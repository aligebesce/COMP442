Aha.

"He said he doesn't catch   cos I'll be  I've, I'll have those right here for your so you're only paying twenty pounds  bloody football bets aren't they!"
He started to laugh.
Well she'll see or not.

Er er  I think he said that as well.
Ha!
"One way of getting out of school, I don't know !"
He did.
He di he did.
Said that as well?
And  and  none of his parents came to collect him.
He just walked by himself.
Were you only collected?
Could you only come out if your parents collected you?
"No, I didn't think they were bothered to tell you truth."
So how did you manage to get out early?
Well it was  well  Dawn's mum came into school she said we were
I want one!
Oh!
But er  nobody rang me.

He's
Oh  I asked him
You've asked ?
I asked him whether he was and
Yeah.
"he said  that he wa he didn't know, he was either coming now or was going to Tramps ."
Yeah.
"Cos someone said last night they were going to Tramps but whether that was just like, they might be going to Tramps or what."
"This bra's too small, I'll have to get a new one!"
But
I think he'll probably go to Tramps to be quite honest.
I think
Mm.
"prob , I think Susan might be going actually."
Mm.
"And if it's a toss up between me and Susan it's,yeah Susan !"
Yeah.
You know?
But I I

No.

Oh and you didn't see that did you?in the paper .

eyes.
Christmas presents.
"Er one thing, what's the name of this record you want?"
Enya.
"It's in the, it's in  I think it's number nine in the hit parade"
What's it called?
What's Enya's record called now Paul?
Eh?
Enya's record?
Shepherd's .
It's number nine wasn't it?
What?
"Nine, wasn't it?"
Number nine.
I don't remember
What's the cover look like?
It was number three when I
It's silvery.
Greyish.
It's not silvery it's blue.
Is it?
It was green last time you I asked you.
Enya anyway.
Are you celebrating your birthday tomorrow?
"Well Paul was asking this, when  well  I'll have some presents."
"Whoever comes, brings me in we'll open those."
Do you want yours opened ?
I'll open one in the morning I think.
"Up to you, what do you think?"
I don't mind .
Christopher shook his head .
"`` No , I understand they 're not on very good terms ."
Sara do n't like Charles Stuart or his wife -- and I do n't blame her .
"She wo n't stay there , not likely ."
Probably she 'll go and live in town .
Strange she never married .
"She was reckoned handsome , and had plenty of beaus at one time . ''"
Jeffrey swung out of the group and started homeward with his dog .
To stand by and hear Sara Stuart discussed after this fashion was more than he could endure .
"The men idly watched his tall , erect figure as he went along the valley ."
"`` Queer chap , Jeff , '' said Alec Churchill reflectively ."
"`` Jeff 's all right , '' said Christopher in a patronizing way ."
`` There ai n't a better man or neighbour alive .
"I 've lived next farm to him for thirty years , so I ought to know ."
But he 's queer sartainly -- not like other people -- kind of unsociable .
He do n't care for a thing ` cept dogs and reading and mooning round woods and fields .
"That ai n't natural , you know ."
But I must say he 's a good farmer .
"He 's got the best farm in Bayside , and that 's a real nice house he put up on it ."
Ai n't it an odd thing he never married ?
Never seemed to have no notion of it .
I ca n't recollect of Jeff Miller 's ever courting anybody .
That 's another unnatural thing about him . ''
"`` I 've always thought that Jeff thought himself a cut or two above the rest of us , '' said Tom Scovel with a sneer ."
`` Maybe he thinks the Bayside girls ai n't good enough for him . ''
"`` There ai n't no such dirty pride about Jeff , '' pronounced Christopher conclusively ."
"`` And the Millers are the best family hereabouts , leaving the kunnel 's out ."
"And Jeff 's well off -- nobody knows how well , I reckon , but I can guess , being his land neighbour ."
"Jeff ai n't no fool nor loafer , if he is a bit queer . ''"
"Meanwhile , the object of these remarks was striding homeward and thinking , not of the men behind him , but of Sara Stuart ."
He must go to her at once .
"He had not intruded on her since her father 's death , thinking her sorrow too great for him to meddle with ."
I ca n't begin to tell you how unhappy I am .
"Truly , my heart is breaking . ''"
Rilla sat down on the lounge beside her .
"Sir Wilfrid squatted on his haunches before them , with his impertinent pink tongue stuck out , and listened ."
"`` What is the trouble , Miranda ? ''"
`` Joe is coming home tonight on his last leave .
"I had a letter from him on Saturday -- he sends my letters in care of Bob Crawford , you know , because of father -- and , oh , Rilla , he will only have four days -- he has to go away Friday morning -- and I may never see him again . ''"
`` Does he still want you to marry him ? ''
asked Rilla .
"`` Oh , yes ."
He implored me in his letter to run away and be married .
"But I can not do that , Rilla , not even for Joe ."
My only comfort is that I will be able to see him for a little while tomorrow afternoon .
Father has to go to Charlottetown on business .
At least we will have one good farewell talk .
"But oh -- afterwards -- why , Rilla , I know father wo n't even let me go to the station Friday morning to see Joe off . ''"
`` Why in the world do n't you and Joe get married tomorrow afternoon at home ? ''
demanded Rilla .
Miranda swallowed a sob in such amazement that she almost choked .
"`` Why -- why -- that is impossible , Rilla . ''"
`` Why ? ''
briefly demanded the organizer of the Junior Red Cross and the transporter of babies in soup tureens .
"`` Why -- why -- we never thought of such a thing -- Joe has n't a license -- I have no dress -- I could n't be married in black -- I -- I -- we -- you -- you -- '' Miranda lost herself altogether and Sir Wilfrid , seeing that she was in dire distress threw back his head and emitted a melancholy yelp ."
Rilla Blythe thought hard and rapidly for a few minutes .
"Then she said , `` Miranda , if you will put yourself into my hands I 'll have you married to Joe before four o'clock tomorrow afternoon . ''"
"`` Oh , you could n't . ''"
`` I can and I will .
But you 'll have to do exactly as I tell you . ''
"`` Oh -- I -- do n't think -- oh , father will kill me -- '' `` Nonsense ."
He 'll be very angry I suppose .
But are you more afraid of your father 's anger than you are of Joe 's never coming back to you ? ''
"`` No , '' said Miranda , with sudden firmness , `` I 'm not . ''"
"The boy started , stopped and looked out towards Island Rock ."
The next moment he hailed me .
"It was Ernest 's voice , and it was Laddie who was barking beside him ."
"`` Ernest , '' I shouted wildly , `` run for help -- quick !"
quick !
The tide will be over the rock in half an hour !
"Hurry , or you will be too late ! ''"
"Instead of starting off at full speed , as I expected him to do , Ernest stood still for a moment , and then began to pick his steps down a narrow path over the cliff , followed by Laddie ."
"`` Ernest , '' I shouted frantically , `` what are you doing ?"
Why do n't you go for help ? ''
Ernest had by this time reached a narrow ledge of rock just above the water-line .
I noticed that he was carrying something over his arm .
"`` It would take too long , '' he shouted ."
"`` By the time I got to the Cove and a boat could row back here , you 'd be drowned ."
Laddie and I will save you .
Is there anything there you can tie a rope to ?
I 've a coil of rope here that I think will be long enough to reach you .
I 've been down to the Cove and Alec Martin sent it up to your uncle . ''
"I looked about me ; a smooth , round hole had been worn clean through a thin part of the apex of the rock ."
`` I could fasten the rope if I had it ! ''
I called .
`` But how can you get it to me ? ''
For answer Ernest tied a bit of driftwood to the rope and put it into Laddie 's mouth .
The next minute the dog was swimming out to me .
As soon as he came close I caught the rope .
"It was just long enough to stretch from shore to rock , allowing for a couple of hitches which Ernest gave around a small boulder on the ledge ."
"I tied my camera case on my head by means of some string I found in my pocket , then I slipped into the water and , holding to the rope , went hand over hand to the shore with Laddie swimming beside me ."
"Ernest held on to the shoreward end of the rope like grim death , a task that was no light one for his small arms ."
"When I finally scrambled up beside him , his face was dripping with perspiration and he trembled like a leaf ."
"`` Ern , you are a brick ! ''"
I exclaimed .
`` You 've saved my life ! ''
I am the daughter of a criminal and I am no fit wife for Alan Douglas .
"No , Alan , do n't plead , please ."
I wo n't think differently -- I never can . ''
There was a ring of finality in her tone that struck dismay to Alan 's heart .
"He prepared to entreat and argue , but before he could utter a word , the boughs behind them parted and Captain Anthony stepped down from the bank ."
"`` I 've been listening , '' he announced coolly , `` and I think it high time I took a share in the conversation ."
"You seem to have run up against a snag , Mr. Douglas ."
You say Frank Harmon is dead .
That 's good riddance if it 's true .
Is it true ? ''
`` His brother declares it is . ''
"`` Well , then , I 'll help you all I can ."
"I like you , Mr. Douglas , and I happen to be fond of Lynde , too -- though you may n't believe it ."
I 'm fond of her for her mother 's sake and I 'd like to see her happy .
I did n't want to give her to Harmon that time three years ago but I could n't help myself .
"He had the upper hand , curse him ."
"It was n't for my own sake , though -- it was for my wife 's ."
"However , that 's all over and done with and I 'll do the best I can to atone for it ."
"So you wo n't marry your minister because your father was not a good man , Lynde ?"
"Well , I do n't suppose he was a very good man -- a man who makes his wife 's life a hell , even in a refined way , is n't exactly a saint , to my way of thinking ."
"But that 's the worst that could be said of him and it does n't entail any indelible disgrace on his family , I suppose ."
"I am not your father , Lynde . ''"
`` Not my father ? ''
Lynde echoed the words blankly .
`` No .
Your father was your mother 's first husband .
She never told you of him .
"When I said he made her life a hell , I said the truth , no more , no less ."
"I had loved your mother ever since I was a boy , Lynde ."
But she was far above me in station and I never dreamed it was possible to win her love .
She married James Ashley .
"He was a gentleman , so called -- and he did n't kick or beat her ."
"Do n't you tell me I 'm like that old gossip , '' said Mr. Harrison irritably ."
`` I 'm not ... not a bit .
What have you got in that box ? ''
"`` A cake , '' said Anne archly ."
In her relief at Mr. Harrison 's unexpected amiability her spirits soared upward feather-light .
`` I brought it over for you ... I thought perhaps you did n't have cake very often . ''
"`` I do n't , that 's a fact , and I 'm mighty fond of it , too ."
I 'm much obliged to you .
It looks good on top .
I hope it 's good all the way through . ''
"`` It is , '' said Anne , gaily confident ."
"`` I have made cakes in my time that were NOT , as Mrs. Allan could tell you , but this one is all right ."
"I made it for the Improvement Society , but I can make another for them . ''"
"`` Well , I 'll tell you what , miss , you must help me eat it ."
I 'll put the kettle on and we 'll have a cup of tea .
How will that do ? ''
`` Will you let me make the tea ? ''
said Anne dubiously .
Mr. Harrison chuckled .
`` I see you have n't much confidence in my ability to make tea .
You 're wrong ... I can brew up as good a jorum of tea as you ever drank .
But go ahead yourself .
"Fortunately it rained last Sunday , so there 's plenty of clean dishes . ''"
Anne hopped briskly up and went to work .
She washed the teapot in several waters before she put the tea to steep .
"Then she swept the stove and set the table , bringing the dishes out of the pantry ."
"The state of that pantry horrified Anne , but she wisely said nothing ."
Mr. Harrison told her where to find the bread and butter and a can of peaches .
Anne adorned the table with a bouquet from the garden and shut her eyes to the stains on the tablecloth .
"Soon the tea was ready and Anne found herself sitting opposite Mr. Harrison at his own table , pouring his tea for him , and chatting freely to him about her school and friends and plans ."
She could hardly believe the evidence of her senses .
"Mr. Harrison had brought Ginger back , averring that the poor bird would be lonesome ; and Anne , feeling that she could forgive everybody and everything , offered him a walnut ."
"`` Ai n't you gone yet , Bert ? ''"
she said sharply .
`` What in the world are you hanging round for ? ''
"`` It 's early yet , '' said Bertie cheerfully ."
`` I thought maybe George Fraser 'd be along and I 'd get a lift as far as the store . ''
"`` Well , I never saw such laziness !"
No wonder old Sampson wo n't keep you longer than the holidays if you 're no smarter than that .
"Goodness , if I do n't settle that boy ! ''"
-- as the sound of fretful crying came from the kitchen behind her .
`` What is wrong with William John ? ''
asked Bertie .
"`` Why , he wants to go out coasting with those Robinson boys , but he ca n't ."
He has n't got any mittens and he would catch his death of cold again . ''
Her voice seemed to imply that William John had died of cold several times already .
"Bertie looked soberly down at his old , well-darned mittens ."
"It was very cold , and he would have a great many errands to run ."
"He shivered , and looked up at his aunt 's hard face as she stood wiping her dish-pan with a grim frown which boded no good to the discontented William John ."
Then he suddenly pulled off his mittens and held them out .
`` Here -- he can have mine .
I 'll get on without them well enough . ''
`` Nonsense ! ''
"said Mrs. Ross , but less unkindly ."
`` The fingers would freeze off you .
Do n't be a goose . ''
"`` It 's all right , '' persisted Bertie ."
`` I do n't need them -- much .
And William John does n't hardly ever get out . ''
"He thrust them into her hand and ran quickly down the street , as though he feared that the keen air might make him change his mind in spite of himself ."
He had to stop a great many times that day to breathe on his purple hands .
"Still , he did not regret having lent his mittens to William John -- poor , pale , sickly little William John , who had so few pleasures ."
It was sunset when Bertie laid an armful of parcels down on the steps of Doctor Forbes 's handsome house .
"His back was turned towards the big bay window at one side , and he was busy trying to warm his hands , so he did not see the two small faces looking at him through the frosty panes ."
A sweet pretty place you have of it here .
"Ah , there 's Jim !"
"The top of the morning to you , Jim ."
"Doctor , here 's my service ."
"Why , there you all are together like a happy family , in a manner of speaking . ''"
"`` If you have anything to say , my man , better say it , '' said the captain ."
"`` Right you were , Cap'n Smollett , '' replied Silver ."
"`` Dooty is dooty , to be sure ."
"Well now , you look here , that was a good lay of yours last night ."
I do n't deny it was a good lay .
Some of you pretty handy with a handspike-end .
And I 'll not deny neither but what some of my people was shook -- maybe all was shook ; maybe I was shook myself ; maybe that 's why I 'm here for terms .
"But you mark me , cap'n , it wo n't do twice , by thunder !"
We 'll have to do sentry-go and ease off a point or so on the rum .
Maybe you think we were all a sheet in the wind 's eye .
"But I 'll tell you I was sober ; I was on ' y dog tired ; and if I 'd awoke a second sooner , I 'd ' a caught you at the act , I would ."
"He was n't dead when I got round to him , not he . ''"
`` Well ? ''
says Captain Smollett as cool as can be .
"All that Silver said was a riddle to him , but you would never have guessed it from his tone ."
"As for me , I began to have an inkling ."
Ben Gunn 's last words came back to my mind .
"I began to suppose that he had paid the buccaneers a visit while they all lay drunk together round their fire , and I reckoned up with glee that we had only fourteen enemies to deal with ."
"`` Well , here it is , '' said Silver ."
"`` We want that treasure , and we 'll have it -- that 's our point !"
"You would just as soon save your lives , I reckon ; and that 's yours ."
"You have a chart , have n't you ? ''"
"`` That 's as may be , '' replied the captain ."
"`` Oh , well , you have , I know that , '' returned Long John ."
"`` You need n't be so husky with a man ; there ai n't a particle of service in that , and you may lay to it ."
"What I mean is , we want your chart ."
"Now , I never meant you no harm , myself . ''"
"An I had known , I should have seen the varlet hanged ere I had told him ."
"Well , if he goes through the fen , I may come up with him and pull his ears . ''"
"Half an hour later , Sir Daniel gave Dick the letter , and bade him speed to the Moat House ."
"And , again , some half an hour after Dick 's departure , a messenger came , in hot haste , from my Lord of Risingham ."
"`` Sir Daniel , '' the messenger said , `` ye lose great honour , by my sooth !"
"The fight began again this morning ere the dawn , and we have beaten their van and scattered their right wing ."
Only the main battle standeth fast .
"An we had your fresh men , we should tilt you them all into the river ."
"What , sir knight !"
Will ye be the last ?
It stands not with your good credit . ''
"`` Nay , '' cried the knight , `` I was but now upon the march ."
"Selden , sound me the tucket ."
"Sir , I am with you on the instant ."
"It is not two hours since the more part of my command came in , sir messenger ."
What would ye have ?
"Spurring is good meat , but yet it killed the charger ."
"Bustle , boys ! ''"
"By this time the tucket was sounding cheerily in the morning , and from all sides Sir Daniel 's men poured into the main street and formed before the inn ."
"They had slept upon their arms , with chargers saddled , and in ten minutes five-score men-at-arms and archers , cleanly equipped and briskly disciplined , stood ranked and ready ."
"The chief part were in Sir Daniel 's livery , murrey and blue , which gave the greater show to their array ."
"The best armed rode first ; and away out of sight , at the tail of the column , came the sorry reinforcement of the night before ."
Sir Daniel looked with pride along the line .
"`` Here be the lads to serve you in a pinch , '' he said ."
"`` They are pretty men , indeed , '' replied the messenger ."
`` It but augments my sorrow that ye had not marched the earlier . ''
"`` Well , '' said the knight , `` what would ye ?"
"The beginning of a feast and the end of a fray , sir messenger ; '' and he mounted into his saddle ."
`` Why !
how now ! ''
he cried .
`` John !
`` Sure thing .
I 'm here for a look-in .
Can I come up to Ingleside tonight and see you ? ''
`` Of courthe . ''
Had he used `` you '' in the singular or plural sense ?
"Presently she would wring Jims ' neck -- oh , what was Ken saying ?"
"`` See here , Rilla , can you arrange that there wo n't be more than a few dozen people round ?"
Understand ?
I ca n't make my meaning clearer over this bally rural line .
There are a dozen receivers down . ''
Did she understand !
"Yes , she understood ."
"`` I 'll try , '' she said ."
`` I 'll be up about eight then .
By-by . ''
Rilla hung up the ` phone and flew to Jims .
But she did not wring that injured infant 's neck .
"Instead she snatched him bodily out of his chair , crushed him against her face , kissed him rapturously on his milky mouth , and danced wildly around the room with him in her arms ."
"After this Jims was relieved to find that she returned to sanity , gave him the rest of his dinner properly , and tucked him away for his afternoon nap with the little lullaby he loved best of all ."
"She sewed at Red Cross shirts for the rest of the afternoon and built a crystal castle of dreams , all a-quiver with rainbows ."
Ken wanted to see her -- to see her alone .
That could be easily managed .
"Shirley would n't bother them , father and mother were going to the Manse , Miss Oliver never played gooseberry , and Jims always slept the clock round from seven to seven ."
"She would entertain Ken on the veranda -- it would be moonlight -- she would wear her white georgette dress and do her hair up -- yes , she would -- at least in a low knot at the nape of her neck ."
"Mother could n't object to that , surely ."
"Oh , how wonderful and romantic it would be !"
Would Ken say anything -- he must mean to say something or why should he be so particular about seeing her alone ?
What if it rained -- Susan had been complaining about Mr. Hyde that morning !
What if some officious Junior Red called to discuss Belgians and shirts ?
"Or , worst of all , what if Fred Arnold dropped in ?"
He did occasionally .
The evening came at last and was all that could be desired in an evening .
Rich !
I says .
"And I 'll tell you what : I 'll make a man of you , Jim ."
"Ah , Jim , you 'll bless your stars , you will , you was the first that found me ! ''"
"And at this there came suddenly a lowering shadow over his face , and he tightened his grasp upon my hand and raised a forefinger threateningly before my eyes ."
"`` Now , Jim , you tell me true : that ai n't Flint 's ship ? ''"
he asked .
At this I had a happy inspiration .
"I began to believe that I had found an ally , and I answered him at once ."
"`` It 's not Flint 's ship , and Flint is dead ; but I 'll tell you true , as you ask me -- there are some of Flint 's hands aboard ; worse luck for the rest of us . ''"
`` Not a man -- with one -- leg ? ''
he gasped .
`` Silver ? ''
I asked .
"`` Ah , Silver ! ''"
says he .
`` That were his name . ''
"`` He 's the cook , and the ringleader too . ''"
"He was still holding me by the wrist , and at that he give it quite a wring ."
"`` If you was sent by Long John , '' he said , `` I 'm as good as pork , and I know it ."
"But where was you , do you suppose ? ''"
"I had made my mind up in a moment , and by way of answer told him the whole story of our voyage and the predicament in which we found ourselves ."
"He heard me with the keenest interest , and when I had done he patted me on the head ."
"`` You 're a good lad , Jim , '' he said ; `` and you 're all in a clove hitch , ai n't you ?"
"Well , you just put your trust in Ben Gunn -- Ben Gunn 's the man to do it ."
"Would you think it likely , now , that your squire would prove a liberal-minded one in case of help -- him being in a clove hitch , as you remark ? ''"
I told him the squire was the most liberal of men .
"`` Aye , but you see , '' returned Ben Gunn , `` I did n't mean giving me a gate to keep , and a suit of livery clothes , and such ; that 's not my mark , Jim ."
"What I mean is , would he be likely to come down to the toon of , say one thousand pounds out of money that 's as good as a man 's own already ? ''"
"`` I am sure he would , '' said I. `` As it was , all hands were to share . ''"
`` AND a passage home ? ''
he added with a look of great shrewdness .
"`` You both have the advantage of me , '' sighed Anne ."
"`` You 're going to teach children who do n't know you , but I have to teach my own old schoolmates , and Mrs. Lynde says she 's afraid they wo n't respect me as they would a stranger unless I 'm very cross from the first ."
But I do n't believe a teacher should be cross .
"Oh , it seems to me such a responsibility ! ''"
"`` I guess we 'll get on all right , '' said Jane comfortably ."
Jane was not troubled by any aspirations to be an influence for good .
"She meant to earn her salary fairly , please the trustees , and get her name on the School Inspector 's roll of honor ."
Further ambitions Jane had none .
`` The main thing will be to keep order and a teacher has to be a little cross to do that .
If my pupils wo n't do as I tell them I shall punish them . ''
`` How ? ''
"`` Give them a good whipping , of course . ''"
"`` Oh , Jane , you would n't , '' cried Anne , shocked ."
"`` Jane , you COULD N'T ! ''"
"`` Indeed , I could and would , if they deserved it , '' said Jane decidedly ."
"`` I could NEVER whip a child , '' said Anne with equal decision ."
`` I do n't believe in it AT ALL .
Miss Stacy never whipped any of us and she had perfect order ; and Mr. Phillips was always whipping and he had no order at all .
"No , if I ca n't get along without whipping I shall not try to teach school ."
There are better ways of managing .
I shall try to win my pupils ' affections and then they will WANT to do what I tell them . ''
`` But suppose they do n't ? ''
said practical Jane .
`` I would n't whip them anyhow .
I 'm sure it would n't do any good .
"Oh , do n't whip your pupils , Jane dear , no matter what they do . ''"
"`` What do you think about it , Gilbert ? ''"
demanded Jane .
`` Do n't you think there are some children who really need a whipping now and then ? ''
"`` Do n't you think it 's a cruel , barbarous thing to whip a child ... ANY child ? ''"
"exclaimed Anne , her face flushing with earnestness ."
"`` Well , '' said Gilbert slowly , torn between his real convictions and his wish to measure up to Anne 's ideal , `` there 's something to be said on both sides ."
"Each wore a sword , and by a movement of his haunch , thrust clear the hilt of it , so that it might be the more readily grasped and the blade drawn ."
"`` Mr. Stewart , I am thinking , '' says Robin ."
"`` Troth , Mr. Macgregor , it 's not a name to be ashamed of , '' answered Alan ."
"`` I did not know ye were in my country , sir , '' says Robin ."
"`` It sticks in my mind that I am in the country of my friends the Maclarens , '' says Alan ."
"`` That 's a kittle point , '' returned the other ."
`` There may be two words to say to that .
But I think I will have heard that you are a man of your sword ? ''
"`` Unless ye were born deaf , Mr. Macgregor , ye will have heard a good deal more than that , '' says Alan ."
"`` I am not the only man that can draw steel in Appin ; and when my kinsman and captain , Ardshiel , had a talk with a gentleman of your name , not so many years back , I could never hear that the Macgregor had the best of it . ''"
"`` Do ye mean my father , sir ? ''"
says Robin .
"`` Well , I wouldnae wonder , '' said Alan ."
`` The gentleman I have in my mind had the ill-taste to clap Campbell to his name . ''
"`` My father was an old man , '' returned Robin ."
`` The match was unequal .
"You and me would make a better pair , sir . ''"
"`` I was thinking that , '' said Alan ."
"I was half out of bed , and Duncan had been hanging at the elbow of these fighting cocks , ready to intervene upon the least occasion ."
"But when that word was uttered , it was a case of now or never ; and Duncan , with something of a white face to be sure , thrust himself between ."
"`` Gentlemen , '' said he , `` I will have been thinking of a very different matter , whateffer ."
"Here are my pipes , and here are you two gentlemen who are baith acclaimed pipers ."
It 's an auld dispute which one of ye 's the best .
Here will be a braw chance to settle it . ''
"`` Why , sir , '' said Alan , still addressing Robin , from whom indeed he had not so much as shifted his eyes , nor yet Robin from him , `` why , sir , '' says Alan , `` I think I will have heard some sough * of the sort ."
"Have ye music , as folk say ?"
Are ye a bit of a piper ? ''
* Rumour .
`` I can pipe like a Macrimmon ! ''
cries Robin .
"`` And that is a very bold word , '' quoth Alan ."
"`` I have made bolder words good before now , '' returned Robin , `` and that against better adversaries . ''"
cried Dick .
`` Would ye mind a ducking ?
Blood of wound or dust of travel -- that 's a man 's adornment . ''
"`` Nay , then , I like him better plain , '' observed the lad ."
"`` But , prithee , how shall I do ?"
"Prithee , good Master Richard , help me with your good counsel ."
"If I come not safe to Holywood , I am undone . ''"
"`` Nay , '' said Dick , dismounting , `` I will give more than counsel ."
"Take my horse , and I will run awhile , and when I am weary we shall change again , that so , riding and running , both may go the speedier . ''"
"So the change was made , and they went forward as briskly as they durst on the uneven causeway , Dick with his hand upon the other 's knee ."
`` How call ye your name ? ''
asked Dick .
"`` Call me John Matcham , '' replied the lad ."
`` And what make ye to Holywood ? ''
Dick continued .
"`` I seek sanctuary from a man that would oppress me , '' was the answer ."
`` The good Abbot of Holywood is a strong pillar to the weak . ''
"`` And how came ye with Sir Daniel , Master Matcham ? ''"
pursued Dick .
"`` Nay , '' cried the other , `` by the abuse of force !"
"He hath taken me by violence from my own place ; dressed me in these weeds ; ridden with me till my heart was sick ; gibed me till I could ` a ' wept ; and when certain of my friends pursued , thinking to have me back , claps me in the rear to stand their shot !"
"I was even grazed in the right foot , and walk but lamely ."
"Nay , there shall come a day between us ; he shall smart for all ! ''"
`` Would ye shoot at the moon with a hand-gun ? ''
said Dick . ''
"'T is a valiant knight , and hath a hand of iron ."
"An he guessed I had made or meddled with your flight , it would go sore with me . ''"
"`` Ay , poor boy , '' returned the other , `` y ' are his ward , I know it ."
"By the same token , so am I , or so he saith ; or else he hath bought my marriage -- I wot not rightly which ; but it is some handle to oppress me by . ''"
`` Boy again ! ''
said Dick .
"`` Nay , then , shall I call you girl , good Richard ? ''"
"And she said I was always to be kind to Dora and stand up for her , and I 'm going to . ''"
`` Do you call pulling her hair being kind to her ? ''
"`` Well , I ai n't going to let anybody else pull it , '' said Davy , doubling up his fists and frowning ."
`` They 'd just better try it .
I did n't hurt her much ... she just cried 'cause she 's a girl .
I 'm glad I 'm a boy but I 'm sorry I 'm a twin .
"When Jimmy Sprott 's sister conterdicks him he just says , ` I 'm oldern you , so of course I know better , ' and that settles HER ."
"But I ca n't tell Dora that , and she just goes on thinking diffrunt from me ."
"You might let me drive the gee-gee for a spell , since I 'm a man . ''"
"Altogether , Marilla was a thankful woman when she drove into her own yard , where the wind of the autumn night was dancing with the brown leaves ."
Anne was at the gate to meet them and lift the twins out .
"Dora submitted calmly to be kissed , but Davy responded to Anne 's welcome with one of his hearty hugs and the cheerful announcement , `` I 'm Mr. Davy Keith . ''"
"At the supper table Dora behaved like a little lady , but Davy 's manners left much to be desired ."
"`` I 'm so hungry I ai n't got time to eat p ` litely , '' he said when Marilla reproved him ."
`` Dora ai n't half as hungry as I am .
Look at all the ex ` cise I took on the road here .
That cake 's awful nice and plummy .
"We have n't had any cake at home for ever 'n ever so long , 'cause mother was too sick to make it and Mrs. Sprott said it was as much as she could do to bake our bread for us ."
And Mrs. Wiggins never puts any plums in HER cakes .
Catch her !
Can I have another piece ? ''
Marilla would have refused but Anne cut a generous second slice .
"However , she reminded Davy that he ought to say `` Thank you '' for it ."
Davy merely grinned at her and took a huge bite .
"When he had finished the slice he said , `` If you 'll give me ANOTHER piece I 'll say thank you for IT . ''"
"`` No , you have had plenty of cake , '' said Marilla in a tone which Anne knew and Davy was to learn to be final ."
"Davy winked at Anne , and then , leaning over the table , snatched Dora 's first piece of cake , from which she had just taken one dainty little bite , out of her very fingers and , opening his mouth to the fullest extent , crammed the whole slice in ."
Dora 's lip trembled and Marilla was speechless with horror .
"Anne promptly exclaimed , with her best `` schoolma'am '' air , `` Oh , Davy , gentlemen do n't do things like that . ''"
"`` I know they do n't , '' said Davy , as soon as he could speak , `` but I ai n't a gemplum . ''"
`` But do n't you want to be ? ''
said shocked Anne .
"Wo n't you be frank with me , dear ?"
Do you honestly think you can never learn to love me ? ''
"`` It is not that , '' said Lynde in a hard , unnatural voice ."
`` I am married already . ''
"Alan stared at her , not in the least comprehending the meaning of her words ."
"Everything -- pain , hope , fear , passion -- had slipped away from him for a moment , as if he had been stunned by a physical blow ."
He could not have heard aright .
`` Married ? ''
he said dully .
"`` Lynde , you can not mean it ? ''"
"`` Yes , I do ."
I was married three years ago . ''
`` Why was I not told this ? ''
"Alan 's voice was stern , although he did not mean it to be so , and she shrank and shivered ."
Then she began in a low monotonous tone from which all feeling of any sort seemed to have utterly faded .
"`` Three years ago Mother was very ill -- so ill that any shock would kill her , so the doctor Father brought from the lake told us ."
A man -- a young sea captain -- came here to see Father .
His name was Frank Harmon and he had known Father well in the past .
They had sailed together .
Father seemed to be afraid of him -- I had never seen him afraid of anybody before .
"I could not think much about anybody except Mother then , but I knew I did not quite like Captain Harmon , although he was very polite to me and I suppose might have been called handsome ."
One day Father came to me and told me I must marry Captain Harmon .
I laughed at the idea at first but when I looked at Father 's face I did not laugh .
It was all white and drawn .
He implored me to marry Captain Harmon .
He said if I did not it would mean shame and disgrace for us all -- that Captain Harmon had some hold on him and would tell what he knew if I did not marry him .
I do n't know what it was but it must have been something dreadful .
And he said it would kill Mother .
"I knew it would , and that was what drove me to consent at last ."
"Oh , I ca n't tell you what I suffered ."
I was only seventeen and there was nobody to advise me .
One day Father and Captain Harmon and I went down the lake to Crosse Harbour and we were married there .
"` Then , ' said Peter , not without grimness , ` step in , if you feel so sure of her , ' and he helped Maimie into the Thrush 's Nest ."
` But why do n't you look at me ? '
"she asked , taking him by the arm ."
"Peter tried hard not to look , he tried to push off , then he gave a great gulp and jumped ashore and sat down miserably in the snow ."
She went to him .
"` What is it , dear , dear Peter ? '"
"she said , wondering . '"
"O Maimie , ' he cried , ` it is n't fair to take you with me if you think you can go back !"
Your mother ' -- he gulped again -- ` you do n't know them as well as I do . '
"And then he told her the woeful story of how he had been barred out , and she gasped all the time ."
"` But my mother , ' she said , ' my mother -- ' ` Yes , she would , ' said Peter , ` they are all the same ."
I dare say she is looking for another one already . '
"Maimie said aghast , ' I ca n't believe it ."
"You see , when you went away your mother had none , but my mother has Tony , and surely they are satisfied when they have one . '"
"Peter replied bitterly , ` You should see the letters Solomon gets from ladies who have six . '"
"Just then they heard a grating creak , followed by creak , creak , all round the Gardens ."
"It was the Opening of the Gates , and Peter jumped nervously into his boat ."
"He knew Maimie would not come with him now , and he was trying bravely not to cry ."
But Maimie was sobbing painfully .
"` If I should be too late , ' she said in agony , ' O Peter , if she has got another one already ! '"
Again he sprang ashore as if she had called him back . '
"I shall come and look for you to-night , ' he said , squeezing close , ` but if you hurry away I think you will be in time . '"
"Then he pressed a last thimble on her sweet little mouth , and covered his face with his hands so that he might not see her go ."
` Dear Peter ! '
she cried .
` Dear Maimie ! '
cried the tragic boy .
"She leapt into his arms , so that it was a sort of fairy wedding , and then she hurried away ."
"Oh , how she hastened to the gates !"
"Peter , you may be sure , was back in the Gardens that night as soon as Lock-out sounded , but he found no Maimie , and so he knew she had been in time ."
"For long he hoped that some night she would come back to him ; often he thought he saw her waiting for him by the shore of the Serpentine as his bark drew to land , but Maimie never went back ."
"She wanted to , but she was afraid that if she saw her dear Betwixt-and-Between again she would linger with him too long , and besides the ayah now kept a sharp eye on her ."
Do n't you think it 's about time I joined up ? ''
The pale mother looked at him .
`` Two of my sons have gone and one will never return .
"Must I give you too , Shirley ? ''"
The age-old cry -- `` Joseph is not and Simeon is not ; and ye will take Benjamin away . ''
How the mothers of the Great War echoed the old Patriarch 's moan of so many centuries agone !
"`` You would n't have me a slacker , mother ?"
I can get into the flying-corps .
"What say , dad ? ''"
The doctor 's hands were not quite steady as he folded up the powders he was concocting for Abbie Flagg 's rheumatism .
"He had known this moment was coming , yet he was not altogether prepared for it ."
"He answered slowly , `` I wo n't try to hold you back from what you believe to be your duty ."
But you must not go unless your mother says you may . ''
Shirley said nothing more .
He was not a lad of many words .
"Anne did not say anything more just then , either ."
"She was thinking of little Joyce 's grave in the old burying-ground over-harbour -- little Joyce who would have been a woman now , had she lived -- of the white cross in France and the splendid grey eyes of the little boy who had been taught his first lessons of duty and loyalty at her knee -- of Jem in the terrible trenches -- of Nan and Di and Rilla , waiting -- waiting -- waiting , while the golden years of youth passed by -- and she wondered if she could bear any more ."
She thought not ; surely she had given enough .
Yet that night she told Shirley that he might go .
They did not tell Susan right away .
"She did not know it until , a few days later , Shirley presented himself in her kitchen in his aviation uniform ."
Susan did n't make half the fuss she had made when Jem and Walter had gone .
"She said stonily , `` So they 're going to take you , too . ''"
`` Take me ?
No .
"I 'm going , Susan -- got to . ''"
"Susan sat down by the table , folded her knotted old hands , that had grown warped and twisted working for the Ingleside children to still their shaking , and said : `` Yes , you must go ."
"I did not see once why such things must be , but I can see now . ''"
"`` You 're a brick , Susan , '' said Shirley ."
"He was relieved that she took it so coolly -- he had been a little afraid , with a boy 's horror of `` a scene . ''"
"He went out whistling gaily ; but half an hour later , when pale Anne Blythe came in , Susan was still sitting there ."
"`` Mrs. Dr. dear , '' said Susan , making an admission she would once have died rather than make , `` I feel very old ."
"I thought Miss Bat did the sewing , '' said Mr. Bemis , as he smiled at the funny little garment , it looked so like Boo himself ."
"`` No , sir ; only yours ."
I do mine and Boo 's .
"At least , I 'm learning how , and Mrs. Pecq says I get on nicely , '' answered Molly , threading her needle and making a knot in her most capable way ."
"`` I suppose it is time you did learn , for you are getting to be a great girl , and all women should know how to make and mend ."
"You must take a stitch for me now and then : Miss Bat 's eyes are not what they were , I find ; '' and Mr. Bemis looked at his frayed wristband , as if he particularly felt the need of a stitch just then ."
"`` I 'd love to , and I guess I could ."
"I can mend gloves ; Merry taught me , so I 'd better begin on them , if you have any , '' said Molly , much pleased at being able to do anything for her father , and still more so at being asked ."
"`` There 's something to start with ; '' and he threw her a pair , with nearly every finger ripped ."
"Molly shook her head over them , but got out her gray silk and fell to work , glad to show how well she could sew ."
`` What are you smiling about ? ''
"asked her father , after a little pause , for his head felt better , and it amused him to question Molly ."
`` I was thinking about my summer clothes .
"I must get them before long , and I 'd like to go with Mrs. Grant and learn how to shop , if you are willing . ''"
`` I thought Miss Bat did that for you . ''
"`` She always has , but she gets ugly , cheap things that I do n't like ."
"I think I am old enough to choose myself , if there is someone to tell me about prices and the goodness of the stuff ."
Merry does ; and she is only a few months older than I am . ''
"`` How old are you , child ? ''"
"asked her father , feeling as if he had lost his reckoning ."
`` Fifteen in August ; '' and Molly looked very proud of the fact .
`` So you are !
"Bless my heart , how the time goes !"
"Well , get what you please ; if I 'm to have a young lady here , I 'd like to have her prettily dressed ."
"It wo n't offend Miss Bat , will it ? ''"
"Molly 's eyes sparkled , but she gave a little shrug as she answered , `` She wo n't care ."
She never troubles herself about me if I let her alone .
`` Hey ?
what ?
Not trouble herself ?
"If she does n't , who does ? ''"
and Mr. Bemis sat up as if this discovery was more surprising than the other .
"Rilla made a third attempt to give the long-suffering Jims his dinner , but all she could think of was the question -- Would Ken come to see her before he went away ?"
She had not heard from him for a long while .
Had he forgotten her completely ?
If he did not come she would know that he had .
Perhaps there was even -- some other girl back there in Toronto .
Of course there was .
She was a little fool to be thinking about him at all .
She would not think about him .
"If he came , well and good ."
It would only be courteous of him to make a farewell call at Ingleside where he had often been a guest .
"If he did not come -- well and good , too ."
It did not matter very much .
Nobody was going to fret .
That was all settled comfortably -- she was quite indifferent -- but meanwhile Jims was being fed with a haste and recklessness that would have filled the soul of Morgan with horror .
"Jims himself did n't like it , being a methodical baby , accustomed to swallowing spoonfuls with a decent interval for breath between each ."
"He protested , but his protests availed him nothing ."
"Rilla , as far as the care and feeding of infants was concerned , was utterly demoralized ."
Then the telephone-bell rang .
There was nothing unusual about the telephone ringing .
It rang on an average every ten minutes at Ingleside .
But Rilla dropped Jims ' spoon again -- on the carpet this time -- and flew to the ` phone as if life depended on her getting there before anybody else .
"Jims , his patience exhausted , lifted up his voice and wept ."
"`` Hello , is this Ingleside ? ''"
`` Yes . ''
"`` That you , Rilla ? ''"
`` Yeth -- yeth . ''
"Oh , why could n't Jims stop howling for just one little minute ?"
Why did n't somebody come in and choke him ?
`` Know who 's speaking ? ''
"Oh , did n't she know !"
Would n't she know that voice anywhere -- at any time ?
`` It 's Ken -- is n't it ? ''
"`` You see , I was little for fourteen years and I 've only been grown-uppish for scarcely three ."
I 'm sure I shall always feel like a child in the woods .
These walks home from school are almost the only time I have for dreaming ... except the half-hour or so before I go to sleep .
I 'm so busy with teaching and studying and helping Marilla with the twins that I have n't another moment for imagining things .
You do n't know what splendid adventures I have for a little while after I go to bed in the east gable every night .
I always imagine I 'm something very brilliant and triumphant and splendid ... a great prima donna or a Red Cross nurse or a queen .
Last night I was a queen .
It 's really splendid to imagine you are a queen .
"You have all the fun of it without any of the inconveniences and you can stop being a queen whenever you want to , which you could n't in real life ."
"But here in the woods I like best to imagine quite different things ... I 'm a dryad living in an old pine , or a little brown wood-elf hiding under a crinkled leaf ."
That white birch you caught me kissing is a sister of mine .
"The only difference is , she 's a tree and I 'm a girl , but that 's no real difference ."
"Where are you going , Diana ? ''"
`` Down to the Dicksons .
I promised to help Alberta cut out her new dress .
"Ca n't you walk down in the evening , Anne , and come home with me ? ''"
"`` I might ... since Fred Wright is away in town , '' said Anne with a rather too innocent face ."
"Diana blushed , tossed her head , and walked on ."
"She did not look offended , however ."
"Anne fully intended to go down to the Dicksons ' that evening , but she did not ."
When she arrived at Green Gables she found a state of affairs which banished every other thought from her mind .
Marilla met her in the yard ... a wild-eyed Marilla .
"`` Anne , Dora is lost ! ''"
`` Dora !
Lost ! ''
"Anne looked at Davy , who was swinging on the yard gate , and detected merriment in his eyes ."
"`` Davy , do you know where she is ? ''"
"`` No , I do n't , '' said Davy stoutly ."
"`` I have n't seen her since dinner time , cross my heart . ''"
"`` I 've been away ever since one o'clock , '' said Marilla ."
`` Thomas Lynde took sick all of a sudden and Rachel sent up for me to go at once .
When I left here Dora was playing with her doll in the kitchen and Davy was making mud pies behind the barn .
I hereby punish you by prompt departure from Orchard Knob .
"Yet I do not dislike audacity , at some times , in some places , in some people ."
It is only from a sense of duty that I punish it in this case .
And it was really pleasant in Eden .
"If you do not mail that letter , and if you still persist in your very absurd interpretation of the meaning of Eve 's kiss , we may meet again in town ."
"Until then I remain , `` Very sincerely yours , `` Dora Lynne Mannering . ''"
Murray kissed the grey letter and put it tenderly away in his pocket .
Then he took his letter to his uncle and tore it into tiny fragments .
Finally he looked at his watch .
"`` If I hurry , I can catch the afternoon train to town , '' he said ."
"Aunt Susanna 's Birthday Celebration Good afternoon , Nora May ."
I 'm real glad to see you .
I 've been watching you coming down the hill and I hoping you 'd turn in at our gate .
Going to visit with me this afternoon ?
That 's good .
I 'm feeling so happy and delighted and I 've been hankering for someone to tell it all to .
Tell you about it ?
"Well , I guess I might as well ."
It ai n't any breach of confidence .
You did n't know Anne Douglas ?
"She taught school here three years ago , afore your folks moved over from Talcott ."
She belonged up Montrose way and she was only eighteen when she came here to teach .
She boarded with us and her and me were the greatest chums .
She was just a sweet girl .
"She was the prettiest teacher we ever had , and that 's saying a good deal , for Springdale has always been noted for getting good-looking schoolmarms , just as Miller 's Road is noted for its humly ones ."
"Anne had yards of brown wavy hair and big , dark blue eyes ."
"Her face was kind o ' pale , but when she smiled you would have to smile too , if you 'd been chief mourner at your own funeral ."
"She was a well-spring of joy in the house , and we all loved her ."
Gilbert Martin began to drive her the very first week she was here .
"Gilbert is my sister Julia 's son , and a fine young fellow he is ."
"It ai n't good manners to brag of your own relations , but I 'm always forgetting and doing it ."
Gil was a great pet of mine .
"`` No , sir , '' replied the captain , `` only that he 's too familiar . ''"
"`` Well , now , and the short and long of it , captain ? ''"
asked the doctor .
`` Tell us what you want . ''
"`` Well , gentlemen , are you determined to go on this cruise ? ''"
"`` Like iron , '' answered the squire ."
"`` Very good , '' said the captain ."
"`` Then , as you 've heard me very patiently , saying things that I could not prove , hear me a few words more ."
They are putting the powder and the arms in the fore hold .
"Now , you have a good place under the cabin ; why not put them there ?"
-- first point .
"Then , you are bringing four of your own people with you , and they tell me some of them are to be berthed forward ."
Why not give them the berths here beside the cabin ?
-- second point . ''
`` Any more ? ''
asked Mr. Trelawney .
"`` One more , '' said the captain ."
`` There 's been too much blabbing already . ''
"`` Far too much , '' agreed the doctor ."
"`` I 'll tell you what I 've heard myself , '' continued Captain Smollett : `` that you have a map of an island , that there 's crosses on the map to show where treasure is , and that the island lies -- '' And then he named the latitude and longitude exactly ."
"`` I never told that , '' cried the squire , `` to a soul ! ''"
"`` The hands know it , sir , '' returned the captain ."
"`` Livesey , that must have been you or Hawkins , '' cried the squire ."
"`` It does n't much matter who it was , '' replied the doctor ."
And I could see that neither he nor the captain paid much regard to Mr. Trelawney 's protestations .
"Neither did I , to be sure , he was so loose a talker ; yet in this case I believe he was really right and that nobody had told the situation of the island ."
"`` Well , gentlemen , '' continued the captain , `` I do n't know who has this map ; but I make it a point , it shall be kept secret even from me and Mr. Arrow ."
Otherwise I would ask you to let me resign . ''
"`` I see , '' said the doctor ."
"`` You wish us to keep this matter dark and to make a garrison of the stern part of the ship , manned with my friend 's own people , and provided with all the arms and powder on board ."
"In other words , you fear a mutiny . ''"
"`` Sir , '' said Captain Smollett , `` with no intention to take offence , I deny your right to put words into my mouth ."
The professor stooped and began hunting for his maltreated hat .
"He was a long time finding it , and when he did he went softly to the door ."
"With his hand on the knob , he paused and looked back ."
"`` Good-bye , Miss Rangely , '' he said softly ."
"But Katherine , whose face was buried in the cushions of the lounge , did not hear him and when she looked up he was gone ."
"* * * * * Katharine felt that life was stale , flat and unprofitable when she alighted at Riverton station in the dusk of the next evening ."
She was not expected until a later train and there was no one to meet her .
She walked drearily through the streets to her boarding house and entered her room unannounced .
"Edith , who was lying on the bed , sprang up with a surprised greeting ."
"It was too dark to be sure , but Katherine had an uncomfortable suspicion that her friend had been crying , and her heart quaked guiltily ."
Could Edith have suspected anything ?
"`` Why , we did n't think you 'd be up till the 8:30 train , and Ned and I were going to meet you . ''"
"`` I found I could catch an earlier train , so I took it , '' said Katherine , as she dropped listlessly into a chair ."
`` I am tired to death and I have such a headache .
"I ca n't see anyone tonight , not even Ned . ''"
"`` You poor dear , '' said Edith sympathetically , beginning a search for the cologne ."
`` Lie down on the bed and I 'll bathe your poor head .
Did you have a good time at Harbour Hill ?
And how did you leave Sid ?
Did he say anything about coming up ? ''
"`` Oh , he was quite well , '' said Katherine wearily ."
`` I did n't hear him say if he intended to come up or not .
"There , thanks -- that will do nicely . ''"
"After Edith had gone down , Katherine tossed about restlessly ."
She knew Ned had come and she did not want to see him .
"But , after all , it was only putting off the evil day , and it was treating him rather shabbily ."
She would go down for a minute .
"There were two doors to the parlour , and Katherine went by way of the library one , over which a portiere was hanging ."
Her hand was lifted to draw it back when she heard something that arrested the movement .
A woman was crying in the room beyond .
It was Edith -- and what was she saying ?
"`` Oh , Ned , it is all perfectly dreadful !"
"` Shall I after him , captain , ' asked pathetic Smee , ` and tickle him with Johnny Corkscrew ? '"
"Smee had pleasant names for everything , and his cutlass was Johnny Corkscrew , because he wriggled it in the wound ."
One could mention many lovable traits in Smee .
"For instance , after killing , it was his spectacles he wiped instead of his weapon ."
"` Johnny 's a silent fellow , ' he reminded Hook ."
"` Not now , Smee , ' Hook said darkly ."
"` He is only one , and I want to mischief all the seven ."
Scatter and look for them . '
"The pirates disappeared among the trees , and in a moment their captain and Smee were alone ."
"Hook heaved a heavy sigh ; and I know not why it was , perhaps it was because of the soft beauty of the evening , but there came over him a desire to confide to his faithful bo ` sun the story of his life ."
"He spoke long and earnestly , but what it was all about Smee , who was rather stupid , did not know in the least ."
Anon he caught the word Peter .
"` Most of all , ' Hook was saying passionately , ' I want their captain , Peter Pan ."
'T was he cut off my arm . '
He brandished the hook threateningly .
` I 've waited long to shake his hand with this .
"Oh , I 'll tear him . '"
"` And yet , ' said Smee , ' I have often heard you say that hook was worth a score of hands , for combing the hair and other homely uses . '"
"` Ay , ' the captain answered , ` if I was a mother I would pray to have my children born with this instead of that , ' and he cast a look of pride upon his iron hand and one of scorn upon the other ."
Then again he frowned .
"` Peter flung my arm , ' he said , wincing , ` to a crocodile that happened to be passing by . ' '"
"I have often , ' said Smee , ` noticed your strange dread of crocodiles . '"
"` Not of crocodiles , ' Hook corrected him , ` but of that one crocodile . '"
He lowered his voice .
"` It liked my arm so much , Smee , that it has followed me ever since , from sea to sea and from land to land , licking its lips for the rest of me . '"
"` In a way , ' said Smee , ` it 's a sort of compliment . ' '"
"I want no such compliments , ' Hook barked petulantly . '"
"I want Peter Pan , who first gave the brute its taste for me . '"
"He sat down on a large mushroom , and now there was a quiver in his voice ."
"` Smee , ' he said huskily , ` that crocodile would have had me before this , but by a lucky chance it swallowed a clock which goes tick tick inside it , and so before it can reach me I hear the tick and bolt . '"
"He laughed , but in a hollow way ."
"` Some day , ' said Smee , ` the clock will run down , and then he 'll get you . '"
`` It 's Max Seeley .
"You need n't laugh , Al. ."
It 's a fact .
I noticed it the minute I introduced them .
"He 's plump and prosperous and she 's pinched and pale , but there 's a resemblance nevertheless ."
Look for yourself and see if it is n't so . ''
"Back in the big , cheery parlour the Thanksgiving guests were amusing themselves in various ways ."
"Max Seeley had given an odd little start when he was introduced to Miss Price , and as soon as possible he followed her to the corner where she had taken refuge ."
"Ernest Allen was out in the kitchen talking to his sisters , the `` uncles and cousins and aunts '' were all chattering to each other , and Mr. Seeley and Miss Price were quite unnoticed ."
"`` You will excuse me , wo n't you , Miss Price , if I ask you something about yourself ? ''"
he said eagerly .
"`` The truth is , you look so strikingly like someone I used to know that I feel sure you must be related to her ."
I do not think I have any relatives of your name .
Have you any of mine ? ''
"Bertha flushed , hesitated for an instant , then said frankly , `` No , I do not think so ."
"But I may as well tell you that Price is not my real name and I do not know what it is , although I think it begins with S. I believe that my parents died when I was about three years old , and I was then taken to an orphan asylum ."
The next year I was taken from there and adopted by Mrs. Price .
She was very kind to me and treated me as her own daughter .
"I had a happy home with her , although we were poor ."
"Mrs. Price wished me to bear her name , and I did so ."
"She never told me my true surname , perhaps she did not know it ."
"She died when I was sixteen , and since then I have been quite alone in the world ."
That is all I know about myself . ''
Max Seeley was plainly excited .
`` Why do you think your real name begins with S ? ''
he asked .
"`` I have a watch which belonged to my mother , with the monogram ` B.S. ' on the case ."
It was left with the matron of the asylum and she gave it to Mrs. Price for me .
Here it is . ''
"Max Seeley almost snatched the old-fashioned little silver watch , from her hand and opened the case ."
An exclamation escaped him as he pointed to some scratches on the inner side .
"They looked like the initials M.A.S. `` Let me tell my story now , '' he said ."
"When he had gone home Anne soothed and warmed the sobbing , shivering Dora , got her her supper and put her to bed ."
"Then she returned to the kitchen , just as Marilla came grimly in , leading , or rather pulling , the reluctant , cobwebby Davy , whom she had just found hidden away in the darkest corner of the stable ."
She jerked him to the mat on the middle of the floor and then went and sat down by the east window .
Anne was sitting limply by the west window .
Between them stood the culprit .
"His back was toward Marilla and it was a meek , subdued , frightened back ; but his face was toward Anne and although it was a little shamefaced there was a gleam of comradeship in Davy 's eyes , as if he knew he had done wrong and was going to be punished for it , but could count on a laugh over it all with Anne later on ."
"But no half hidden smile answered him in Anne 's gray eyes , as there might have done had it been only a question of mischief ."
There was something else ... something ugly and repulsive .
"`` How could you behave so , Davy ? ''"
she asked sorrowfully .
Davy squirmed uncomfortably .
`` I just did it for fun .
Things have been so awful quiet here for so long that I thought it would be fun to give you folks a big scare .
"It was , too . ''"
In spite of fear and a little remorse Davy grinned over the recollection .
"`` But you told a falsehood about it , Davy , '' said Anne , more sorrowfully than ever ."
Davy looked puzzled .
`` What 's a falsehood ?
Do you mean a whopper ? ''
`` I mean a story that was not true . ''
"`` Course I did , '' said Davy frankly ."
`` If I had n't you would n't have been scared .
I HAD to tell it . ''
Anne was feeling the reaction from her fright and exertions .
Davy 's impenitent attitude gave the finishing touch .
Two big tears brimmed up in her eyes .
"`` Oh , Davy , how could you ? ''"
"she said , with a quiver in her voice ."
`` Do n't you know how wrong it was ? ''
Davy was aghast .
Anne crying ... he had made Anne cry !
A flood of real remorse rolled like a wave over his warm little heart and engulfed it .
"So when the man woke , there was a poke beside him and something into the inside of it that moved ."
"Well , it seems he was one of these gentry that think aye the worst of things ; and for greater security , he stuck his dirk throughout that poke before he opened it , and there was his bairn dead ."
"I am thinking to myself , Mr. Balfour , that you and the man are very much alike . ''"
* Bag .
`` Do you mean you had no hand in it ? ''
"cried I , sitting up ."
"`` I will tell you first of all , Mr. Balfour of Shaws , as one friend to another , '' said Alan , `` that if I were going to kill a gentleman , it would not be in my own country , to bring trouble on my clan ; and I would not go wanting sword and gun , and with a long fishing-rod upon my back . ''"
"`` Well , '' said I , `` that 's true ! ''"
"`` And now , '' continued Alan , taking out his dirk and laying his hand upon it in a certain manner , `` I swear upon the Holy Iron I had neither art nor part , act nor thought in it . ''"
`` I thank God for that ! ''
"cried I , and offered him my hand ."
He did not appear to see it .
`` And here is a great deal of work about a Campbell ! ''
said he .
"`` They are not so scarce , that I ken ! ''"
"`` At least , '' said I , `` you can not justly blame me , for you know very well what you told me in the brig. But the temptation and the act are different , I thank God again for that ."
"We may all be tempted ; but to take a life in cold blood , Alan ! ''"
And I could say no more for the moment .
`` And do you know who did it ? ''
I added .
`` Do you know that man in the black coat ? ''
"`` I have nae clear mind about his coat , '' said Alan cunningly , `` but it sticks in my head that it was blue . ''"
"`` Blue or black , did ye know him ? ''"
"said I. `` I couldnae just conscientiously swear to him , '' says Alan ."
"`` He gaed very close by me , to be sure , but it 's a strange thing that I should just have been tying my brogues . ''"
"`` Can you swear that you do n't know him , Alan ? ''"
"I cried , half angered , half in a mind to laugh at his evasions ."
"`` Not yet , '' says he ; `` but I 've a grand memory for forgetting , David . ''"
"`` And yet there was one thing I saw clearly , '' said I ; `` and that was , that you exposed yourself and me to draw the soldiers . ''"
"`` It 's very likely , '' said Alan ; `` and so would any gentleman ."
You and me were innocent of that transaction . ''
"`` The better reason , since we were falsely suspected , that we should get clear , '' I cried ."
"Then she came over , sat down beside me , and took me in her arms . ''"
"` Do n't cry , dear little Rilla-my-Rilla ."
"You have nothing to reproach yourself with in regard to Fred ; and if Leslie West 's son asked you to keep your lips for him , I think you may consider yourself engaged to him ."
"But -- oh , my baby -- my last little baby -- I have lost you -- the war has made a woman of you too soon . '"
`` I shall never be too much of a woman to find comfort in mother 's hugs .
"Nevertheless , when I saw Fred marching by two days later in the parade , my heart ached unbearably ."
`` But I 'm glad mother thinks I 'm really engaged to Ken ! ''
"CHAPTER XXII LITTLE DOG MONDAY KNOWS `` It is two years tonight since the dance at the light , when Jack Elliott brought us news of the war ."
"Do you remember , Miss Oliver ? ''"
Cousin Sophia answered for Miss Oliver .
"`` Oh , indeed , Rilla , I remember that evening only too well , and you a-prancing down here to show off your party clothes ."
Did n't I warn you that we could not tell what was before us ?
Little did you think that night what was before you . ''
"`` Little did any of us think that , '' said Susan sharply , `` not being gifted with the power of prophecy ."
"It does not require any great foresight , Sophia Crawford , to tell a body that she will have some trouble before her life is over ."
I could do as much myself . ''
"`` We all thought the war would be over in a few months then , '' said Rilla wistfully ."
`` When I look back it seems so ridiculous that we ever could have supposed it . ''
"`` And now , two years later , it is no nearer the end than it was then , '' said Miss Oliver gloomily ."
Susan clicked her knitting-needles briskly .
"`` Now , Miss Oliver , dear , you know that is not a reasonable remark ."
"You know we are just two years nearer the end , whenever the end is appointed to be . ''"
"`` Albert read in a Montreal paper today that a war expert gives it as his opinion that it will last five years more , '' was Cousin Sophia 's cheerful contribution ."
"`` It ca n't , '' cried Rilla ; then she added with a sigh , `` Two years ago we would have said ` It ca n't last two years . '"
But five more years of this ! ''
"`` If Rumania comes in , as I have strong hopes now of her doing , you will see the end in five months instead of five years , '' said Susan ."
"`` I 've no faith in furriners , '' sighed Cousin Sophia ."
"`` The French are foreigners , '' retorted Susan , `` and look at Verdun ."
And think of all the Somme victories this blessed summer .
The Big Push is on and the Russians are still going well .
"Why , General Haig says that the German officers he has captured admit that they have lost the war . ''"
"`` You ca n't believe a word the Germans say , '' protested Cousin Sophia ."
says he .
`` This is nae kind of time of night for decent folk ; and I hae nae trokings * wi ' night-hawks .
What brings ye here ?
I have a blunderbush . ''
* Dealings .
"`` Is that yoursel ' , Mr. Balfour ? ''"
"returned Alan , stepping back and looking up into the darkness ."
`` Have a care of that blunderbuss ; they 're nasty things to burst . ''
`` What brings ye here ?
and whae are ye ? ''
"says my uncle , angrily ."
"`` I have no manner of inclination to rowt out my name to the country-side , '' said Alan ; `` but what brings me here is another story , being more of your affair than mine ; and if ye 're sure it 's what ye would like , I 'll set it to a tune and sing it to you . ''"
`` And what is ` t ? ''
asked my uncle .
"`` David , '' says Alan ."
`` What was that ? ''
"cried my uncle , in a mighty changed voice ."
"`` Shall I give ye the rest of the name , then ? ''"
said Alan .
"There was a pause ; and then , `` I 'm thinking I 'll better let ye in , '' says my uncle , doubtfully ."
"`` I dare say that , '' said Alan ; `` but the point is , Would I go ?"
Now I will tell you what I am thinking .
"I am thinking that it is here upon this doorstep that we must confer upon this business ; and it shall be here or nowhere at all whatever ; for I would have you to understand that I am as stiffnecked as yoursel ' , and a gentleman of better family . ''"
"This change of note disconcerted Ebenezer ; he was a little while digesting it , and then says he , `` Weel , weel , what must be must , '' and shut the window ."
"But it took him a long time to get down-stairs , and a still longer to undo the fastenings , repenting -LRB- I dare say -RRB- and taken with fresh claps of fear at every second step and every bolt and bar ."
"At last , however , we heard the creak of the hinges , and it seems my uncle slipped gingerly out and -LRB- seeing that Alan had stepped back a pace or two -RRB- sate him down on the top doorstep with the blunderbuss ready in his hands ."
"`` And , now '' says he , `` mind I have my blunderbush , and if ye take a step nearer ye 're as good as deid . ''"
"`` And a very civil speech , '' says Alan , `` to be sure . ''"
"`` Na , '' says my uncle , `` but this is no a very chanty kind of a proceeding , and I 'm bound to be prepared ."
"And now that we understand each other , ye 'll can name your business . ''"
"`` Why , '' says Alan , `` you that are a man of so much understanding , will doubtless have perceived that I am a Hieland gentleman ."
"My name has nae business in my story ; but the county of my friends is no very far from the Isle of Mull , of which ye will have heard ."
"I have some myself , though you might never suspect it ."
But anyhow I ai n't going to give anything to that carpet .
"Folks are everlasting begging for money here , it seems to me ."
How 's your project of painting the hall coming on ? ''
`` Splendidly .
We had a meeting of the A.V.I.S. last Friday night and found that we had plenty of money subscribed to paint the hall and shingle the roof too .
"MOST people gave very liberally , Mr. Harrison . ''"
"Anne was a sweet-souled lass , but she could instill some venom into innocent italics when occasion required ."
`` What color are you going to have it ? ''
`` We have decided on a very pretty green .
"The roof will be dark red , of course ."
Mr. Roger Pye is going to get the paint in town today . ''
`` Who 's got the job ? ''
`` Mr. Joshua Pye of Carmody .
He has nearly finished the shingling .
"We had to give him the contract , for every one of the Pyes ... and there are four families , you know ... said they would n't give a cent unless Joshua got it ."
"They had subscribed twelve dollars between them and we thought that was too much to lose , although some people think we should n't have given in to the Pyes ."
Mrs. Lynde says they try to run everything . ''
`` The main question is will this Joshua do his work well .
If he does I do n't see that it matters whether his name is Pye or Pudding . ''
"`` He has the reputation of being a good workman , though they say he 's a very peculiar man ."
He hardly ever talks . ''
"`` He 's peculiar enough all right then , '' said Mr. Harrison drily ."
"`` Or at least , folks here will call him so ."
I never was much of a talker till I came to Avonlea and then I had to begin in self-defense or Mrs. Lynde would have said I was dumb and started a subscription to have me taught sign language .
"You 're not going yet , Anne ? ''"
`` I must .
I have some sewing to do for Dora this evening .
"Besides , Davy is probably breaking Marilla 's heart with some new mischief by this time ."
"This morning the first thing he said was , ` Where does the dark go , Anne ?"
I want to know . '
I told him it went around to the other side of the world but after breakfast he declared it did n't ... that it went down the well .
`` One ! ''
-LRB- Slightly had begun to count . -RRB-
"None too soon , Peter , every inch of him on tiptoe , vanished into the cabin ; for more than one pirate was screwing up his courage to look round ."
"They could hear each other 's distressed breathing now , which showed them that the more terrible sound had passed ."
"`` It 's gone , captain , '' Smee said , wiping off his spectacles ."
`` All 's still again . ''
"Slowly Hook let his head emerge from his ruff , and listened so intently that he could have caught the echo of the tick ."
"There was not a sound , and he drew himself up firmly to his full height ."
`` Then here 's to Johnny Plank ! ''
"he cried brazenly , hating the boys more than ever because they had seen him unbend ."
"He broke into the villainous ditty : `` Yo ho , yo ho , the frisky plank , You walks along it so , Till it goes down and you goes down To Davy Jones below ! ''"
"To terrorize the prisoners the more , though with a certain loss of dignity , he danced along an imaginary plank , grimacing at them as he sang ; and when he finished he cried , `` Do you want a touch of the cat -LSB- o ' nine tails -RSB- before you walk the plank ? ''"
At that they fell on their knees .
"`` No , no ! ''"
they cried so piteously that every pirate smiled .
"`` Fetch the cat , Jukes , '' said Hook ; `` it 's in the cabin . ''"
The cabin !
Peter was in the cabin !
The children gazed at each other .
"`` Ay , ay , '' said Jukes blithely , and he strode into the cabin ."
"They followed him with their eyes ; they scarce knew that Hook had resumed his song , his dogs joining in with him : `` Yo ho , yo ho , the scratching cat , Its tails are nine , you know , And when they 're writ upon your back -- '' What was the last line will never be known , for of a sudden the song was stayed by a dreadful screech from the cabin ."
"It wailed through the ship , and died away ."
"Then was heard a crowing sound which was well understood by the boys , but to the pirates was almost more eerie than the screech ."
`` What was that ? ''
cried Hook .
"`` Two , '' said Slightly solemnly ."
The Italian Cecco hesitated for a moment and then swung into the cabin .
"He tottered out , haggard ."
"`` What 's the matter with Bill Jukes , you dog ? ''"
"hissed Hook , towering over him ."
"`` The matter wi ' him is he 's dead , stabbed , '' replied Cecco in a hollow voice ."
`` Bill Jukes dead ! ''
It mattered nothing to me that the world may have thought there was some social difference between us .
"There , Jeff , you can not accuse me of not making my meaning plain . ''"
"`` Sara , '' he whispered , wondering , bewildered , half-afraid to believe this unbelievable joy ."
"`` I 'm not half worthy of you -- but -- but '' -- he bent forward and put his arm around her , looking straight into her clear , unshrinking eyes ."
"`` Sara , will you be my wife ? ''"
`` Yes . ''
She said the word clearly and truly .
"`` And I will think myself a proud and happy and honoured woman to be so , Jeff ."
"Oh , I do n't shrink from telling you the truth , you see ."
You mean too much to me for me to dissemble it .
"I 've hidden it for eighteen years because I did n't think you wanted to hear it , but I 'll give myself the delight of saying it frankly now . ''"
"She lifted her delicate , high-bred face , fearless love shining in every lineament , to his , and they exchanged their first kiss ."
"Clorinda 's Gifts `` It is a dreadful thing to be poor a fortnight before Christmas , '' said Clorinda , with the mournful sigh of seventeen years ."
Aunt Emmy smiled .
"Aunt Emmy was sixty , and spent the hours she did n't spend in a bed , on a sofa or in a wheel chair ; but Aunt Emmy was never heard to sigh ."
"`` I suppose it is worse then than at any other time , '' she admitted ."
That was one of the nice things about Aunt Emmy .
She always sympathized and understood .
"`` I 'm worse than poor this Christmas ... I 'm stony broke , '' said Clorinda dolefully ."
`` My spell of fever in the summer and the consequent doctor 's bills have cleaned out my coffers completely .
Not a single Christmas present can I give .
And I did so want to give some little thing to each of my dearest people .
"But I simply ca n't afford it ... that 's the hateful , ugly truth . ''"
Clorinda sighed again .
"`` The gifts which money can purchase are not the only ones we can give , '' said Aunt Emmy gently , `` nor the best , either . ''"
"`` Oh , I know it 's nicer to give something of your own work , '' agreed Clorinda , `` but materials for fancy work cost too ."
That kind of gift is just as much out of the question for me as any other . ''
"`` That was not what I meant , '' said Aunt Emmy ."
"`` What did you mean , then ? ''"
"asked Clorinda , looking puzzled ."
Aunt Emmy smiled .
"`` Suppose you think out my meaning for yourself , '' she said ."
Sore bested ? ''
returned the knight .
"`` Nay , then , we will make speed sitting down , good Richard ."
"As the world goes in this poor realm of England , he that rides softliest rides surest ."
"Delay , they say , begetteth peril ; but it is rather this itch of doing that undoes men ; mark it , Dick ."
"But let me see , first , what cattle ye have brought ."
"Selden , a link here at the door ! ''"
"And Sir Daniel strode forth into the village street , and , by the red glow of a torch , inspected his new troops ."
He was an unpopular neighbour and an unpopular master ; but as a leader in war he was well-beloved by those who rode behind his pennant .
"His dash , his proved courage , his forethought for the soldiers ' comfort , even his rough gibes , were all to the taste of the bold blades in jack and salet ."
"`` Nay , by the rood ! ''"
"he cried , `` what poor dogs are these ?"
"Here be some as crooked as a bow , and some as lean as a spear ."
"Friends , ye shall ride in the front of the battle ; I can spare you , friends ."
Mark me this old villain on the piebald !
A two-year mutton riding on a hog would look more soldierly !
Ha !
"Clipsby , are ye there , old rat ?"
"Y ' are a man I could lose with a good heart ; ye shall go in front of all , with a bull 's eye painted on your jack , to be the better butt for archery ; sirrah , ye shall show me the way . ''"
"`` I will show you any way , Sir Daniel , but the way to change sides , '' returned Clipsby , sturdily ."
Sir Daniel laughed a guffaw .
"`` Why , well said ! ''"
he cried .
"`` Hast a shrewd tongue in thy mouth , go to !"
I will forgive you for that merry word .
"Selden , see them fed , both man and brute . ''"
The knight re-entered the inn .
"`` Now , friend Dick , '' he said , `` fall to ."
Here is good ale and bacon .
"Eat , while that I read . ''"
"Sir Daniel opened the packet , and as he read his brow darkened ."
"When he had done he sat a little , musing ."
So I ran away to Kensington Gardens and lived a long long time among the fairies . '
"She gave him a look of the most intense admiration , and he thought it was because he had run away , but it was really because he knew fairies ."
Wendy had lived such a home life that to know fairies struck her as quite delightful .
"She poured out questions about them , to his surprise , for they were rather a nuisance to him , getting in his way and so on , and indeed he sometimes had to give them a hiding ."
"Still , he liked them on the whole , and he told her about the beginning of fairies ."
"` You see , Wendy , when the first baby laughed for the first time , its laugh broke into a thousand pieces , and they all went skipping about , and that was the beginning of fairies . '"
"Tedious talk this , but being a stay-at-home she liked it ."
"` And so , ' he went on good-naturedly , ` there ought to be one fairy for every boy and girl . '"
` Ought to be ?
Is n't there ? '
` No .
"You see children know such a lot now , they soon do n't believe in fairies , and every time a child says , ' I do n't believe in fairies , ' there is a fairy somewhere that falls down dead ."
"Really , he thought they had now talked enough about fairies , and it struck him that Tinker Bell was keeping very quiet . '"
"I ca n't think where she has gone to , ' he said , rising , and he called Tink by name ."
Wendy 's heart went flutter with a sudden thrill .
"` Peter , ' she cried , clutching him , ` you do n't mean to tell me that there is a fairy in this room ! '"
"` She was here just now , ' he said a little impatiently ."
"` You do n't hear her , do you ? '"
and they both listened .
"` The only sound I hear , ' said Wendy , ` is like a tinkle of bells . '"
"` Well , that 's Tink , that 's the fairy language ."
I think I hear her too . '
"The sound came from the chest of drawers , and Peter made a merry face ."
"No one could ever look quite so merry as Peter , and the loveliest of gurgles was his laugh ."
He had his first laugh still .
"` Wendy , ' he whispered gleefully , ' I do believe I shut her up in the drawer ! '"
"He let poor Tink out of the drawer , and she flew about the nursery screaming with fury ."
"` You should n't say such things , ' Peter retorted ."
"` Of course I 'm very sorry , but how could I know you were in the drawer ? '"
Wendy was not listening to him . '
"O Peter , ' she cried , ` if she would only stand still and let me see her ! '"
"` They hardly ever stand still , ' he said , but for one moment Wendy saw the romantic figure come to rest on the cuckoo clock . '"
"` What fun , ' he said doubtfully , and they did not dare expose him when Mrs. Darling and Nana returned ."
"` Nana , good dog , ' he said , patting her , ' I have put a little milk into your bowl , Nana . '"
"Nana wagged her tail , ran to the medicine , and began lapping it ."
"Then she gave Mr. Darling such a look , not an angry look : she showed him the great red tear that makes us so sorry for noble dogs , and crept into her kennel ."
"Mr. Darling was frightfully ashamed of himself , but he would not give in ."
In a horrid silence Mrs. Darling smelt the bowl . '
"O George , ' she said , ` it 's your medicine ! '"
"` It was only a joke , ' he roared , while she comforted her boys , and Wendy hugged Nana ."
"` Much good , ' he said bitterly , ` my wearing myself to the bone trying to be funny in this house . '"
And still Wendy hugged Nana .
"` That 's right , ' he shouted ."
` Coddle her !
Nobody coddles me .
Oh dear no !
"I am only the breadwinner , why should I be coddled , why , why , why ! '"
"` George , ' Mrs. Darling entreated him , ` not so loud ; the servants will hear you . '"
Somehow they had got into the way of calling Liza the servants .
"` Let them , ' he answered recklessly ."
` Bring in the whole world .
But I refuse to allow that dog to lord it in my nursery for an hour longer . '
"The children wept , and Nana ran to him beseechingly , but he waved her back ."
He felt he was a strong man again .
"` In vain , in vain , ' he cried ; ` the proper place for you is the yard , and there you go to be tied up this instant . '"
"` George , George , ' Mrs. Darling whispered , ` remember what I told you about that boy . '"
"Alas , he would not listen ."
"He was determined to show who was master in that house , and when commands would not draw Nana from the kennel , he lured her out of it with honeyed words , and seizing her roughly , dragged her from the nursery ."
"He was ashamed of himself , and yet he did it ."
"It was all owing to his too affectionate nature , which craved for admiration ."
"When he had tied her up in the back-yard , the wretched father went and sat in the passage , with his knuckles to his eyes ."
In the meantime Mrs. Darling had put the children to bed in unwonted silence and lit their night-lights .
"They could hear Nana barking , and John whimpered , ` It is because he is chaining her up in the yard , ' but Wendy was wiser ."
"` That is not Nana 's unhappy bark , ' she said , little guessing what was about to happen ; ` that is her bark when she smells danger . '"
"I should think you ought to be able to , with that imagination you 're always talking of . ''"
"`` But punishments are so horrid and I like to imagine only pleasant things , '' said Anne , cuddling Davy ."
`` There are so many unpleasant things in the world already that there is no use in imagining any more . ''
"In the end Davy was sent to bed , as usual , there to remain until noon next day ."
"He evidently did some thinking , for when Anne went up to her room a little later she heard him calling her name softly ."
"Going in , she found him sitting up in bed , with his elbows on his knees and his chin propped on his hands ."
"`` Anne , '' he said solemnly , `` is it wrong for everybody to tell whop ... falsehoods ?"
I want to know ? ''
"`` Yes , indeed . ''"
`` Is it wrong for a grown-up person ? ''
`` Yes . ''
"`` Then , '' said Davy decidedly , `` Marilla is bad , for SHE tells them ."
"And she 's worse 'n me , for I did n't know it was wrong but she does . ''"
"`` Davy Keith , Marilla never told a story in her life , '' said Anne indignantly ."
`` She did so .
She told me last Tuesday that something dreadful WOULD happen to me if I did n't say my prayers every night .
"And I have n't said them for over a week , just to see what would happen ... and nothing has , '' concluded Davy in an aggrieved tone ."
"Anne choked back a mad desire to laugh with the conviction that it would be fatal , and then earnestly set about saving Marilla 's reputation ."
"`` Why , Davy Keith , '' she said solemnly , `` something dreadful HAS happened to you this very day . ''"
Davy looked sceptical .
"`` I s ` pose you mean being sent to bed without any supper , '' he said scornfully , `` but THAT is n't dreadful ."
"Course , I do n't like it , but I 've been sent to bed so much since I come here that I 'm getting used to it ."
"And you do n't save anything by making me go without supper either , for I always eat twice as much for breakfast . ''"
`` I do n't mean your being sent to bed .
I mean the fact that you told a falsehood today .
"And , Davy , '' ... Anne leaned over the footboard of the bed and shook her finger impressively at the culprit ... `` for a boy to tell what is n't true is almost the worst thing that could HAPPEN to him ... almost the very worst ."
So you see Marilla told you the truth . ''
"`` But I thought the something bad would be exciting , '' protested Davy in an injured tone ."
`` Marilla is n't to blame for what you thought .
Bad things are n't always exciting .
They 're very often just nasty and stupid . ''
"`` It was awful funny to see Marilla and you looking down the well , though , '' said Davy , hugging his knees ."
"Marilla says she caught him hanging over the well-box four times today , trying to reach down to the dark . ''"
"`` He 's a limb , '' declared Mr. Harrison ."
`` He came over here yesterday and pulled six feathers out of Ginger 's tail before I could get in from the barn .
The poor bird has been moping ever since .
Those children must be a sight of trouble to you folks . ''
"`` Everything that 's worth having is some trouble , '' said Anne , secretly resolving to forgive Davy 's next offence , whatever it might be , since he had avenged her on Ginger ."
"Mr. Roger Pye brought the hall paint home that night and Mr. Joshua Pye , a surly , taciturn man , began painting the next day ."
He was not disturbed in his task .
The hall was situated on what was called `` the lower road . ''
"In late autumn this road was always muddy and wet , and people going to Carmody traveled by the longer `` upper '' road ."
The hall was so closely surrounded by fir woods that it was invisible unless you were near it .
Mr. Joshua Pye painted away in the solitude and independence that were so dear to his unsociable heart .
Friday afternoon he finished his job and went home to Carmody .
"Soon after his departure Mrs. Rachel Lynde drove by , having braved the mud of the lower road out of curiosity to see what the hall looked like in its new coat of paint ."
When she rounded the spruce curve she saw .
The sight affected Mrs. Lynde oddly .
"She dropped the reins , held up her hands , and said `` Gracious Providence ! ''"
She stared as if she could not believe her eyes .
Then she laughed almost hysterically .
`` There must be some mistake ... there must .
I knew those Pyes would make a mess of things . ''
"Mrs. Lynde drove home , meeting several people on the road and stopping to tell them about the hall ."
The news flew like wildfire .
"Gilbert Blythe , poring over a text book at home , heard it from his father 's hired boy at sunset , and rushed breathlessly to Green Gables , joined on the way by Fred Wright ."
"They found Diana Barry , Jane Andrews , and Anne Shirley , despair personified , at the yard gate of Green Gables , under the big leafless willows ."
"`` It is n't true surely , Anne ? ''"
exclaimed Gilbert .
"`` It is true , '' answered Anne , looking like the muse of tragedy ."
`` Mrs. Lynde called on her way from Carmody to tell me .
"Oh , it is simply dreadful !"
What is the use of trying to improve anything ? ''
`` What is dreadful ? ''
"Here Michael , encouraged by his success , breathed so loudly that they were nearly detected ."
"Nana knew that kind of breathing , and she tried to drag herself out of Liza 's clutches ."
But Liza was dense .
"` No more of it , Nana , ' she said sternly , pulling her out of the room . '"
"I warn you if you bark again I shall go straight for master and missus and bring them home from the party , and then , oh , wo n't master whip you , just . '"
"She tied the unhappy dog up again , but do you think Nana ceased to bark ?"
Bring master and missus home from the party !
"Why , that was just what she wanted ."
Do you think she cared whether she was whipped so long as her charges were safe ?
"Unfortunately Liza returned to her puddings , and Nana , seeing that no help would come from her , strained and strained at the chain until at last she broke it ."
"In another moment she had burst into the dining-room of 27 and flung up her paws to heaven , her most expressive way of making a communication ."
"Mr. and Mrs. Darling knew at once that something terrible was happening in their nursery , and without a good-bye to their hostess they rushed into the street ."
But it was now ten minutes since three scoundrels had been breathing behind the curtains ; and Peter Pan can do a great deal in ten minutes .
We now return to the nursery .
"` It 's all right , ' John announced , emerging from his hiding-place . '"
"I say , Peter , can you really fly ? '"
"Instead of troubling to answer him Peter flew round the room , taking the mantelpiece on the way ."
` How topping ! '
said John and Michael .
` How sweet ! '
cried Wendy .
"` Yes , I 'm sweet , oh , I am sweet ! '"
"said Peter , forgetting his manners again ."
"It looked delightfully easy , and they tried it first from the floor and then from the beds , but they always went down instead of up . '"
"I say , how do you do it ? '"
"asked John , rubbing his knee ."
He was quite a practical boy .
"` You just think lovely wonderful thoughts , ' Peter explained , ` and they lift you up in the air . '"
He showed them again .
"` You 're so nippy at it , ' John said ; ` could n't you do it very slowly once ? '"
Peter did it both slowly and quickly .
"` I 've got it now , Wendy ! '"
"`` For , by my sooth , y ' are here and I do mightily suspect your honesty ."
"If ye would save your neck , write me swiftly an obligation for twenty pound . ''"
"`` For twenty pound , my good lord ! ''"
cried Condall .
`` Here is midsummer madness !
My whole estate amounteth not to seventy shillings . ''
"`` Condall or Tyndal , '' returned Sir Daniel , grinning , `` I will run my peril of that loss ."
"Write me down twenty , and when I have recovered all I may , I will be good lord to you , and pardon you the rest . ''"
`` Alas !
"my good lord , it may not be ; I have no skill to write , '' said Condall ."
`` Well-a-day ! ''
returned the knight .
"`` Here , then , is no remedy ."
"Yet I would fain have spared you , Tyndal , had my conscience suffered ."
"Selden , take me this old shrew softly to the nearest elm , and hang me him tenderly by the neck , where I may see him at my riding ."
"Fare ye well , good Master Condall , dear Master Tyndal ; y ' are post-haste for Paradise ; fare ye then well ! ''"
"`` Nay , my right pleasant lord , '' replied Condall , forcing an obsequious smile , `` an ye be so masterful , as doth right well become you , I will even , with all my poor skill , do your good bidding . ''"
"`` Friend , '' quoth Sir Daniel , `` ye will now write two score ."
Go to !
y ' are too cunning for a livelihood of seventy shillings .
"Selden , see him write me this in good form , and have it duly witnessed . ''"
"And Sir Daniel , who was a very merry knight , none merrier in England , took a drink of his mulled ale , and lay back , smiling ."
"Meanwhile , the boy upon the floor began to stir , and presently sat up and looked about him with a scare ."
"`` Hither , '' said Sir Daniel ; and as the other rose at his command and came slowly towards him , he leaned back and laughed outright ."
`` By the rood ! ''
"he cried , `` a sturdy boy ! ''"
"The lad flushed crimson with anger , and darted a look of hate out of his dark eyes ."
"Now that he was on his legs , it was more difficult to make certain of his age ."
"His face looked somewhat older in expression , but it was as smooth as a young child 's ; and in bone and body he was unusually slender , and somewhat awkward of gait ."
"`` Ye have called me , Sir Daniel , '' he said ."
`` Was it to laugh at my poor plight ? ''
"`` Nay , now , let laugh , '' said the knight ."
"If you 'll come up one by one , unarmed , I 'll engage to clap you all in irons and take you home to a fair trial in England ."
"If you wo n't , my name is Alexander Smollett , I 've flown my sovereign 's colours , and I 'll see you all to Davy Jones ."
You ca n't find the treasure .
You ca n't sail the ship -- there 's not a man among you fit to sail the ship .
"You ca n't fight us -- Gray , there , got away from five of you ."
"Your ship 's in irons , Master Silver ; you 're on a lee shore , and so you 'll find ."
"I stand here and tell you so ; and they 're the last good words you 'll get from me , for in the name of heaven , I 'll put a bullet in your back when next I meet you ."
"Tramp , my lad ."
"Bundle out of this , please , hand over hand , and double quick . ''"
Silver 's face was a picture ; his eyes started in his head with wrath .
He shook the fire out of his pipe .
`` Give me a hand up ! ''
he cried .
"`` Not I , '' returned the captain ."
`` Who 'll give me a hand up ? ''
he roared .
Not a man among us moved .
"Growling the foulest imprecations , he crawled along the sand till he got hold of the porch and could hoist himself again upon his crutch ."
Then he spat into the spring .
`` There ! ''
he cried .
`` That 's what I think of ye .
"Before an hour 's out , I 'll stove in your old block house like a rum puncheon ."
"Laugh , by thunder , laugh !"
"Before an hour 's out , ye 'll laugh upon the other side ."
Them that die 'll be the lucky ones . ''
"And with a dreadful oath he stumbled off , ploughed down the sand , was helped across the stockade , after four or five failures , by the man with the flag of truce , and disappeared in an instant afterwards among the trees ."
"21 The Attack AS soon as Silver disappeared , the captain , who had been closely watching him , turned towards the interior of the house and found not a man of us at his post but Gray ."
It was the first time we had ever seen him angry .
`` Quarters ! ''
he roared .
"And then , as we all slunk back to our places , `` Gray , '' he said , `` I 'll put your name in the log ; you 've stood by your duty like a seaman ."
"""You'll let me fall if you carry me like that. I won't go with you!"""
"""Don't be afraid! I'll hold you quite tight all the way."""
"Then said the crab to himself, ""If this fellow once got hold of fish, he would never let them go in a pond! Now if he should really put me into the pond, it would be capital; but if he doesn't then I'll cut his throat, and kill him!"" So he said to him:"
"""Look here, friend, you won't be able to hold me tight enough; but we crabs have a famous grip. If you let me catch hold of you round the neck with my claws, I shall be glad to go with you."""
"And the other did not see that he was trying to outwit him, and agreed. So the crab caught hold of his neck with his claws as securely as with a pair of blacksmith's pincers, and called out, ""Off with you, now!"""
"And the crane took him and showed him the pond, and then turned off towards the Varana-tree."
"""Uncle!"" cried the crab, ""the pond lies that way, but you are taking me this way!"""
"""Oh, that's it, is it?"" answered the crane. ""Your dear little uncle, your very sweet nephew, you call me! You mean me to understand, I suppose, that I am your slave, who has to lift you up and carry you about with him! Now cast your eye upon the heap of fish-bones lying at the root of yonder Varana-tree. Just as I have eaten those fish, every one of them, just so I will devour you as well!"""
"""Ah! those fishes got eaten through their own stupidity,"" answered the crab; ""but I'm not going to let you eat me. On the contrary, is it you that I am going to destroy. For you in your folly have not seen that I was outwitting you. If we die, we die both together; for I will cut off this head of yours, and cast it to the ground!"" And so saying, he gave the crane's neck a grip with his claws, as with a vice."
"Then gasping, and with tears trickling from his eyes, and trembling with the fear of death, the crane beseeched him, saying, ""O my Lord!"
"Indeed I did not intend to eat you. Grant me my life!"""
"""Well, well! step down into the pond, and put me in there."""
"And he turned round and stepped down into the pond, and placed the crab on the mud at its edge. But the crab cut through its neck as clean as one would cut a lotus-stalk with a hunting-knife, and then only entered the water!"
"When the Genius who lived in the Varana-tree saw this strange affair, he made the wood resound with his plaudits, uttering in a pleasant voice the verse:"
"""The villain, though exceeding clever,     Shall prosper not by his villainy."
"He may win indeed, sharp-witted in deceit,     But only as the Crane here from the Crab!"""
Loving Laili
"Once there was a king called King Dantal, who had a great many rupees and soldiers and horses. He had also an only son called Prince Majnun, who was a handsome boy with white teeth, red lips, blue eyes, red cheeks, red hair, and a white skin. This boy was very fond of playing with the Wazir's son, Husain Mahamat, in King Dantal's garden, which was very large and full of delicious fruits, and flowers, and trees."
They used to take their little knives there and cut the fruits and eat them. King Dantal had a teacher for them to teach them to read and write.
"One day, when they were grown two fine young men, Prince Majnun said to his father, ""Husain Mahamat and I should like to go and hunt."" His father said they might go, so they got ready their horses and all else they wanted for their hunting, and went to the Phalana country, hunting all the way, but they only founds jackals and birds."
"The Raja of the Phalana country was called Munsuk Raja, and he had a daughter named Laili, who was very beautiful; she had brown eyes and black hair."
"One night, some time before Prince Majnun came to her father's kingdom, as she slept, Khuda sent to her an angel in the form of a man who told her that she should marry Prince Majnun and no one else, and that this was Khuda's command to her. When Laili woke she told her father of the angel's visit to her as she slept; but her father paid no attention to her story. From that time she began repeating, ""Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun,"" and would say nothing else. Even as she sat and ate her food she kept saying, ""Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun."" Her father used to get quite vexed with her. ""Who is this Majnun? who ever heard of this Majnun?"" he would say."
"""He is the man I am to marry,"" said Laili. ""Khuda has ordered me to marry no one but Majnun."" And she was half mad."
"Meanwhile, Majnun and Husain Mahamat came to hunt in the Phalana country; and as they were riding about, Laili came out on her horse to eat the air, and rode behind them. All the time she kept saying, ""Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun."" The prince heard her, and turned round. ""Who is calling me?"" he asked. At this Laili looked at him, and the moment she saw him she fell deeply in love with him, and she said to herself, ""I am sure that is the Prince Majnun that Khuda says I am to marry."" And she went home to her father and said, ""Father, I wish to marry the prince who has come to your kingdom; for I know he is the Prince Majnun I am to marry."""
"""Very well, you shall have him for your husband,"" said Munsuk Raja."
"""We will ask him to-morrow."" Laili consented to wait, although she was very impatient. As it happened, the prince left the Phalana kingdom that night, and when Laili heard he was gone, she went quite mad. She would not listen to a word her father, or her mother, or her servants said to her, but went off into the jungle, and wandered from jungle to jungle, till she got farther and farther away from her own country."
"All the time she kept saying, ""Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun;"" and so she wandered about for twelve years."
"At the end of the twelve years she met a fakir he was really an angel, but she did not know this who asked her, ""Why do you always say, 'Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun'?"" She answered, ""I am the daughter of the king of the Phalana country, and I want to find Prince Majnun; tell me where his kingdom is."""
"""I think you will never get there,"" said the fakir, ""for it is very far from hence, and you have to cross many rivers to reach it."" But Laili said she did not care; she must see Prince Majnun. ""Well,"" said the fakir, ""when you come to the Bhagirathi river you will see a big fish, a Rohu; and you must get him to carry you to Prince Majnun's country, or you will never reach it."""
"She went on and on, and at last she came to the Bhagirathi river."
"There was a great big fish called the Rohu fish. It was yawning just as she got up to it, and she instantly jumped down its throat into its stomach. All the time she kept saying, ""Majnun, Majnun."" At this the Rohu fish was greatly alarmed and swam down the river as fast as he could. By degrees he got tired and went slower, and a crow came and perched on his back, and said ""Caw, caw."" ""Oh, Mr. Crow,"" said the poor fish ""do see what is in my stomach that makes such a noise."""
"""You could certainly do with a rivet or two, sir,"" said he. ""In fact, you want a good many."""
"""Well, get to work, then,"" said the dragon. ""You mend my wing, and then I'll go out and eat up all the town, and if you make a really smart job of it I'll eat you last. There!"""
"""I don't want to be eaten last, sir,"" said John."
"""Well then, I'll eat you first,"" said the dragon."
"""I don't want that, sir, either,"" said John."
"""Go on with you, you silly man,"" said the dragon, ""you don't know your own silly mind. Come, set to work."""
"""I don't like the job, sir,"" said John, ""and that's the truth. I know how easily accidents happen. It's all fair and smooth, and 'Please rivet me, and I'll eat you last' and then you get to work and you give a gentleman a bit of a nip or a dig under his rivets and then it's fire and smoke, and no apologies will meet the case."""
"""Upon my word of honor as a dragon,"" said the other."
"""I know you wouldn't do it on purpose, sir,"" said John, ""but any gentleman will give a jump and a sniff if he's nipped, and one of your sniffs would be enough for me. Now, if you'd just let me fasten you up?"""
"""It would be so undignified,"" objected the dragon."
"""We always fasten a horse up,"" said John, ""and he's the 'noble animal.'"""
"""It's all very well,"" said the dragon, ""but how do I know you'd untie me again when you'd riveted me? Give me something in pledge. What do you value most?"""
"""My hammer,"" said John. ""A blacksmith is nothing without a hammer."""
"""But you'd want that for riveting me. You must think of something else, and at once, or I'll eat you first."""
"At this moment the baby in the room above began to scream. Its mother had been so quiet that it thought she had settled down for the night, and that it was time to begin."
"""Whatever's that?"" said the dragon, starting so that every plate on his body rattled."
"""It's only the baby,"" said John."
"""What's that?"" asked the dragon. ""Something you value?"""
"""Well, yes, sir, rather,"" said the blacksmith."
"""Then bring it here,"" said the dragon, ""and I'll take care of it till you've done riveting me, and you shall tie me up."""
"""All right, sir,"" said John, ""but I ought to warn you. Babies are poison to dragons, so I don't deceive you. It's all right to touch but don't you go putting it into your mouth. I shouldn't like to see any harm come to a nice-looking gentleman like you."""
"The dragon purred at this compliment and said: ""All right, I'll be careful. Now go and fetch the thing, whatever it is."""
"So John ran up the steps as quickly as he could, for he knew that if the dragon got impatient before it was fastened, it could heave up the roof of the dungeon with one heave of its back, and kill them all in the ruins. His wife was asleep, in spite of the baby's cries; and John picked up the baby and took it down and put it between the dragon's front paws."
"""You just purr to it, sir,"" he said, ""and it'll be as good as gold."""
"So the dragon purred, and his purring pleased the baby so much that it stopped crying."
"Then John rummaged among the heap of old iron and found there some heavy chains and a great collar that had been made in the days when men sang over their work and put their hearts into it, so that the things they made were strong enough to bear the weight of a thousand years, let alone a dragon."
"John fastened the dragon up with the collar and the chains, and when he had padlocked them all on safely he set to work to find out how many rivets would be needed."
"""Six, eight, ten twenty, forty,"" said he. ""I haven't half enough rivets in the shop. If you'll excuse me, sir, I'll step around to another forge and get a few dozen. I won't be a minute."""
"And off he went, leaving the baby between the dragon's fore-paws, laughing and crowing with pleasure at the very large purr of it."
"John ran as hard as he could into the town, and found the mayor and corporation."
"""There's a dragon in my dungeon,"" he said; ""I've chained him up. Now come and help to get my baby away."""
"""What would I have done without your help?"" she said. ""I was so dreadfully frightened. Don't you see how my paws are shaking still?"" And she held out the prettiest little paws imaginable for him to see."
"Then Mr. Red Squirrel's heart began to thump very fast and hard beneath the white fur of his chest, and he sighed softly. ""I wish I might always help you and protect you,"" he said; ""but I suppose there are better fellows than I who want to do that."" And he sighed again."
"""Yes, they might want to,"" she said, looking away from him and acting as though she saw another Blue Jay coming."
"""You wouldn't be my little wife, would you?"" he asked, coming nearer to her."
"""Why I might!"" she answered, with a saucy flirt of her tail, and she scampered away as fast as she could. Do you think Mr. Red Squirrel stopped then to eat his fat kernel of yellow corn? Or do you think he waited to see whether the Blue Jays were around? No, indeed! He followed as fast as his legs could carry him from tree to tree, from branch to branch, and it was not until he had reached the top of a tall beech that he overtook his little sweetheart. They were still there when the Gray Squirrel happened along in the afternoon."
"""Ah!"" said he, squinting at Mr. Red Squirrel, for his eyes were poor."
"""You are getting acquainted, are you? Pleasant society here. The Squirrel set is very select. You must meet some of our young people."
"Suppose you will begin housekeeping one of these days?"""
"""I have done so already, sir,"" answered Mr. Red Squirrel, although his wife was nudging him with one paw and motioning him to keep quiet. ""Mrs."
"Red Squirrel and I will build our round home in the top fork of this tree. We shall be pleased to have you call when we are settled."""
"""Is that so?"" exclaimed the Gray Squirrel. ""I did not know that you were married. I thought you came alone to the forest."""
"""This is my wife, sir,"" said Mr. Red Squirrel, and the Gray Squirrel made his very best bow and looked at her as sharply as his poor eyes would let him."
"""I think I must have seen you somewhere,"" he said; ""your face is very familiar."" And he scratched his poor old puzzled head with one claw."
"""Why, Cousin Gray Squirrel, don't you know Bushy-tail?"" she cried. ""You lived the next tree to mine all winter."""
"""To be sure!"" he exclaimed. ""But isn't your marriage rather sudden?"""
"""No,"" she said, blushing under her fur. ""We have always liked each other, although we never spoke until this morning. I used to scamper along the rail fence to see Mr. Red Squirrel in his cage."""
"""Did you truly come for that?"" asked her husband, after their caller had gone."
"""I truly did,"" she answered, ""but I never expected anybody to know it."
"You poor fellow! I felt so sorry for you. I would have given every nut I had to set you free."""
"They were a very happy couple, and the next fall the Gray Squirrel watched them and their children gathering nuts for their winter stores."
"Mr. Red Squirrel, as the head of the family, planned the work, yet each did his share. The nuts were not yet ripe, and they gnawed off the stems, then came to the ground, filled their cheek-pockets with the fallen nuts, and scampered off to hide them in many places. They were stored in tree-hollows, under the rustling leaves which strewed the ground, in the cracks of old logs, beneath brush-heaps, and in holes in the ground."
"""Don't stop to think how many you need,"" said the little mother to her children. ""Get every nut you can. It may be a very long winter."""
"""And if you don't eat them all,"" said their hard-working father with a twinkle in his eyes, ""you may want to drop a few down to some poor fellow who has none. That was your mother's way."""
"""When was it her way? What makes you smile when you say it? Mother, what does he mean?"" cried the young Red Squirrels all in a breath."
"""I gave some nuts to a hungry Squirrel once,"" she said, ""and he was so grateful that he drove the Blue Jays away when they tried to rob me."""
"But she looked so happy as she spoke that the children knew there was more to the story. They dared not tease her to tell, so they whispered among themselves and wondered what their father meant."
"As they gathered nuts near the Gray Squirrel, he motioned them to come close. ""S-sh!"" said he. ""Don't tell it from me, but I think the poor hungry fellow was your father, and it was a lucky thing for you that she had enough to give away."""
"""Do you suppose that was it?"" the young Red Squirrels whispered to each other. ""Do you really suppose so?"""
THE BIGGEST LITTLE RABBIT LEARNS TO SEE
"Seven little Rabbits lay on their nest at the bottom of the burrow, and wriggled and squirmed and pushed their soft noses against each other all day long. Life was very easy for them, and they were contented. The first thing that they remembered was lying on their bed of fur, hay, and dried leaves, and feeling a great, warm, soft Something close beside them. After a while they learned that this Something was their Mamma Rabbit. It was she who had gotten the nest ready for them and lined it with fur that she tore from her own breast. She didn't care so much about looking beautiful as she did about making her babies comfortable."
"It was their Mamma Rabbit, too, who fed them with warm milk from her own body until they should be old enough to go out of the burrow. Then they would nibble bark and tender young shoots from the roots of the trees, and all the fresh, green, growing things that Rabbits like. She used to tell them about this food, and they wondered and wondered how it would taste. They began to feel very big and strong now. The soft fur was growing on their naked little bodies and covering even the soles of their feet. It was growing inside their cheeks, too, and that made them feel important, for Papa Rabbit said that he did not know any other animals that had fur inside their cheeks. He said it was something to be very proud of, so they were very proud, although why one should want fur inside of one's cheeks it would be hard to say."
"The Rattlesnake, for it was he, raised his head to look at the bird. The young Blue Jay saw that his eyes were very bright. He looked right into them, and could see little pictures of himself upon their shining surfaces. He stood still to look, and the Rattlesnake came nearer. Then the young Blue Jay tried to see his tail, but he couldn't look away from the Rattlesnake's eyes, though he tried ever so hard."
"The Rattlesnake now coiled up his body, flattened out his head, and showed his teeth, while all the time his queer forked tongue ran in and out of his mouth. Then the young Blue Jay tried to move and found that he couldn't. All he could do was to stand there and watch those glowing eyes and listen to the song which the Rattlesnake began to sing:"
"""Through grass and fern,   With many a turn,     My shining body I draw."
"In woodland shade   My home is made,     For this is the Forest Law."
"""Whoever tries   To look in my eyes     Comes near to my poisoned jaw;   And birds o'erbold   I charm and hold,     For this is the Forest Law."""
"The Rattlesnake drew nearer and nearer, and the young Blue Jay was shaking with fright, when there was a rustle of wings, and his father and mother flew down and around the Rattlesnake, screaming loudly to all the other Jays, and making the Snake turn away from the helpless little bird he had been about to strike. It was a long time before the forest was quiet again, and when it was, the Blue Jay family were safely in their nest, and the Rattlesnake had gone home without his supper."
"After the young Blue Jay got over his fright, he began to complain because he had not seen the Rattlesnake's tail. Then, indeed, his patient mother gave him such a scolding as he had never had in all his life, and his father said that he deserved a sound pecking for his foolishness."
"When the young Blue Jay showed that he was sorry for all the trouble that he had made, his parents let him have some supper and go to bed; but not until he had learned two sayings which he was always to remember. And these were the sayings: ""A really brave bird dares to be afraid of some things,"" and, ""If you go near enough to see the tail of a danger, you may be struck by its head."""
THE RED SQUIRRELS BEGIN HOUSEKEEPING
"The first thing that Mr. Red Squirrel did after coming to the forest and meeting the Gray Squirrel was to look for something to eat. It was not a good season for a stranger who had no hidden store of nuts and seeds to draw upon. The apples and corn were not ripe, and last year's seeds and acorns were nearly gone. What few remained here and there had lost their sweet and wholesome taste. Poor Mr. Red Squirrel began to wish that he had eaten breakfast before he ran away. He even went to the edge of the forest and looked over toward the farmhouse, where his open cage hung in the sunshine. He knew that there were nuts and a fresh bit of fruit inside of it, and his mouth watered at the thought of them, but he was a sensible young fellow, and he knew that if he went back to eat, the cage door would be snapped shut, and he would never again be free to scamper in the beautiful trees."
"""I will starve first!"" he said to himself, and he was so much in earnest that he spoke quite loudly."
"The words were hardly out of his mouth when ""Pft!"" a fat acorn came down at his feet. He caught it up with his forepaws before looking around. It was smooth and glossy, not at all as though it had passed a long winter on an oak branch. He took a good nibble at it and then looked up to see if there were more on the tree above him. You can think how surprised he was to find himself sitting beneath a maple, for in all the years since the world began no maple has ever borne acorns."
"""There are no more to come,"" he said. ""I must take small bites and make it last as long as I can."" And he turned it around and around, clutching it tightly with his long, crooked claws, so that not the tiniest bit could be lost. At last it was all eaten, not a crumb was left, and then ""Pft!"" down came a walnut. This hit him squarely on the back, but he was too hungry to mind, and he ate it all, just stopping long enough to say:"
"""If this maple bears such fruit as acorns and walnuts, I should like to live in a maple grove."""
"Next came a hazelnut, then a butternut, and last of all a fat kernel of yellow corn. He knew now that some friend was hidden in the branches above, so he tucked the corn in one of his cheek-pockets, and scampered up the maple trunk to find out who it was. He saw a whisking reddish-brown tail, and knew that some other Red Squirrel was there. But whoever it was did not mean to be caught, and such a chase as he had!"
"Just as he thought he had overtaken his unknown friend, he could see nothing more of her, and he was almost vexed to think how careless he must have been to miss her. He ran up and down the tree on which he last saw her, and found a little hollow in one of its large branches. He looked in, and there she was, the same dainty creature whom he had so often watched from his cage. He could see that she was breathless from running so fast, yet she pretended to be surprised at seeing him."
"Perhaps she now thought that she had been too bold in giving him food, and so wanted him to think that it had been somebody else."
"""Good morning!"" said he. ""Thank you very much for your kindness."""
"""What do you mean?"" said she."
"""As though you didn't know!"" he answered. ""I never heard of a maple tree that bore acorns, nuts, and corn, and that in the springtime."""
"""Oh, well,"" said she, tossing her pretty head, ""you have lived in a cage and may not know what our forest trees can do."""
"That was a rather saucy thing to say, but Mr. Red Squirrel knew her kind heart and that she said it only in mischief. ""How do you know I have lived in a cage?"" he asked."
"""I I thought you looked like the Squirrel at the farmhouse,"" she said; and then forgetting herself, she added, ""You did look so surprised when that walnut hit you."""
"""Where were you then?"" he asked quickly."
"""Oh! I was on a branch above you,"" she answered, seeing that he now knew all about it. ""You looked so hungry, and I had plenty of food stored away. You may have some whenever you wish. It must have been dreadful in that cage."""
"Now Mr. Red Squirrel had loved his little friend ever since the first time he saw her on the rail fence, but he had never thought she would care for him a tired, discouraged fellow, who had passed such a sorrowful life in prison. Yet when he heard her pitying words, and saw the light in her tender eyes, he wondered if he could win her for his wife."
"""I shall never be able to do anything for you,"" said he. ""You are young and beautiful and know the forest ways. I am a stranger and saddened by my hard life. I wish I could help you."""
"""The Blue Jays! The Blue Jays!"" she cried, starting up. ""They have found my hidden acorns and are eating them."""
"And sure enough, a pair of those handsome robbers were pulling acorn after acorn out of a tree-hollow near by, and eating them as fast as they could. You should have seen Mr. Red Squirrel then! He leaped from branch to branch until he reached the Blue Jays; then he stood by the hole where the acorns were stored, and scolded them."
"""Chickaree-chickaree-quilch-quilch-chickaree-chickaree!"" he said; and that in the Red Squirrel language is a very severe scolding. He jumped about with his head down and his tail jerking, while his eyes gleamed like coals of fire. The Blue Jays made a great fuss and called ""Jay!"
"Jay!"" at him, and made fun of him for being a stranger, but they left at last, and Mr. Red Squirrel turned to his friend."
"So the next afternoon, quite early, long before the beams of sunset announced the coming night, when everybody would be up and working, the two children got out of bed. Effie wrapped herself in a shawl of dragonproof muslin there was no time to make the frock and Harry made a horrid mess of himself with the patent dragon poison. It was warranted harmless to infants and invalids, so he felt quite safe."
"Then they joined hands and set out to walk to St. George's Church. As you know, there are many St. George's churches, but fortunately they took the turning that leads to the right one, and went along in the bright sunlight, feeling very brave and adventurous."
"There was no one about in the streets except dragons, and the place was simply swarming with them. Fortunately none of the dragons were just the right size for eating little boys and girls, or perhaps this story might have had to end here. There were dragons on the pavement, and dragons on the roadway, dragons basking on the front doorsteps of public buildings, and dragons preening their wings on the roofs in the hot afternoon sun."
"The town was quite green with them. Even when the children had gotten out of the town and were walking in the lanes, they noticed that the fields on each side were greener than usual with the scaly legs and tails; and some of the smaller sizes had made themselves asbestos nests in the flowering hawthorn hedges."
"Effie held her brother's hand very tight, and once when a fat dragon flopped against her ear she screamed out, and a whole flight of green dragons rose from the field at the sound, and sprawled away across the sky. The children could hear the rattle of their wings as they flew."
"""Oh, I want to go home,"" said Effie."
"""Don't be silly,"" said Harry. ""Surely you haven't forgotten about the Seven Champions and all the princes. People who are going to be their country's deliverers never scream and say they want to go home."""
"""And are we,"" asked Effie ""deliverers, I mean?"""
"""You'll see,"" said her brother, and on they went."
"When they came to St. George's Church they found the door open, and they walked right in but St. George was not there, so they walked around the churchyard outside, and presently they found the great stone tomb of St."
"George, with the figure of him carved in marble outside, in his armor and helmet, and with his hands folded on his breast."
"""How ever can we wake him?"" they said. Then Harry spoke to St."
"George but he would not answer; and he called, but St. George did not seem to hear; and then he actually tried to waken the great dragon-slayer by shaking his marble shoulders. But St. George took no notice."
"Then Effie began to cry, and she put her arms around St. George's neck as well as she could for the marble, which was very much in the way at the back, and she kissed the marble face, and she said: ""Oh, dear, good, kind St. George, please wake up and help us."""
"And at that St. George opened his eyes sleepily, and stretched himself and said: ""What's the matter, little girl?"""
So the children told him all about it; he turned over in his marble and leaned on one elbow to listen. But when he heard that there were so many dragons he shook his head.
"""It's no good,"" he said, ""they would be one too many for poor old George. You should have waked me before. I was always for a fair fight one man one dragon, was my motto."""
"Just then a flight of dragons passed overhead, and St. George half drew his sword."
But he shook his head again and pushed the sword back as the flight of dragons grew small in the distance.
"""I can't do anything,"" he said. ""Things have changed since my time. St."
"Andrew told me about it. They woke him up over the engineers' strike, and he came to talk to me. He says everything is done by machinery now; there must be some way of settling these dragons. By the way, what sort of weather have you been having lately?"""
"This seemed so careless and unkind that Harry would not answer, but Effie said patiently, ""It has been very fine. Father says it is the hottest weather there has ever been in this country."""
"""Ah, I guessed as much,"" said the Champion, thoughtfully. ""Well, the only thing would be ... dragons can't stand wet and cold, that's the only thing. If you could find the taps."""
St. George was beginning to settle down again on his stone slab.
"""Good night, very sorry I can't help you,"" he said, yawning behind his marble hand."
"""Oh, but you can,"" cried Effie. ""Tell us what taps?"""
"""Oh, like in the bathroom,"" said St. George, still more sleepily. ""And there's a looking glass, too; shows you all the world and what's going on. St. Denis told me about it; said it was a very pretty thing. I'm sorry I can't good night."""
And he fell back into his marble and was fast asleep again in a moment.
"""We shall never find the taps,"" said Harry. ""I say, wouldn't it be awful if St. George woke up when there was a dragon near, the size that eats champions?"""
"Effie pulled off her dragonproof veil. ""We didn't meet any the size of the dining room as we came along,"" she said. ""I daresay we shall be quite safe."""
"So she covered St. George with the veil, and Harry rubbed off as much as he could of the dragon poison onto St. George's armor, so as to make everything quite safe for him."
"""We might hide in the church till it is dark,"" he said, ""and then """
"said the stranger, in his sweetest way; ""but who is the Moth who is punishing him that queer-looking one with a crooked feeler?"""
"""Sir,"" said she, moving farther from him, ""he is a friend of mine, and I do not think it matters to you if he is queer-looking."""
"""Oh!"" said the stranger. ""Oh! oh! oh! You have a bad temper, haven't you? But you are very good-looking in spite of that."" There is no telling what he would have said next, for at this minute Miss Cecropia's friend heard the mean things he was saying, and flew against him."
"It was not long before this stranger also was punished, and then the Moth with the crooked feeler turned to the others. ""Do any of you want to try it?"" he said. ""You must understand that you cannot be rude before her."" And he pointed his right fore leg at Miss Cecropia as she sat trembling on the branch."
"""Her!"" they cried mockingly, as they flew away. ""There are prettier Moths than she. We don't care anything for her."""
"Miss Cecropia's friend would have gone after them to punish them for this impoliteness, but she clung to him and begged him not to. ""You will be killed, I know you will,"" she sobbed. ""And then what will become of me?"""
"""Would you miss me?"" he asked, as he felt of one of his wings, now broken and bare."
"""Yes,"" she cried. ""You are the best friend I have. Please don't go."""
"""But I am such a homely fellow,"" he said. ""I don't see how you can like me since I broke my wing."""
"""Well, I do like you,"" she said. ""Your wing isn't much broken after all, and I like your crooked feeler. It is so different from anybody else's."" Miss Cecropia looked very happy as she spoke, and she quite forgot how she once decided to go away from him. There are some people, you know, who can change their minds in such a sweet and easy way that we almost love them the better for it. One certainly could love Miss Cecropia for this, because it showed that she had learned to care more for a warm heart and courage than for whole wings and straight feelers."
"Mr. Cecropia did not live long after this, unfortunately, but they were very, very happy together, and she often said to her friends, as she laid her eggs in the best places, ""I only hope that when my Caterpillar babies are grown and have come out of their chrysalides, they may be as good and as brave as their father was."""
THE BEES AND THE KINGBIRD
"There was in the forest a great hollow tree where for years a swarm of Bees had made their home. To look at it in winter, one would never guess what a store of honey was sealed up within, but in summer the Bees were always passing in and out, and it was indeed a busy place. Then the Workers had to gather honey and build the cells and look out for the Queen-Mother's many babies. The Queen-Mother had so much care of her eggs that she could really do nothing but attend to them. After they were ready in their cells, the Workers took care of them, and tucked in a lot of bread for the babies to eat when they were hatched. Then there was the bread-making to be done also, and all the Workers helped bring the pollen, or flower-dust, out of which it was made."
"The Drones didn't do anything, not a thing, not a single thing, unless it were taking care of the Queen when she flew away from the tree. They had done that once, but it was long ago, before she had laid an egg and while she was still quite young. They were handsome great fellows, all black and gold, and if you didn't know about them, you might have thought them the pleasantest Bees in the tree. Of course you would not care for them after finding how lazy they were, for people are never liked just because they are fine-looking."
"The Drones always found some excuse for being idle, and like many other lazy people they wanted the busy ones to stop and visit with them. ""What is the hurry?"" they would say. ""There will be more honey that you can get to-morrow. Stop a while now."""
"But the Workers would shake their brown heads and buzz impatiently as they answered, ""We can get to-morrow's honey when to-morrow comes, but to-day's honey must be gathered to-day."""
"Then the Drones would grumble and say that they didn't see the sense of storing up so much honey anyway. That also was like lazy people the world over, for however much they scold about getting the food, they are sure to eat just as much as anybody else. Sometimes lazy people eat even more than others, and pick for the best too."
"On cloudy days, the Workers did stay at home in the tree, but not to play. They clung to the walls and to each other and made wax. It took much patience to make wax. When they were gathering honey there was so much that was interesting to be seen, and so many friends to meet, that it was really quite exciting; but when they made wax they had to hang for a long, long time, until the wax gathered in flakes over their bodies. Then it was ready to scrape off and shape into six-sided cells to hold honey or to be homes for the babies."
One sunshiny morning the Queen-Mother stopped laying her eggs and cried:
"""Listen! did you hear that?"""
"""What?"" asked the Workers, crowding around her."
"""Why, that noise,"" she said. ""It sounded like a bird calling 'Kyrie!"
"K-y-rie!' and I thought I heard a Worker buzzing outside a minute ago, but no one has come in. I am afraid "" and here she stopped."
"""Of what are you afraid!"" asked the Drones, who, having nothing to do but eat and sleep, were always ready to talk about anything and everything. The great trouble with them was that if you once began to talk they did not like to have you leave and go to work."
"""Why,"" said the Queen-Mother, ""I don't want to alarm you, but I thought it was a Kingbird."""
"""Well, what if it was?"" said a big Drone. ""There is only one of him and there are a great many of us."""
"""Yes,"" said the Queen-Mother, ""but there may not be so many of us very long if he begins to watch the tree. I have lived much longer than you and I know how Kingbirds act."""
"This was true, for Queens live to be very old, and Drones never live long because they are so lazy."
"""Well,"" said the big Drone, ""we must find out about this. Just fly around and see if it is a Kingbird,"" he said to a Worker. ""We must know about things before we act."""
"""Suppose you should go,"" she replied. ""I have my leg-pockets full of pollen, and it ought to be made into bread at once. I never saw Larvæ so hungry as these last ones are."""
"""I only wish that I could go,"" said the big Drone, limping as he got out of her way; ""but my fifth foot just stepped on my third foot, and I can hardly move."""
THE UNDECIDED RATTLESNAKE
"It is not often that one of the Forest People has any trouble about making up his mind, but there was one large Rattlesnake who had great difficulty in doing so. She lived in the southern edge of the forest, where the sunshine was clear and warm, and there were delightful crevices among the rocks in which she and all her friends and relatives could hide."
"It seemed very strange that so old a Snake should be so undecided as she was. It must be that she had a careless mother who did not bring her up in the right way. If that were so, one should indeed be sorry for her."
"Still even that would be no real excuse, for was she not old enough now to train herself? She had seven joints in the rattle on her tail and an eighth one growing, so you can see that she was no longer young, although, being healthy, she had grown her new joints and changed her skin oftener than some of her friends. In fact, she had grown children of her own, and if it had not been that they took after their father, they would have been a most helpless family. Fortunately for them, their father was a very decided Snake."
"Yes, it was exceedingly lucky for them. It may not have been so good a thing for him. His wife was always glad to have things settled for her, and when he said, ""We will do this,"" she answered, ""Yes, dear."" When he said, ""We will not do that,"" she murmured, ""No, dear."" And when he said, ""What shall we do?"" she would reply, ""Oh, I don't know. What do you think we might better do?"" He did not very often ask her opinion, and there were people in the forest who said he would never have talked matters over with her if he had not known that she would leave the decision to him."
"Now this is a bad way in which to have things go in any family, and it happened here as it would anywhere. He grew more and more selfish from having his own way all of the time, and his wife became less and less able to take care of herself. Most people thought him a very devoted husband. Perhaps he was. It is easy to be a devoted husband if you always have your own way."
"One night Mr. Rattlesnake did not return to their home. Nobody ever knew what had become of him. The Red Squirrel said that Mrs. Goldfinch said that the biggest little Rabbit had told her that the Ground Hog had overheard Mr. Crow say that he thought he saw somebody that looked like Mr. Rattlesnake chasing a Field Mouse over toward the farm, but that he might have been mistaken. This was all so uncertain that Mrs."
Rattlesnake knew no more than she had known before. It was very trying.
"""If I only knew positively,"" she said to her friend, Mrs. Striped Snake, ""I could do something, although I am sure I don't know what it would be."""
"Mrs. Striped Snake tried to help her. ""Why not have one of your children come home to live with you?"" she said pleasantly, for this year's children were now old enough to shift for themselves."
"""I've thought of that,"" answered Mrs. Rattlesnake, ""but I like a quiet life, and you know how it is. Young Snakes will be young Snakes."
"Besides, I don't think they would want to come back."""
"""Well, why not be alone, then?"""
"""Oh, it is so lonely,"" replied Mrs. Rattlesnake, with a sigh."
"""Everything reminds me so of my husband, and that makes me sad. If I lived somewhere else it would be different."""
"""Then why not move?"" said Mrs. Striped Snake, briskly. ""I would do that."
"Find a nice crack in the rock just big enough for one, or make a cosy little hole in the ground somewhere near here. Then if he comes back he can find you easily. I would do that. I certainly would."""
"She spoke so firmly that Mrs. Rattlesnake said she would, she would to-morrow. And her friend went home thinking it was all settled. That shows how little she really knew Mrs. Rattlesnake."
"The more Mrs. Rattlesnake thought it over that night, the more she dreaded moving. ""If he does not come back,"" she sighed, ""I may marry again in the spring, and then I might have to move once more. I believe I will ask somebody else what I ought to do."""
"So in the morning she began to consult her friends. They all told her to move, and she decided to do it. Then she could not make up her mind whether to take a rock-crevice or make a hole in the ground. It took another day of visiting to settle that it should be a hole in the ground. A fourth day was spent in finding just the right place for her home, and on the fifth day she began work."
"By the time the sun was over the tree-tops, she wished she had chosen some other place, and thought best to stop and talk to some of her friends about it. When she returned she found herself obliged to cast her skin, which had been growing tight and dry for some time. This was hard work, and she was too tired to go on with her home-making, so she lay in the sunshine and admired her beautiful, long, and shining body of reddish brown spotted with black. Her rattle had eight joints now, for when a Rattlesnake casts the old skin a new joint is always uncovered at the end of the tail. She waved it quickly to see how an eight-jointed rattle would sound. ""Lovely!"" she said. ""Lovely! Like the seeds of the wild cucumber shaking around in their dry and prickly case."""
"One could not tell all the things that happened that fall, or how very, very, very tired her friends became of having her ask their advice. She changed her mind more times than there are seeds in a milkweed pod, and the only thing of which she was always sure was eating. When there was food in sight she did not stop for anybody's advice. She ate it as fast as she could, and if she had any doubts about the wisdom of doing so, she kept them to herself."
"When winter came she had just got her new home ready, and after all she went when invited to spend the winter with a cave party of other Snakes."
"They coiled themselves together in a great mass and slept there until spring. As the weather grew warmer, they began to stir, wriggling and twisting themselves free."
Two bachelor Snakes asked her to marry. One was a fine old fellow with a twelve-jointed rattle. The other was just her own age.
"""To be sure I will,"" she cried, and the pits between her nostrils and her ears looked more like dimples than ever. ""Only you must wait until I can make up my mind which one to marry."""
"""Oh, no,"" they answered, ""don't go to all that trouble. We will fight and decide it for you."""
"It was a long fight, and the older of the two Snakes had a couple of joints broken off from his rattle before it was over. Still he beat the other one and drove him away. When he came back for his bride he found her crying. ""What is the matter?"" said he, quite sternly."
"""Oh, that p-poor other b-bachelor!"" she sobbed. ""I b-believe I will g-go after him. I think p-perhaps I l-love him the b-better."""
"""No, you don't, Mrs. Rattlesnake,"" said the fine old fellow who had just won the fight. ""You will do no such thing. You will marry me and never speak to him again. When I have lost two joints of my rattle in fighting for you, I intend to have you myself, and I say that you love me very dearly. Do you hear?"""
"""Yes, darling,"" she answered, as she wiped her eyes on the grass, ""very dearly."" And they lived most happily together."
"""He reminds me so much of the first Mr. Rattlesnake,"" she said to her friends. ""So strong, so firm, so quick to decide!"""
"The next day it rained, and the next, and the next. Mrs. Goldfinch did not dare leave her nest to make calls, lest the cold raindrops should chill and hurt the four tiny birds that lay curled up in their shells."
"At last the weather was warm and sunshiny, and Mrs. Goldfinch and some of her bird neighbors went to call on Mrs. Mourning Dove. They found her just coming from a wheat-field, where she had been to get grain. ""Oh, you poor creature!"" they cried. ""We have heard all about it. Your poor babies! How sorry we are for you!"""
"Mrs. Mourning Dove looked from one to another as though she did not know what to make of it. ""What do you mean?"" she cooed. ""My babies are well and doing finely. Won't you come to see them?"""
"Then it was the turn of the other birds to be surprised. ""Why,"" they chirped, ""we heard that your eggs had fallen through your nest and had broken and killed the tiny Dove babies inside. Is it true?"""
"""Not a word of it,"" answered Mrs. Mourning Dove. ""The nest is all right, and the eggs were not broken until my two little darlings broke them with their sharp beaks."""
"""Here they are,"" she added, fondly. ""Did you ever see such pretty ones?"
"See him open his bill, the dear! And did you ever see such a neck as she has? Mr. Mourning Dove thinks there never were such children."""
"""But do you feel perfectly safe to leave them in that nest?"" asked the Oriole politely. ""My babies are so restless that I should be afraid to trust them in it."""
"""That is what people always say,"" answered Mrs. Mourning Dove, with a happy coo, ""and I fear that I am a rather poor housekeeper, but it runs in our family. Mr. Mourning Dove and I have raised many pairs of children, and they never rolled out, or tumbled through, or blew away, and I do not worry about these. I shall never be thrifty like you good builders, perhaps, but I'm sure you cannot love your little ones any more than I do mine. It was very kind of you to be so sorry for me when you heard I was in trouble. I think I have the best neighbors in the world."""
"When her callers went away, they could not say enough about Mrs."
"Mourning Dove's pleasant ways, and her gentle, well-behaved children."
"""It is too bad she is such a poor nest-maker,"" the Vireo said, ""and I understand now what she meant when she told me that they sometimes used old Robins' nests for their young. She said they flattened them out and added a few twigs, and that they did finely. I thought it very queer in them to do so, but perhaps if I had not been a good builder I should have done the same thing."""
"""Perhaps we all would,"" the others agreed. ""She certainly is a very pleasant bird, and she is bringing up her children well. Mr. Mourning Dove seems to think her perfect. We won't worry any more about her."""
THE YOUNG BLUE JAY WHO WAS NOT BRAVE ENOUGH TO BE AFRAID
Everybody who is acquainted with the Blue Jays knows that they are a very brave family. That is the best thing that you can say about them.
"To be sure, they dress very handsomely, and there is no prettier sight, on a fine winter morning, than a flock of Blue Jays flitting from branch to branch, dining off the acorns on the oak trees, and cocking their crested heads on one side as they look over the country. They are great talkers then, and are always telling each other just what to do; yet none of them ever do what they are told to, so they might just as well stop giving advice."
"The other people of the forest do not like the Blue Jays at all, and if one of them gets into trouble they will not help him out. This always has been so, and it always will be so. If it could be winter all the time, the Blue Jays could be liked well enough, for in cold weather they eat seeds and nuts and do not quarrel so much with others. It is in the summer that they become bad neighbors. Then they live in the thickest part of the woods and raise families of tiny, fuzzy babies in their great coarse nests. It is then, too, that they change their beautiful coats, and while the old feathers are dropping off and the new ones are growing they are not at all pretty. Oh, then is the time to beware of the Blue Jays!"
"They do very little talking during the summer, and the forest people do not know when they are coming, unless they see a flutter of blue wings among the branches. The Blue Jays have a reason for keeping still then."
"They are doing sly things, and they do not want to be found out."
The wee babies grow fast and their mouths are always open for more food.
"Father and Mother Blue Jay spend all their time in marketing, and they are not content with seeds and berries. They visit the nests of their bird neighbors, and then something very sad happens. When the Blue Jays go to a nest there may be four eggs in it; but when they go away there will not be any left, nothing but pieces of broken egg-shell. It is very, very sad, but this is another of the things which will always be so, and all that the other birds can do is to watch and drive the Jays away."
"There was once a young Blue Jay in the forest who was larger than his brothers and sisters, and kept crowding them toward the edge of the nest. When their father came with a bit of food for them, he would stretch his legs and flutter his wings and reach up for the first bite."
"And because he was the largest and the strongest, he usually got it."
"Sometimes, too, the first bite was so big that there was nothing left for anyone else to bite at. He was a very greedy fellow, and he had no right to take more than his share, just because he happened to be the first of the family to break open the shell, or because he grew fast."
"This same young Blue Jay used to brag about what he would do when he got out of the nest, and his mother told him that he would get into trouble if he were not careful. She said that even Blue Jays had to look out for danger."
"""Huh!"" said the young Blue Jay; ""who's afraid?"""
"""Now you talk like a bully,"" said Mother Blue Jay, ""for people who are really brave are always willing to be careful."""
"But the young Blue Jay only crowded his brothers and sisters more than usual, and thought, inside his foolish little pin-feathery head, that when he got a chance, he'd show them what courage was."
"After a while his chance came. All the small birds had learned to flutter from branch to branch, and to hop quite briskly over the ground."
"One afternoon they went to a part of the forest where the ground was damp and all was strange. The father and mother told their children to keep close together and they would take care of them; but the foolish young Blue Jay wanted a chance to go alone, so he hid behind a tree until the others were far ahead, and then he started off another way. It was great fun for a time, and when the feathered folk looked down at him he raised his crest higher than ever and thought how he would scare them when he was a little older."
"The young Blue Jay was just thinking about this when he saw something long and shining lying in the pathway ahead. He remembered what his father had said about snakes, and about one kind that wore rattles on their tails. He wondered if this one had a rattle, and he made up his mind to see how it was fastened on. ""I am a Blue Jay,"" he said to himself, ""and I was never yet afraid of anything."""
"“I must go out unto my maid, Who keeps my thoughts for me,”"
"And ran out and found Maid Maleen, “Girl, what didst thou say to the foot-bridge?”"
"“I said nothing but,"
"“Foot-bridge, do not break, I am not the true bride.”"
"“That costs thee thy life!” cried the bride, but she hurried into the room, and said, “I know now what I said to the foot-bridge,” and she repeated the words. “But what didst thou say to the church-door?” “To the church-door?” she replied; “I don’t talk to church-doors.” “Then thou art not the true bride.”"
"She went out and found Maid Maleen, and said, “Girl, what didst thou say to the church-door?”"
"“I said nothing but,"
"“Church-door, break not, I am not the true bride.”"
"“That will break thy neck for thee!” cried the bride, and flew into a terrible passion, but she hastened back into the room, and said, “I know now what I said to the church-door,” and she repeated the words."
“But where hast thou the jewel which I gave thee at the church-door?”
"“What jewel?” she answered; “thou didst not give me any jewel.” “I myself put it round thy neck, and I myself fastened it; if thou dost not know that, thou art not the true bride.” He drew the veil from her face, and when he saw her immeasurable ugliness, he sprang back terrified, and said, “How comest thou here? Who art thou?” “I am thy betrothed bride, but because I feared lest the people should mock me when they saw me out of doors, I commanded the scullery-maid to dress herself in my clothes, and to go to church instead of me.” “Where is the girl?” said he; “I want to see her, go and bring her here.” She went out and told the servants that the scullery-maid was an impostor, and that they must take her out into the court-yard and strike off her head. The servants laid hold of Maid Maleen and wanted to drag her out, but she screamed so loudly for help, that the King’s son heard her voice, hurried out of his chamber and ordered them to set the maiden free instantly. Lights were brought, and then he saw on her neck the gold chain which he had given her at the church-door. “Thou art the true bride,” said he, “who went with me to the church; come with me now to my room.” When they were both alone, he said, “On the way to church thou didst name Maid Maleen, who was my betrothed bride; if I could believe it possible, I should think she was standing before me thou art like her in every respect.” She answered, “I am Maid Maleen, who for thy sake was imprisoned seven years in the darkness, who suffered hunger and thirst, and has lived so long in want and poverty. To-day, however, the sun is shining on me once more. I was married to thee in the church, and I am thy lawful wife.” Then they kissed each other, and were happy all the days of their lives. The false bride was rewarded for what she had done by having her head cut off."
"The tower in which Maid Maleen had been imprisoned remained standing for a long time, and when the children passed by it they sang,"
"“Kling, klang, gloria."
Who sits within this tower?
"A King’s daughter, she sits within, A sight of her I cannot win, The wall it will not break, The stone cannot be pierced."
"Little Hans, with your coat so gay, Follow me, follow me, fast as you may.”"
The Lion and the Crane
The Bodhisatta was at one time born in the region of Himavanta as a white crane; now Brahmadatta was at that time reigning in Benares. Now it chanced that as a lion was eating meat a bone stuck in his throat.
"The throat became swollen, he could not take food, his suffering was terrible. The crane seeing him, as he was perched on a tree looking for food, asked, ""What ails thee, friend?"" He told him why. ""I could free thee from that bone, friend, but dare not enter thy mouth for fear thou mightest eat me."" ""Don't be afraid, friend, I'll not eat thee; only save my life."" ""Very well,"" says he, and caused him to lie down on his left side. But thinking to himself, ""Who knows what this fellow will do,"" he placed a small stick upright between his two jaws that he could not close his mouth, and inserting his head inside his mouth struck one end of the bone with his beak. Whereupon the bone dropped and fell out. As soon as he had caused the bone to fall, he got out of the lion's mouth, striking the stick with his beak so that it fell out, and then settled on a branch. The lion gets well, and one day was eating a buffalo he had killed. The crane thinking ""I will sound him,"" settled on a branch just over him, and in conversation spoke this first verse:"
"""A service have we done thee       To the best of our ability,     King of the Beasts! Your Majesty!"
"What return shall we get from thee?"""
In reply the Lion spoke the second verse:
"""As I feed on blood,       And always hunt for prey,     'Tis much that thou art still alive       Having once been between my teeth."""
Then in reply the crane said the two other verses:
"""Ungrateful, doing no good,       Not doing as he would be done by,     In him there is no gratitude,       To serve him is useless."
"""His friendship is not won       By the clearest good deed."
"Better softly withdraw from him,       Neither envying nor abusing."""
And having thus spoken the crane flew away.
"And when the great Teacher, Gautama the Buddha, told this tale, he used to add: ""Now at that time the lion was Devadatta the Traitor, but the white crane was I myself."""
"""Yes."""
"""Much?"""
"Kilshaw leant forward and answered, almost in a whisper,"
"""Five hundred on Friday night,"" and in spite of himself he avoided the"
Superintendent's shrewd eye. But that officer's business was not to pass
"moral judgments. Law is one thing, morality another."
"""Then the thing's as plain as a pikestaff. This Gaspard got to know"
"about the money, and murdered him to get it. We needn't look further for"
"a motive."""
"""I suppose all this will have to come out? I wonder if Gaspard knew who"
"Benham was?"""
"""It's not necessary to suppose that, unless we believe all Evans says."
"Certainly, if we trust Evans, Gaspard hinted designs on some one before"
he could have known Benyon had this money. Could he have known he was
"going to have it?"""
"""Benyon may have told him I had promised to help him."""
"""Well, sir, we must see about that. We shall want you at the inquest,"
"sir."""
"""I suppose you will, confound you! And I should think you'd want a"
"greater man than I am, too."""
The Superintendent looked grave.
(IN ABSENCE.)
I PASSED your street of many memories.
"A sunset, sombre pink, the flush"
"Of inner rose-leaves idle fingers crush,"
"Died softly, as the rose that dies."
"All the high heaven behind the roof lay thus,"
"Tenderly dying, touched with pain"
A little; standing there I saw again
The sunsets that were dear to us.
I knew not if ’twere bitter or more sweet
"To stand and watch the roofs, the sky."
"O bitter to be there and you not nigh,"
Yet this had been that blessed street.
"How the name thrilled me, there upon the wall!"
"There was the house, the windows there"
"Against the rosy twilight high and bare,"
The pavement-stones: I knew them all!
"Days that have been, days that have fallen cold!"
"I stood and gazed, and thought of you,"
Until remembrance sweet and mournful drew
Tears to eyes smiling as of old.
"So, sad and glad, your memory visibly"
"Alive within my eyes, I turned;"
"And, through a window, met two eyes that burned,"
"Tenderly questioning, on me."

"""We've simply got to make him laugh,"" I whispered to Tommy. ""It's a"
"matter of principle now!"""
"""Then wait till we have supper, and get him soused,"" my confederate"
"cautiously replied. ""That'll do it. But you'd better not drink much,"" he"
"added. ""How are the nerves this evening?"""
"""I've almost forgotten them,"" I answered."
But Tommy was persistent at times. Unknown to me he was now preparing a
report to wire the Mater.
"""Sleeping better?"" he asked."
"""Lots."""
"""Lying to me?"""
"""A little,"" I laughed outright. ""But honestly I'm in heaps better"
"shape!"""
"""Oh, I've seen you improving from day to day, but we want to put it over"
"right. So don't hit the asphalt too hard tonight."""
And in all justice to myself and my friendship to Tommy I really did not
intend to. What place was it that some one said is paved with good
intentions?

"It came plummeting out of the sky--a soundless, streaking, purple glow,"
"moving faster and faster until it ripped at the trees, crashed through"
them and struck sickeningly against a hill. Momentarily it flared
"brightly, then went out."
"It was not long after that the murders began--strange, inexplicable"
"deaths, all the victims found with their heads crushed as if their"
skulls had exploded outward.
"The trail of victims lead from Arkansas to Tennessee, to Kentucky,"
Illinois and Michigan--sixteen unrelated people who had only one thing
"in common: All of their brains were withered, as if sucked dry of their"
contents ...
"And somewhere wandered an evil stranger from another planet, his"
"personality expanding, his brain power increasing, preparing for the"
inevitable encounter that could make him master of the world!

"“Among ordinary honourable people one takes such things for granted,” he"
said.
"“Forgive me,” she said again, humbly."
But he could find no pity for her in his heart. She had wronged him past
redemption.
“How much truth was there in the newspaper story?” he asked coldly.
She told him rapidly what Amédée Bazouge had said concerning his attack
in the hospital and his subsequent stroke.
“So the man is wilfully killing himself with absinthe?” he said.
"“It appears so,” replied Yvonne with a shudder."
“Could you tell me what passed between you otherwise--in general terms?”
"he asked, after a short silence. “You explained your position? Or did"
"you leave him in ignorance, as you were going to leave me?”"
“I told him--of course. It was necessary. And he laughed--I thought to
"spare you, Everard.”"
"“Spare me, Yvonne?”"
"“Yes,” she said, simply, “I could have borne all the pain and fright"
of it alone--why should I have made you unhappy? And _he_ said he would
"never interfere with me, and I can trust his word. Why should I have"

"Captured in South Carolina in 1717. Tried at Charleston, and convicted of"
taking the _Turtle Dove_ and other vessels in the previous July. Hanged in
"June, 1717."
"MOODY, CAPTAIN CHRISTOPHER."
"A notorious pirate. Very active off the coast of Carolina, 1717, with two"
ships under his command. In 1722 was with Roberts on board the _Royal
"Fortune_, being one of his chief men or ""Lords."" Taken prisoner, and tried"
"at Cape Coast Castle, and hanged in chains at the age of 28."
MOORE. Gunner.
A gunner aboard Captain Kidd's ship the _Adventure_. When Kidd's mutinous
"crew were all for attacking a Dutch ship, Kidd refused to allow them to,"
"and Moore threatened the captain, who seized a bucket and struck Moore on"
"the head with it, the blow killing him. Kidd was perfectly justified in"
"killing this mutinous sailor, but eventually it was for this act that he"
was hanged in London.
"MORGAN, CAPTAIN."
"This pirate must not be confused with the buccaneer, Sir Henry Morgan."
"Little is known about him except that he was with Hamlin, the French"
"pirate, in 1683, off the coast of West Africa, and helped to take several"
Danish and English ships. Soon the pirates quarrelled over the division of
"their plunder and separated into two companies, the English following"
Captain Morgan in one of the prizes.

"me. Yes, madam, you may wince,' he continued bitterly, 'for you shall"
still be my wife; and when you are my wife we will talk of that.'
"'Never!' she said, with a brave face; but her heart beat wildly, and a"
mist rose before her eyes.
"He laughed. 'My legions are round me,' he said. 'Where are yours?'"
"'You are a gentleman,' she answered with an effort. 'You will let me"
go.'
'If I do not?'
'There are those who will know how to avenge me.'
"He laughed again. 'I do not know them, Countess,' he said"
"contemptuously. 'For Hesse Cassel, he has his hands full at Nuremberg,"
"and will be likely, when Wallenstein has done with him, to need help"
himself. The King of Sweden--the brightest morning ends soonest in
"rain--and he will end at Nuremberg. Bernhard of Weimar, Leuchtenstein,"
all the fanatics fall with him. Only the banner of the Free Companies
"stands and waves ever the wider. Be advised,' he continued grimly."
"'Bend, Countess, or I have the means to break you.'"
'Never!' she said.
"'So you say now,' he answered slowly. 'You will not say so in five"
"minutes. If you care nothing for yourself, have a care for your"
friends.'
"'You said I had none,' she retorted hoarsely."
“And there are superior things which are good for nothing.”
"“Will you come and take a drive with me, philosopher brother?”"
“Where?”
“Let’s go to the Villa Borghese. The carriage will be here in a moment.”
“All right. Let us go there.”
"A two-horse victoria with rubber tires was waiting at the door, and"
"Laura and Cæsar got in. The carriage went past the Treasury, and out"
"the Porta Salaria, and entered the gardens of the Villa Borghese."
The morning had been rainy; the ground was damp; the wind waved the
tree-tops gently and caused a murmur like the tide. The carriage rolled
slowly along the avenues. Laura was very gay and chatty. Cæsar listened
to her as one listens to a bird warbling.
Many times while listening he thought: “What is there inside this head?
"What is the master idea of her life? Has she really any idea about life,"
or has she none?”
After several rounds they crossed the viaduct that unites the Villa
Borghese with the Pincio gardens.
_FROM THE PINCIO TERRACE_
They approached the great terrace of the gardens by an avenue that has
busts of celebrated men along both sides.
Knee-deep in the water he tried to shout but he had no strength. A
"terrible faintness was creeping over him. His arms outstretched, he"
"stumbled forward toward the voices. Oh, he must _not_ yield to that"
overpowering sleepiness until he had made them know!
"""Help--help!"" he gasped, reeling toward the shadowy forms."
"""What the blazes--"" A man ran forward. Two others came at his heels."
"""Why, _it's Lav Green_!"" one of them cried."
"""The _Arabella_--adrift out there--Sidney's on it--oh--_help_! And then"
Lavender slipped into the strong arms that reached out to catch him.
"""Quick, the _Sally_! She's at Rockman's!"" Captain Davies ran toward"
"Rockman's wharf. Before Jed Starrow's men, concealed behind the shed"
"could guess their intention, three men had jumped into the big motor"
boat and had swung her free of the wharf.
"""What the hell--"" shouted an ugly voice after them, but the _Sally_"
only chugged out into the darkness of the bay.
*       *       *       *       *
"""Look, Sid--light! It's--it's--morning!"" Mart's voice came in a thin"
whisper. For a long time the girls had lain huddled against the
"taff-rail of the boat, too weary and disheartened to even talk."
Sidney lifted her face to the tiny streak of light that gleamed palely
in the east.
Then she shook Pola ever so slightly. Poor Pola had fallen into a sleep
"""I still should know you,"" answered Frances."
"""Not I!"" exclaimed Bettina."
"Presently Lilly came in, and I presented him to Monsieur l'Abbé du Boise"
and explained the presence of Frances and Bettina by saying:--
"""A friend of ours in France has asked Mistress Jennings to render what"
"aid she can to Monsieur l'Abbé, and she is here at my request to receive"
"his commands."""
"""It is good!"" exclaimed Lilly. ""She has the king's ear if any one has,"
and the ear is very close to the mind. What may I do to serve Monsieur
"l'Abbé?"""
"""If I may see you privately---the baron and me--I shall tell you how you"
"may serve me,"" answered the Abbé."
"The Abbé and I excused ourselves to Frances and Bettina, and went with"
"the Doctor to the room which he called his observatory, where we came to"
the point very quickly:--
"""I want to buy Dunkirk for my master for the sum of one hundred thousand"
"pounds,"" said the Abbé, by way of starting the consultation."
"""But London has already offered that sum,"" returned Lilly, ""and stands"
"ready to pay more."""
"""In payments,"" suggested the Abbé."
"""Yes,"" returned Lilly. ""But I see no way of bringing the king to accept"
"the sum you offer unless--unless Mistress Jennings can persuade him."""
"board H.M.S. _King Fisher_. Eventually he reached Bristol, where he"
"bought, with his share of booty, a horse and two pistols, with which to go"
on the highway.
"Hanged on June 17th, 1747, for stealing an old silver watch and 5s. from"
Mr. Francis Sleep at Dunstable.
"SKIPTON, CAPTAIN."
"Commanded a pirate ship, in which he sailed in company with Captain"
"Spriggs. Being chased by H.M.S. _Diamond_ off the coast of Cuba, Skipton"
"ran his sloop on to the Florida Reef. Escaping with his crew to an island,"
"they were attacked by the Indians, and many of them were captured and"
"eaten. The survivors, embarking in a canoe, were caught by the man-of-war"
and taken prisoner.
"SKYRM, CAPTAIN JAMES. Welsh pirate."
Hanged at the advanced age--for a pirate--of 44.
"Commanded the _Ranger_, one of Captain Roberts's ships that cruised in"
1721 and 1722 off the West Coast of Africa. In the fight with the King's
"ship that took him he was very active with a drawn sword in his hand, with"
which he beat any of his crew who were at all backward. One of his legs
"was shot away in this action, but he refused to leave the deck and go"
below as long as the action lasted. He was condemned to death and hanged
in chains.

THE POWER OF EVIL
"""You might call it a fight,"" Elizabeth said, ""but they never actually"
"laid a hand on each other."""
"Dr. Carew stared at her in puzzlement as she went on. ""They threw every"
"hard thing in the room at each other, without ever touching anything. It"
"was like some ghastly, murderous game. A clock flew through the air like"
"a cannonball, straight at Joseph's head, and some unseen force seemed to"
stop it. For a second it hung there and trembled in the air--_with
nothing under it_; then it turned and flew like lightning at Quincy; he
barely dodged it.
"""Finally a vase did find its mark and Quincy fell to the floor. Joseph"
"stepped over him and came toward me. I ran, slamming the door in his"
"face, locking him in. He laughed evilly and called after me, 'Why waste"
"time running away, Elizabeth? I'll come to get you, and you won't be"
"able to resist me now!'"""

thriller--

The Girl turned upon him with eyes flashing and retorted:
"""Well, it's my throat, ain't it?"""
"""Well I'll be!--"" The Sheriff's sentence was left unfinished, for Nick,"
"quickly pulling him to one side, whispered:"
"""Say, Rance, the Girl's cut up because she vouched for 'im. Don't rub it"
"in."""
"Notwithstanding, Rance, to the Girl's query of ""How did this Nina"
"Micheltoreña know it?"" took a keen delight in telling her:"
"""She's his girl."""
"""His girl?"" repeated the Girl, mechanically."
"""Yes. She gave us his picture,"" went on Rance; and taking the photograph"
"out of his pocket, he added maliciously, ""with love written on the back"
"of it."""
"A glance at the photograph, which she fairly snatched out of his hands,"
convinced the Girl of the truthfulness of his assertion. With a movement
"of pain she threw it upon the floor, crying out bitterly:"
"""Nina Micheltoreña! Nina Micheltoreña!"" Turning to Ashby with an abrupt"
"change of manner she said contritely: ""I'm sorry, Mr. Ashby, I vouched"
"for 'im."""
The Wells Fargo Agent softened at the note in the Girl's voice; he was
about to utter some comforting words to her when suddenly she spoke
Perhaps--perhaps we may have doubted the man somewhat over-hastily. But
"as for me, I will answer for La Giralda."""
"""For me,"" said El Sarria, sententiously, ""I will answer for no"
"woman--save only Dolóres Garcia!"""
Concha looked up quickly.
"""I also am a woman,"" she said, smiling."
"""And quite well able to answer for yourself, Señorita!"" returned El"
"Sarria, grimly."
For the answers of Ramon Garcia were not at all after the pattern set by
Rollo the Scot.
CHAPTER XXVII
THE SERGEANT AND LA GIRALDA
The dust-heat of the desolate plains of Old Castile was red on the
horizon when the Sergeant and his companion started together on their
"strange and perilous mission. Would they ever return, and when? What"
"might they not find? A Court deserted and forlorn, courtiers fleeing, or"
"eager to flee if only they knew whither, from the dread and terrible"
"plague? A Queen and a princess without guards, a palace open to the"
plunder of any chance band of robbers? For something like this the imp
of the deserted village had prepared them.
"Cap'n Davies lifted the box. ""It's pretty big to be diamonds but it"
looks suspicious like! And you're sure it wasn't there before? That it
"ain't the property of that summer boarder of Miss Green's?"""
"Sidney's face was flaming with excitement. ""Oh, I'm _sure_! The other"
stuff was there but there wasn't any box under it. If I hadn't been so
excited listening I'd have realized I was sitting on something
"different. Can't we look inside?"""
"""We won't take the time to look at anything now, mate. We'll get"
ashore. I reckon by this time there are folks strainin' their eyes for
"a sight o' you--"""
He fairly pushed Sidney and Mart ahead of him and toward the _Sally_.
"Saunders lifted the girls into the smaller boat, then took the box."
"""To Rockman's. Quick as you can make it,"" snapped Cap'n Phin."
CHAPTER XXII
"""YOU NEED A BIG BROTHER"""
Aunt Achsa had not slept through the storm. Accustomed though she was
"to the howl of the wind and the roar of the pounding surf, tonight it"
filled her heart with dread. Lavender had not come home.
Twice during the night hours she crept to the door of his small room

"eyes and wearing a red-cross on his arm. ""Ich danke meinem Gott--I thank"

"""It's good for politicians and profiteers--für die ist's gut."""
"""Ask them what they think of the submarines."""
A Lieutenant of the Prussian Guard answered contemptuously that he
didn't think much of them. He didn't believe stories of food-shortage in

of lies.

"“Now, Mrs. Moulton,” he said gently, “I’m afraid I must trouble you to"
go with me. I am going over to a pawnbroker’s on the Bowery.”
"“The Bowery?” she repeated, with a genuinely surprised shudder. “Oh,"
"no, Mr. Kennedy. Don’t ask me to go anywhere to-night. I am—I am in no"
condition to go anywhere—to do anything—I—”
"“But you must,” said Kennedy in a low voice."
“I can’t. Oh—have mercy on me. I am terribly upset. You—”
"“It is your duty to go, Mrs. Moulton,” he repeated."
“I don’t understand.” she murmured. “A pawnbroker’s?”
"“Come,” urged Kennedy, not harshly but firmly, then, as she held back,"
"added, playing a trump card, “We must work quickly. In his hands we"
found the fragments of a torn dress. When the police—”
"She uttered a shriek. A glance had told her, if she had deceived"
"herself before, that Kennedy knew her secret."
"Antoinette Moulton was standing before him, talking rapidly."
“Some one has told Lynn. I know it. There is nothing now that I can
conceal. If you had come half an hour later you would not have found
"me. He had written to Mr. Schloss, threatening him that if he did not"
leave the country he would shoot him at sight. Mr. Schloss showed me
the letter.
"“It had come to this. I must either elope with Schloss, or lose his"
"sense making orphans."""
"""You promised, Sis,"" I told her through my teeth. ""You promised you"
"wouldn't get Butt into trouble!"""
She tossed her spiral curls at me and ground a heel into the purser's
"instep. He screwed up his face and howled, but he didn't let go of her"
arm.
"""_Shush_, Ferdinand, this is serious!"""
"It was. I heard the Captain say, ""I'm not carrying a weapon, Brown."""
"""Then _get_ one,"" Butt's low, lazy voice floated out."
"""No, thanks. You're as handy with that thing as I am with a"
"rocketboard."" The Captain's words got a little fainter as he walked"
forward. Butt growled like a gusher about to blow.
"""I'm counting on your being a good guy, Brown."" The Captain's"
"voice quavered just a bit. ""I'm banking on what I heard about the"
blast-happy Browns every time I lifted gravs in New Kalamazoo; they
"have a code, they don't burn unarmed men."""

"Just about this time, events in the lifeboat went down to a mumble. The"
top of my head got wet and I looked up. There was sweat rolling down
the Second Assistant's forehead; it converged at his nose and bounced
off the tip in a sizable stream. I twisted out of the way.
"""What's happening?"" Sis gritted, straining toward the lock."
"""I am a soldier,"" answered Vaviloff, with a modest air."
"""That is easily seen, and I am sure we shall be able to finish this job"
"without much trouble."""
"""Just so."""
"""Good!  You have the law on your side, and will, of course, win your"
"case.  I want to tell you this at the very beginning."""
"""I thank you most humbly,"" said the sergeant, rubbing his eyes in order"
to hide the smile in them.
"""But tell me, why did you make the acquaintance of your future"
"neighbours like this through the law courts?"""
Vaviloff shrugged his shoulders and did not answer.
"""It would have been better to come straight to us and settle the matter"
"peacefully, eh?  What do you think?"""
"""That would have been better, of course, but you see there is a"
"difficulty ...  I did not follow my own wishes, but those of others ..."
I learned afterwards that it would have been better if ... but it was
"too late."""
"""Oh!  I suppose some lawyer taught you this?"""
"""Someone of that sort."""
"""Aha!  Do you wish to settle the affair peacefully?"""

"""Were you just like what you are now when you were young?"" asked"
Kuvalda simply.  The other's nostrils twitched.  Ivan Andreyevitch
"sighed, passed his hand over his eyes and said:"
"""Oh!  When I was young I had to undergo a great many difficulties ..."
"Work!  Oh!  I did work!"""
"""And you cheated, too, I suppose?"""
"""People like you?  Nobles?  I should just think so! They used to grovel"
"at my feet!"""
"""You only went in for robbing, not murder, I suppose?"" asked the"
"Captain.  Petunikoff turned pale, and hastily changed the subject."
"""You are a bad host.  You sit while your guest stands."""
"""Let him sit, too,"" said Kuvalda."
"""But what am I to sit on?"""
"""On the earth ... it will take any rubbish ..."""
"""You are the proof of that,"" said Petunikoff quietly, while his eyes"
shot forth poisonous glances.
"And he went away, leaving Kuvalda under the pleasant impression that"
the merchant was afraid of him.  If he were not afraid of him he would
long ago have evicted him from the dosshouse.  But then he would think
"twice before turning him out, because of the five roubles a month. And"
the Captain gazed with pleasure at Petunikoff's back as he slowly
"retreated from the courtyard. Following him with his eyes, he noticed"
again.
"""I s'pose they had one o' them little lovers' quarrels an' that made 'er"
"tell you, eh?"" She laughed a forced little laugh, though her heart was"
"beating strangely as she kept on: ""He's the kind o' man who sort o'"
"polkas with every girl he meets."" And at this she began to laugh almost"
hysterically.
"Rance, who resented her apologising to anyone but himself, stood"
scowling at her.
"""What are you laughing at?"" he questioned."
"""Oh, nothin', Jack, nothin',"" half-cried, half-laughed the Girl. ""Only"
"it's kind o' funny how things come out, ain't it? Took in! Nina"
Micheltoreña! Nice company he keeps--one o' them Cachuca girls with
"eyelashes at half-mast!"""
"Once more, she broke out into a fit of laughter."
"""Well, well,"" she resumed, ""an' she sold 'im out for money! Ah, Jack"
"Rance, you're a better guesser'n I am!"" And with these words she sank"
down at the table in an apathy of misery. Horror and hatred and
hopelessness had possession of her. A fierce look was in her eyes when a
"moment later she raised her head and abruptly dismissed the boys,"
saying:
"""Well, boys, it's gittin' late--good-night!"""
Sonora was the first to make a movement towards the door.
"""Come on, boys,"" he growled in his deep bass voice; ""don't you intend to"
"ever played.  The Chopin polonaise in A flat, that song of revolution,"
"which had always seemed so unattainable, went as if her fingers were"
"being worked for her.  When she had finished, Monsieur Harmost, bending"
"forward, lifted one of her hands and put his lips to it.  She felt the"
"scrub of his little bristly beard, and raised her face with a deep sigh"
of satisfaction. A voice behind them said mockingly:
"""Bravo!"""
"There, by the door, stood Fiorsen."
"""Congratulations, madame!  I have long wanted to see you under the"
"inspiration of your--master!"""
Gyp's heart began to beat desperately.  Monsieur Harmost had not moved.
"A faint grin slowly settled in his beard, but his eyes were startled."
Fiorsen kissed the back of his own hand.
"""To this old Pantaloon you come to give your heart.  Ho--what a lover!"""
Gyp saw the old man quiver; she sprang up and cried:
"""You brute!"""
"Fiorsen ran forward, stretching out his arms toward Monsieur Harmost, as"
if to take him by the throat.
"The old man drew himself up.  ""Monsieur,"" he said, ""you are certainly"
"drunk."""
"Gyp slipped between, right up to those outstretched hands till she could"
And jammed neatly down behind it was the body of Les King. His throat
had been cut.
Brent Taber stared down into the closet for what seemed like an
interminable time. His eyes were bleak and his mouth was grim and stiff
as he passed a slow hand along his jaw.
"He took a long, backward step and closed his eyes for a moment as though"
hoping the whole improbable mess would go away. But it was still there
when he opened them again.
"He turned, went downstairs, and took the receiver off the phone on the"
wall by the front door.
"The shapeless landlady came out again. She scowled at Taber. ""What are"
"you doing here?"""
"He regarded her with a kind of affectionate weariness. ""Have you got a"
"dime, lady?"""
"Gaping, she pawed into her apron pocket and handed him a coin."
"""Thanks much."" He dialed. ""Is Captain Abrams there?"""
"There was a wait, during which Brent Taber asked the oddly bemused"
"landlady: ""Are you afraid of the dead?"""
"But before she could decide whether she was or not, Taber turned to the"
"phone. ""Captain?.... That's right, Brent Taber ... No, right, here in"
Manhattan. There's been a little trouble. You'd better come over
"personally."""
"""No, it is not.  It has been destroyed."""
"""Why?""  I asked."
"""For some mysterious reason known to Yolande.""  Then, turning quickly"
"again to me, she placed her hand upon my arm in deep earnestness,"
"saying: ""Tell me, is your love for her absolutely and entirely dead--so"
"dead that you would not care to perform her a service?"""
Anderson's strange and startling story flashed through my mind.  I made
no reply.
"""Remember the affection you once bore her,"" she urged.  ""I am a woman,"
"m'sieur, and I presume to remind you of it."""
I needed no reminder.  The recollection of those sweet idyllic days was
still fresh as ever in my memory.  Ah! in those brief sunny hours I had
fondly believed that our love would last always.  It is ever the same.
Youth is ever foolish.
"""I should have loved her now,"" I answered at last, ""were it not for one"
"fact."""
"There was a mystery which had ended our love, and I saw now an"
"opportunity of clearing it up.  ""To what fact do you refer?"""
"""To the reason of our parting."""
"""The reason!"" echoed the Countess.  ""I have no idea whatever of the"
"reason.  What was it?"""
I held my breath.  Would it be just to tell her the truth?  I wondered.
go....
"As Noll, reaching the bottom step, fumbled at the door that led into"
"the tavern of _The Golden Sun_, a young woman in black came languidly"
"down the stairs, and he held the door open for her to pass in."
The light fell on the delicate features of Madelaine. She smiled with
"pleasure, seeing him."
They entered and stood together--a song was being sung--and as the last
"chords were struck, she slipped her hand within his arm; and he left"
it there. She shared the cordial greeting that Noll received from the
faded poets and frequenters of the place. She was very beautiful--but
her face pathetically pale. Noll noticed a dizzy tendency to cling to
"his arm, as though she feared to fall. He found a table, and made her"
sit down beside him.
"“Madelaine,” said he--“you look as if you wanted food.”"
She sighed sadly:
"“Ah, yes--for years,” she said."
He called for a drink and some biscuits for her; and whilst they were
"being brought, he asked her:"
"“What became of you, Madelaine--after the old widow Snacheur was"
killed?”
She sighed sadly:
"goin'."""
"He bowed her out of the room, and then, snatching up his hat and cane"
"with very visible annoyance, included the others in a curt nod of"
farewell and made off himself.
He passed her before she had closed her own door--and would gladly have
paused there.
"""You won't forget me, will you?"" she heard him ask eagerly from behind"
her. But she did not delay to answer that question.
"A few minutes later, Slyne knocked at her door and entered, followed by"
the other two men. He had brought with him the papers which Mr. Jobling
"had prepared. Mr. Jobling carried an inkstand, and Captain Dove a"
decanter of brandy. Slyne seated himself at the table and waved Sallie
back to her chair by the window.
"""We're going to talk business for a few minutes,"" he told her, ""and then"
get everything settled in writing--to keep you safe.
"""Fire ahead now, Dove. You want to know--"""
"""Is Sallie really--"""
"""_I_ don't know anyone of that name now. D'you mean Lady Josceline?"""
"Captain Dove glared at him, and then at the lawyer, and then at Sallie"
herself.
"""Is that really who I am now, Jasper?"" she asked, a most wistful"
inflection in her low voice.
"""No doubt.  As soon as she returned she began to talk of him."""
And next instant I recollected the strange effect the news of his
"arrival in Paris had had upon Yolande, and the curiously tragic event"
which had subsequently occurred.  All was puzzling--all inscrutable.
A silence fell between us.  I was revolving in my mind whether I should
ask this wizen-faced old leader of Society a further question.  With
sudden resolve I turned to her again and asked:
"""O Baronne, I had quite forgotten.  Do you chance to know the Countess"
"de Foville, of Brussels?  They have a chateau down in the Ardennes, and"
"move in the best set in Belgium?"""
"""De Foville?  De Foville?"" she repeated.  ""What, do you mean the mother"
"of that little witch Yolande?"""
"""Yes.  But why do you call her a witch?""  I demanded, with feigned"
laughter.
"""Why?"" cried the old woman, the expression of her face growing dark with"
"displeasure.  ""Well, I do not know whether she is a friend of yours, but"
"all I can tell you is that should she be, the best course for you to"
"pursue is to cut her acquaintance."""
"""What do you mean?""  I gasped."
"""I mean exactly what I have said."""
"""But I don't understand,"" I cried.  ""Be more frank with me,"" I implored."
"""Where does she work?"""
"""Down in Wall Street."""
"""Not much chance we're interested. This money has been turning up around"
"Times Square."""
"""The other's a man--quiet, no trouble, pays his rent right on the dot"
every week. John Dennis his name is and he doesn't look like no
"counterfeiter."""
"Taber took a forward step. ""What's his room number?"""
"""Six--on the second floor. But he isn't in now. He just went out."""
"""Okay. Maybe I'll be back. As I said, we don't suspect anybody. We're"
"just checking for sources."""
Taber turned toward the door. The woman vanished back into her own
quarters as Taber snapped the lock. He stood in the vestibule for a
"minute or two, studying some cards he took from his pocket, and when she"
"did not reappear, he opened the door, went back in, and climbed the"
stairs.
The door to number six was not locked. Taber went inside. The window was
small and gave on an areaway. He could see nothing until he turned on
"the light. Even then, he could see nothing of interest--the room was"
ordinary in every sense.
"But as Brent Taber checked it out, some unusual aspects became apparent."
"There were two pieces of luggage in the closet. One, an oversized"
"suitcase, stood on end."
"And we, alike from each remote,"
"The world that works, the heaven that waits,"
"Con our brief pleasures o’er by rote,"
The favourite pastime of the Fates.
"We smoke, to fancy that we dream,"
"And drink, a moment’s joy to prove,"
"And fain would love, and only seem"
To love because we cannot love.
"Draw back the blinds, put out the light:"
"’Tis morning, let the daylight come."
"God! how the women’s cheeks are white,"
And how the sunlight strikes us dumb!
EMMY.
"EMMY’S exquisite youth and her virginal air,"
"Eyes and teeth in the flash of a musical smile,"
"Come to me out of the past, and I see her there"
As I saw her once for a while.
"Emmy’s laughter rings in my ears, as bright,"
"Fresh and sweet as the voice of a mountain brook,"
"And still I hear her telling us tales that night,"
Out of Boccaccio’s book.
"There, in the midst of the villainous dancing-hall,"
"the sea outside and the flowers in the delft bowl laughed, too."
“The angel has been having a good time.”
John cleared his throat again.
"“My dear,” said he, and then he stopped short. All the carefully"
prepared exordiums went out of his head. How now to break the news to
her he did not know.
“Are you very tired?” she asked.
"“Not a bit,” said John."
"“Then be a dear, and read me something. Read me 'Elaine.' ”"
The elevated and sophisticated and very highly educated may learn
with surprise that “The Idylls of the King” still appeal to ingenuous
fifteen. Thank God there are yet remaining also some sentimentalists of
fifty who can read them with pleasure and profit!
"“But that is so sad, Stellamaris,” said John. “You don't want to be sad"
this beautiful spring morning.”
"Which was a very inconsistent remark to make, seeing that he was about"
to dash the young sun from her sky altogether.
"“I like being sad sometimes, especially when the world is bright."
"And Lancelot was such a dear,”--here spoke ingenuous fifteen,--“and"
"Elaine--oh, do read it!”"
"So John, secretly glad of a respite, drew from the bookcase which held"
on his face.
"The girls surged forward when they saw him, scattering the crew to one"
side. They were like a school of sharks that had just caught sight of a
dying whale.
"""M-m-m-m! Are all Venusians built like that?"""
"""Men like that are worth the mileage!"""
"""_I want him!"" ""I want him!"" ""I want him!_"""
Sis had been let go. She grabbed my free hand and pulled me away. She
"was trying to look only annoyed, but her eyes had bright little bubbles"
of fury popping in them.
"""The cheap extroverts! And they call themselves responsible women!"""
"I was angry, too. And I let her know, once we were in our cabin."
"""What about that promise, Sis? You said you wouldn't turn him in. You"
"_promised_!"""
She stopped walking around the room as if she had been expecting to get
"to Venus on foot. ""I know I did, Ferdinand, but he forced me."""
"""My name is Ford and I don't understand."""
"""Your name is Ferdinand and stop trying to act forcefully like a girl."
"It doesn't become you. In just a few days, you'll forget all this and"
"be your simple, carefree self again. I really truly meant to keep my"
"word. From what you'd told me, Mr. Brown seemed to be a fundamentally"
decent chap despite his barbaric notions on equality between the
hymns and some of the Gospel Songs. Some of the numbers in the Gospel
"Songs section of the _Hymnary_ might well be classified as hymns, e.g.,"
"Nos. 441, 444, 447, 458, 463, 468, 470, 471, 472, and 492. Either words"
or music meet the generally accepted standards of a hymn.
12. Women Hymn Writers.
There have been no outstanding women composers of church tunes but some
"of our finest lyrics have been contributed by women, as the following"
list from the _Hymnary_ will show:
_German_

CHAPTER XVII
ERASMUS AT BASLE
1521-9
Basle his dwelling-place for nearly eight years:
1521-9--Political thought of Erasmus--Concord and
peace--Anti-war writings--Opinions concerning princes and
government--New editions of several Fathers--The
"_Colloquia_--Controversies with Stunica, Beda, etc.--Quarrel"
with Hutten--Eppendorff
It is only towards the evening of life that the picture of Erasmus
acquires the features with which it was to go down to posterity. Only at
Basle--delivered from the troublesome pressure of parties wanting to
"enlist him, transplanted from an environment of haters and opponents at"
"Louvain to a circle of friends, kindred spirits, helpers and admirers,"
"emancipated from the courts of princes, independent of the patronage of"
"“Don’t quote the critics, for Heaven’s sake,” said Severance. “It is"
enough to have read them.”
"“Oh, Mrs. Pendleton,” exclaimed Teddy, “if you could have been at the"
"yacht race! Such excitement, such—”"
"“To change the subject,” said Trent, with determination in his eye,"
"“Mrs. Pendleton, did you receive all the marked papers I sent you"
"containing my speeches, especially the one on Jesuitism in Politics?”"
"“Don’t bother Mrs. Pendleton with politics!” exclaimed Boswell, whose"
own egotism was kicking against its bars. “You did not think my book too
"long, did you? One purblind critic said—”"
"“Good night, Mrs. Pendleton,” said Severance, rising abruptly. “Good"
"evening,” and he bowed to Miss Decker and to the men. Jessica rose"
suddenly and went with him to the door.
"“I am going to walk on the cliffs—‘Forty Steps’—at eleven to-morrow,”"
"she said, as she gave him her hand. “This may be unconventional, but _I_"
choose to do it.”
He bowed over her hand. “Mrs. Pendleton will only have set one more
"fashion,” he said. “I shall be there.”"
"As he left the room by one door, Jessica crossed the room and opened"
another.
"“Good night,” she said to the astounded company, and withdrew."

"voice. ""The Swabian dynasty is no more."""
"With a cry and a sob that shook his whole being, Francesco covered his"
face with his hands.
For a moment the duke stared blankly at the speaker.
"""And the Frangipani?"" he asked, his features ashen-gray and drawn."
The messenger pointed to Astura.
"""There is feasting and high glee: the Pontiff's bribe was large.""--"
Francesco trembled in every limb.
"""Such a day was never seen in Naples,"" the messenger concluded with a"
"shudder. ""To a man they died under the axe--the soil was dyed crimson"
"with their blood."""
There was a silence.
"The messenger pointed to the sea, which had melted into the indefinite"
background of the night.
"Dim and distant, like a pearl over the purple deeps, one sail after"
"another struck out of the vague west. They came heading for the land,"
the black hulls rising and falling against the tumultuous blackness of
the clouds.
A red gleam started suddenly from the waves. A quick flame leaped up
like a red finger above the cliff.
including every reference necessary to enable the searcher to find what
"he wishes without delay or confusion, the mistake of overloading the"
index with useless entries.
"Use ink, as pencil entries often become illegible."
"Write plainly, and do not try to economize space in preparing the copy."

PROCEDURE
"Having settled upon a definite plan, the indexer seats himself at a"
"""When it gets dark I'm coming out to the _Arabella_ and stay all night."
Maybe they'll come back and I'll find out why. That fellow said
something 'bout Rockman's not being safe. They'll learn the _Arabella_
"isn't safe either!"""
"""But Lav, I'm coming with you!"""
"""You can't. And this isn't any work for a girl to get mixed up in."""
Sidney drew herself to her full height.
"""Lavender Green, if you think you're going to lose me _now_ you're"
mistaken. I guess we went into this in a sort of partnership and it's
going to hold. I found out just as much as you did! And if you come out
"to the _Arabella_, _I'm_ coming, and Mart, too, if she's home."""
Lav still hesitated.
"""Aunt Achsa won't let you. How'd you get away?"""
"This staggered Sidney for a moment, then she thought of a ""way."" This"
was Wednesday night and Miss Letty had said that on Wednesday night she
was going to drive to Truro and that Sidney might go with her. From
Truro Miss Letty was going on to Wellfleet. Aunt Achsa would think
Sidney wanted to see Cap'n Davies again. She explained all this
"breathlessly to Lavender. ""This is important enough to warrant a fib."
And when it's all over Aunt Achsa will understand. Let's go home now
"and find Mart."""
Unwillingly Lavender conceded Sidney's right to share with him his
night's vigil at any cost. Again they beached the dory near Sunset Lane.
"""Another thief crep' into camp,"" coldly observed the Girl almost"
simultaneously with the report.
Johnson winced.
"""Poor devil!"" he muttered. ""But of course, as you say, he's only a"
"thief."""
In reply to which the Girl uttered words to the effect that she was glad
he had been caught.
"""Well, you're right,"" said Johnson, thoughtfully, after a short silence;"
"then determinedly and in short jerky sentences, he went on: ""I've been"
thinking that I must go--tear myself away. I have very important
"business at dawn--imperative business . . ."""
"The Girl, who now stood by the table folding up the white cloth cover,"
"watched him out of the corner of her eye, take down his coat from the"
peg on the wall.
"""Ever sample one o' our mountain blizzards?"" she asked as he slipped on"
"his coat. ""In five minutes you wouldn't know where you was. Your"
important business would land you at the bottom of a canyon 'bout twenty
"feet from here."""
Johnson cleared his throat as if to speak but said nothing; whereupon
the Girl continued:
"""You say you believe in Fate. Well, Fate has caught up with you--you got"
"to stay here."""
"Andrews chuckled. ""I'll do better than our young pilot friend. The man"
"is big, and should be muscular, but he is soft from lack of exercise."
"Yet he'll attempt to stay there longer than I did, I guess."""
"""No doubt."""
"He eyed her sharply, not missing her repetitious dry reply."
"""Which, incidentally,"" he said, ""gives me my first chance to speak with"
"you alone since we took off from Earth."""
"""That's so. But--"""
"""Miss Hemingway, you are an exceedingly brisk young woman, attractive"
"and intelligent. May I ask if you have ever taken a lover?"""
"""Why, no."""
"""Never considered it?"""
"She smiled thinly. ""Naturally. All women think about it. Most do."
"I--er--"""
"Alice let her voice trail away uncertainly. The direct, frontal attack"
"had put her off-balance, but she realized that this was Andrews' direct"
way.
"He had smiled at her uncertainty, and said swiftly, ""Then may I be the"
"first--"" when he noted the fading amusement in her face and glibly ad"
"libbed--""to congratulate you on your choice of young men? The space"
commodore to whom you bade farewell in Chicago was an up and coming
"man, I'd assume."""
"""Proceed, count."""
"""Monsieur le Comte Hamilton begs me to say that he was called away from"
"London early to-day on the king's business, but that he will return"
in four weeks. When he returns he will do himself the honor to send
"me again, asking you to name a friend, unless you prefer to apologize,"
"which no gentleman would do in a case of this sort. You said, I am told,"
"that Monsieur le Comte lied. If you admit that he did not lie, of course"
"you admit that you did. So, im-pos-si-ble! There must be to fight!"""
"""Do you know, count, the cause of my having given Count Hamilton the"
"lie?"" I asked."
"""I did not inquire,"" he answered smilingly. ""To me it was to carry the"
"message."""
"""George Hamilton is your friend, is he not?"" I asked."
"""Yes, but far more, he is the friend of my king, and will make entreaty"
"with my monarch for my return to France,"" answered De Grammont."
"""It was because of Count Hamilton's insulting reference to his brother"
"that I used the ugly word,"" I returned."
"""A-ah, that is different!"" Then recovering himself quickly: ""But I"
undertook the mission. It is to finish. Monsieur George Hamilton? My
friend? My king's friend? If it had been known to me! But you have the
"message of 'Sieur le Comte."""
"After a short silence he said, ""When Monsieur le Comte Hamilton returns,"
"I shall ask him to relieve me of this duty."""
“I fled.
“And now you have found me.”
"She had turned, hastily, to leave the room. Kennedy blocked the door."
"“Mrs. Moulton,” he said firmly, “listen to me. What was the first"
question you asked me? ‘Can I trust you?’ And I told you you could.
This is no time for—for suicide.” He shot the word out bluntly. “All
may not be lost. I have sent for your husband. Muller is outside.”
“Muller?” she cried. “He made the replica.”
“Very well. I am going to clear this thing up. Come. You _must_.”
"It was all confused to me, the dash in a car to the little pawnbroker’s"
"on the first floor of a five-story tenement, the quick entry into the"
place by one of Muller’s keys.
Over the safe in back was a framework like that which had covered
"Schloss’ safe. Kennedy tore it away, regardless of the alarm which it"
must have sounded. In a moment he was down before it on his knees.
"“This is how Schloss’ safe was opened so quickly,” he muttered, working"
feverishly. “Here is some of their own medicine.”
He had placed the peculiar telephone-like transmitter close to the
combination lock and was turning the combination rapidly.
"Suddenly he rose, gave the bolts a twist, and the ponderous doors swung"
open.

"TUCKER, ROBERT."
Of the Island of Jamaica.
"One of Major Stede Bonnet's crew. Tried, condemned, and hanged at"
"Charleston, South Carolina, on November 8th, 1718. The prisoners were not"
"defended by counsel, because the members of the South Carolina Bar still"
"deemed it ""a base and vile thing to plead for money or reward."" We"
understand that the barristers of South Carolina have since persuaded
"themselves to overcome this prejudice. The result was that, with the"
"famous Judge Trott, a veritable terror to pirates, being President of the"
"Court of Vice-Admiralty, the prisoners had short and ready justice, and"
all but four of the thirty-five pirates tried were found guilty.

"'Your spy, that cat there,' my lady answered, carried away by her"
"temper, 'may go! The women will stay.'"
"Fraulein Max, singled out by that merciless finger, sprang forward,"
her face mottled with surprise and terror. For a second she hesitated.
"Then she rushed towards her friend, as if she would embrace her."
'Countess!' she cried. 'Rotha! Surely you are mad! You cannot think
that I would----'
"My lady turned, and in a flash struck her fiercely on the cheek with"
"her open hand. 'Liar!' she cried; 'go to your master, you whipped"
hound!'
"The Dutch woman recoiled with a cry of pain, and sobbing wildly went"
back to her place. The general laughed harshly.
"'You hold with me, sweetheart,' he said. 'Discipline before"
everything. But you have not my patience.'
"She looked at him--angry with him, angry with herself, her hand to her"
bosom--but she did not answer.
"'For you must allow,' he continued--his tone and his eyes still"
bantered her--'that I have been patient. I have been like a man
"athirst in the desert; but I have waited day after day, until now I"
"can wait no longer, sweetheart.'"
'So you tamper with my--with that woman!' she said scornfully.

“Mr. Pangbutt’s father?”
"“H’m, h’m! Yes. I assure you.”"
“Dear me! And he has such a very distinguished manner!”
“And--d’you know?”
She whispered.
“Lady Persimmon? Indeed?”
The lady of the lorgnettes nodded mysteriously. The withered eyes
expressed shocked surprise. She gave a funny little laugh. The
"lorgnettes were raised again, and she said, surveying the assembled"
guests critically through the glasses:
“I absolutely _adore_ literary people--and artists--and actors--and
those sort of persons. It is so strange to think they have all slept
"in attics. And really, it’s quite the _fashion_ to go on the stage"
now.... Who’s the fright in the post-office red?... Oh! is it?... Lady

"young fellow is getting on wonderfully. You see, they like to have"
"a gentleman on the stage--besides, he acts in the most gentlemanly"
"manner--quite unlike a professional actor. And then, of course, his"
manager is rather exclusive--he called the company together the other
"day, and told them that he did not expect them to recognise him in"
the street. It’s so nice for the young fellow to be with such a
"of a foreign compound name has been used alone, as _Merle d'Aubigné_"
(index under _Merle_ with a cross-reference from _Aubigné_).
"In French, a forename is sometimes joined to a surname by a hyphen. In"
"such cases make the entry under the family name, with a cross-reference"
"from the forename: e.g., entry, _Rochette, Désiré Raoul_;"
"cross-reference, _Raoul-Rochette, Désiré_. See _Rochette_."
"(_c_) In foreign compound names of women also, although the first part"
"is usually the maiden name and the second the husband's name, the entry"
"should generally be under the first, with a cross-reference from the"
"second[51]: e.g., _Rivé-King_, with cross-reference from _King, born"
Rivé_.
Index surnames preceded by prefixes:
"(_a_) In French and Belgian, under the prefix when it is or contains"
"an article, _Le, La, L', Du, Des_; under the word following when the"
"prefix is a preposition, _de, d'_: e.g., _Des Essarts, Du Cange,"
"La Fontaine, Le Sage, L'Estoille_; but _Charlevoix, P. F. X. de_;"
"_Estrées, Mme d'_."
"_La_ and _Le_ are often, _Des_ is usually, and _Les_ is almost without"
"exception printed as one word with the name following, as _Lafontaine,"
"Lesage, Lesdiguières_; _de_ and _d'_ are sometimes so printed; when"
"they are, enter under the _D_: e.g., _Debucourt, Decamps, Delisle_; but"
"_Bucourt, A. de_, _Camps, C. de_, _Lisle, J. de_."
"(_b_) In English, under the prefix, no matter from what language the"
"name is derived, with cross-references when necessary: e.g., _De"
"Quincey_, _Van Buren_."
"""Why do you stop? Why don't you go on--finish your search--only don't"
"ever speak to me again."""
"At that, Rance became conciliatory."
"""Say, Min, I don't want to quarrel with you."""
Turning her back on him the Girl moved over to the bureau where she
snapped out over her shoulder:
"""Go on with your search, then p'r'aps you'll leave a lady to herself to"
"go to bed."""
The Sheriff followed her up with the declaration:
"""I'm plumb crazy about you, Min."""
The Girl shrugged her shoulder.
"""I could have sworn I saw--I--Oh, you know it's just you for me--just"
"you, and curse the man you like better. I--I--even yet I can't get over"
"the queer look in your face when I told you who that man really was."" He"
"stopped and flung his overcoat down on the floor, and fixing her with a"
"look he demanded: ""You don't love him, do you?"""
Again the Girl sent over her shoulder a forced little laugh.
"""Who--me?"""
"The Sheriff's face brightened. Taking a few steps nearer to her, he"
hazarded:
And the _Triumphants_ towed alongside.
"""Up you go,"" said Benson."
"""I won't,"" said Smith."
"""Won't you?"" asked Benson.  ""We'll see about that.  Hook on there,"
"Billings."""
And the next moment Smith was jammed in a running bowline round his
waist.
"""Sway him up,"" said Benson; and the crew of the _Harvester_ hoisted"
the notorious robber with about the only feelings of pleasure they
were likely to know till they reached New York.  And the
_Triumphants_ pushed off as they heard the mate address Mr. Smith in
language which did his reputation and the reputation of the ship most
ample justice.
"""There's talk and there's a fore-topsail-yard-ahoy voice for you,"""
"said Benson.  ""Oh, Mr. Smith will be looked after, he will.  Now,"
"chaps, pull for it, or the admiral will be waitin', and if that"
"'appens, 'twill be 'Stand from under.'"""
THE POLICY OF THE _POTLUCK_.
"Concerning the permanent and immutable characteristics of ships, the"
unhappy man who has never had his limited range of vision broadened
by a trip in a sailing ship must of necessity know little.  He
"for the disturbance, but are themselves badly mauled. Then the Pardoner"
"and the Friar go off amicably together. There is no allegory, no moral;"
merely satire on the fraudulent and hypocritical practices of pardoners
"and friars, together with some horseplay to raise a louder laugh. The"
fashion of that satire may be judged from the following exchange of home
truths by the rival orators.
"_Friar._ What, should ye give ought to parting pardoners?--"
"_Pardoner._ What, should ye spend on these flattering liars,--"
"_Friar._ What, should ye give ought to these bold beggars?--"
"_Pardoner._ As be these babbling monks and these friars,--"
_Friar._ Let them hardly labour for their living;--
_Pardoner._ Which do nought daily but babble and lie--
"_Friar._ It much hurteth them good men's giving,--"
"_Pardoner._ And tell you fables dear enough at a fly,--"
"_Friar._ For that maketh them idle and slothful to wark,--"
_Pardoner._ As doth this babbling friar here to-day?--
_Friar._ That for none other thing they will cark.--
"_Pardoner._ Drive him hence, therefore, in the twenty-devil way!--"
"_The Four P.P._ (? 1540), similarly, requires no more than a palmer, a"
cymbal claps. Triumphantly the _maialino_ looked around. He out-smacked
all.
"The bread of the country is rather coarse and brown, with a hard, hard"
crust. A large rock of this is perched on every damp serviette. The
"_maialino_ tore his rock asunder, and grumbled at the black-cap, who had"
got a weird sort of three-cornered loaf-roll of pure white bread--starch
white. He was a swell with this white bread.
"Suddenly black-cap turned to me. Where had we come from, where were we"
"going, what for? But in laconic, sardonic tone."
"""I _like_ Sardinia,"" cried the q-b."
"""Why?"" he asked sarcastically. And she tried to find out."
"""Yes, the Sardinians please me more than the Sicilians,"" said I."
"""Why?"" he asked sarcastically."
"""They are more open--more honest."" He seemed to turn his nose down."
"""The padrone is a Sicilian,"" said the _maialino_, stuffing a huge block"
"of bread into his mouth, and rolling his insouciant eyes of a gay,"
well-fed little black pig towards the background. We weren't making much
headway.
"""You've seen Cagliari?"" the black-cap said to me, like a threat."
"""Yes! oh Cagliari pleases me--Cagliari is beautiful!"" cried the q-b,"

"‘What does this mean, Pa?’ cried I."
"They gathered themselves up, shamelessly--laughed--ye gods, twittingly,"
"at _me_! Wholly unabashed, Pa, shaking himself into comfort in his"
"clothes, slapped me upon the back:"
"‘Horace, my son----’"
"‘Don’t be familiar, Sir Pompey,’ said I. ‘You are speaking to the heir"
to a baronetcy.’
The baronet laughed vulgarly:
"‘Mrs. Bartholomew Doome,’ he said--‘allow me to introduce to you"
"Horace, my son--at least, my reputed son.’"
"Bows, chassées, and greetings."
"‘Horace--the Misses Doome, Master Horace Doome, and Master Oliver"
Doome----’
The old gentleman slapped me upon the back again with mighty hand that
near drove me down amongst the fire-irons.
He dug me in the ribs:
"‘The rogue’s been married this seven years,’ cried he; ‘and now he’s"
"signed the deeds as partner in Malahide and Son, and you’re just in"
"the nick of time, the fool of a lawyer is upstairs--only--look here,"
"Horace, you must, like Doome, sign a bond not to touch the business"
arrangements--you and he would wreck the counting-house in six
months....’
"The foreigners, perceiving that the Englishman was on an errand of"
"peace, gathered about the case, and soon discovered from the"
stencilled inscription that it at any rate pretended to come from
Cognac.
"""Goddam,"" said the little red-capped Frenchman who had first"
"discovered them.  ""Cognac!  I spik English--brandee, Por'smout',"
"Lon-don!"""
Jones made signs that he presented the case to them.
"""I ain't above makin' a concession or two,"" he remarked"
"confidentially to the French captain; ""but if I'd listened to my lot"
"on board, it would 'ave been blood up to the neck."""
The Frenchman shook his head.
"""You bet it would 'ave bin,"" said Jones earnestly, ""but what d'ye say"
"to 'avin' a drink?  Billy, gimme your knife."""
"And with it he started opening the case, while the Frenchmen's eyes"
gleamed in pleasing anticipation.  They had not had a drink for
weeks.  And as they carried the case down to the ship with Jones and
"their own captain in the rear, they concluded that the English were"
not such bad chaps after all.
"""But where's my man 'Art!"" asked Jones, when he came to the French"
camp.
"""'Ere I be,"" cried Hart, who was lashed hard and fast to a round"
"rock.  ""Lord, captain, but I've 'ad a time.  Can't you cut me adrift,"
her hands on his arm. The boy's form in its light underwear showed
pitifully crooked but Sidney saw him straight and she saw the gleam in
his eyes. Suddenly she remembered what Vick had said so lightly about
"the Grail. Ah, she was seeing its gleam now, transcendently beautiful,"
in Lav's eyes! She dropped her hold of his arm.
"""You see, I've _got_ to try it, Sid."" And she understood. He went on:"
"""I'll swim for the lighthouse. They can telephone from there to"
Rockman's. You girls find a light and signal with it. Don't lose your
"nerve, Sid."" He poised for an instant on the rail then plunged into the"
black water.
"""Oh, _Lav_,"" cried Sidney. She leaned far over the side of the boat."
"She could see nothing but a crest of foam. ""Mart, he's--he's--drowned!"""
Pola screamed again.
CHAPTER XX
"""THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG!"""
In the sunny embrasure of Mrs. White's morning room Trude Romley sorted
"over the mail that Pepper, the butler, had brought in. So gay and"
"colorful was the room itself with its cretonnes, its soft tinted walls,"
"its singing birds, in wicker cages, that it seemed a part of the"
fragrant garden that crowded close to the French windows. A tiny
fountain splashed azure blue water over delicately sculptured nymphs; a
flowering vine trailed around the windows.
“At the Hotel Excelsior. We are staying there. Will you come?” “All
right.”
"Laura accepted, and they went to the Via Veneto with the Englishman"
riding beside them.
They went into the hotel and passed through to the “hall” full of
"people, Marchmont sent word to his wife by a servant, to come down."
Laura and Cæsar seated themselves with the Englishman.
"“This hotel is unbearable,” exclaimed Marchmont; “there is nothing here"
but Americans.”
"“Your wife, however, must like that,” said Cæsar."
"“No. Susanna is more European every day, and she doesn’t care for the"
"shrieking elegance of her compatriots. Besides, her father is here, and"
that makes her feel less American.”
"“It is an odd form of filial enthusiasm,” remarked Cæsar."
"“It doesn’t shock me. I almost think it’s the rule,” replied Marchmont;"
“at home I could see that my brothers and sisters hated one another
"cordially, and that every member of the family wanted to get away from"
the others. You two who are so fond of each other are a very rare
instance. Is it frequent in Spain that brothers and sisters like one
another?”
"“Yes, there are instances of it,” answered Cæsar, laughing."

"""Less of your lip, now!"" snarled the old man. ""And _don't_ keep on"
"saying that. Just take it from me again, both of you, that you'd better"
"not be so slow again in telling me--"""
"""You didn't give me time,"" Mr. Jobling protested."

"Captain Dove nodded, most emphatically. ""I'll send word to Brasse and Da"
"Costa at once,"" he remarked, ""and then I'll be ready to start whenever"
"you are."""
"He left the room after Mr. Jobling, and Slyne, in the doorway, looked"
"back at Sallie, the reassuring smile on his lips belied by his cold,"
calculating eyes.
"""And how about you, Sallie?"" he asked. ""Have you made up your mind? Are"

For it was obvious that the drinking was going to begin.  The French
"captain served the liquor out in a small glass to every one, and"
presently some of his melancholy disappeared.  He gave an order to
"one of his men who brought two more glasses, one for the English"
"captain, and one for himself."
"""I looks towards you,"" said Jones."
"""À votre santé,"" cried the Frenchman.  ""Monsieur, vous êtes un homme"
"de coeur quand mêne."""
"""I don't savvy, but I dessay you means well,"" said the captain."
"""Now, if I'd thought to bring along the signal book we might 'ave 'ad"
quite a talk.  But time enough; I dessay afore we're took off I shall

"He pointed to Hart, and though two of the Frenchmen, who had black"
"eyes, remonstrated against the deed of mercy, Hart was unlashed and"
given a drink.
"""Here's to you, old cocklywax,"" said Hart, with a scrape of his leg."
"""I bears no grudge, not me."""
"But Marion wouldn’t be stopped. “No, mother, you spoil father, and it’s"
not right. You ought to be stricter with him. He’s very naughty.” She
"laughed her hard, bright laugh and patted her hair in a mirror."
"Strange! When she was a little girl she had such a soft, hesitating"
"voice; she had even stuttered, and now, whatever she said—even if it"
"was only “Jam, please, father”—it rang out as though she were on the"
stage.
"“Did Harold leave the office before you, dear?” asked Charlotte,"
beginning to rock again.
"“I’m not sure,” said Old Mr. Neave. “I’m not sure. I didn’t see him"
after four o’clock.”
“He said—” began Charlotte.
"But at that moment Ethel, who was twitching over the leaves of some"
"paper or other, ran to her mother and sank down beside her chair."
"“There, you see,” she cried. “That’s what I mean, mummy. Yellow, with"
touches of silver. Don’t you agree?”
"“Give it to me, love,” said Charlotte. She fumbled for her"
"tortoise-shell spectacles and put them on, gave the page a little dab"
"with her plump small fingers, and pursed up her lips. “Very sweet!” she"
crooned vaguely; she looked at Ethel over her spectacles. “But I
shouldn’t have the train.”
“Not the train!” wailed Ethel tragically. “But the train’s the whole
point.”
"“Here, mother, let me decide.” Marion snatched the paper playfully from"
"to record,--Cleopatras of cats, whom age could not wither, and whose"
"infinite variety custom could not stale,--and there was the approaching"
marriage of Arachne with a duke to report. And he told her of his
"gay, bright life in London and of the beautiful Belinda Molyneux, an"
"imaginary Egeria, who sometimes lunched with the queen. The effort of"
"artistic creation absorbed him, as it always had done, under the spell"
of Stellamaris's shining eyes. The foolish world of his imagination
"became real, and for the moment hung like a veil before his actual world"
of tragedy. It was in the nature of a shock to him when Stella's maid
entered and asked him if he could speak to Mr. Herold outside the door..
"“Tell him to come in,” said Stellamaris."
"“He says he will, Miss, after he has seen Mr. Risca.”"
Risca found Herold on the landing.
“Well?”
“Well?” said John.
“What has happened? How did she take it?”
"John looked away, and thrust his hands into his pockets."
“I 've not told her yet.”
Walter drew a breath. “But you 're going to?”

message:
Dear Fellow Scientist:
A project is contemplated that will have a crucial bearing on man's
future in deep space. Ample non-military Government funds are
available. There was a time when professional men scoffed at the

the professional men. Now both times are past. May they never

"through them, hesitated at the name ""Willard Farquar,"" looked at the"
"sleeping girl, then quickly tossed them all into the addresso-robot and"
plugged in the steno-robot.

"another!"""
But the butcher of Tortosa could be as simple and direct in his methods
as even Rollo himself.
"""Will you give it to me?"" he said, still admiring it as it flashed upon"
his finger.
"Etienne looked at the general calmly from head to foot, Concha all the"
time frowning upon him to warn him of his danger. But the young man was
"preening himself like a little bantam-cock of vanity, glad to be"
reckless under the fire of such eyes. He would not have missed the
"chance for worlds, so he replied serenely, ""Do you still intend to shoot"
"us?"""
"""What has that to do with the matter?"" growled Cabrera, who was losing"
his temper.

THE BURNING OF THE MILL-HOUSE
"Cabrera bit his lip for a moment, frowned still more darkly, and then"
"my being cried out to you--yet all was dark about me, horrible"
"midnight, peopled with foul forms! Oh, that night,--that night--"""
"Shivering, she covered her eyes as if trying to banish the memory."
"""It has passed,"" she breathed after a pause, during which Francesco"
"had taken her in his arms, kissing her eyes, her lips, and the"
"sylph-like, flower-soft face. ""I see the dawn!"""
"""Our dawn!""--Francesco replied, pointing to the hillock beyond."
"For a time there was a great silence, as if the fates of two souls"
were being weighed in the scales of destiny.
It was Francesco who spoke.
"""How you have suffered!"""
"She crept very close to him, smiling up at him with the old-time smile"
through tear-dimmed eyes.
"""It counts for naught now! Are not you with me?"""
The sky burned azure above the tree-tops. Transient sunshafts quivered
"through the vaulted dome of breathless leaves, as slowly Francesco and"
Ilaria strode towards the camp of the Duke of Spoleto on the
sun-bathed hillock above the Nera.
The End.
"let a lady go to bed?"""
One by one the men filed through the door which Nick held open for them;
"but when all but himself had left, the devoted little barkeeper turned"
"to the Girl with a look full of meaning, and whispered:"
"""Do you want me to stay?"""
"""Me? Oh, no, Nick!"" And with a ""Good-night, all! Good-night, Sonora, an'"
"thank you! Good-night, Nick!"" the Girl closed the door upon them. The"
last that she heard from them was the muffled ejaculation:
"""Oh, Lordy, we'll never git down to Cloudy to-night!"""
Now the Girl slid the bolts and stood with her back against the door as

Slowly the road agent parted the curtains and came forward in an
attitude of dejection.

impossible for her to continue.
"""I didn't,"" denied the road agent, quietly, his countenance reflecting"
how deeply hurt he was by her words.
"""You lie!"" insisted the Girl, beside herself with rage."

“Yes.”

They went down in the carriage to the Priory of Malta. They knocked at
"the gate and a woman came out who knew Kennedy, and who told them to"
wait a moment and she would open the church.
"“Here,” said Kennedy, “you have all that remains of the famous Order of"
Saint John of Jerusalem. That anti-historic man Bonaparte rooted it
"out of Malta. The Order attempted to establish itself in Catania, and"
"afterwards at Ferrara, and finally took refuge here. Now it has no"

"“Among the San Blas Indians, who are at a far higher level of"
"civilization, the exclusion of aliens is the result of well-founded"

independence; they have maintained the purity of their race and enjoyed
freely for hundreds of years every inch of their territory. They feel

REVENGE IN AN ALIEN WORLD
When Gail Loring chose Bill Drake to be her husband--in name only--for
"the duration of the flight to Mars, she didn't know that she had just"
signed his death warrant.
"Jealous Dr. Spartan, leader of the expedition, swore to get revenge and"
force Gail to share his maniacal plan for power.
"Bound together in space, five men and a woman strained against the"
powerful tug of twisted emotions and secret ambitions.
But all plans were forgotten when they landed on the Red Planet and
"encountered the Martians--half animal, half vegetable, with acid for"
blood and radar for sight.
"Jimmie told his chum of the arrival of Gilroy, and then the two boys"
hastened toward the camp.
“The outlaws were discussing the advisability of taking all the boys
"into their care,” Ned said, as they hustled along, “so I’m afraid"
they’ve been there and taken the lads by surprise.”
CHAPTER IX
IN QUEST OF INFORMATION
"Left at the camp by the departure of Ned and Jimmie, Jack, Frank and"
Harry sat for a long time in the warm sunshine in front of the barrier
and discussed the situation. Gilroy had tucked himself into a collection
of blankets at the rear of the cave and was sound asleep.
“What do you think Jimmie had in his mind when he went away alone?”
asked Harry. “He merely had some plan to carry out.”
"“Oh, he’s always going off alone,” Jack answered."
“Some day he’ll go away alone and won’t be able to get back!” Frank put
in. “He won’t always be able to get out of his scrapes.”
"“Pretty foxy boy, that!” Jack declared."
"“What strikes me as being singular,” Frank suggested, “is that Jack’s"
father never said a word to him about this land business.”
"She was seated in a chair, motionless and statuesque, staring straight"
"before her.  The blow had utterly crushed her, for she was entirely"
devoted to her only daughter now that her husband was dead.  I well knew
"how deep was her affection for Yolande, and how tender was her maternal"
love.
"The room was in semi-darkness, for she had not risen to turn on the"
"light.  As I entered I did so with her permission, saying quietly:"
"""Madame, I come to you with a message."""
"""From whom?"" she asked in a hard mechanical voice."
"""From my friend Deane, the English doctor whom I have summoned.  Yolande"
"still lives!"""
"""She lives!"" she cried, springing to her feet in an instant.  ""You are"
"deceiving me!"""
"""I am not, madame,"" I reassured her, smiling.  ""Your daughter is still"
"breathing, and is increasing in strength perceptibly.  The doctors say"
"that she will probably recover."""
"""Thank God!"" she gasped, her thin white hands clasped before her.  ""I"
"pray that He may give her back to me.  I will go to her."""
"But I held her back, explaining that both the medical men had expressed"
a wish to remain there alone.
"""But what caused that appearance so akin to death?"" she asked quickly."
"daughter, I am pleased to tell you, will live; but she must be kept"
absolutely quiet.  I cannot allow you to approach her on any pretext
"whatsoever."""
"""She will not die, will she?"" the woman implored distractedly."
"""No,"" he replied, in a voice somewhat strained, I thought, ""she will not"
"die.  Of that you may rest assured."""
"Then turning to me, he beckoned, and I followed him out of the room."
CHAPTER EIGHT.
THE OLD LOVE.
"""I don't like that woman, old fellow,"" were the first words Dick uttered"
when we were alone in the room in which Yolande had been found.
"""Why not?""  I asked, rather surprised.  ""The Countess de Foville is"
"always charming."""
"He shrugged his shoulders, saying:"
"""One sometimes has strange and unaccountable prejudices, you know.  This"
"is one of mine."""
"""And Yolande,"" I asked, ""what of her?"""
"""She's better.  But it was fortunate I made the discovery just when I"
"did, or she would no doubt have passed away.  I never saw an appearance"
"so closely resembling death in all my experience; in fact, I'd have"
"staked my professional reputation that there was no spark of life."""
Index under the highest title:
"British and foreign noblemen, with cross-reference from earlier titles"
"by which they have been known, and, in the case of British noblemen,"
"from the family name: e.g., _Chesterfield, 4th Earl of (Philip"
"Dormer Stanhope)_. _Chesterfield, 5th Earl of (Philip Stanhope)_."
"Cross-reference from _Stanhope_. _Saint-Simon, Louis de Rouvroi, Duc"
de_.
Authors should be put under their names. The definition of a name is
"""that by which a person or thing is known."" Noblemen are known by their"
"titles, not by their family names."
In the few cases in which the family name[50] or a lower title is
"decidedly better known, index under that and cross-reference from"
"the title: e.g., _Francis Bacon, Baron Verulam_; _Robert Curzon,"
"14th Baron Zouche_; _John Napier, Baron of Merchiston_; _Horace"
"Walpole, 4th Earl of Oxford_; likewise the military nobles and"
"princes of the French Empire: e.g., _Lucien Bonaparte, Prince de"
"Canino_; _McMahon, Duc de Magenta_."
Englishwomen's titles-of-honor are to be treated by the following
rules. In the matter of titles an Englishwoman in marrying has
everything to gain and nothing to lose. If she marries above her
"own rank she takes her husband's title in exchange for her own,"
if below her own rank she keeps her own title.
(_a_) The wife of a peer takes her husband's style.
"That is, she is Baroness, Viscountess, Marchioness, etc. In indexing,"
"say _Brassey, Annie (Allnutt), Baroness_; not _Brassey, Annie"
"(Allnutt), Lady_."
"""Would you go out in the grounds where we sat yesterday and fetch my"
"galoshes?"""
So he went out to do her this great favor. He sang a well-known popular
"song as he crossed the yard, cheerful in his own peculiar way."
She turned to me.
"""You seem silent."""
"""Do I?"""
"""Yes, you're very silent."""
"""Listen to this,"" I said, and began to read to her from the book I held in"
my hands. I read a longish bit.
"She tried to interrupt me several times, and at length said impatiently:"
"""What is this you want me to listen to?"""
"""The _Musketeers_. You must admit it's entertaining."""
"""I've read it,"" she said. And then she began to clasp her hands and drag"
them apart again.
"""Then you must hear something you haven't read before,"" I replied, and"
went across to my room to fetch a few pages I had written. They were only
"a few poems--nothing special, just a few small verses. Not that I am in"
"the habit of reading such things aloud, but I seized on this for the"
"moment because I wanted to prevent her from humbling herself, and telling"
me anything more.
"give?"""
"Serious as was Johnson's predicament, he could not suppress a smile. In"
a surprisedly calm voice he told her to say that she had gone to bed.
The Girl's eyes flooded with admiration.
"""Why, o' course--that's it,"" she said, and turned back to the door and"
"called through it: ""I've gone to bed, Nick! I'm in bed now!"""
The barkeeper's answer was lost in another loud howl of the blast. Soon
"afterwards, however, the Girl made out that Nick was endeavouring to"
convey to her a warning of some kind.
"""You say you've come to warn me?"" she cried."
"""Yes, Ramerrez . . .!"""
"""What? Say that again?"""
"""Ramerrez is on the trail--"""
"""Ramerrez's on the trail!"" repeated the Girl in tones of alarm; and not"
waiting to hear further she motioned to Johnson to conceal himself
"behind the curtains of the bed, muttering the while:"
"""I got to let 'em in--I can't keep 'em out there on such a night . . ."""
He had barely reached his place of concealment when the Girl slid back
the bolts and bade the boys to come in.
"Headed by Rance, the men quickly filed in and deposited their lanterns"
"on the floor. It was evident that they had found the storm most severe,"
"harm."""
"""No; nothing will do anybody harm if it gives you pleasure."""
"At that bitter retort, he kept silence a long time, now and then heaving"
"a long sigh.  His words kept sounding in her heart: ""The soul, not the"
"body, is faithful.""  Was he, after all, more faithful to her than she had"
"ever been, could ever be--who did not love, had never loved him?  What"
"right had she to talk, who had married him out of vanity, out of--what?"
And suddenly he said:
"""Gyp!  Forgive!"""
"She uttered a sigh, and turned away her face."
"He bent down against the eider-down.  She could hear him drawing long,"
"sobbing breaths, and, in the midst of her lassitude and hopelessness, a"
"sort of pity stirred her.  What did it matter?  She said, in a choked"
voice:
"""Very well, I forgive."""

A fragile domesticity
"""Well?"" she interrogated."
"""Well, we was sure that you was in trouble,"" put in Sonora. ""My breath"
"jest stopped."""
"""Me? Me in trouble, Sonora?"" A little laugh that was half-gay,"
"half-derisive, accompanied her words."
"""See here, that man Ramerrez--"" followed up Rance with a grim look."
"""--feller you was dancin' with,"" interposed Sonora, but checked himself"
instantly lest he wound the Girl's feelings.
"Whereupon, Rance, with no such compunctions, became the spokesman, a"
grimace of pleasure spreading over his countenance as he thought of the
unpleasant surprise he was about to impart. Stretching out his stiffened
"fingers over the blaze, he said in his most brutal tones:"
"""Your polkying friend is none other than Ramerrez."""
"The Girl's eyes opened wide, but they did not look at the Sheriff. They"
looked straight before her.
"""I warned you, girl,"" spoke up Ashby, ""that you should bank with us"
"oftener."""
The Girl gave no sign of having heard him. Her slender figure seemed to
"have shrunken perceptibly as she stared stupidly, uncomprehendingly,"
into space.
"""We say that Johnson was--"" repeated Rance, impatiently."
And Gyp thought: 'How wonderful of him not to have asked a single
question.'
"The cab stopped at the Bury Street door.  She took his hand, put it to"
"her cheek, and got out.  He said quietly:"
"""Do you want the dogs?"""
"""Yes--oh, yes!  He doesn't care for them."""
"""All right.  There'll be time to get you in some things for the night"
after I come back.  I shan't run any risks to-day.  Make Mrs. Markey give
"you tea."""
"Gyp watched the cab gather way again, saw him wave his hand; then, with a"
"deep sigh, half anxiety, half relief, she rang the bell."
XVII
"When the cab debouched again into St. James' Street, Winton gave the"
"order: ""Quick as you can!""  One could think better going fast! A little"
red had come into his brown cheeks; his eyes under their half-drawn lids
had a keener light; his lips were tightly closed; he looked as he did
"when a fox was breaking cover.  Gyp could do no wrong, or, if she could,"
he would stand by her in it as a matter of course.  But he was going to
"take no risks--make no frontal attack. Time for that later, if necessary."
"He had better nerves than most people, and that kind of steely"
determination and resource which makes many Englishmen of his class
"""Sid, I haven't played square,"" Lavender suddenly blurted out,"
"flushing. ""We promised to tell one another if any one of us found out"
"anything and _I did_--and I didn't tell!"""
Lavender's admission faded beside the fact that he knew something.
"""Oh, what?"" Sidney cried."
"""I wasn't going to tell you. I thought you didn't care anything about"
"the pirates any more. And the laugh's sort o' on me, anyway, because I"
"thought we were all crazy to suspect Jed Starrow."""
"""Tell me quick, Lav,"" commanded Sidney, quivering with excitement."
Lav leaned against the rail. To tell his story meant confessing his
state of mind.
"""I guess I've been sore because you and Mr. Dugald fooled 'round with"
those new folks. Jealous. I get that way lots of times--all hot inside
because I'm different. And I go off somewhere alone and stay there
"until I fight it down."""
"""I know, Lav. Aunt Achsa told me. Did you go to the dunes?"""
"""One night I did. Stayed there all night. But one evening I went out on"
the breakwall. There's a place out there where the rocks are piled so's
to make a cave. I used to play there a lot when I was a little kid. I
crawled into it. And I hadn't been there very long when I heard
somebody talking--two men. They were up close so's I heard everything

"Curly was shown to a room on the second floor back, where he recognized"
a number of Bill’s belongings scattered about in the usual disorder.
Perhaps it was the sight of them which aroused in the young fellow an
"increasing doubt of his ability to do what he came for. Would this man,"
"who had never been in the habit of taking any one’s advice, listen to"
"him? He wondered, and then, unable to remain still, arose and paced the"
floor anxiously.

the soft twilight the girl saw that his face was lined and careworn.
"The yearning at her heart lent poignant sympathy to her words, as she"
together in the room where Yolande was lying.
"""This is a most curious case, my dear Trepard,"" began Dick, speaking in"
"French--""a case of coma, which I have mistaken for death;"" and,"
"continuing, he briefly explained how the patient had been found in a"
state so closely resembling death that he himself had been deceived.
"The old Frenchman placed his hand upon her heart, and, withdrawing it,"
said:
"""She's breathing now."""
"""Breathing!""  I echoed.  ""Then she is recovering!"""
"""Yes, old fellow,"" Dick replied, ""she is recovering--at least we hope we"
"shall save her.""  Then, turning to his colleague, he raised her hand and"
"pointed to the finger-nails, asking: ""Do you notice anything there?"""
"The other, adjusting his pince-nez, bent and examined, them one by one."
"""Yes,"" he answered at last.  ""A slight purple discoloration at the base"
"of the nails."""
"""And upon the lower lip does anything strike you as peculiar?"""
"""A yellow mark,"" he answered, after carefully inspecting the spot"
indicated.
"""And there?""  Deane asked, touching the mark upon the neck."
"""Very strange!"" ejaculated the elder man.  ""It is a most unusual case."""

"of exhaustion. She stirred now with a little cry. ""What is it?"""
"""It's morning--daylight. See--there--"""
"""Oh--h!"" Pola whimpered. ""Is that all?"" She clung to Sidney in fresh"
"terror. ""If we're going to die--I'd rather not _see_--"""
"""Hark,"" cried Mart, suddenly leaning forward. ""Don't you hear"
"something? Girls, that's a motor boat! I _know_! Quick. Let's signal!"
"Yell! Wave something! _Anything!_"" She sprang to her feet, leaning her"
body against the rail for support as the boat rolled in the heavy sea.
"She cupped her hands to her lips and shouted lustily. ""Come on, girls!"""
she commanded.
"""Maybe it's the pirates,"" wailed Pola."
"""I don't care if it is! I don't care _what_ it is!"" And Mart and Sidney"
lifted their chorus.
"Out of the mist that lay over the surging water a small, gray object"
gradually shaped. The chug-chug of an engine now came distinctly to
their ears. After a little they could make out the forms of two men
standing. And then someone shouted faintly.
"Pola, a solemn happiness transfiguring her face, clung to Sidney."
"""Girls,"" she whispered, ""We're going to be saved! And I'll never forget"
this night--never. Or you two. Or what you've done! Or what you _are_.
"And I'm never going to get over being ashamed of myself!"""
Sidney had some solemn resolutions of her own shaping in her heart but
the moment gave her no time to pronounce them.
"""Am I he who slew Raniero Frangipani?"""
"""Courage!"" said the duke."
"""My blood is as water, my heart as wax. Death and destiny are over my"
"head!"""
"""Speak not to me of destiny and look not to the skies! I have closed"
my account with Heaven! In himself is man's power! You have broken the
crucifix! Now trust your own soul. So long as you did serve a
"superstition had you lost your true heaven!"""
"""And yet--"""
"""You have played the god, and the Father in Heaven must love you for"
your strength! God does not love a coward! He will let you rule your
"destiny--not destiny your soul!"""
"""Strange words--"""
"""But true! Were I God, should I love the monk puling prayers in a den?"
Nay--that man should I choose who dared to follow the dictates of his
own soul and strangle Fate with the grip of truth. Great deeds are

The horseman in the valley had swept at a gallop through a sea of
"sun-bronzed fern. His eyes were full of a restless glitter, as the"
"eyes of a man, whose heart is troubled. He sprang from the saddle,"
"and, leading his horse by the bridle, bent low before the twain."
"""Tidings, my lord!"""
leaned far back in his arms.
"""No,"" was the man's truthful answer."
"""Oh, how glad I am! Take me--ah, take me I don't care where as long as"
"it is with you!"" cried the Girl in an ecstasy of delight."
"""So help me, God, I'm going to . . .!"" promised Johnson, his voice"
"strained, tense. ""You're worth something better than me, Girl,"" he"
"added, a moment later, ""but they say love works miracles every hour,"
that it weakens the strong and strengthens the weak. With all my soul I
"love you, with all my soul I--"" The man let his voice die out, leaving"
"his sentence unfinished. Suddenly he called: ""Why, Min-Minnie!"""
"""I wasn't really asleep,"" spoke up the Girl, blinking sleepily. ""I'm"
"jest so happy an' let down, that's all."" The next moment, however, she"
was forced to acknowledge that she was awfully sleepy and would have to
say good-night.
"""All right,"" said Johnson, rising, and kissed her good-night."
"""That's your bed over there,"" she told him, pointing in the direction of"
the curtains.
"""But hadn't you better take the bed and let me sleep over here?"""
"""Not much!"""
"""You're sure you would be more comfortable by the fire--sure, now?"""

"remarkable ability, and in his later calling of piracy he gained great"
"notoriety, and was a born leader of men. His history has been written"
"“_Allons d’ici_,” she whispered, turning a terrified glance around."
The man raised his hat to his companions and signed to her to come. He
"was a handsome, careless, dissipated-looking fellow, with curly hair and"
a twirled black moustache; short and slightly made. He wore a Tyrolese
hat and a very low turned-down collar and a great silk bow outside
his waistcoat. There was a devil-may-care charm in his swagger as
he walked--also an indefinable touch of vulgarity; the type of the
_cabotin_ in easy circumstances.
"Yvonne, more dead than alive, followed him through the deserted _salle"
"des jeux_ on to the quiet bit of verandah, and sank into a chair that he"
"offered. She looked at him, still white to the lips."
“You?”
"“Yes,” he said laughingly, “why not? It is not astonishing.”"
"“But I thought you dead!” gasped Yvonne, trembling."
"“_A la bonne heure!_ And I seem a ghost. Oh, I am solid. Pinch me. But"
how did you come to learn? Ah! I remember it was given out in Paris. A
"_canard_. It was in the hospital--paralysis, _ma chère_. See, I can only"
"just move my arm now. _Cétait la verte, cette sacrée verte--_”"
"“Absinthe?” asked Yvonne, almost mechanically."
"He nodded, went through the motions of preparing the drink, and laughed."
"“I had a touch lately,” he went on. “That was the second. The third I"
shall be _prrrt--flambé!_ They tell me to give it up. Never in life.”
"""Wouldn't it be a good idea to call him again? It's rather important!"""
"""Oh, you think we shouldn't have gone out in a storm like this? I've"
"been dreadfully uneasy!"""
"""No danger at all,"" I declared, with affected indifference, adding: ""The"
"weather isn't half as rough as 'the old dear' will be, take my word for"
"it!"""
"A shadow of mystification passed over her wonderful face, yet she smiled"
"with well-bred tolerance, saying:"
"""You are quite droll."""
"""Drollery is the brother of good fellowship,"" I replied, helping her"
"across the reeling cabin. As I had feared, she went directly to my room"
where the door had swung back showing an empty bunk.
"""Why, he's up, after all,"" she glanced over her shoulder at me."
"""I believe he is,"" I idiotically affirmed."
"""But where?""--this more to herself."
"""Hiding, maybe,"" I ventured, taking a facetious squint about."
"""Hiding?"" she asked, in mild surprise."
"""Er--playing a trick on us! He's a funny old dog at tricks!"""
"""Funny old dog?"" She drew slightly away from me. ""Do you mean my father,"
"Mr.--er?"""
"""We've got his horse,"" he said pointedly."
"""An' I never knowed one o' these men to separate from his horse,"""
"commented Sonora, still smarting under the Girl's reprimand."
"""Right you are! And now that we've got his horse and this storm is on,"
"we've got him,"" said Rance, triumphantly. ""But the last seen of"
"Johnson,"" he went on with a hasty movement towards the Girl and eyeing"
"her critically, ""he was heading this way. You seen anything of him?"""
The Girl struggled hard to appear composed.
"""Heading this way?"" she inquired, reddening."
"""So Nick said,"" declared Sonora, looking towards that individual for"
proof of his words.
But Nick had caught the Girl's lightning glance imposing silence upon
him; in some embarrassment he stammered out:
"""That is, he was--Sid said he saw 'im take the trail, too."""
"""But the trail ends here,"" pointed out Rance, at the same time looking"
"hard at the Girl. ""And if she hasn't seen him, where was he going?"""
At this juncture Nick espied a cigar butt on the floor; unseen by the
"others, he hurriedly picked it up and threw it in the fire."
"""One o' our dollar Havanas! Good Lord, he's here!"" he muttered to"
himself.
"""Rance is right. Where was he goin'?"" was the question with which he was"

"""I could have you,"" murmured Johnson, meditatively."
The Girl nodded eagerly.
There was a long silence in which Johnson was trying to make up his mind
"to tear himself away from her,--the one woman whom he loved in the"
"world,--for it had been slowly borne in upon him that he was not a fit"
mate for this pure young girl. Nor was his unhappiness lessened when he
"recalled how she had struggled against yielding to him. At last,"
"difficult though it was, he took his courage in both hands, and said:"
"""Girl, I have looked into your heart and my own and now I realise what"
"this means for us both--for you, Girl--and knowing that, it seems hard"
"to say good-bye as I should, must and will . . ."""

"her feet and gazed upon him, round-eyed."

The stenographer acted very queerly. At first she seemed overcome with
amazement; then tears flowed from her wondering eyes; and then she
"smiled sunnily through them, and one of her arms slid tenderly about"
the broker’s neck.

We drew our breakfast and packed up our belongings. All was confusion in
the hut.
"We paraded, the roll was called, and as the day began to dawn we marched"
off.
"We passed down the main road in long, swaying columns of fours. We left"
the woodyard behind us and hoped it would be destroyed--how we hated the
place for the dreary months we had spent there! The westward stream of
"refugees had ceased, but an eastward stream of French infantry and field"
artillery thronged the roads. The artillerymen were mostly tall and
powerfully built. The infantry were nearly all elderly men of poor
physique. They looked desperately miserable. We exchanged greetings:
"""It's a good war!"""
"""C'est une bonne guerre!"""
And then we broke into song:
"""Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, _Oh_ it's a lovely war!"""
"The French did not sing, but we, who were escaping destruction, passed"

_CORNERS OF ROME_
"They went back to the carriage, and having crossed through the centre of"
"Rome, got out in front of the Farnese Palace."
"“I will be out inside of ten minutes,” said Kennedy."
The Farnese Palace aroused great admiration in Cæsar; he had never
"passed it before. By one of the fountains in the _piazza,_ he stood"
"gazing at the huge square edifice, which seemed to him like a die cut"
from an immense block of stone.
"“This really gives me an impression of grandeur and force,” he said to"
himself. “What a splendid palace! It looks like an ancient knight in
"full armour, looking indifferently at everything, sure of his own"
worth.”
"Cæsar walked from one end of the _piazza_ to the other, absorbed in the"
majestic pile of stone.
Kennedy surprised him in his contemplation.
“Now will you say that you are a good philistine?”
"“Ah, well, this palace is magnificent. Here are grandeur, strength,"
overwhelming force.”
"“Yes, it is magnificent; but very uncomfortable, my French colleagues"
tell me.”

"“All we know about it is that they’re not here,” replied Jimmie."
"“There are altogether too many bears in this forest,” suggested Gilroy."
“The lads may have encountered some of them.”
“That’s a fact!” laughed Jimmie. “Perhaps we’d better go out and see if
we can find a group of pine trees bearing a mess of Boy Scouts.”
"“This is a serious matter,” Ned interrupted. “Judging from our own"
"experiences, the boys may be having a bad time of it.”"
“The outlaws are none too good to commit murder!” Jimmie asserted.
CHAPTER XI
THE DEVIL’S PUNCH BOWL
"“See here, boys,” Frank Shaw suggested, as the three boys moved on"
"through the forest, almost entirely surrounded by repulsive half-breeds,"
"“this will be a fine story for Dad’s newspaper. ‘Captured by Bold, Bad"
"Men; or, Why Little Frankie Didn’t Get Home to His Beans’! That would be"
"a fine title for the story, and I’ll ask Dad to print a picture of three"
boys wandering through a jungle surrounded by a bunch of cheap skates
that no decent dog would bark at.”
“Keep still!” whispered Harry. “What’s the use of stirring these people
up? We’re in no shape to scrap with them!”
"""I'm a domestic man,"" he said suddenly.  ""A domestic man in a serious"
line of life; and I never thought to have anything like this in my

Gyp took up her sunshade.  She felt that she must get away; at any moment
he might say something she could not bear--and the smell of mutton rising
fast!
"""I am sorry,"" she said again; ""good-bye""; and moved past him to the door."
"She heard him breathing hard as he followed her to open it, and thought:"
'If only--oh! please let him be silent till I get outside!'  Mr. Wagge
passed her and put his hand on the latch of the front door.  His little
piggy eyes scanned her almost timidly.
"""Well,"" he said, ""I'm very glad to have the privilege of your"
"acquaintance; and, if I may say so, you 'ave--you 'ave my 'earty"
"sympathy.  Good-day."""
"The door once shut behind her, Gyp took a long breath and walked swiftly"
"away.  Her cheeks were burning; and, with a craving for protection, she"
"put up her sunshade.  But the girl's white face came up again before her,"

CHAPTER XVIII
"""HOOK!"""
Sidney found it a little difficult to take up the fun with her
erstwhile chums where she had left off. When she stopped at the
"Calkins' house directly after breakfast, Mart coolly declined to go"
"anywhere with her, and smiled scornfully at her bare legs."
"""I s'pose your million-dollar friend is otherwise engaged today!"""
"Sidney truthfully admitted that she was. ""She's gone to Chatham with"
her mother to see some people they know. And I'm glad. I've been just
"dying for a good swim. Let's go out to the _Arabella_ this morning."""
But Mart declared she was tired of all that. In fact she was tired of
doing lots of the silly things they'd been doing. She'd promised Gert
Bartow to go there right after lunch.
Sidney had no choice but to go on alone in search of Lav. She was
discouraged to the point of tears. Yet she knew in her heart that she
deserved Mart's coldness. She remembered how she had felt once when
Nancy had deserted her for a new girl at Miss Downs'. And it had
seriously threatened their friendship.
As she wandered slowly toward the town Sidney wondered what Mart and
Gert Bartow were going to do. Gert Bartow was a girl of nineteen at
"least, and much more grown up than even that. Mart had pointed her out"
to Sidney. Sidney wished Mart had asked her to go with her to Gert's.
She felt very lonely.

THE ANGLO-JAPANESE ALLIANCE AND AMERICA[1]
AN INTERVIEW
"'Our people,' said Baron Suyematsu, 'like the British people, favour"
the renewal of the Anglo-Japanese alliance. They also favour its
"extension. The nature of such extension demands careful thought, of"
"course. I will not go into details, but I will say that a more effectual"
"alliance is desirable from the standpoints of both England and Japan,"
and I also think from the standpoint of America. Japan's interest is too
"obvious to require mention; but England's interest, in my opinion, is"
equally real. Russia and England are in contact throughout Asia and
friction is constant. England needs strengthening against Russia and
He was borne out of the room. The Rogan leader turned to Brand and
spoke.
"""He says that if your comrade does not tell him what he wants to know,"
"your turn will come next,"" sobbed Greca. ""Oh! Why does not The Great"
"White One strike these monsters to the dust!"""
She ran to Brand and pressed her satiny cheek to his. Then she was
dragged roughly away.
The great door clanged shut. The heavy outer fastenings clicked into
place. Dex had gone to experience whatever it was that Journeyman and
the rest had experienced in this red hell. And Brand was left behind
to reflect on what dread torments this might comprise; and to pray
desperately that no matter what might be done to his shrinking body he
would be strong enough to refuse to betray his planet.
CHAPTER V
_The Torture Chamber_
"Swiftly Dex was carried down the long ramp to the ground floor, the"
arms of his captors gripping him with painful tightness. Heading the
"procession was the immensely tall, gangling Rogan leader, clutching"
Greca by the wrist and dragging her indifferently along to be his
mouthpiece.
“Quick!” he repeated.
It was too late.
"“For God’s sake, Kennedy,” shouted a voice at the street door, “what"
are you doing here?”
"It was McLear himself. He had come with the Hale patrol, on his mettle"
now to take care of the epidemic of robberies.
Before Craig could reply a cab drew up with a rush at the curb and two
"men, half fighting, half cursing, catapulted themselves into the shop."
They were Winters and Moulton.
"Without a word, taking advantage of the first shock of surprise,"
Kennedy had clapped a piece of chemical paper on the foreheads of Mrs.
"Moulton, then of Moulton, and on Muller’s. Oblivious to the rest of us,"
he studied the impressions in the full light of the counter.
Moulton was facing his wife with a scornful curl of the lip.
“I’ve been told of the paste replica—and I wrote Schloss that I’d shoot
"him down like the dog he is, you—you traitress,” he hissed."
She drew herself up scornfully.
“And I have been told why you married me—to show off your wicked jewels
and help you in your—”
“You lie!” he cried fiercely. “Muller—some one—open this safe—whosever
"it is. If what I have been told is true, there is in it one new bag"
religious music.
"“Spain is the place for all that,” said Kennedy. “Here in Italy the"
"Church ceremonies are too gay. Not so in Spain; at Toledo, at Burgos,"
"there is an austerity in the cathedrals, an unworldliness....”"
"“Yes,” said Cæsar; “unhappily we have nothing left there but"
"ceremonies. At the same time, the people are dying of hunger.”"
"They discussed whether it is better to live in a decorative, esthetic"
"sphere, or in a more humble and practical one; and Susanna and Kennedy"
stood up for the superiority of an esthetic life.
As they left the hotel Cæsar said to Kennedy:
“Allow me a question. Have you any intentions concerning Mrs.
Marchmont?”
“Why do you ask?”
"“Simply because I shouldn’t go to see her often, so as not to be in the"
way.”
“Thank you ever so much. But I have no intentions in relation to her.
She is too beautiful and too rich a woman for a modest employee like me
to fix his eyes on.”
“Bah! A modest diplomat! That is absurd. It is merely that you don’t
take to her.”
“No. It’s because she is a queen. There ought to be some defect in her
face to make her human.”
"“Now, now,” said Fluffy Reubens, sprawling in two chairs. “Chuck it,"
Blotte--you make me feel as cold as a dead undertaker.... Lor!” he
"yawned, “this is precious slow.” He yawned again: “Paul Pangbutt’s a"
"confounded long time, ain’t he? Scenting his beard, I suspect!”"
"Andrew Blotte roused from his mood, and he began to pace up and down"
the room as before: “No more Italian waiters for me--with cursèd oily
"locks,” he cried--“no more grease-spots on dingy grey tablecloths that"
hide their offences under smiling napkins!... To-night I shall be
waited upon by the gods.... Never again the boiled potato; never again
"the homely bun, damn them!... This is the night of life--a night for"
"music and gaiety and minstrelsy.... Hunger shall cease, and pain----”"
"Rippley went up to him and took him by the shoulder, kindly:"
"“Stop it, Blotte. Aren’t you well, old man?”"
Blotte laughed:
“Well?... Psha! I am like a boy. The new genius arrives to-night. And I
go off--to sup with the gods.... The world has forgotten Andrew Blotte.”
"Rippley turned, a twinkle in his eye, to the others:"
"“I say, boys,” said he--“as it’s to be a unique night, and Blotte"
"about to be translated, and may be in the papers in the morning----”"
"Blotte laughed grimly, where he paced:"
"“Oh, yes,” he growled--“I shall be in the papers to-morrow. Have no"
fear of it.”
"“I wanted to tell you about it, that 's all,” said Risca. “I made up my"
mind this afternoon. The only thing is what the deuce am I to do with a
child of fifteen in Fenton Square?”
“Is she pretty?”
"“Lord, no. Coarse, undersized little cockney, ugly as sin.”"
"“Anyhow,” said Herold, extinguishing his cigarette in the ash-tray,"
"“it's out of the question.” He rose from his chair. “Look here,” he"
"cried with an air of inspiration, “why not send her down to The Channel"
House?”
“I'm not going to shift responsibilities on to other people's
"shoulders,” John growled in his obstinate way. “This child 's my"
"responsibility. I 'm going to see her through somehow. As to Southcliff,"
"you must be crazy to suggest it. What's to prevent her, one fine"
"day, from getting into Stella's room and talking? My God! it would be"
appalling!”
Herold agreed. He had spoken thoughtlessly.
"“I should just think so,” said Risca. “The idea of such a tale of horror"
being told in that room--”
"The dresser entered. “Miss Mercier has just gone on, sir.”"
"“Well, just think out something else till I come back,” said Herold. “At"
"any rate, Fenton Square won't do.”"
He left John to smoke and meditate among the clothes hanging up on pegs
Rays of the afternoon sun in a glimmer across the trees;
"Glittering moist underfoot, the long alley. The firs, one by one,"

At I wait for my love in the fir-tree alley alone with the sun.

waking life. It may be worth while to bring forward a few dreams which
incidentally illustrate the moral attitude of the dreamer.
A lady narrated the following dream immediately on awakening: 'I had
murdered a woman from some moral or political motive--I forget what--and
had come in great agony to my husband with her shoes and watch-chain. He
"promised to help me, and while I was wondering what could be done for"
"the benefit of the woman's family, some one came in and announced that a"
"lecture was about to be given on the beauty of nakedness. I then went,"
with several prim and respectable ladies of my acquaintance [the names
"were given], into a crowded hall. The lecturer who--so far as appearance"
"is concerned--was a well-known Member of Parliament, then entered and"
"gave a most eloquent address on Whitman, nakedness, ugly figures, etc."
He especially emphasised the fact that the reason people are shocked at
nakedness is that they usually only see unbeautiful bodies which repel
"them because they are unlike their ideals. Then he put out his hand, and"
"writing _France, Isle de_; _Man, Isle of_; _Wight, Isle of_:"
"e.g., _Cod, Cape_; _George, Lake_; _Washington, Mt._; _Moultrie,"
Fort_; but _Cape Breton Island_. When the name of a fort becomes
"the name of a city, of course the inversion must be abandoned, as"
_Fort Wayne_.
"Forenames are to be used in the form employed by their owners,"
"however unusual, as _Will Carleton, Sally (Pratt) McLean, Hans"
"Droysen, Fritz Reuter_."
Give names of places in the English form. (Cross-reference from
"the vernacular, if necessary): e.g., _Munich_ not _Muenchen_ or"
"_München_, _Vienna_ not _Wien_, _Austria_ not _Oesterreich_."
But if both the English and the foreign forms are used by English
"writers, prefer the foreign form: e.g., _Dauphiné_ rather than"
_Dauphiny_.
Use the modern name of a city and cross-reference to it from the
"ancient, provided its existence has been continuous and there is"
no doubt as to the identity.
Distinctive epithets are to be in the same language as the name:
"e.g.,"
"_Kniaz, fürst von, Freiherr zu, duc de Magenta, Bishop of Lincoln,"
"évêque de Meaux_; but _Emperor of Germany, King of France_, not"
"_kaiser_ and _roi_, when names of sovereign princes are given in"
English. Treat in the same way patronymics habitually joined with a
"person's name; as, _Clemens Alexandrinus_."
"Prefixes (i.e., titles which in speaking come before the name), as"
"_Hon., Mrs., Rev._, etc., should in the heading be placed before"
"the Christian name (as _Smith, Capt. John_), and suffixes as"
"_Jr., D.D., LL.D._, after it (as _Channing, James Ellery, D.D._)."
"Hereditary titles generally follow the Christian name, as _Derby,"
"Thomas Stanley, 1st earl of_; but British courtesy titles (i.e.,"
"those given to the younger sons of dukes and marquesses) precede,"
"as _Wellesley, Lord Charles (2d son of the Duke of Wellington)_. In"
"other languages than English, French, and German the title usually"
"precedes the forename; as, _Alfieri, Conte Vittorio_. Occasionally a"
"French nobleman uniformly places his title before his forenames; as,"
"_Gasparin, Comte Agénor de_."
_Lord_ should be replaced by the exact title in the names of English
"noblemen: e.g., Lord Macaulay should be entered as _Macaulay, 1st"
baron_. _Lord_ in the title of Scotch judges follows the family name;
"as, _Kames, H. Home, afterwards Lord_."
"The title Baronet is given in the form _Scott, Sir Walter, bart._"
"Patronymic phrases, as _of Dedham_, follow all the names; but they must"
immediately follow the family name when they are always used in close
"connection with it, as _Girault de St. Farjeau, Eusèbe_; similarly"
"_aîné_, _fils_, _jeune_, as _Dumas fils, Alexandre_; _Didot fils,"
Ambroise_. Latin appellatives should not in general be separated from
"their nouns by a comma; as, _Caesar Heisterbacensis_."
"The name of a king's wife should be written thus: _Charlotte, Queen,"
"consort of George III of England_. _Anne Boleyn Queen, 2d consort of"
Henry VIII of England._
"Andrews said scornfully, ""Without a doubt, a man of your age and build"
"could wipe up the lifeship with me."""
"Norton chuckled. ""Don't count on your age being good protection,"
Andrews. You may push me far enough to make me forget that you're a
"decrepit old man who has to buy what your physique can't get you."""
"""Now see here!"" roared Andrews."
*       *       *       *       *
He was stopped short by Norton who took one long step forward to grasp
"him by the coat lapels. Andrews' face went white, because he was"
looking into the face of dark anger. Norton's other hand was clenched
"in a large, tight fist. He eyed the older man sourly for a minute, then"
shoved him backward to collapse in a chair.
"""What are you trying to do?"" sneered Norton. ""Make me mad enough to"
clip you so you can yell 'Foul!'? I know as well as you do that the law
doesn't even recognize taunts and tongue-lashings as contributory to
"assault."""
"Alice got up from her couch and stood between them. ""Stop it, both of"
"you!"" she cried. ""Stop it!"""
"Norton's anger subsided. ""All right,"" he said to Andrews. ""Now that"
"we've all had our lungs exercised, I'll go below and pedal that"
"generator. Alice, you can have the bathroom first. Andrews, you take it"
"with what she leaves. Is that okay?"""
"""Aren't you the hard-working little Boy Scout?"""
"""I--I have joined Sir Robert Perry's Ministry,"" he answered."
"""Of course he has, Alicia,"" interposed Lady Eynesford hastily."
"Alicia seated herself on the sofa, remarking as she did so,"
"""Well, you do change a good deal, don't you?"""
"""Really, Miss Derosne,"" he stammered, ""I don't understand you."""
"""Oh, I only mean that you were first with Sir Robert, then with Mr."
"Medland, and now with Sir Robert again! And presently with Mr. Medland"
"again, I suppose?"""
"""She doesn't appreciate the political reasons,"" began Lady Eynesford,"
"with troubled brow and smiling lips; but Coxon, frowning angrily, broke"
"in,"
"""Not the last, I promise you, anyhow, Miss Derosne."""
"""What, you think he's finally beaten then?"""
"""That's not the question. Beaten or not, he is discredited, and no"
"respectable man would act with him."""
"""We needn't discuss--"" began Lady Eynesford again, but this time Alicia"
"was the interrupter. She spoke in a cold, hard way, very unlike her own."
"""If he won, you would all be at his feet."""
Coxon was justified in being angry at her almost savage scorn of him;
"regardless of anything except his wrong, he struck back the sharpest"
"There was a brief, noisy interval, during which Emerson was too"
astounded to attempt an answer to the questions hurled broadcast by the
"new-comers; then Marsh levelled a trembling finger at him and cried,"
hysterically:
"""There he is, men. He tried to murder me. I--I'm hurt. I'll have him"
"arrested."""
The seriousness of the accusation struck the young man on the instant;
he turned upon the group.
"""I didn't do that. I heard a fight going on and ran in here--"""
"""He's a liar,"" the wounded man interrupted, shrilly. ""He stabbed me!"
"See?"" He tried to strip the shirt from his wounds, then fell to"
"chattering and shaking. ""Oh, God! I'm hurt."" He staggered to a"
packing-case and sank upon it weakly fumbling at his sodden shoulder.
"""I didn't do that,"" repeated Boyd. ""I don't know who stabbed him. I"
"didn't."""
"""Then who did?"" some one demanded."
"""What are you doing in here? You'd a killed him in a minute,"" said the"
man with the lantern.
"""We'll fix you for this,"" a third voice threatened."
"""Listen,"" Boyd said, in a tone to make them pause. ""There has been a"
"mistake here. I was passing the building when I heard a woman scream,"
"and I rushed in to prevent Marsh from choking her to death."""

"83,672. He could not understand why men went to Japan and Canada instead"
of coming to India on better terms. It was a mystery to him. He thought
it was either sheer ignorance or the spread of the commercial spirit.

"a rule, keen and anxious to learn; he could not wish for better"

PROF. J. C. BOSE AT MADURA
On his way back to Calcutta from the Fourth Scientific Deputation to the
"West, Prof. J. C. Bose visited Madura, 14th June 1915. The Tamil Sangam"
presented him with an address. In reply Dr. Bose made an important
"speech, in course of which he said:--"
I am no longer a representative of Bengal nor have I come to a strange
"place, but as an Indian addressing the mighty India and her people. When"
we realise that unity of our destiny then a great future opens out for
us.
"calmly, and added, with a sigh, ""I have no doubt he would have landed"
"you in rather an awkward fix ... had we not taken pity upon you."""
"""Ah!""  And the angry soldier raised his hand.  ""There are two of them"
"...  One of them discovered it, the other wrote the petition, the"
"accursed reporter!"""
"""Why the reporter?"""
"""He writes for the papers ...  He is one of your lodgers ... there they"
"all are outside ...  Clear them away, for Christ's sake!  The robbers!"
They disturb and annoy everyone in the street.  One cannot live for
them ... And they are all desperate fellows ...  You had better take
"care, or else they will rob or burn you ..."""
"""And this reporter, who is he?"" asked Petunikoff, with interest."
"""He?  A drunkard.  He was a teacher but was dismissed.  He drank"
everything he possessed ... and now he writes for the papers and
"composes petitions.  He is a very wicked man!"""
"""H'm!  And did he write your petition, too?  I suppose it was he who"
discovered the flaws in the building.  The beams were not rightly put
"in?"""
"""He did!  I know it for a fact!  The dog!  He read it aloud in here and"
"boasted, 'Now I have caused Petunikoff some loss!'"""
"""Ye--es...  Well, then, do you want to be reconciled?"""
"""To be reconciled?""  The soldier lowered his head and thought. ""Ah!"
"This is a hard life!"" said he, in a querulous voice, scratching his"
"listlessly, and his large head drooped forward as if at last its weight"
had proven too great for the squat body.
"""What's wrong?"" I asked."
"""How do you know there is anything wrong, my boy Jack?"""
"""You look so killingly happy,"" Tommy said, joining us."
"Monsieur's pale eyes stared for a moment, then blinked several times"
before he murmured:
"""The man I went to see is dead--murdered, just after he mailed that"
report. So I have no information. These police called it suicide because
a knife lay in his hand. Bah! I could place a knife in the hand of any
"man I kill!"""
"""Was he a friend of yours?"""
"""No. I have never seen him. But he knew something!"""
"""He evidently knew too much,"" Tommy suggested."
"""You speak true, my boy. It seems to be a dangerous thing here to know"
"too much of certain matters!"""
"""Well,"" I laughed, trying to put a heartiness in my voice and drive away"
"his depression, ""let's go ashore for dinner! Then the Opera--and"
"afterwards another bite where the high life eats? What-say, Professor?"""
"As it turned out, however, neither the dinner, nor all of Tommy's"
"banter, nor Madame Butterfly sung in Spanish (as if it could!) succeeded"
"He shook hands with Lovegood and Aubrey; and, turning to Ffolliott, a"
faint smile flickered over his worried face:
"“Ffolliott!... Sorry to be late, but there have been domestic"
difficulties--my butler has gone sick.”
The guests were arriving fast.
“Mistair Maupassant Fosse!” bawled Rippley at the door.
"The little man glared at the servant, fussed into the room, and tripped"
across to his host.
"“A nickname they have for me,” he said--“a nickname....”"
"Rippley watched Blotte solemnly tramp down the stairs, his wig on one"
"side; heard him announce to a lady, just arrived, that he was going to"
sup with the gods; and he was gone.
Groups of guests came swarming up the stairs and passed into the studio.
"Rippley, glancing into the studio, saw the white satin dress of"
Ffolliott move uneasily amongst the arriving guests; and he heard his
"thin, affected drawl as he explained to his host:"
“D’you know--I feel such an ass----”
Pangbutt patted him upon the shoulder:
"“Never mind,” said he absently--“it can’t be helped. Make the best of"
it.”
"""But the police?"" queried Boyd."
"""Oh, I squared them easy. It's you they want. Yes, sir, I _worked_."""
"Again he scanned their faces anxiously. ""I'm a scullery-maid."""
"""What?"""
"""That's what I said. I've rustled garbage-cans till the smell of food"
"gives me a cold sweat. I'm as hungry as a starving Cuban, and yet the"
"sight of a knife and fork turns my stomach."" He wheeled suddenly upon"
"Alton Clyde, whose burst of shrill laughter offended him. ""Don't cry."
"Your sympathy unmans me."""
"""Tell us about it,"" urged Cherry."
"""What's the use?"" he demanded, with a glare at Clyde. ""That bone-head"
"wouldn't understand."""
"""Go ahead,"" Boyd seconded, with twitching lips. ""You look as if you had"
"worked, and worked hard."""
"""Hard? I'm the only man in the world who knows what hard work is!"""
"""Start at the beginning--when you were arrested."""
"""Well, I didn't care nothing about the sneeze,"" he took up the tale,"
"""for I figure it out that they can't slough me without clearing you, so"
"I never take no sleeping-powders, and, sure enough, about third"
"drink-time the bulls spring me, and I screw down the main stem to the"
"drink and get Jerry to your fade--"""
"“You are bothering me and preventing me from drinking my coffee,” he"
"said, with exquisite politeness, and touched the bell."
"“Be careful!” exclaimed the monk, seizing Cæsar’s arm with violence."
"“Don’t you touch me again,” said Cæsar, pulling away violently, his"
"face pale and his eyes flashing. “If you do, I have a revolver here with"
"five chambers, and I shall take pleasure in emptying them one by one,"
"taking that lighthouse you carry about for a nose, as my target.”"
“Fire it if you dare.”
Fortunately the waiter had come in on hearing the bell.
"“Do you wish anything, sir?” he asked."
"“Yes, please escort this clerical gentleman to the door, and tell him on"
the way not to come back here.”
Days later Cæsar found out that there had been a great disturbance at
the Altemps palace in consequence of the calls he had made. Preciozi
"had been punished and sent away from Rome, and the various Spanish"
monasteries and colleges warned not to receive Cæsar.

"He opened the door softly. She was sitting in a large armchair, over a"
"little bit of bright fire; save for gleams suddenly coming and going, as"
"a coal blazed and died down again, the room was in darkness. He walked"
"up to her and knelt by the chair, his head almost on a level with hers."
"""Well, Daisy, what are you doing?"""
She put out a hand and laid it on his with a gentle pressure.
"""I'm thinking,"" she said. ""Do you want a light?"""
"""No, I like it dark best--best for what I have to say."""
"Suddenly she threw her arms round his neck, drawing him to her and"
kissing his face.
"""I'd do the same if you'd killed him yourself,"" she whispered in the"
"extravagance of her love, and kissed him again."
"""But, Daisy, you don't know."""
"""Yes, I do. He told me. He's been here."""
"""Who?"""
"""Jack Norburn. He said you would hate telling me, so he did. You mustn't"

"'It should be in this direction,' Steve said, with an accent of doubt."
'But I cannot see. We shall have the horses down.'
"'Let me go first,' I said."
"'We must not separate,' he answered hastily."
"'No, no,' I said, my teeth beginning to chatter. 'But are you sure"
that there is an eyot here?'
"'I did not go to it,' he answered, scratching his head. 'But I saw a"
"clump of willows rising well above the level, and they looked to me as"
if they grew on dry land.'
"He stood a moment irresolutely, first one and then another of the"
horses shaking itself till the women could scarcely keep their seats.
'Why do we not go on?' my lady asked in a low voice.
"'Because Steve is not sure of the place, my lady,' I said. 'And it is"
"almost impossible to move, it is so dark, and the osiers grow so"
closely. I doubt we should have waited until daylight.'
"'Then we should have run the risk of being intercepted,' she answered"
feverishly. 'Are you very wet?'
"'No,' I said, though my feet were growing numb, 'not very. I see what"
we must do. One of us must climb into a willow and look out.'
We had passed a small one not long before. I plashed my way back to

Look at Rippley! he’s utterly uncultured--he hasn’t an aitch in his
composition.”
Gomme nodded:
"“But there isn’t an aitch in composition,” he said demurely."
"“N-no.” Fosse stammered, becoming nervous. “But he can’t even pronounce"
the names of the ancients whose gods he models!”
Gomme smiled:
“No--but he can model ’em.”

The scene of the story is Newfoundland. The story deals with the love
"of Black Dennis Nolan, a young giant and self-appointed skipper of the"
"little fishing hamlet of Chance Along, for Flora Lockhart, a beautiful"
"professional singer, who is rescued by Dennis from a wreck on the"
"treacherous coast of Newfoundland, when on her way from England to the"
"United States. The story is a strong one all through, with a mystery"
"that grips, plenty of excitement and action, and the author presents"
life in the open in all its strength and vigor. Mr. Roberts is one of
the younger writers whom the critics have been watching with interest.
"In ""The Harbor Master"" he has surely arrived."
"""They was here first,"" said Lampert obstinately."
"""But the hisland is British ground,"" urged Simcox, ""and where our"
flag flies no Frenchman can have the best.  We gives 'em liberty to
"trade, and they can take what's left.  What for have we always beat"
"'em if we're to give in now?"""
"""Continuosity of foreign politics is my motter,"" said the skipper."
"""With continuosity and joodishus firmness, and a polite 'hout o'"
"this,' you'll see 'em listen to reason, and evacuate.  I shall send"
"hin my hultimatum this very afternoon.  And you, Simcox, shall be"
"hambassador."""
Simcox looked anxious.
"""Well, captain, I was thinking it would be judicious policy to send"
in the Dutchman.  It will remind them that Europe is more or less
"agin them, and to have a Dutchman here will make 'em think twice"
"afore they elects for war."""
The skipper shook his head.
"""No, Simcox, it looks judicious on the surface, but takin' deeper"
"thought it ain't.  It would aggerawate them, and that ain't policy."
"We fights if we must, but don't start it by doin' anythin' unpleasin'"
more'n askin' for our rights.  And in n'gotiashuns it ain't policy to
remind 'em deliberate of the time the Prooshians beat 'em.  And

"hultimatum at once."""
ever-increasing recklessness--began presently to possess us. Once or
"twice I had to check the foremost, or they would have outrun the rear;"
"and this kind of race brought us gradually into such a state of alarm,"
"that by-and-by, when the line came to a sudden stop on the brow of a"
"gentle descent, I could hardly restrain my impatience."
'What is it?' I asked eagerly. 'Why are we stopping?' Surely the road
is good enough here.'
"No one answered, but it was significant that on the instant one of the"
women began to cry.
'Stop that folly!' I said. 'What is in front there? Cannot some one
speak?'
"'The Waldgrave thinks that he hears horsemen before us,' Fraulein Max"
answered.
In another moment the Waldgrave's figure loomed out of the darkness.
"'Martin,' he said--I noticed that his voice shook--'go forward. They"
"are in front. Man alive, be quick!' he continued fiercely. 'Do you"
want to have them into us?'
"I left my girl's rein, and pushing past the women and Fraulein, joined"
"Steve, who was standing by my lady's rein. 'What is it?' I said."
"'Nothing, I think,' he answered in an uncertain tone."
"I stood a moment listening, but I too could hear nothing. I began to"
argue with him. 'Who heard it?' I asked impatiently.
"'The Waldgrave,' he answered."
"MORGAN, COLONEL BLODRE, or BLEDRY."
This buccaneer was probably a relation of Sir Henry Morgan. He was an
important person in Jamaica between 1660 and 1670. At the taking of Panama
by Henry Morgan in 1670 the Colonel commanded the rearguard of 300 men. In
"May, 1671, he was appointed to act as Deputy Governor of Providence Island"
by Sir James Modyford.
"MORGAN, LIEUT.-COLONEL EDWARD. Buccaneer."
Uncle and father-in-law of Sir Henry Morgan.
"In 1665, when war had been declared on Holland, the Governor of Jamaica"
issued commissions to several pirates and buccaneers to sail to and attack
"the Dutch islands of St. Eustatius, Saba, and Curacao. Morgan was put in"
"command of ten ships and some 500 men; most of them were ""reformed"
"prisoners,"" while some were condemned pirates who had been pardoned in"
order to let them join the expedition.
"Before leaving Jamaica the crews mutinied, but were pacified by the"
promise of an equal share of all the spoils that should be taken. Three
"ships out of the fleet slipped away on the voyage, but the rest arrived at"
"St. Kitts, landed, and took the fort. Colonel Morgan, who was an old and"
"corpulent man, died of the heat and exertion during the campaign."
"MORGAN, LIEUT.-COLONEL THOMAS."

shot out just as the door opened behind Slyne's back and a voice
announced:
"""M. Dubois."""
CHAPTER XV
THE LAW--AND THE PROFITS
Sallie saw how Jasper Slyne's face blanched at sight of that very
"untimely intruder, whose keen eyes seemed to take in the situation there"
at a glance.
"Mr. Jobling had fallen backward into a convenient armchair and, with"
"both hands clapped to his nose, was moaning most piteously. Captain Dove"
"was standing over him, with features inflamed, in a very bellicose"
"posture and glaring at the new-comer, toward whom Slyne had turned"
inquiringly.
"""You're--looking for some one, M. Dubois?"" Slyne asked, in a tone of"
"polite surprise, which, Sallie knew, was assumed."
"""A thousand pardons,"" returned that individual. ""I am indeed looking for"
"some one--whom I thought to find here. I had no intention, however, of"
"intruding upon a lady--"" He bowed profusely to Sallie. ""It may be,"" he"
"suggested, ""that I have mistaken the number. Is not this the suite 161?"""
"""One hundred and sixty,"" Slyne told him, and evidently did not think it"
"“I know you are an angel—oh, hang it! You do make me feel as if you"
_were_ my mother.”
"“Now, don’t be unreasonable, or I shall believe that you are a tyrant.”"
"“A tyrant? I? Horri—no, I wish I was. What a model of propriety you"
are! I never should have thought it—I mean—darling! you were always
"such a coquette, you know. Not that I ever thought so. You know I never"
"did—oh, hang it all—but if I let you have your own way in this"
unreasonable—I mean this perfectly natural whim—you might at least
"promise to marry me in a month. And, indeed, I think that if you are an"
"angel, I am a saint.”"
"“Well, on one condition.”"
“Any! Any!”
“It must be an absolute secret until the wedding is over. I hate
"congratulations, and if we are going to have a sensation we might as"
well have a good concentrated one.”
"“I agree with you, and I’ll never find fault with you again. You—”"
Miss Decker almost ran into the room.
"“Jessica!” she cried. “Oh, dear Mr. Dedham, how are you? Jessica, mother"
"has one of her terrible attacks, and I must ask you to stay with her"
while I go for the doctor myself. I cannot trust servants.”
“Let me go! let me go!” cried Teddy. “I’ll bring him back in a quarter
of an hour. Who shall—”
The staff-paymaster spoke seriously. The man was heart and soul in
"his work, and his mental horizon was bounded by official forms and"
other red-tapeism connected with the accountant branch of H.M.
Service.
"""By the by,"" interposed Oswestry, ""Staggles ought to be recommended"
"for the V.C."""
"""What's that, Torps?"" asked Barracombe. ""Our staff-paymaster the"
"V.C.?"""
"""What for?"" inquired the staff-paymaster innocently."
The commander entrenched himself behind a double number of an
illustrated periodical.
"""For bringing Mephisto in out of action,"" he replied with a chuckle."
CHAPTER XXVIII.
THE FOILED AIR RAID.
"LATE that evening the ""Sunderland"" brought up in the Admiralty"
"Harbour at Dover, in company with three other light cruisers, two"
"monitors, and a flotilla of destroyers. All night long the men slept"
"at their guns, while the cruiser's searchlights aided those of the"
forts both ashore and on the breakwater in sweeping the approach to
the sheltered harbour.
THE ORDOVICIAN AND SILURIAN
[Footnote: Often known as the Lower Silurian.]
THE ORDOVICIAN
In North America the Ordovician rocks lie conformably on the
"Cambrian. The two periods, therefore, were not parted by any"
"deformation, either of mountain making or of continental uplift."
The general submergence which marked the Cambrian continued into
the succeeding period with little interruption.
"SUBDIVISIONS AND DISTRIBUTION OF STRATA. The Ordovician series, as"
"they have been made out in New York, are given for reference in"
"the following table, with the rocks of which they are chiefly"
composed:
5 Hudson . . . . . . . . shales
4 Utica  . . . . . . . . shales
3 Trenton  . . . . . . . limestones
2 Chazy  . . . . . . . . limestones
1 Calciferous  . . . . . sandy limestones
These marine formations of the Ordovician outcrop about the
"Cambrian and pre-Cambrian areas, and, as borings show, extend far"
and wide over the interior of the continent beneath more recent
strata. The Ordovician sea stretched from Appalachia across the
"Mississippi valley. It seems to have extended to California,"
although broken probably by several mountainous islands in the

"""Are you going with us?"" Boyd inquired."
"""Sure."""
"""See here. Is life one long succession of surprise parties with you?"""
"""Why, I've figgered on this right along."""
"""But the ship is jammed now. There is no room."""
"""Oh, I fixed that up long ago. I am going to bunk with the steward."""
"""Well, why in the world didn't you let us know you were coming?"""
"""Say, don't kid yourself. You knew I couldn't stay behind."" Fraser blew"
"a cloud of smoke airily. ""I never start anything I can't finish, I keep"
"telling you, and I'm going to put this deal through, now that I've got"
"it started."" With a half-embarrassed laugh and a complete change of"
"manner, he laid his hand upon Boyd's shoulder, saying: ""Pal, I ain't"
"much good to myself or anybody else, but I like you and I want to stick"
"around. Maybe I'll come in useful yet--you can't tell."""
"Emerson had never glimpsed this side of the man's nature, and it rather"
surprised him.
"""Of course you can come along, old man,"" he responded, heartily. ""We're"
"glad to have you."""
To one who has never witnessed the spring sailing of a Northern
"cannery-tender, the event is well worth seeing; it is one of the"
"that scoundrel, not if you do divorce 'im.  No; she'll have her disgrace"
"for nothing."""
"Gyp, who had listened with her head a little bent, raised it suddenly,"
and said:
"""There'll be no public disgrace, Mr. Wagge, unless you make it yourself."
If you send Daphne--Daisy--quietly away somewhere till her trouble's
"over, no one need know anything."""
"Mr. Wagge, whose mouth had opened slightly, and whose breathing could"
"certainly have been heard in the street, took a step forward and said:"
"""Do I understand you to say that you're not goin' to take proceedings,"
"ma'am?"""
"Gyp shuddered, and shook her head."
"Mr. Wagge stood silent, slightly moving his face up and down."
"""Well,"" he said, at length, ""it's more than she deserves; but I don't"
"disguise it's a relief to me.  And I must say, in a young lady like you,"
"and--and handsome, it shows a Christian spirit."" Again Gyp shivered, and"
"shook her head.  ""It does.  You'll allow me to say so, as a man old"
"enough to be your father--and a regular attendant."""
He held out his hand.  Gyp put her gloved hand into it.
"""I'm very, very sorry.  Please be nice to her."""
"Mr. Wagge recoiled a little, and for some seconds stood ruefully rubbing"
his hands together and looking from side to side.
"formidable in small operations. He kept his cab at the door, rang, and"
"asked for Gyp, with a kind of pleasure in his ruse."
"""She's not in yet, sir.  Mr. Fiorsen's in."""
"""Ah!  And baby?"""
"""Yes, sir."""
"""I'll come in and see her.  In the garden?"""
"""Yes, sir."""
"""Dogs there, too?"""
"""Yes, sir.  And will you have tea, please, sir?"""
"""No, thanks.""  How to effect this withdrawal without causing gossip, and"
"yet avoid suspicion of collusion with Gyp?  And he added: ""Unless Mrs."
"Fiorsen comes in."""
"Passing out into the garden, he became aware that Fiorsen was at the"
"dining-room window watching him, and decided to make no sign that he knew"
"this.  The baby was under the trees at the far end, and the dogs came"
rushing thence with a fury which lasted till they came within scent of
"him.  Winton went leisurely up to the perambulator, and, saluting Betty,"
"looked down at his grandchild. She lay under an awning of muslin, for"
"fear of flies, and was awake.  Her solemn, large brown eyes, already like"
"Gyp's, regarded him with gravity.  Clucking to her once or twice, as is"
"the custom, he moved so as to face the house.  In this position, he had"
Betty with her back to it.  And he said quietly:
"""Butt's trying to decide whether he wants him fried or scrambled,"" the"
"Computer's Mate said, pulling her back. ""Hey, purse, remember when the"
whole family with their pop at the head went into Heatwave to argue
"with Colonel Leclerc?"""
"""Eleven dead, sixty-four injured,"" the purser answered mechanically."
"""And no more army stationed south of Icebox."" His right ear twitched"
"irritably. ""But what're they saying?"""
"Suddenly we heard. ""By authority vested in me under the Pomona College"

We all waited breathlessly for Butt's reply. The seconds ambled on and
"there was no clatter of electrostatic discharge, no smell of burning"
flesh.
Then we heard some feet walking. A big man in a green suit swung out
"into the crossway. That was Butt. Behind him came the Captain, holding"

Gyp uttered a little laugh; then she said slowly:
"""Can you tell me, please, what this Mr.--Wagge can do?"""
Again Rosek shrugged his shoulders.
"""He is rabid--a rabid man of his class is dangerous.  A lot of money will"

"He turned, and Gyp thought he was really going; but he stopped and came"
back past the line of the window.  The expression of his face was quite
"changed, so hungry that, for a moment, she felt sorry for him.  And that"
"must have shown in her face, for he suddenly caught at her, and tried to"

"hand in sign of leave-taking and, turning, ran lightly up the wharf"
toward her mother.
"Sidney's eyes followed her, devouring her dainty clothes, the"
"tight-fitting motoring hat, the buckled pumps. Pola--the Pola she had"
"carried enshrined in her heart! That heart hurt now, to the core. She"
"had dreamed of a meeting sometime, somewhere, had planned just what it"
would be like and what she'd say and what Pola would say. And now Pola
had turned a shoulder upon it.
Mart's laugh behind her roused her.
"""Who's Guinevere, anyway? Her ma called her just in time--we might a"
"hurt the doll-baby!"""
"Sidney turned on Mart fiercely. ""She's a friend of mine,"" she cried, in"
"a voice she made rough to keep the tears from it. ""And she's _not_ a"
"doll-baby."""
"""All right--go and play with her then--she's crazy about you, I guess."""
"And with that Mart swung on her heel and stalked away, her head in the"
air.
Poor Sidney hurried back to Sunset Lane to hide her humiliation and her
"""Yes, yes; that's nothing!  Don't cry--don't cry!"""
"Very slowly the sobbing died away, till it was just a long shivering, but"
still the girl held her hands over her face and her face down.  Gyp felt
"paralyzed.  The unhappy girl, the red and green room, the smell of"
mutton--creeping!
"At last, a little of that white face showed; the lips, no longer craving"
"for sugar-plums, murmured:"
"""It's you he--he--really loves all the time.  And you don't love"
"him--that's what's so funny--and--and--I can't understand it.  Oh, Mrs."
"Fiorsen, if I could see him--just see him!  He told me never to come"
again; and I haven't dared.  I haven't seen him for three weeks--not
"since I told him about IT.  What shall I do?  What shall I do?"""
His being her own husband seemed as nothing to Gyp at that moment. She
felt such pity and yet such violent revolt that any girl should want to
"crawl back to a man who had spurned her.  Unconsciously, she had drawn"
"herself up and pressed her lips together.  The girl, who followed every"
"movement, said piteously:"
"""I don't seem to have any pride.  I don't mind what he does to me, or"
"what he says, if only I can see him."""
Gyp's revolt yielded to her pity.  She said:
"""How long before?"""
"""Three months."""
"Now they found Mart at home. Sidney put her head in the door, made"
"certain that gran'ma was not in hearing, and cried ""Hook!"""
Mart had only to look once at Sidney's face to know that something had
happened. Sidney dragged her out to the Lane and there she and
"Lavender, in words as quick as pistol shots, told the story."
"""Meet us down on the beach near Milligan's at eight o'clock,"" Lav"
"whispered, as they parted."
CHAPTER XIX
THE GLEAM
Exactly at the appointed hour Sidney met Lavender on the beach. She was
breathless and a little worried for it had been neither easy nor to her
liking to deceive Aunt Achsa. Aunt Achsa had declared that a storm was
"""comin'"" for she could smell it in the air and Tillie Higgins had seen"
Sam Doolittle start for the backside with his pike pole and that meant
"a blow for Sam didn't waste steps. ""'Tisn't likely Letty Vine'll _go_"
"to Truro tonight."""
"""But I'll _see_ if she's going, anyway,"" Sidney had cried and had raced"
"off, a sweater over her arm."
"""I wish I could tell her how very important it is and then she'd"
"understand, but I can't for maybe she wouldn't understand,"" Sidney"
thought as she hurried to the rendezvous.
But the teacher was crying as if the tears quieted and comforted him.
"From this day they became friends, and the ""creatures that once were"
"men,"" seeing them together, said: ""The teacher is friendly with Tyapa"
...  He wishes his money. Kuvalda must have put this into his head ...
"To look about to see where the old man's fortune is ..."""
Probably they did not believe what they said.  There was one strange
"thing about these men, namely, that they painted themselves to others"
worse than they actually were.  A man who has good in him does not mind
sometimes showing his worse nature.

"When all these people were gathered round the teacher, then the reading"
of the newspaper would begin.
"""Well, what does the newspaper discuss to-day?  Is there any"
"feuilleton?"""
"""No,"" the teacher informs him."
"""Your publisher seems greedy ... but is there any leader?"""
"""There is one to-day....  It appears to be by Gulyaeff."""
"""Aha!  Come, out with it.  He writes cleverly, the rascal."""

"would go ashore and through his agents, Messrs. Ross and Co., transmit"
large sums of money to his wife and children in England. But Thwaites had
"another home at Algiers fitted with every luxury, including three Armenian"
girls.
For several years this successful pirate plundered ships of all nations
until such pressure was brought to bear on the Dey of Algiers that
Thwaites thought it best to collect what valuables he could carry away and
disappear.
"Landing at Gibraltar in 1796, dressed in European clothes, he procured a"
"passage to New York in an American frigate, the _Constitution_. Arriving"
"in the United States, he purchased an estate not far from New York and"
"built himself a handsome mansion, but a year later retribution came from"
"an unlooked-for quarter, for he was bitten by a rattlesnake and died in"
the most horrible agonies both of mind and body.
"TOMKINS, JOHN."
Of Gloucestershire.
Hanged at the age of 23 at Rhode Island in 1723. One of Charles Harris's
crew.
"TOPPING, DENNIS."
"He shipped on board the sloop _Buck_ at Providence in 1718, in company"
with Anstis and other famous pirates. Was killed at the taking of a rich
Portuguese ship off the coast of Brazil.
"Sawkins, who never knew what fear meant, stormed the town at the head of"
"his men, but was killed by a musket-ball."
"Basil Ringrose, the buccaneer who wrote the narrative of this voyage,"
"describes Sawkins as being ""a man who was as valiant and courageous as any"
"man could be, and the best beloved of all our company""; and on another"
"occasion he speaks of him as ""a man whom nothing on earth could terrifie."""
"SAWNEY, CAPTAIN."
A pirate of New Providence Island in the Bahamas. In this pirate republic
"this old man lived in the best hut, and was playfully known as ""Governor"
"Sawney."""
"DE SAYAS, FRANCISCO."
"A Spanish pirate hanged at Kingston, Jamaica, in 1823."
"SCOT, LEWIS."
Distinguished as being the first pirate to carry on the trade on land as
well as at sea. Before this time pirates were never known to be anything
"but harmless drunkards when on shore, whatever they might be on board"
their ships. Scot changed all this when he sacked and pillaged the city of
Campeachy. So successful was he that his example was quickly followed by
"Mansfield, John Davis, and other pirates."
"SCOT, ROGER."
"occasional little voyage, taking a ship or two, or burning an Arab"
"village, North's career as a pirate may be considered to have terminated,"
"as, indeed, his life was shortly afterwards, being murdered in his bed by"
"a treacherous native. North's friends the pirates, shocked at this"
"cold-blooded murder, waged a ruthless war on the natives for seven years:"
thus in their simple way thinking to revenge the loss of this estimable
"man, who had always been the natives' best friend."
"NORTON, GEORGE."
"One of Captain John Quelch's crew. Tried for piracy in June, 1704, at the"
Star Tavern at Boston.
"NUTT, JOHN."
One of Captain John Phillip's original crew of five pirates in the
_Revenge_ in 1723. Nutt was made master or navigator.
OCHALI. Barbary renegade.
In 1511 he sailed from Algiers with a fleet of twenty-two vessels and
"1,700 men to raid Majorca. The Moors landed at Soller and pillaged it."
"Before they could get back to their ship, the pirates were attacked by the"
"Majorcans, headed by Miguel Angelats, and completely routed, 500 of them"
being killed.
"ODELL, SAMUEL."
"""My lord,"" she said, kneeling at his feet, ""God save and comfort"
"you!""--"
The man's brow was twisted into furrows. His right hand clasped his
"left wrist. He looked over the woman's head into the woods, and"
breathed fast through clenched teeth.
"""Speak!"" he said."
"""My lord, the woman lives!"""
"""I can bear the truth!"""
The anchoress made the sign of the cross.
"""She came to us here in the valley, my lord, tall and white as a lily,"
"her hair loose upon her neck. Her feet were bare and bleeding, her"
"soles rent with thorns. And as she came, she sang wild snatches of a"
"song, such as tells of love, and of Proserpina, Goddess of Shades. We"
"took her, my lord, gave her meat and drink, bathed her torn feet, and"
"gave her raiment. She abode with us, ever gentle and lovely, yet"
"speaking like one who had suffered, even to the death. And yet,--even"
"as we slept, she stole away from us last night, and now is gone!""--"
The woman had never so much as raised her eyes to the man's face. Her
"hands held her crucifix, and she was ashen pale, even as new-hewn"
stone.
"""And is this all?"""
The man's voice trembled in his throat. His face was terrible to
"""Solem has gone now,"" Josephine replied."
"""Lucky for him!"""
"""Why?"" asked Josephine."
"""Oh, he's a dreadful creature!"""
How agitated she was! But in the course of the day she calmed down. Her
"anger dissolved, and there was neither weeping nor a scene; only she did"
"not walk proudly, as was her habit, but preferred to sit in silence."
"That passed too; she roused herself briskly soon after Solem's departure,"
"and in a few days she was the same as ever. She took walks, she talked and"
"laughed with us, she made the actor swing her in the children's swing, as"
in the lawyer's day....
"I went out one evening, for there was good weather and darkness for"
walking; there was neither a moon nor stars. The gentle ripple of the
little Reisa river was all the sound I heard; there were God and Goethe
"and _über allen Gipfeln ist Ruh'_ that night. On my return, I was in"
"the mood to walk softly and on tiptoe, so I undressed and went to bed in"
the dark.
"Then they came again to my window, those two lunatics, the lady and the"
actor. What next? But it was not he that chose this spot; of that I was
sure. She chose it because she was convinced I had returned. There was
something she _wanted_ me to hear.
Why should I listen to him still pleading with her?
"""I've had enough of this,"" he said. ""I'm leaving tomorrow."""
"Winstanley, after Yvonne had gone again."
"“I am sacrificing them for my wife’s happiness, Emmeline,” he replied,"
with a touch of irony.
"“Yes, it would be a pity to spoil her pleasure. She is such a child.”"
"“I wish we all had something of her nature,” said the Canon."
Mrs. Winstanley noted the snub. She was treasuring up many resentments
against Yvonne. In her heart she considered herself a long-suffering
woman.
"“You seem to enjoy it too, Everard,” said Yvonne to him that evening."
They were sitting near the entrance watching the smartly-dressed people.
“And I am so glad to be alone with you.”
"He was pleased, smiled at her, and throwing off his dignity, entered"
into the frivolous spirit of the place. Yvonne forgot the restraint she
had always put upon her tongue when talking to him. She chattered about
"everything, holding her face near him, so as to be heard through the"
"hubbub of thousands of voices, the eternal shuffling of passing feet,"
and the crash of the orchestra in the far gallery.
"“It is a _Revue des Deux Mondes,_” she said, looking rapidly around"
"her, with bright eyes."
“How?” asked the Canon.
"“The _beau_ and the _demi_,” she replied, wickedly. She shook his knee."
"“Oh, do look at that woman! what does she think a man can see in her!”"
"Gunner on board ""Blackbeard's"" ship, the _Queen Ann's Revenge_. Killed on"
"November 22nd, 1718, in North Carolina, during the fight with Lieutenant"
Maynard.
"MULLET, JAMES, _alias_ MILLET."
Of London.
"One of the crew of the _Royal James_, in which vessel Major Stede Bonnet"
played havoc with the shipping along the coasts of South Carolina and New
England. Hanged at Charleston in 1718.
"MULLINS, DARBY."
"This Irish pirate was born in the north of Ireland, not many miles from"
"Londonderry. Being left an orphan at the age of 18, he was sold to a"
planter in the West Indies for a term of four years.
"After the great earthquake at Jamaica in 1691, Mullins built himself a"
house at Kingston and ran it as a punch-house--often a very profitable
business when the buccaneers returned to Port Royal with good plunder.
"This business failing, he went to New York, where he met Captain Kidd, and"
"was, according to his own story, persuaded to engage in piracy, it being"
"urged that the robbing only of infidels, the enemies of Christianity, was"
"an act, not only lawful, but one highly meritorious."
At his trial later on in London his judges did not agree with this view of
"the rights of property, and Mullins was hanged at Execution Dock on May"

her scrupulously selected and daintily bound library the volume of
Tennyson and read aloud the idyll of Lancelot and Elaine. And the
"sea-wind blew about his head and fluttered the brown hair on the pillow,"
"and the log-fire blazed in the chimney, and the great dog slept, and a"
noontide hush was over all things. And Risca read the simple poem with
"the heart of the girl of fifteen, and forgot everything else in the"
world.
"When he had finished, the foolish eyes of both were moist. “The dead"
"oar'd by the dumb,” with the lily in her hand,--dead for the love of"
"Lancelot,--affected them both profoundly."
"“I think I should die, too, like that, Great High; Belovedest,” said"
"Stellamaris, “if any one I loved left me.”"
"“But what Lancelot is going to leave you, dear?” said John."
She shook the thistledown of sadness from her brow and laughed.
“You and Walter are the only Lancelots I've got.”
"“The devil 's in the child to-day,” said Risca to himself."
There was a short pause. Then Stella said:
"“Belovedest dear, what was the particular thing that Walter said you had"
to tell me?”
"“It 's of no consequence,” said John. “It will do to-morrow or the day"
after.”
"Stella started joyously,--as much as the rigid discipline of years would"
"suspicious nature would connect George with the rescue, and would lead"
him to conclude that Hamilton must be in England.
"A maid of Lady Castlemain's told Rochester, who in turn told me, that the"
king had again set his men to work searching for Hamilton. That being the
"case, George was in danger, and should he be found by the king's secret"
"agents, who, I understood, were prowling all over England in the hope of"
"obtaining a reward, his life would not be worth a week's purchase."
"George knew the risk he ran by remaining in England, but it was a part of"
his reckless courage to take delight in it. Later on this recklessness of
disposition induced him to take a far greater risk. But of that in its
turn.
*       *       *       *       *
"After supper, I found Hamilton in his bedroom, which was connected"
by a hidden stairway with the room of the sinking floor. He wore his
"Quaker's disguise, and on the table beside him were the Bible and a few"
"theological works dear to the hearts of his sect. I gave him the box,"
telling him its history. The letter was brief and was written in cipher.
George translated it thus:--

"""DE CATANET."""

"""Sit down--sit down!"" said he wheezily. ""What's your hurry? You haven't"

"But Slyne was already beyond the doorway, fumbling with a last button."
"""If you believe I've come here to talk simply for the sake of talking,"""
"said he with sombre magnificence, ""I needn't waste any more breath on"
"you. Good-bye."""
"Captain Dove jumped out of his bunk. He was clearly impressed, in spite"
"of himself, by the other's indomitable assurance."
"""Come back, you fool!"" he called angrily. ""Come back. I want to know--"
"""I'll go ashore with you,"" he shouted, raising his voice, since Slyne"
was already on his way to the gangway. But Slyne did not seem to hear.
"""I'll take your offer--for Sallie,"" cried Captain Dove, in a slightly"
lower tone.
"Slyne hesitated in his stride, stopped, and turned back into the"
alleyway which led to the saloon.
"""What was that you said?"" he demanded of Captain Dove."
"""Come on inside,"" requested Captain Dove, more curtly."
"""I don't believe I will,"" Slyne declared, inwardly elated over the"
"winning of that somewhat risky move. ""You don't deserve another chance."

"of outposts) joined on the crest of the rise, and in five minutes the"
English were in flight for the shelter of the piled-up _Potluck_.

away and got him down to the ship.  He swore most terribly.

Simcox looked sulky and injured.

ABERDEEN: THE UNIVERSITY PRESS
[Transcriber's Notes:
This book contains a number of misprints.
The following misprints have been corrected:
"to have been particularly active in helping to take a Dutch merchantman,"
"the _Gertruycht_. Hanged in chains at Cape Coast Castle in April, 1722, at"
the age of 23.
"SWAN, CAPTAIN."
"Commanded the _Nicholas_, and met Dampier when in the _Batchelor's"
Delight_ at the Island of Juan Fernandez in 1684. The two captains cruised
"together off the west coast of South America, the _Nicholas_ leaving"
"Dampier, who returned to England by way of the East Indies."
"SWAN, CAPTAIN. Buccaneer."
Of the _Cygnet_. Left England as an honest trader. Rounded the Horn and
"sailed up to the Bay of Nicoya, there taking on a crew of buccaneers who"
had crossed the Isthmus of Darien on foot. Dampier was appointed pilot or
"quartermaster to the _Cygnet_, a post analogous to that of a navigating"
"officer on a modern man-of-war, while Ringrose was appointed supercargo."
"Swan had an adventurous and chequered voyage, sometimes meeting with"
"successes, but often with reverses. Eventually he sailed to the Philippine"
"Islands, where the crew mutinied and left Swan and thirty-six of the crew"
"behind. After various adventures the _Cygnet_, by now in a very crazy"
"state, just managed to reach Madagascar, where she sank at her anchorage."
"SWITZER, JOSEPH."
Of Boston in New England.
"Tried for piracy at Rhode Island in 1723, but found to be ""not guilty."""
gilded by my father's abundant generosity.
We sat late after dinner. Somewhere in the hall Bilkins hovered with
glasses and tray to be on hand when the whistles began their screaming.
In twenty years he had not omitted this New Year's Eve ceremony.
"""Your wound never troubles you?"" my mother asked, her solicitation over"
a scratch I had received ten months before not disguising a light of
pride that charmed me.
"""I've forgotten it, Mater. Never amounted to anything."""
"""Still, you did leave some blood on French soil,"" Dad spoke up, for this"
conceit appealed to him.
"""Enough to grow an ugly rose, perhaps,"" I admitted."
"""I'll bet you grew pretty ones on the cheeks of those French girls,"" he"
chuckled.
"""Pretty ones don't grow any more, on cheeks or anywhere else,"" I"
"doggedly replied. ""Materialism's the keynote now--that's why I'm going"
"back to work, at once."""
"""Oh,"" the Mater laughed, ""don't think of your father's stupid office,"
"yet!"""
"""There's nothing left to think of,"" I grumbled."
"""Isn't there?"" he exclaimed. ""What'd you say if Gates has the yacht in"
"commission, and you take a run down to Miami----"""
"unveiling, I am too thrilled.”"
He kept button-holing Pangbutt:
"“Too thrilled to--er--I am thrilled, sir, thrilled, as indeed is"
"Charlotte--oh, ah, yes--Charlotte!” He searched about behind him for"
"the little old lady, who moved up to his side. “Oh, ah, yes--there"
"you are, Charlotte! Allow me to introduce Mr. Pangbutt, our host."
"May I ask, sir, if Mr. Anthony Bickersteth has yet arrived? No?..."
"How fortunate! How very fortunate!... Charlotte, I am becoming quite"
excited.”
Pangbutt led them to chairs.
Two richly-dressed ladies of an age that discovers as much as is
"concealed by considerable dressing, hesitated at the door; and one,"
taking a last amused glance over her shoulder at some incident that
"passed upon the stairs below, tittered, and, turning, swept the room"
with keen regard through her raised lorgnettes.
“How amusin’! how absolutely amusin’!” she crooned. “I like literary
and artistic people _so_ much.”
"“Yes,” said the other, “they are _so_ different to one’s own class...."
And actresses _dress_ so well!”
"She flung back an elaborate head of jewels, and whispered something to"
the lady of the lorgnettes.
The lady of the lorgnettes laughed:
“Really?” said she
And
"""Far, far from Ypers,"
"I'd like to be,"
Where German snipers
"Can't get at me."""
And
"""When this bloody war is over,"
"O how happy I shall be,"
"When I get my civvy clothes on,"
"No more soldiering for me."""
and all the other songs familiar to every soldier in the British army.
We marched all day along straight roads running in between flat fields
and past ugly little villages. As we grew tired and footsore our
rollicking spirit abated and the singing died down.
Towards nightfall we halted in a large meadow with a pond in one corner.
"Several lorries loaded with tents were waiting for us. We unloaded them,"
"pitched the tents, crept into them, and went to bed."
The rumble of the cannonade sounded faintly in the far distance.
"""I reckon it's a bloody shame to let the other Tommies and the"
"Frenchies...."""
The voice seemed to die away into a drawl as weariness overcame me. I
"continued to hear the sound of words for a little while, but they"
with uneasy feet on the lopsided deck.
"""They're standin' upon the 'ill as thick as pea-sticks,"" said one of"
the boys.
"""Speak hup,"" roared the skipper."
The crew shoved old Mac in front.
"""We've revolved the notion up and over,"" said Mac, ""and we've come to"
"the conclusion, sir, there ain't nothin' to be got by sendin'"
"ignorant men like we on such errands."""
The skipper hiccupped angrily.
"""Who asted you to think?  But I ain't the man to press unwilling"
"lubbers into goin' aloft, _I_ can lead the way.  Go into the"
"fo'castle, you dogs, and consider yourselves under arrest.  Go!"""
"""Blimy,"" said the crowd, ""but we're all in our own custody, so we"
"are.  Now what's the old man goin' to do?"""
They watched him from the fo'castle as he staggered into his own part
of the ship.
"""I'll be my own hambassador,"" said Jones.  ""I'll show 'em 'ow to work"
things with dignity; I'll show that ass Lampert what's o'clock.  What
"you wants in such cases made and provided is tact, and go, and"
innerds.  Innerds is the chief need.  Why fight if palaver'll do?
Where I was wrong was to send a galoot like Simcox.  But what could I
"do but work the best with the tools I 'ad?  If I'd gone myself, we'd"
"'ave made peace afore there was a row."""

"In the rules which follow, the basis adopted is ""Cutter's Rules for"
"a Dictionary Catalogue,""[49] prepared for library cataloguing. Such"
"portion as applies to book indexing has been freely drawn upon, adapted"
and added to from the present writer's experience.
ARRANGEMENT
"When, under a single entry, there are both subject-references and"
"references by folios only, place the folio-references together at the"
"end of the entry, following the subject-references."
"Arrange entries according to the English alphabet, whatever the order"
of the alphabet in which a foreign name might have been entered in its
original language.
"Arrange German names spelled with the vowels ä, ö, ü as if spelled ae,"
"oe, ue, but retain the form employed by the author."
"When the same word serves for several kinds of entries, the order"
"should be as follows: person, place, subject, title: e.g., (1) _Brown,"
G. F._ (person). (2) _Brown Village_ (place). (3) _Brown-tail Moth_
"(subject). (4) _Brown Family, the_ (title)."
"Forenames precede surnames: e.g., _Francis I_ precedes _Francis,"
Charles_.
"Brand laughed. ""Try and get you out of it! I know your attitude toward"
"a real jaunt. And it's a real jaunt we've got ahead of us, too, old"
"boy. We're going to the red spot. Immediately."""
*       *       *       *       *
"Dex's sandy eyebrows shot up. ""The red spot! That's where Coblenz and"
"Heiroy were lost!"""
"""And Journeyman,"" added Brand. ""He's the latest victim of whatever's"
"in the hell-hole."""
"Dex whistled. ""Journeyman too! Well, all I've got to say is that"
whatever's there must be strong medicine. Journeyman was a damn fine
"man, and as brave as they come. Have you any idea what it's all"
"about?"""
"""Not an idea. Nobody has. We're to go and find out--if we can. Are you"
"all ready?"""
"""All ready,"" said Dex."
"""So am I. We'll start at eleven o'clock in one of the Old Man's best"
"cruisers. Meanwhile, we might as well go and hunt up a dinner"
"somewhere, to fortify us against the synthetic pork chops and bread"
"we'll be swallowing for the next fortnight."""
They went out; and at ten minutes of eleven reported at the great
"space ship hangars north of New York, with their luggage, a"
conspicuous item of which was a chess board to help while away the
"long, long days of spacial travel. Brand then paused a little while"
"right in suspecting Eilert, for I heard him going upstairs, and when I"
"came in, he was turning out the bag and going through the clothes."
"""What are you doing?"" I said."
At first he tried to brazen it out.
"""Never you mind,"" he replied. But my knowing something about him was so"
"much to my advantage that he soon drew in his horns. How I wronged him, he"
"complained, and exploited him:"
"""You haven't bought these clothes,"" he said. ""I could have got more for"
"them if I'd sold them."" He had been paid, but he still wanted more, like"
"the stomach, which goes on digesting after death. That was Eilert. Yet he"
"was not too bad; he had never been any better, and he certainly had grown"
no worse with his new livelihood.
May no one ever grow worse with a new livelihood!
So I moved the knapsack and the clothes into my own room in order to take
better care of them. It was a slow job to tidy everything up for the
"second time, but it had to be done. Later that evening I would resume my"
"journey, taking the knapsack with me. I had done with the place, and the"
nights were moonlit again.
Enough of these clothes!
XXX
MAQUILLAGE.
"THE charm of rouge on fragile cheeks,"
"Pearl-powder, and, about the eyes,"
The dark and lustrous Eastern dyes;
The floating odour that bespeaks
A scented boudoir and the doubtful night
Of alcoves curtained close against the light
"Gracile and creamy white and rose,"
"Complexioned like the flower of dawn,"
Her fleeting colours are as those
"That, from an April sky withdrawn,"
Fade in a fragrant mist of tears away
When weeping noon leads on the altered day.
IMPRESSION.
TO M. C.
"THE pink and black of silk and lace,"
Flushed in the rosy-golden glow
Of lamplight on her lifted face;
"Powder and wig, and pink and lace,"
And those pathetic eyes of hers;
"""Do you remember Pancorbo?"" said Ramon Garcia."
"Rollo could not hear the answer, but he caught the outlaw's next"
question.
"""And have you forgotten El Sarria, who, having a certain Miguelete under"
"the point of his knife, let him go for his sweetheart's sake, because"
"she was waiting for him down in the valley?"""
"The sentry's reply was again inaudible, but Rollo was fully awake now."
"Ramon Garcia had not abandoned hope, and why should he? When there was"
"anything to be done, none could be so alert as Rollo Blair."
"""I am El Sarria the outlaw,"" Ramon went on, ""and these are my"
"companions. We are no traitors, but good Carlists to a man. Our papers"
"are----"""
"Here the words were spoken so low that Rollo could not hear more, but"
the next moment he was nudged by Ramon on the leg.
"""Write a note to Concha Cabezos, telling her to bring the papers here at"
"once if she would save our lives. You are sure she is faithful?"""
"""I am sure!"" said Rollo, who really had no reason for his confidence"
except the expression in her eyes.
"He had no paper, but catching the sentry's eye, he nodded across to"
where Etienne was still diligently rolling cigarettes.
"""Alcoy?"" he whispered."
"The sentry shouldered his piece and took a turn or two across the floor,"
- That's right.
"- Two women, side by side..."
That is the most powerful thing that there is.
Now get on up here and attack each other.
- All right.
- What's that now?
What...
"Oh, God."
"Well, Cookie, hold on one second."
"This is my first class, so I don't think..."
Don't worry about it.
You're gonna be the attacker.
- Okay.
"- And Maggie, you just do all the moves that we've been working on, okay?"
"Yes, Cookie."
"All right, you're at the ATM."
It's late at night.
"Emma, attack."
"Beep, boop, beep, boop."
"Ooga-booga, give me your money and also your body!"
[groaning]
- You're dead.
- Ow.
"- Nice, Maggie."
- That actually really hurt.
"Remember too, your forearm is a five-way weapon, okay?"
- Five ways?
"- So you've got one,"
"- two, three, four, and five."
"- Ah, ah!"
- That hurts.
- You're okay.
He's my arch enemy...
in affairs of the heart!
Alright!
I promise you!
I won't be with him after you've rescued him!
Really?
"Yes, I really mean it."
Will you come with me then?
"Sure I will, wherever you go!"
Yoyo's locked up there.
- So high above!
- Let's go!
- Over there!
- OK!
From here!
I go first!
Come up.
Hurry!
Hurry up!
Old friend!
I feel good now!
- Commissioner!
- Yes sir!
Did he tell you where the 'Beast' is?
Ask him!
"Yoyo, tell us."
I won't!
"I'll let you go if you tell us where it is, or else..."
You'll get Amelian!
"(A million) ln that case, I won't say anything!"
- What?
Bring him Amelian!
A little too rich for my blood.
Maybe they fell out of your pocket— or maybe Cindy's.
"Now, you go home and you sleep... and you wake up and you guide the traffic through this town... and everything will be the way it was."
I'm taking him in tomorrow morning at 6:00.
That's in a few hours.
"I'd like you to come with me, Ray."
There's nothing I can say?
Okay.
Then 6:00 it is.
Yeah.
"No, Lis."
Who was he supposed to call?
Ray knows everybody.
What am I supposed to do?
Let him go in alone?
What?
You know what?
"Okay, fine."
Why don't you go home?
I mean...
"I wanna be here for you, Freddy, but—"
"Lisa's nervous, you know."
She's pregnant.
- I mean—
"- So, go on."
I'll be fine.
Yeah.
"You be careful, Freddy."
Yeah.
You too.
Shut the fuck up!
"Would ya, please?"
Master finagler!
"-Oh, right."
-(laughter)
"Drink up, boys."
"Ernie, uh, what have you been doing since you got out of the Army?"
I'm with some outfit.
"Come on, drink up."
"Oh, come on, come on, now, Ernie."
-What are you doing?
"-Well, it's a big outfit-- big."
"If I mention the name, you'd know it right away."
MORGAN:
What outfit?
What difference does it make?
I'm doing all right.
Believe me.
"Secret, huh?"
"Well, in a way, it has to be, yeah."
TUBBY:
I got it-- government work.
You could call it that.
Yeah.
You got a contract with the government.
For four years.
-Four years?
-Whoa.
I got a six months' contract.
Then comes cancellations and changes in specifications.
-How do you do it?
-Very simple.
"When the four years is up, I simply reen... uh, renegotiate."
-They're only too glad to do business with me. -(buzzing)
The tea is for Sifu!
Thinking of making a run for it?
Grab him!
Sifu!
- He's Wong Fei-hung?
"- Yes, it's him!"
That guy's involved as well!
He knows Shirt Pinching Toad Trap?
Stop!
On your knees!
- Sifu...
- Sifu...
You two have gone too far!
Committing crimes in my name!
You're the real Wong Fei-hung?
I've been too lenient with them.
"Marshal, please don't take offence."
I'll deal with them later!
"OK, Wong Fei-hung."
"I won't pursue this, for your sake."
"Marshal, thanks for your understanding."
"Tonight, I'll hold a dinner upstairs especially for you."
Good on you.
"Foon, come with me!"
Sifu Wong?
You've already learnt Shirt Pinching Toad Trap.
You don't need another Sifu.
Get out!
Shirt Pinching Toad Trap?
"Have another drink, have another drink."
Thank you for coming.
"Sifu Wong, I'll drink to your hospitality."
But I didn't mean nobody to get killed.
Quit stalling.
Who paid ya to do it?
Hanley and Grayce.
How did you frame him?
I socked his head.
Then planted the liquor in the car.
Yeah.
Then started the car and then jumped out.
"Yeah, I did, but I didn't mean to have nobody get killed."
[GUNFIRE]
Have you heard enough?
"Plenty, Stacey."
And thanks.
"Okay, pal."
That's just what I hoped.
[GUNSHOTS]
[EXPLOSION]
"I'm all right, Frank."
"Stacey, you can't wash out on me now."
I need you.
I'll get you out of here.
"I'm going out, pal."
My way.
I wanna tell you something.
[GUNFIRE]
"That dame of yours is the one that sprung ya, not me."
Take care of her.
She's worth it.
I think I can hold 'em!
"No hurry now, Dale."
"So long, kid."
"- Are you still in the same house, John?"
- You too?
"- Rachel, how?"
- I say hello.
A little girl was abducted.
I need to find him.
"""Sacred Quest"" A little girl's life, how beautiful."

"The club's owner, Jade the name of a woman."
"But the man behind the name ""Rook."" Jade, Rook'un knows where it is."
"- Girl, Rook'un hands?"
- Ask him.
"The Rook, a young man."
Young and very dangerous.
"Be careful, my friend."
"- The same as you say: ""I'm already dead."""
- Hey!
Bitch where is it?

(This is work that man.) (What's he doing that here?

"Fuck, man!"
Kill him!
Shut up.

"I'm sorry, come on."
You'll be okay.
Mr. Ben-Shmuel.
Alex Dolgin's secretary asked me to take you to the rehearsal.
He likes to take me because I know all of his business partners.
It's just...
It's easy for him.
What's he do for a living?
He's an entertainment lawyer.
Mmm!
[Smacks lips] Mmm!
- Is he rich?
- Does it matter?
I don't know.
Does it matter to you?
"If it mattered, I'd be with him, and I'm not."
I'm with you.
[Laughs]
I told my friends about you.
- You did?
- Mm-hmm.
What did you say?
- That you're crazy...
- [Laughs]
And that I'm having a sexual awakening with you.
Wow.
A sexual awakening.
I told them that I've never come so much in my life.
[Laughs]
"Oh, wait a second."
Even more than with Paul?
- Way more than Paul.
- Yeah.
Paul was too big.
I couldn't take it unless I was really drunk.
What's wrong?
Rewind.
And kiss.
- Jake--
- You want to know if there was tongue.
"I can tell you, decidedly there was not."
"- No, Jake."
Figgis is here.
"- Okay, well, good talk."
Don't die.
Holt had very soft lips.
Wish I hadn't said that one either.
We should get into positions.
"- Yeah, okay."
"- Hey, kill the lights!"
Figgis is here!
"- Excuse me, ma'am, this dolly's being used."
- Broccoli che visto?
- It's being used.
-Quantieralavitolabella ?
Tuttomatrolamente?
- Just bring it back when you're done.
-Ah!
Garbanzomarinara!
Pizzeríarestaurante!
Ahh!
Jackpot.
Let's do this.
- And how am I supposed to get all the way up there?
- Gracefully.
- Boost my bottom!
- I'm boosting!
- Boost my bottom!
We'll fly it out of Cairo.
"And Gobler, I want plenty of protection."
Jones.
"Holy smoke, my friends,"
I...
I'm so pleased you're not dead!
"Indy, Indy, we have no time."
"If you still want the Ark, it is being loaded onto a truck for Cairo."
Truck?
What truck?
Let's go!
Get back to Cairo.
"Get us some transport to England... boat, plane, anything."
Meet me at Omar's.
Be ready for me.
I'm going after that truck.
- How?
- I don't know.
I'm making this up as I go.
Ew!
He's there!
Idiot!
Idiot!
Everything at last has been arranged.
- The Ark?
- Is on board.
"Nothing is lacking, now that you're here."
Or what is left of you.
- You trust these guys?
- Yes.
Mr. Katanga.
"Mr. Katanga, these are my friends."
- For who?
"- For, like, it's an app."
You can kind of...
"like, I've used it all over when funds were low, so..."
"- Oh, there's some interesting ones."
- Pretty cool.
"- ""Thrillseekers wanted."""
- Ooh.
- This looks right up your street.
- Okay.
"Okay, four pound signs."
That's a biggie.
That's good.
It's a little out of town.
And some kind of play test deal for a company called Saitoo...
Saitogoo...
- SaitoGemu?
- SaitoGemu.
Yeah.
They're huge.
- They're really big.
- Really?
- Horror games?
- Uh...
Have you heard of...
"Oh, what's one of theirs?"
- Harlech Shadow.
- Harlech Shadow?
"Yes, I have."
"I used to play that in my buddy David Ludwig's basement when we were, like, seventh grade."
"Well, that's Shou Saito."
It's his company.
Please.
Open up there.
"Yeah, those."
Plug the jacksin there.
"Yeah, in there."
So your name's Henry and...
"Okay, what a good news is that you gonna a while."
"Bad news is that in this case,"
"""a while"" means 20, 30 minutes tops, Henry."
"Unless you're very, very lucky."
Which you are.
Uncle Jimmy is gonna take you to his lab.
Hang on.
"Ah, Shit."
We got ?
on our tail.
Unplug yourself.
Put that away.
There's no clothes in here.
Put the hoodie on.
"There's no enough time, fuck."
Just cover the blood up with the your bag.
Just stay calm and let me handle this here?
Maybe we can skip right to the fine?
So...
Shit.
Fucking Akan paying...
Do you know what's wrong with Mother Russia?
Too goddamn hot.
Too goddamn hot.
Too goddamn hot.
As you wish.
"Oh, God."
"- All right, sad-arse?"
- Nina just rang from the hospital.
He's taken a turn for the worse.
But he's been asking for you.
"Look, we've done our best but he is... he's just too weak."
"Do you understand, Adam?"
"Well, look, we'll... we'll give you some time alone with him, OK?"
Dad?
Adam.
"I'm here, Dad."
Why?
What's happened?
You collapsed.
You weren't well.
You collapsed.
Are you all right?
Have you fed?
Here.
It's OK.
I've got these people looking after me.
"But they... they understand, do they?"
It's fine.
They're nice.
"Now, you give me a minute and we'll get out of here, hey?"
"No, listen."
You have to stay here.
I'm just...
I'm just so... so tired.
"You gave me too much, Dad."
You made yourself weak.
What else could we do?
And I shall.
Take care of her.
Of course.
Look. ;0]
We'll put this by the window.
So you can watch your friends dancing across the street.
And look.
I love this room.
I'm going to order the whole lot.
And...
Come in and close the door.
How are you?
Sit down.
Thank you.
"Alicia, look who's here."
"We're just getting some air, reading magazines..."
Who was that woman who just left?
"Katerina, Alicia's teacher."
Her teacher?
"Yes, her dancing teacher."
Katerina's a real character.
Her academy is in front of my house.
Alicia was her pupil.
And Katerina loves her like a daughter.
FOUR YEARS EARLIER
"Benigno, you've been at the window for half an hour."
"I'm coming, Mom."
Are you following me?
No...
"Well, yes."
And?
I think this is yours.
"Master, he's right!"
Seems like he's not bad
What did you say?
Master is angry!
No wonder you can't win over him!
Dad!
"I'm sorry, Master!"
Master's technique is good
But now he can't even stand still
He was defeated in at least six or seven stances
He picked up the brick
The brick?
You bastard!
Master!
Stay there!
Don't run
It's me!
"Master, stop it!"
Stop it!
You bastard!
How dare you beat me up!
I didn't mean it!
"You did, too!"
And you beat me so hard?
It's just a mistake!
Mistake?
It's more than one time
"No, Master can't take it"
Dad!
"T ell me, who taught you those stances?"
Me
I taught him!
- They can put the finger on you.

Keep in touch.
Let me know what the doctor says.
- Get our doctor if you have to.
Come on.
- Wait a minute.
"Listen, Patsy, I'm asking you, don't go up there, will you?"
- All right.
- Wouldn't that mean--?
"Now, boys."
"Now, wait."
Now wait.
Now let's be sensible.
"Now, let's start all over again."
I'll change everything back to what it was before.
- I swear I will.
I'll change and--
- You're a liar.
"We, the jury, find you guilty of murder in the first degree."
Where did--?
Where--?
- Let's go.
Get him.
- Hurry up.
Hurry up and get him.
Let's hurry up and get him.
"Come on, boys, let's go."
Come on.
"Hurry, Patsy."
He's dead.
"Hey, come on."
"We all spend so much time, energy AND money in an effort to look our best."
We all WANT to be attractive.

"Hello, Rose, it's Alex."
Oh!
"Hi, Alex."
How... how are you?
"Oh, I'm okay, I'm... trying to get on with my life, ya know."
"Oh, good, good."
What's wrong with you?
You don't...
Claire's gone.
Gone?
Yeah.
Gone where?
I came home to surprise her during lunch and I found her in bed with her masseur.
"It's my own fault, really..."
Claire hates surprises.
"Alex, I'm..."
I'm really sorry.
"No, no, I knew it was coming."
I don't know WHY she wasn't happy.
I...
I...
I don't know how I could have loved her any more than I did.
I don't think it would've mattered how much you loved her.
- Rose.
- Uh-huh.
Did you know that Claire was jealous of you.
- What!
Jealous of me?
"- Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yes.."
"Sammy, watch where you're going."
I'm watching.
"I'm all right, man."
Jesus-sorry!
[Overlapping chatter]
"Red light, red light."
Jesus fuck!
God damn it.
"You're fucking pushing on me, man."
Who's that?
"Hey, it's John Wayne!"
It's not the same guy.
"Hey, it's Mr. America."
I thought I told you to get out of here.
Holy shit!

Just because.
May I suggest jewelry?

A silver band.
Lined with amethyst.
Is amethyst your wife's favorite stone?
I just think it would look nice.

"No, far from it."
Didn't wanna face the fact that Buzz just might be Andy's new favourite toy.
So you got rid of him.
"Well, what ifAndy starts playing with me more, Woody, huh?"
You gonna knock me outta the window too?
I don't think we should give him the chance.
"There he is, men."
Frag him!

Tackle him!
"No, no, no!"
Wait!

"Okay, Mom, be right down."
I've gotta get Buzz.

"Mom, do you know where Buzz is?"
"No, I haven't seen him."
"-Andy, I'm heading out the door!"
"-But, Mom, I can't find him!"
"Honey, just grab some other toy."
"Now, come on!"
"Oh, okay."
I couldn't find my Buzz.
I know I left him right there.

Sorry.

"Oh, my God."
You know who it is.
Jackson.
"You just wanted Erica to confirm it, didn't you?"
I'm gonna help you stop him.
As part of your pack.
"If you want me in, fine."
We'll get you out of here.
- What's your name?
- Ben.
"Hey, Ben."
I'm Doug.
Let's see if I can move some of this stuff out of the way here.
- How did you get caught in here?
- We were by the canal and the water started coming real fast.
"- Just get it out, please."
Just get it out!
- Mom told us to stay out of the tunnel.
"It ain't my fault, Joey."
The water just pushed me.
"All right, settle down, fellas."
It's nobody's fault.
- Are you okay?
- I'm cold and my leg hurts.
Let me take a look at it.
It's your lucky day.
I'm a doctor.
- Let me check this.
Does this hurt?
"- Yeah, a lot."
- Try not to move it.
- Is it broken?
- It might be.
"- Oh, no."
"- No, no...."
"- Don't cry, Ben."
"Yeah, Ben."
Don't cry.
It's nothing compared to what I've seen.
"- Yes, I do."
I gotta go.
This isn't right.
"- Yeah, it is."
"- No, no, no."
"Kim, it isn't."
And I don't know what I thought was gonna happen tonight.
I definitely know what I hoped was gonna happen tonight.
But this isn't cool.
"I really, really, really want to have sex with you."
Yeah.
I can tell.
- You can tell that?
- Yeah.
Subtle signs.
But I can't.
I can't.
I'm sorry.
Michael?
Okay.
It's gonna be okay.
He's gonna come home.
He's gonna come home.
He's gonna come home.
"Hey, this is Michael..."
Do something for me.
What?
"Go home, tell her that it's over and leave her."
- I can't.
- What?
You're an amazing guy.
You wouldn't be here with me right now unless you knew something was missing in your life.
Don't kill her.
Of course not.
"But you, on the other hand..."
No!
Don't!
"Please, please."
No!
"Please, please."
David!
Please!
No!
You'll do exactly what we want.
You'll broadcast my numbers because now you know every choice has a consequence.
Stop it!
Stop it!
Stop it!
My God.
Try the other zones.
Who's in the basement?
Let's see what's down there.
We're clear.
My God.
He only fired two shots.
"Oh, my God, it's David."
"Oh, my God!"
They must have thought he was dead.
Bled out.
He knew there was a gun hidden down here.
You still with me?
"Yeah, feel nauseous."
"Yeah, well, puke if you have to."
I haven't puked since college.
It's either a cat leg or a finger.
It's freaking me out.
Let's just get out of here before these people get home.
"Axl, we can't stop now!"
"We have come all this way, and why?"
For aunt Edie!
To give her the one thing in her life
She has always dreamed of!
Wait!
I remember!
It was a book.
You buried a book?
No.
"It was in a ""Nancy Drew"" book."
"She buried a time capsule,"
"And I always thought that I should do it,"
And I never did.
I'm digging a lot bigger hole.
I'll tell you one case Nancy Drew's not gonna solve!
Who's out there?
"Ooh, run!"
Run!
"Oh, look."
"Oh, ms."
Rinsky's here...
In our meeting.
Wow.
You look so pretty.
Is that a new top?
No.
Thank you for coming down.
"Whenever parents have a complaint,"
Or was it all of you?
"Was it you, Jones?"
Was it you?
Was it you?
Or was it you?
"You sick bastard, you're imagining things again!"
Oh yeah?
"You've been fishing with Ivan lately, Reynolds?"
How's that...
How's that tuna biting?
Let me see you talking your way out of this one!
Where is it?
Christ!
"What the fuck now, Reznik?"
Get him off me!
"You're through, you fuck!"
Pick up your shit and get the fuck out of here.
You're fired.
This motherfucker's crazy.
"You lost it, man."
Shit!
Damn it!
Where is it?
Asshole!
What the fuck did you do with it?
Idiot!
Hey!
Fuck you!
Get out!
What?
It's an occupational hazard.
"So, Trevor, are you gonna rescue me from this miserable life or what?"
And... my heart is broken.
Yeah.
Nai would what to say to you right now.
"I can't talk to her, though."
"I just can't... talk to her, 'cause it's like... she's not our Nai anymore."
Exactly.
"I'm sorry, dad."
"I'm so sorry, daddy."
Hi.
Hi.
Nice shoes.
I hate talking about shoes with you.
I...
I hate that at's all we talk about.
I miss you.
I... where are you?
"Where... where did you go, Addison?"
"Like I said, nice shoes."
You came.
"No, wait."
I...
I need you to listen.
Just listen?
Um...
I want to be a good mother.
"I want to be a good mother so badly,"
"And, um, I'm trying to figure out how to do that, how to do that when I look at this baby and I feel..."
Uh...
Katie stole something from me.
"She changed me, and I don't know how to change it back."
"But I'm trying to be a good mother, okay?"
Okay.
because I wanted to forget him.
Did you?
Well...
I thought so.
- Who drove off last night?
- It was Jacob.
"I thought Johannes drove him, but he couldn't have."
- Jorgen lent him to Jacob.
- He never lends out Johannes.
He did to Jacob.
It seems he is giving it all to that Jacob.
Helene Hansson.
I'd like to speak to Doctor Philippsen.
Remember to lie.
How big was it?
You have to agree or she won't believe it...
"Good, off you go."
- We caught one that was this big.
- No way!
"It's true, but it got away."
I have to go to town.
Jorgen?
Won't you stay for lunch?
We ate on the way.
I'll be home in a few hours.
- Jorgen?
I spoke to Doctor Phillipsen.
- Yes.
Phillipsen's under confidentiality.
That's totally unacceptable.
He promised me.
He's betrayed my trust.
"Wow, in stereo."
Great.
Thanks.
You ready to go?
"Hey, perfect timing."
"- How is it, haole?"
- Shamu.
What's with the stick?
You got slammed in a cruncher?
"- Um, I don't know what that means."
- Sand facial.
"You ate a big one, huh?"
There was no surfing accident.
"He, uh, busted his knee getting out of bed."
- How white can you get?
- Pretty white.
- Who's this?
"- This is my sister, Mary."
"- Mary, meet Kamekona."
- Hey.
This is the reason I called.
I want a friendly face to make sure she stays put.
"Oh, come on."
You want me to babysit your little sister?
- Correct.
"- Shoots, small kine."
"She doesn't leave this office, you under..."
"Whoa, whoa!"
Hold on.
Seriously?
What if I have to use the bathroom?
- Don't spill.
- Give me two cards.
- It's good for 80000.
I can only get 1500 from the ATM.
I'll transfer the balance and add 2000 for your trouble.
Did your mum drop you as a baby?
I don't want 4500 in the bank.
I am on welfare.
So get another card or go elsewhere.
- Give me yours.
- Mine's behind the bar.
I need it.
Wait here.
Back to the Edge.
Out of the car!
- What are you doing with Yugo Danny?
- Nothing.
What's this?
- ID.
ID.
- In my right-hand pocket.
Alexander Seeberg?
Judge Seeberg's son?
- Did you hurt your footsie?
- Just come along.
Not with you.
You and your partner broke my rib last time.
See you in court.
Can I see your watch again?
How much did you say it cost?
25000.
- How about going somewhere else?
- Right.
It's the sign of Solon.
MacGyver... it's...the Ark... of Solon.
Oh...
Oh...
It looks so beautiful.
"Yeah, it's gorgeous."
Now can we get it and us out of here?
But just think.
Inside this Ark rests the Torch of Truth.
"Ah, yes."
"""Gods march in rank."""
Yes!
Yes.
"""And Hecate races in the heavens,"
"""enters the gates of Hades,"
"""and the Book shall summon the power of the ancient ones."
"""Offer the Torch of Truth to the Temple of Ages, and the Treasure of Atlantis...shall rise."""
It's the riddle of Solon.
Great!
Now can we go?
You are going nowhere.
What?
What is it?
Ah!
Tell me who you were spying for.
United Nations?
U.S. Intelligence?
Who?
We're not spies.
"Ah, yes, you are, uh historians."
Historians?
I happen to be a professor of archaeology.
Dori!
Dori!
"Dori, you're here."
Why is he here?
Do you know this dog?
"Yes, he's Dori."
Somebody abandoned him.
Do you know the owners?
"Yes, I've seen them here before."
They abandoned him?
"Yes, I think so."
I couldn't find the owners.
So my uncle decided to raise him.
Really?
That's terrible.
How could they abandon Dori?
That's his name?
Yes.
"We didn't know, so we named him Ocean."
"Oh, you did?"
"Dori, what's happened to you?"
Will you keep him?
"Yes, my uncle is fond of dogs."
And he's just a little puppy.
That's better for him.
Huh?
It's better than being raised in Seoul.
"Dori, are you alright?"
Do you like it here?
Don't you miss your owner?
Some owners they are for ditching him.
The crazy bastards.
You speak my mind.
Well done.
Come on.
An enquiry.
"- Yes, Sir."
Before 18th of September...
Did this guy stay here?
"No, Sir."
Are you sure?
Or do you want confirm with someone else?
I'm sure.
He is not our guest.
"Panju, this is where I stay."
Please come.
Do you know him?
No.
Take a closer look.
He was staying here.
I'm sure that he didn't stay here.
How are you so sure?
I never forget any guest's face.
I can even remember a guest who stayed with us 10 years ago.
Do you know him?
No.
Give the key for room number 205.
Why?
He is staying here.
Give the key.
We are investigating trusting people like this!
Come.
He was staying here for a while.
What happened to him?
Illingworth.
"Ah, yes."
I see.
And then up there.
"Yep, yep."
And that leaves...
May.
"May, that sounds plausible."
And that gives...
Stewart.
Yes.
Alec Stewart.
You've got it.
You were on fire!
"Marianne, are you the big cricket fan?"
Yeah.
"Cos they were, ""Come on, Marianne - say some names!"""
"You were coming out with them, one after the other."
Very well done for a full ten points.
You certainly know your cricket.
Let's go through the names as you put them in.
"First of all you put in Cowdrey, Colin Cowdrey."
And you spotted you hadn't got that quite in the right order.
"Brearley, Mike Brearley, captain during Botham's famous Headingley Ashes."
"Hussain, Nasser Hussain."
"Pietersen, Kevin Pietersen."
"Illingworth, Ray Illingworth."
"May, Peter May."
"And finally Stewart, Alec Stewart."
And you didn't fall for any of our red herrings -
"Botham, Gower, Strauss, Willis."
Didn't go for any of those.
"Hello, this is..."
"Hello, I'm Gregory Larkin."
Professor Gregory Larkin.
Answer the phone.
I'm sleeping.
- Hello.
- Hello?
"- Yes, is Professor Larkin there?"
- Who?
"I mean, is Professor Morgan there?"
- Barely.
Who's this?
- This is Gregory Larkin.
I'm a professor in the math department at Columbia.
I was just calling to see
- how you are tonight.
- I'm fine.
How you are?
Fine.
"I hope it wasn't presumptuous of me, but I sat down in one of your classes."
And I was very impressed.
I was hoping we could have dinner Saturday.
Hold on.
- Wait.
Could you talk louder please?
- I sat in on your class.
- Hold on.
Don't go away.
- I was impressed with your teaching.
I was hoping we could have dinner Saturday.
I can do this!
"- Hello, can you hear me?"
Why did it have to be curry?
You like curry.
Since when?
What's wrong with her?
All right.
Wait!
You can't do it like that.
"She's a bride, she should look like a bride."
Like this.
What do you think?
"It's good, right?"
"Yes, it's fine."
"- Okay, you can take it."
"- All right, I'll take the picture."
Look here.
"Three, two-"
Wait!
"Hyang Gi, don't stick too close."
Why is the bride smiling so much?
"Hold the flower up, and you come out a bit, so that your face will come out smaller."
"- Good, right?"
- Yes.
"So that your face will be smaller, right."
"Okay, okay..."
Okay...
- Are the lights fine?
- Yes.
Can you take the picture slightly lower?
Right?
I think that'll be better.
"Ji Hyung, smile!"
Smile!
- Please...
- What?
It's 7-4-6-3.
Can you remember?
Everything's all right.
It's all right.
It's okay.
"- Go, go..."
- Okay.
Can you keep your pressure on it?
Okay.
- Did we do it?
- I think so.
- Will I die?
"- No, you can live a long time like this."
I need a doctor.
Can you take the bullet out?
It's a lot different than taking a piece of scrap out of your leg.
Here.
This is gonna take the pain away for a while.
Wait.
"I'm gonna wake up, right?"
I've seen four guys get shot in the gut.
Every one of them lived.
Not the bullet.
You.
You wouldn't...
What?
"You wouldn't do that to me, would you?"
No.
- Somerset Textiles.
- Blackleg Miner.
- Send them in.
"- Yes, sir."
"All right, boys, come on."
Hats off.
"Well, what do you want?"
Why aren't you at your work?
"Well, Mr. Thompson, sir, we wanted to ask you."
Please don't fire Miss Griffith.
Get back to your work.
"- But, Mr. Thompson, please--"
"- Get back to your work, I said."
This is no Boy Scout camp.
Those days are over.
This is a reformatory.
Now get back where you belong.
You can't do that.
Oh.
Can't I?
"Now the rest of you boys, get out of here."
You stay.
I'll show you what I can do.
- Watch that door.
- Okay.
"It don't work, huh?"
Shh.
"Not so much noise, you guys."
Are you crazy?
We got enough food here to feed all the kids in the dormitory.
Shh!
Here comes somebody.
- It's Charlie.
- Get away from that door.
You said that.
Mr. Aaronson.
"Hello, Nicholas."
Did you see your dad outside?
"Yes, I did."
"Mr. Aaronson, uh... about Sarah--"
Sarah?
Your child.
is there anyone that can take care of her?
She's with a nanny.
"Well, legally, the biological father has rights."
He does?
Legally.
But I'm prepared to help you if you--
What?
If you wish to keep her.
Oh.
No.
"Thank you, no."
Have you met the father?
She said they were just friends.
I even gave him a job at one of my stores.
I gave that guy a job.
"Oh, Alvin?"
I'm on my way to the track.
"I'm up _3,OOO so far-- an astonishing run."
"Alvin, understand that if you choose not to do your job, then I will have to--"
- What?
Fire me?
- Yes.
"I've already been fired, Lulu, trust me."
I'm already dead to this place.
- Open up!
You guys were gone a long time.
Where's Franz?
What's she doing here?
She wanted to call the police for her Franz.
"You almost sunk us all, you and your Biberkopf."
- Where's Franz?
- The cops got him.
That's a lie!
Shut her up!
It's not true!
"Henschke, we'll be gone a few days."
I'll tell you the address.
Quiet!
You're coming with us.
"Good luck, Biberkopf."
Buy my little gadget!
"Peep, peep, peep The dickey bird sings"
Let me outta here!
- Push him out!
- He squealed on us!
"Well now, Mr. Biberkopf!"
Welcome back.
You were gone a long time ― three weeks.
You boiling some punch there?
Have a look.
I'm not buying that.
It's gauze for bandages.
I don't know you.
What's your name?
Me?
Paula.
- God dang.
The things I would do to that.
- You gonna talk to her or what?
- I don't know.
- Show us your tits!
"- What the fuck, Lance?"
- You stupid idiot.
- It's all good.
- Seriously?
- They're leaving.
Great going.
- Come on.
Don't be like this.
Come back.
"- Fucking idiot, dude."
- Hold on one second.
"- Well, well, well."
- Hey.
"- Hi, honey."
What are you troublemakers up to?
- Just hanging out.
- Yeah?
Hanging out?
- That's all we're doing.
I swear.
- Where's your dad?
Fuck if I know.
"- You know, you're getting yourself quite a reputation around here."
"- Come on, Jacob."
"- Hey, Jacob."
"- All right, whatever."
- Shoot.
For sure.
Bye.
Drake set it up for Saturday.
Sweet.
Good.
Now I can get some sleep.
What?

he hit me up like three times today.
He's freaking crazy.
Stop for a minute.
What?
This boy Erin's seeing-- do you know anything about him?
Yeah.
He's-- he's new in town.
He works for Garret.
He's a fighter?
I guess so.
Could you deal with him?
I already have once.

Yeah.
Why?
The word's up somebody's trying to book him some big money fights.
I was thinking of bringing some of my friends in.
l want to make sure you can take this guy.
Set it up.
This is it?
What the fuck were you expecting?
It's a private bout.
Come on.
This should be interesting.
"Yeah, I'm all right."
"Let yourself in, will you?"
[Baby Crying]
[Clicks]

[Yawns]
"Mmm, that crazy kid."
[Chuckles]
She locked me up with my own cuffs.

- Yeah.
I also got two feds- Mulderig and Klein.
[Groans]
What do we need those pricks for?
"Because our department's got about 908 bucks to make buys... and they can get all they want from ""Uncle Sap."""
Hello.
"These yours, darling?"
"[Man] Mike, take a look at this blue one with the tan, on the right."
- Try a practical demonstration.

"You have to say ""oway""."
He's here.

Are you alright?
I Ieft you so many messages.
Weren't you supposed to call as soon as you got there?
"Yes, but I was in a meeting."
- I have to reorganize everything.
- How are you?
"Fine, they're very welcoming."
- It's not even hot.
- Stop it.
Stop lying.
"I'm yourwife, you can tell me you're suffering."
"Sure, it's tough, it's a mess here."
I knew it!
- How well I know you.
- I'II be back in two weeks.
Taste the pastiera.

- Yes.
I heard a woman's voice.
"- It's Maria, my neighbor."
- And how.
- But you seem to be doing well.
- I'm great.
- But you seem to be doing well.
- I'm great.
"Why wouldn't you be great, with a friend like Russ here?"
- Yeah.
"Look at that, huh?"
"- Oh, jeez."
"Oh, boy."
How about that?
"Don't say a word, not one."
"Cause if i hear one comment like, ""What are you talking about?""..."
- I'm gonna call the cops.
- What?
Wh-What do you mean?
It slipped out.
We're listening.
Go ahead.
"I chewed on it for three days, and I'm convinced I have evidence to fuck you both up big time."
Bull.
You don't have any evidence.
What is that?
- Stop it.
Shut up.
You shut up.

Shut up!
No.
That's bullshit.

"I am not stupid, I am a German of Germany."
"No, you are an excrement German."
"All good, wanted?"
You are excited?
"Finally we can make the love,"
"Today also we have found a bloody fool,"
You cannot come on a daily basis here.
Why no?
Because you stay as an idiot.
And why I stay as an idiot?
Because yes.
"In agreement, I go away."
"He is determined, I go away."
But?

I go away.
To where you want to go?
"He is determined, I go away."
I go away.
Tell them to target the robot and await my command.
This is Nautilus.
What is the giant's current position?
"SOLDIER 1: 67. 71972 degrees west, by 44.50177 degrees north."
Locked and loaded.
"Oh, my baby, I'm so sorry."
- Stop the car.
- Hogarth!
"My God, honey, you're all right."
Go back!
We've gotta help him!
"Are you crazy, kid?"
You're lucky to be alive!
We're taking you to a hospital.
(SOLDIERS YELLING)
SOLDIER 2:
Everyone!
Out of the car!
We're evacuating the area.
What are you talking about?
We gotta get this boy to a hospital.
What boy?
Hogarth!
"Hogarth, no!"
(BEEPING)
Hey!
No!
Stop!
This is General Rogard.
Ready the attack and prepare to retreat to the fallback position.
No!
No!
"All right, but aren't you the guide?"
Are you ennoyed?
"Not ""ennoyed"", ""annoyed""!"
Annoyed?
"Not yet, but if you carry on, I soon will be."
"Welcome, engineer."
Hello.
- We're honoured.
- The honour's mine.
This is it.
Welcome.
This is one of the rooms.
What did she say?
"If it's too small, there are other rooms."
"Thank you, we'll only be staying a couple of nights."
Make yourself at home.
This is the bathroom.
Another bedroom...
That's good.
Thank you.
- Where's the old lady's house?
- Who?
- The lady who's ill.
- You mean Malek?
"Yes, son."
She lives over there.
You can see it from the roof.
- Which way?
- This way.
- Can we see it from here?
- Yes.
See that blue window?
What?

"Dad, I'm sick of you trying to always--"
"No, no, sing it!"
"No, I'm sick of singing!"

"Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!"
"Just go right back to your room and sing a ballad, mister!"
Just let me go!
Go ahead... make my day.
"You get upstairs, or I will slap you until there's little red handprints all over your face."
Ahgghgh!
"Oh, my God, what was that?"
!
Did you see that?

"Oh, my God, it hurt so bad!"
Agh!
"What the ""h"" is going on?"

This is crazy!
"Well, I had to see it to believe it!"
So I can break this set up?
You mean from the other shot?
So like--
TRENT HAAGA:
Yeah.
-We're very late.
We're never gonna get a movie.
I'm just worried--
You're absolutely right.
Can we [inaudible]?

So I get from here to here.
Is that it?
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
"Hey, Hasan."
Thank you.
That was great.
Thank you.
"Hang in, though."
We can still use you as the super stud that you are.
[Laugh]
"And we may need you as Toxie, too."
"Now, why is he getting out of the costume?"
Because he might be-
- I guess we got the real Toxie.
"Yeah, you're right."
WOMAN:
"I mean, I can put him back in it."
"Nah, it's all right."
Just stay handy.
"And we'll keep doing this, I think."
Like tomorrow we ought to do it also.
"I'm telling you, asshole, to get your ass out there!"
For crying out loud...
"Okay, I'll go."
"Come on, hurry!"
Shit.
Who the fuck are you?
What the hell?
"Stop, goddamn it!"
"Stop it, you dirty slut!"
You whore!
"Eat this, too."

I'm getting too old for this.
Don't be ridiculous.
Old ladies tell me men can still get it up after 70.
Then buy me some herbal supplements.
I keep having fucked-up nightmares.
What're you doing in there?
Oh hell.
Shit!
Nothing!
Get away from the car.
- Don't open it!
- What are you doing?
For crying out loud!
Dad!
Dad?
Look.
How do I look?
Pretty.
Freakishly pretty.
How long were you watching?
"See my hands, and my feet."
You can see it is I.
Myself.
Oh Lord...
Hvo-jm...
It's okay.
My baby.
You know Daddy's a policeman.
I'll take care of everything.
Daddy will.
"They were startled and frightened, thinking they saw a ghost."
"He said to them, ""Why are you troubled, and why do doubts rise in your minds?"""
Look at my hands and my feet.
It is I myself!
"Touch me and see; a ghost does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have."

It's still dawn.
What is it?
Somebody died.
Chun Woo-Hee
Who?
"You know Cho, the ginseng grower?"
Yeah.
His wife died.
It's pouring out there...
"Hello, Nina."
Take her to interrogation 819.
"Yes, sir."
What's the security configuration?
"Don't worry about it, Jack."
We're handling Nina.
"Ryan, you know what she's capable of."
That's none of your concern right now.
I'm sending you to medical to get checked out.
I'm fine.
I don't think you are.
What's this about?
We found evidence you've been injecting heroin.
"Tell me I'm off here, Jack."
Tell me I'm wrong.
I didn't think so.
"Ryan, I haven't missed a step."
I'm fine.
I have to cover my ass.
- I need to get you checked out.
- You're wasting time.
- Kim.
- Yeah?
I thought you'd want to know your dad's back.
What about Chase?
"Uh, he's a few minutes behind."
Thank you.
Kim.
Dad.
"Oh, god."
Hi.
She's here.
Meaning what?
Meaning nothing comes out of the mirror unless something goes back in.
Really?
And I am done... with that.
I beg to freaking differ.
Freak.
I suppose I should have destroyed that mirror when I had the chance.
Turn around.
This is on you.
You're the one who set me free.
"Well, I'm fixing that right now."
Turn around.
"Oh, my..."
I am never going back into that mirror.
Do you hear me?
Never.
And this.
This is my ace.
That's it.
Cash me out.
Curiouser and curiouser.
"Artie, now!"
"Pete, help me."
"Artie, where is Myka?"
- Thank you.
"- Yeah, you're welcome."
All right.
"Here, let's get this."
- So what now?
- Now...
Now we move Alice to the dark vault.
- What's the dark vault?
Why?
"Somebody's got to be a grown-up, and clearly, it's not you."
Uh... grown-ups drink.
I've been seeing someone.
Like...
A shrink?
Like a guy.
Who?
You don't know him.
And he doesn't drink?
He's been sober for 15 years.
Sounds horrible.
Wait.
Is that whose car is out front?
Yeah.
I'm on a waiting list for one of those.
How'd he get it?
He's a dealer.
Drugs?
Cars.
Asshole.
"So, where is he?"
He took the boys for a bike ride.
He's alone with the boys?
So?
"So you're giving me shit about my parenting skills, and some total stranger is off with..."
he's not a total stranger.
Yeah?
"Well, how well do you know this guy?"
Well.
How well?
Well enough that we're getting married.
Run!
Don't let them catch you!
"Jeffrey, run!"
The cops are afteryou!
Freeze!
"Jeffrey, the cops are all around!"
The cops are everywhere!
Run!
"Jeffrey, run away!"
"It's me,Jenny."
Don't move!
Let's go.
"What's wrong, officer?"
Flirting isn't a crime.
Arrest him!
"Keep clear, everyone."
Let me through.
Open those suitcases.
- What were you doing at the airport?
- Chasing a piece ofass.
What's yourjob?
I'm a casting agent for movie companies.
- But you resisted arrest!
- I was drunk.
Stand up and walk a straight line!
- Where's your friend?
- What friend?
You know who.
He's in grave danger.
Help him.
Tell me where he is.
I want to help him solve his problem.
BRENDAN FLYNT:
"Right, right, OK."
INTERVIEWER:
And that way it's cheaper to set on fire
A non-established character.
I don't think it matters.
I think it was more like that was on his resume.
"And they went, oh, there's an idea."
So now he starts right here.
MAN:
Where are your cameras?
He'll do the whole stunt.
I get most of the flame.
You'll still get your stuff here.
Is that OK?
So I'm gonna have both cameras at the bottom.
MAN:
So both the cameras--
BRENDAN FLYNT:
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
Put my cameras down here.
MAN:
Yeah that' my buddy TJ up there.
I'm a little nervous just for him.
INTERVIEWER:
You're worried for him?
"Hey, how long have you been doing this?"
About 22 years.
"Setting myself on fire, probably about 10."
INTERVIEWER:
Yeah?
You nervous at all?
We all had that.
Why can't they have that?
I don't know.
"There, did you see that?"
- What?
- That guy.
- People are looking at me.
- That's good.
They're looking at me.
"Oh, they're looking at you."
H i.
H i.
See?
Now what was that about?
- He said hi?
- That was not hi.
- That was hi.
- That was a different hi.
That was a he wants to get to know you hi.
From someone who never talks to me has never talked me...
and would never talk to me.
Except now he thinks you put out so he talks to you.
"- See, I told you that note was good."
- Rayanne.
Maybe Jordan started the rumor.
Don't be ridiculous.
It's a very guy thing to do.
- Hey Catalano.
- Hey.
"So, what about this gun thing?"
I would hate to be that soda bottle.
Splat.
I knew it.
- You asshole.
- I'm sorry.
"It is you that's been smoking too, isn't it?"
Wha...?
"Wait, what does that even matter?"
Have you...?
!
Have you been smoking?
No.
"No, I haven't."
I talked to Neil.
I told him.
He said I could stay at his boat for a while.
Excuse me?
Now you're moving out?
"- You're, like, leaving me?"
- No.
"No, I just assumed that you wouldn't want me to..."
Aren't we gonna deal with this?
Don't you wanna find some way for us to work through this?
"I assumed that when I told you, you would want me out."
Is that what you want?
No.
Okay.
Okay.

"- Hi, boys."
"I'm Mrs. Roberts, and this is Officer Gardner."
How are you doing?
- This yours?
- No.
"- Well, how about I leave it here just in case it is?"
- Whatever.
"- Is your dad home, boys?"
- Why y'all here?
- Let's go inside.
Come on.
- What do you want?
- It's all right.
"- Look, I told you y'all can't be here, okay?"
"Mommy is dead, Gonki."
Mommy is dead.
Yes.
Want me to sleep here?
Gonki Galonki is sad.
Daddy Galonki is very sad too.
How long have you been here?
I just got here.
"You look good, Daddy."
How are you?
I'm fine.
And you?
Great.
How's your son?
He is in the army theater.
That doesn't surprise me.
And your wife?
Nira and I got divorced 5 years ago.
I didn't know.
"Until it happened, I didn't know either."
"Here, something sweet."
Thank you.
"It's a good play, ""The Enchanted Nose""."
"Yes, it's never been done here before."
"Maybe in drama school, I'm not sure."
It's a lovely comedy.
So much street wisdom.
Renee had a very sharp eye.
They don't write like that anymore.
How many characters?
They all fit into a cab.
Could a play like that work today?
"Yeah, which takes me back to, ""Maybe we should come back tomorrow."""
No.
"This way, my darling boy."
"Ah, here he is!"
The man of the hour!
"Whassup, innit?"

Zapatti's bullet killed the child.
It wasn't the cop.
That's it!
That's what passes for good news these days.
I'll take it.
I saw Tino Zapatti's probation report.
"Exemplary, but an odd thing."
It's front-loaded.
-With who?
-With supervisory personnel.
But it's signed off on by an honest judge.
-Judge Walter Stern?
-Yes.
Thank God.
I'm meeting Frank Anselmo for breakfast.

Don't piss up his leg.
Just get him off this infrastructure thing.
Nothing wrong with it...

Good work tonight.
Mrs. Marquand couldn't stop talking about the cover of Time.
I think she collects them.
"National ink, the mother's milk of politics."
It's just scars.
Chicks dig scars.
I love scars.
Now here we go.
"Oh, wonderful."
You're doing very good.
What?
"What's that, Larry?"
Really?
You want to take our love to the next level?
"Well, I..."
"The setting's a little strange, but..."
"Well, I suppose we wouldn't be the first star-crossed lovers to make love in a crypt."
"Oh Larry, I accept."
Oh-ohhhhh!
Oomph!
"No, not there."
Maybe it's here.
"No, it's never there."
There's no murder weapon anywhere.
"Come on, Marnie, you're looking for a remote control."
Suspicious.
What is?
Just a second Ricky.
Jumbo panties!
Excuse me.
Aahhh!
I've been caught.
What are you doing with my panties?
What should I do?
"S-say you're a panty fiend, sorry."
"Sorry, I'm a panty fiend."
Is he seeing somebody?
- Why are you asking me?
- Just tell me the truth.
"Is he seeing somebody else, Chris?"
Look at me!
I'm looking at you.
I don't know if he's seeing anybody else.
You don't know.
How could you not know?
I don't know anything.
Hey.
This is Michael.
- Leave a message...
- What is with the yelling?
- Where did he go?
- I don't know.
Jenna!
"Michael, call me as soon as you get this message."
I'm gonna kill you.
"Oh, my God!"
What the hell are you doing?
You're calling him?
"- No, that wasn't him."
- To tell him what?
What is this?
- What the fuck is this?
- I honestly have no fucking idea.
"- Yes, you do."
Do you know her?
- Just give me a break.
"- No, I don't."
- Do you know her?
We are here to see--
- What is his name?
We're here--
- Vagina.
"No, we're here to see Raza."
OK.
Follow me.
"Thank you, ma'am."
"We'll follow...you, I guess."
"Ba-dunk, ba-dunk, ba-dunk"
"She got it, she got it"
"She got it, she got it"
"- Hey, guys."
- Hey.
"- Hey, Raza!"
- What?
What's up?
- Kumar and Roldy?
"- What's up, man?"
I haven't seen you guys since graduation.
What are you guys doing here?
"Wait, what's up with the orange jumpsuits?"
"- Hey, no, no, question number one--"
- It's kind of a long story. l-  ...what's up with this party?
- What do you mean?
There's exposed vagina all over your house.
Yeah.
That was my idea.
"I don't know about you guys, I'm sick of all the hype over topless."
Really?
I always liked toplessness.
That's--
- Think about it.
Think about it on your own.
You're Seigaku's pillar of strength.
Stop kidding around.
Echizen's not coming again today?
What did you hear about it?
Don't worry about it?
Looks like he came to school though.
What happened?
Is it a cold?
It is a cold.
"- Ne, ne, ne, did something happen to the chibi?"
- Ah...
What do you mean something happened?
- It wasn't easy coming here.
- Then what do you want me to do?
At least help me a little.
The age of Kanto will continue tonight.
"Ryoma, let's have a game."
- Don't want.
- Good.
Heh?
"Oi, Ryoma."
"{\pos(192,242)}I'm bored."
What's up?
"{\pos(192,242)}Why?"
"Ya, they want those training camp."
Why?
"{\pos(192,242)}Sure."
"{\pos(192,242)}See you then."
"Mum there's still one more week, right."
I understand.
That is the reason!
That will deepen the hatred between us.
I don't care!
You want us to kill own men!
"Yes, kill them all!"
- And if we won't?
- And if we won't?
"Listen, I want you to fight with your own men."
Only the winning side can survive.
Or all will be killed.
We have no choice!
"Tat-chi, do your best!"
Ming-kai!
- I won't use 8-divine Sword.
- You!
My fists will suffice!
"- Fung-wu, take the sword!"
- There's not much time left!
Take your sword!
Fung-wu!
Take it!
- Shoot!
- No shooting!
Stop!
No shooting!
Stop!
- Sister!
- Take the sword!
- Do it!
- No!
You must take the sword!

"Come on, Mitch, are you in?"
"No, I'm out."

Do you mind?
"-well, turn it off!"
"Come on, will you?"
Let the girls have their music?
stanley!
There you are.
I didn't hear you name it!
"-Didn't I name it, Mitch?"
-I wasn't listening.
What were you doing?
He was looking through the drapes.
-I was looking through no drapes.
-We're gonna play.
"We're gonna deal this hand again, play cards or quit."
deal me out.
"AII right, this game's gonna be Spit in the Ocean."
Yes?
hello.
Excuse me.
The little boy's room is occupied right now.
"Oh, excuse me."
Yes.
Yes.
- Is everything okay?
- Yes.
- All okay.
- Yes father.
Shall we go?
Bravo!
What?
Scared of all these men?
No normally there's always a bunch of beggars outside the temple.
Minister Pradhan's sent us.
We're here to take you to ACP Pradhan's farm house.
Come quietly or else we'll beat you up.
No.
I am scared.
I'm frightened.
Look at this I'm getting goose-bumps.
Don't beat me.
Don't beat me.
Boss.
Run!
Jump.
You jump.
Tell me something will anybody be at home?
Daddy the Boss is here all alone.
Where are our goons?
Hello sir.
I could've pulverized your goons back there.
But then I had a brainstorm.
I left those rascals back in those lanes.
And I came visiting your home.
I don't get to do a door slam on me.
I do a door slam on you.
This is my bar!
That means I get the last
- friggin' door slam.
"- Oh, yeah?"
What about this?
!
- What about this?
!
- Ha-ha!
"Oh, yeah?"
Yeah!
- Moving out.
"- Oh, yeah."
Aha!
"So, Trent wouldn't give the ring back?"
Tell me how that went down.
It was dimly lit.
Through the darkness I saw an Adonis.
"He looked at me, I looked at him."
The nipple went in my mouth.
I loved it.
I can still picture it now.
"Brett, are you OK?"
Are we not doing flashbacks any more?
"Anyway, I'm not giving up."
We're going to get that diamond back.
How do you get at diamond out of a guy's mouth?
How stupid can the guy be?
Let's just think.
For a year I was Trent oregano dealer.
"Now, you say it."
Is beautiful.
Tonight.
What?
What?
What're you doing?
"You're the guy's wife, Cora."
You told me that.
You were gonna leave me?
-I was writing you a note.
-Were you writing me a thank-you note?
-Is that what you were doing?
"-Cora, look."
Live here.
Live with the guy.
"Took a chance, we didn't make it."
Live with the man.
He wants to have a baby.
You understand?
He's changed.
He says the accident changed him and now I'm supposed to have his kid.
"How am I gonna do that, Frank?"
How am I supposed to have his baby?
I can't have his baby.
The only one I could have a baby by is you.
Okay.
Say you won't leave me.
Please.
"Just stall him, babe."
Just stall him.
-Going far?
-We're goin' to Ventura.
You know what?
I need to un-know that!
Your friend is here.
Chuck.
Thanks for coming.
"Yeah, well, I don't have a lot of time, so can we do this?"
"Hey, no, don't!"
Don't!
Shut up.
Do it.
"Okay, this is gonna sting a little at first, but after a few seconds, you're gonna be feeling much more cooperative."
"No, stop it!"
"Help me hold him, please."
Don't!
"Okay, I'm giving him a low dose, but he's gonna conk out any minute, so you guys are gonna have to act fast."
There we go.
All right.
Let's take this again.
Where's his ex-wife?
I-c-
- I c-
- I can't.
Just relax.
That's it.
Calm down.
Where did you hide her?
Cy-
- Cyprus.
She's in Nicosia...
Under the name...
Yasmine...
Sadek.
- No.
"- Uh, well, it's tomorrow."
"All right, um, Horace?"
Listen.
It's been a month.
I didn't need Ricky to tell me what we already know.
He's gone.
So-
- So what are you gonna do?
- What are you talking about?
What the fuck-
- What are you--
Why are you saying this to-- What are you saying to me right now?
Why are you saying this?
"- Horace, because, right now is right now."
Pete is gone.
Are you gonna do Easter?
What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?
- Iâm not doing Easter.
Iâm not doing any of that.
None of that makes sense without Pete here.
"- Okay, so, then close this place down."
Go do something else.
- I can' t do that.
- Why not?
"- Because he's gonna come back, 'cause he might come back."
- He's-
"- Horace, he is not coming back."
Horace.
"Pete is dead, Horace."
Fuck it.
"Hi, honey."
Is that my phone in your pocket?
Or are you just happy to see me?
"Oh, God, that's all kinds of wrong."
"Uh, no."
Mine.
"- Okay, I'm gonna go shower."
- Okay.
Quick.
How do I write her back?
Just text her everything ys.
"Yeah, compliment her face without makeup, and tell her it's the best sex you ever had."
This is my son.
"Oh, they're here."
"All right, uh."
"Look, I'd love to stay... and help you pretend to be your son, but I have to go pretend I'm dying."
Hello.
I'm Victoria Chase.
This is Dr. Lori Hernandez.
I'm Dr. Robert Moore.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Ah.
Likewise.
"I'm sorry for staring, but I'm just surprised at how well you look."
"Oh, thank you, but I'm tired."
So very tired.
Please sit.
I know that I need to.
"Hmm, that's very odd."
What?
You're not limping at all.
Limping?
"ABC, NBC, CNN."
Mike.
That Canada story... still interest you?
Everything interests me.
"Uh, I quit, Mike."
Bullshit.
Come on.
It all worked out.
I did?
What do I tell a source on the next tough story?
No.
What got broken here...

THE wind will CARRY US
A film by Abbas KlAROSTAMl
Where's the tunnel then?
We've passed it.
When?
Someone's been sleeping!
Where is it?
"We've passed it, back near Biston."
We're heading nowhere.
Read the address to see where it is.
How many times do I have to read it?
"After the junction, we take a winding road."
This is the winding road.
We're on it.
"After this road, we head downhill."
Then there's a single tree.
"Thank you, Roko."
"Look at it, a real champion."
- Thank you.
- No problem.
"Come on, folks!"
Come and get it!
"Hello, 13 Ribarska St."
What do you say?
"Out here, all the fish is as big as this one."
"I'd like to ask you something, if I can..."
"No, you can't."
What devil brings you here?
Praise the Lord.
Now and forever.
"It was opened, so I came in for a prayer."
Do you need any help?
"Thank you, my child."
I'm done.
Sister...
I'd like to give a donation to your church... if I may.
You may... of course you may.
We pass this on to the Child Care Centre.
Here.
My child...
Thank you.
On behalf of them.
What brings you here?
"Have you come alone, or..."
I'm alone.
My child...
"If you need anything, just ask."
"Thank you, Sister."
"Because I do not know whether night is a dream, and he hates me, and now he's going to give me to them like he did with the others."
They are going... to sacrifice me to the demons!
- It's all right.
It's all right.
You're just imagining things.
Everything is going to be okay.
- What the devil is going on in here?
!
"- My apologies, ma'am."
This poor girl is clearly suffering from some kind of delusional attack.
- Lucy... you cannot hurt me.
- I can.
I will!
- You can't.
Gunther.
No!
Let go of me.
The wolves!
The wolves!
No!
The wolves...
"- Thank you, sir."
Porter.
- Detective Thomas.
Good to see you.
- How're you doing?
Good to see you.
- I'm good.
I'm good.
"Please, sit."
- Sure.
- How are you?
"Since you have been decided, will you go with me also."
Ah...yes.
We go.
Lets go.
"Yet this traffic, no longer can be crossed."
It is truth.
Slowly...
-Sandro?
you have bound?
"-No, it is that I..."
-What you do?
"We go, we go, lady."
Where you are going to look for them?
In the day-care center?
The very ready one!
You accompanied her to house?
"Eh, boys, Prof. Cicchirini has bought a new car."
-No.
-That yes.
-I do not create it to me.
-If you I to it say.
We are going to let pass this opportunity?
No.
"Boys, a question:"
Which can be the car of Cicchirini?
I believe that it is the one with the canvas.
Bravo!
Right answer.
"-Goodbye, mother."
-Paulino.
Mother.
"I must go to me, we see you behind schedule this?"
"Yes, I'm going to the fields to get my things."
Where's the engineer from?
Tehran or Hamadan?
"Get up, you've slept enough, you layabouts."
"Get up, I've brought fresh apples."
This is for Ali and this one for Keyvan.
- Hello.
"- Hello, are you well?"
I have some fresh bread for you.
- What is it?
- Bread.
We have fresh bread.
What more can you want?
You won't have another chance like this.
This is for me.
The big apple is for uncle Jahan.
How about that!
This isn't Jahan's apple.
I think it's yours.
"Yes, yes, it's coming."
Here.
All right.
- Have you had your share?
- Yes.
Where are you going?
To school.
- To school?
- Yes.
Do you have time to show us the village?
"No, I have exams."
I'll go with you to school.
All right.

Okay.

Yeah.

"- Yeah, talented."
What's the story?
"Yes, I, too, would like to know."
"I don't have it all figured out, but it's about this girl after, like, an atomic war, and she has to learn how to survive on her own."
"Well, now that's depressing."
- I think it's cool.
- Depressing and cool.
-And I went up.
"-Son, we are penguins"
-We can not fly.
-But Sven is a penguin.
"I do not know what type of penguin Sven is, but penguins are"
"Emperor, we can not ..."
-If I learn to fly
Mom can get out of there.
I do not know if there is a way out.
"Erik, surely, is not flying."
If you want you must desire and if you want
-What is your wish!
"-Erik, get real."
They are trapped.
They are hungry and afraid.
The last thing we need is false hope.
-Boys?
-Then all will die.
"Boys, what's the problem with you two?"
It's just a conversation.
-Erik?
We need a mother's love.
It will explode.
"Dude, why will not catch a few more fish?"
"He is not hungry, Aunt Gloria."
"Yeah beauty, Atticus, I know, I understand."
I'm going fishing.
"Erik, stop with this anger."
"Calm down, Erik."
"Honey, take a step back."
Close your eyes ...
Take a deep breath ...
Pity yourself for how they'll cripple you!
Poor girl.
"--Here, take it as a keepsake from grandpa!"
"--Pasha, calm down!"
"--Egoists --Pasha, where to?"
Comrade!
Why do you look at me that way?
--Me?
"--Yeah, you"
I wasn't looking at you
No.
You clearly were.
Familiarize yourself.
A monthly pass!
"Hey, pal!"
May I join you?
She kicked me out
Now she'll start begging me back
"""Come in"" she'll say."
"I'll say ""No"" out of principle"
"I have no home, no corner of my own."
"That's how it is, pal"
--And where's yours?
--Who?
--Fedor!
--And I keep silent
--Fedor --Whaaaaat!
Nothing
See that?
I trained her
And you don't just go back either.
Train her good.
Hey...
Come on.
She killed them here.
The old woman got it the worst of it.
Her head was smashed open like a watermelon.
You saw with your own eyes?
Of course I did.
How?
The old woman tells me the Jap is a ghost.
He was gonna suck her blood dry.
The Jap?
Yeah.
The Jap with the limp.
"Oh, him!"
You've seen him?
Yeah.
How many times?
Once or twice.
Be careful.
Why?
"The old woman says, if you keep seeing him around, it's because he's stalking you."
To suck your blood dry.
Wait here for a second.
Okay.
Get your ass over here.
What?
Get over here now!
But I just found the dermatologist.
I found a witness.
"So, get over here as fast as you can."
What the...?
Where'd she go?
- The fee.
For companionship.
Right.
This is all I have.
Hopefully that's enough.
We can stop by a cash machine.
"So this is what a day at the office is like, huh?"
Just another typical Tuesday.
Neil... and Grace.
Is it date night tonight?
How adorable you both look.
- I'm impressed.
- That's because it's authentic.
Everything in the spirit of the time period.
"Except tonight, the women are in charge."
Explore.
Make new friends.
Enjoy.
- Drink?
- Absolutely.
Two vodka martinis.
Up.
Olives.
- Have we met?
- No.
You look so familiar.
Yes.
So do you.
- Grace.
"- Oh, Audrey."
"Oh, now I get it."
You cancelled me so that you could do him yourself.
- Okay.
Is there a safe word you can think of?
Something easy to remember in distress?
"How about the word ""stop""?"
"- Good choice. ""Stop"" it is."
- Yeah.
"Okay, we'll leave you to enjoy your evening."
- Alright.
- You'll hear from me in a moment.
Just make yourself at home.
"Okay, all right."
"Well, take her easy."
Harlech...
Shadow.
Is this real?
"Yeah, it's real."
That's real.
It's really dead.
-  Cooper.
"- Oh, hey."
- Are you hearing me?
- Loud and clear.
Oh!
"Reaching for the Dutch courage already, I see."
- I'm afraid that wine's non-alcoholic.
- Lame.
"- Well, we need you with a clear head."
- Okay.
Fair point.
Fair point.
This is high-quality craftsmanship.
This is nice.
Back to the hotel?
What hotel?
The Intersexion.
I'II go check it out.
well... next!
You go.
"Name, address and occupation."
Duck...
"lionel PIourde,"
"I Iive at 157, 3rd lane in St-Jude."
Occupation...
"I worked on the Van KIee farm, but I had a small accident, so..."
I'm declared an invalid...
that's about it.
"OK, go ahead."
What happened?
What happened?
"well, a Iot happened."
From the top.
"well, at the beginning..."
"Josée Morin, Touchy Tougas and me, we... we met at the hotel around 7:00pm."
"Start with when you arrived, and you saw the black guy."
You saw him with the lady and her gun.
That's it.
That's what?
That's it... we saw them.
You got out of your car?
Yeah.
"Who was there with you, aside from the lady, her son and the suspect?"
There was the one you call Touchy?
Sorry.
"Josée Morin, the dancer..."
"- Eh, the answer is... no."
No?
Then why did you save her from jail?
You taught her to save me.
It's only fair I save her.
What's your relationship with this girl?
Tell me!
"Fung-wu, the Highness is behind this."
He deliberately pinned the blame on us.
Someone is there!
"We're surrounded, let's go inside."
- They're the Ching army!
"- And archery, too!"
What shall we do now?
Their aim is Mr. Chao and me.
We'll escape in different directions.
"Fung-wu, you and Miss Cheung should escape out the back window."
Yan-ling and I will fight them in the front.
Shoot!
Now!
Run!
"You go first, I'll stop them!"
Miss Cheung!
Run!
Let's go together.
I taught you to fight.
Watch out!
You have come back?
Chin Kang Fist?
8-divine Sword?
Fantastic!
Still fighting!
[Jessie] What's going on?
- Are you Richard Sammler?
- l am.
We have a warrant.
is there another computer?
"- No, just the kids'."
- Take that too.
- [Jessie] My report!
- Sweetie.
What are you looking for?
"It's in the warrant, read it."
Have your family stand aside.
- Can they do this?
"- Oh, yeah."
"- Oh, my God."
"- Hey, watch it!"
"Sir, listen, stand aside now."
[man] into the back bedroom.
"Look, Rick, I've just come from the DA's office."
Where you've been spending a lot of time.
Mason Gould is on 3.
- The opportunity to clear your name.
- On TV?
- You didn't know about the bribes?
"- No, absolutely not."
I want the two of us to face this like people who love each other do.
I can't do that right now.
Ripped By mstoll
Go!
Go!
Go!
John.
I want you to be happy.
What?
"This is your wake-up call, Mr. Klein."
I didn't ask for a wake-up call.
"What happened to you, Mr. Klein?"
Yes.
I can't believe I got through.
"Gordon, where are you, man?"
Speak up.
"Listen, John, he was right."
Mr. Cold was right about everything.
Right?
Right about what?
I can't hear you.
He was right about understanding.
"It's real, John."
I want you to know.
It's real
What is...
What are you talking about?
You've got nothing to worry about.
I'll see you in time.
Gordon?
Gordon!
Can they tell how long he was out there?
Looks like he's been dead about eight hours.
He died of exposure.
What made you come out here?
- He called me.
- When?
I didn't like the way he sounded.
I think I'm really hurt here.
"Help me, you son of a bitch."
"I mean, even out here, right?"
"Someone always does, eventually."
"I'm sorry I hit you, man."
"I'm really sorry, man."
"What were you doing, running in the middle of the road, anyhow?"
Can I move my...
No.
Bug out of here.
"Hey, stop."
I need help.
I'm down here.
Get off me.
You look pretty tasty.
Get away from me.
I think I'll start with your eyes.
Get away from me.
"Yum. ""Ant-solutely"" delicious."
"Please, don't hurt me."
"You're a real mess, my friend."
"I mean, seriously racked up."
Please.
Save your strength.
That would be my advice.
You'll need it.
Help me.
"You'll be all right, fellow."
Just lie still.
I think I'm paralysed.
Can you...
You'll be all right.
I'm one ofyou.
"I grew up here, a stone's throwfrom here, on a little lemon ranch in Yorba Linda."
"Itwas the poorest lemon ranch in California, I can tellyou that."
"The poorest lemon ranch in California, I can assure you ofthat."
My dad sold it before they found oil on it.
My dad sold it before they found oil on it.
- But itwas all we had.
- But itwas all we had.
- My dad built the farm.
- Huh.
You're new here.
- What's your name?
"- Joaquin, Mr. Hoover."
Oh.
My fathersacrificed everything he had... so that his sons could go to college.
- Agentle Quaker motherquietly wept...
"- oh, Christ."
- When he went to war.
"- Turn this crap off, Clyde."
It's giving me a headache.
"You may go, Joaquin."
"I wantto see him, Clyde."
"Edgar, he works in the kitchen."
"Notthe boy, you idiot."
Nixon.
- [Sound off]
- You hearwhat he said in Oregon... aboutme having too much power?
It's between Nixon and a Kennedy again.
Who do you want?
Kennedy?
[Laughs]
Never.
"Yes, I know, I know!"
Why you say I know nothing?
"Look, look, look..."
You know the horse?
Uh...
Nitwit or Dragonfly?
Dragonfly!
There isn't a horse called...
you're the nitwit!
"What is ""wit-nit""?"
It doesn't matt...
I could spend the rest of my life having this conversation!
"Please, please try to understand before one of us dies!"
I try.
You're going to forget everything you know about Nitwit.
"No, no, Dragonfly."
Dragonfly!
Yes!
"Sí, sí, sí."
Eventually.
What?
Eventually.
"Uh, at the end."
"No, no, no, forget it now!"
Now?
"Well, pretend you forget!"
Pretend?
"Well, don't say anything to anyone about the horse!"
I know that.
You tell me that this morning!
- Basil...?
- So don't do it again!
"- Pop that shirt off, and we'll start punching."
"- Oh, my God."
Really?
"- Yeah, man."
Every time I'm gonna take...
- Why can't you just take it off?
- Just take it off.
- You're ruining the moment.
- What is with you and the moment?
You know what?
Forget it.
Forget it.
- Who do you want to punch you first?
- I don't care.
- That was good.
"- Well, you caught me off guard."
That was a big part of it.
- That was the same spot.
"The same, exact spot."
- Yeah.
"Charlie, if we keep this up, you're gonna be... the best underground street fighter ever, bro."
- Okay.
Okay.
Deandra.
- Just 10 more minutes.
"- No, no."
That's it.
"Dee, that's..."
- I love it.
I need more of it.
It's dangerous.
Enough.
"We're here with you, Stan."
Stan.
Stan.
Now do you believe me?
Shut up.
There must be an explanation.
You sure you put him in the incinerator?
Yeah.
He's ashes.
I don't know who or what we just saw but it's not the same guy.
That cold.
"He's here in the house, with us."
"It's like ice in here, boss."
"What I don't understand is, why did he come to this house?"
Has he ever been here before?
Never.
I barely knew him.
I met you all for the first time last night.
Go.
Let's go.
Wait.
Don't leave me.
"Please, don't leave me."
Go on and see what it is.
He's been gone five minutes.
Where the devil is he?
I don't know.
Maybe he's with Stan.
I'm going up there.
Look!
One of my murderers is dead.
The others will also die.
I killed them for you.
You did it for yourself.
"Why did you write to me, then, Jess?"
Because I love you.
And you were the only person I could turn to.
"You're all I've got right now, Jess."
Promise me you won't go away again.
I need my brother back.
I promise.
JESS:
Promise me you won't go away again.
I need my brother back.
Are you ready?
One condition.
Just this.
Then we're done.
I'll talk to Calum.
He'll get you everything you need.
You talking to me?
You what?
You what?
Haha haha!
"Check this, yo."
Don't point a gun at me ever again.
Where'd you get it?
Kosovan Kate.
Who's Kosovan Kate.
She works with the Albanians.
Here.
You need to wear these.
Give the old bill an head start.
"So she's setting up her own people, is she?"
He was good.
"He was very, very good."
"Señor, nobody has come out of there alive..."
Please.
Señor!
Stop.
Stay out of the light.
Forrestal.
Let us hurry.
There is nothing to fear here.
That's what scares me.
Stay here.
If you insist Señor.
Give me the whip.
Throw me the idol.
No time to argue.
"Throw me the idol, I throw you the whip."
Give me the whip.
Adios señor.
Adios stupido.
Dr. Jones.
Again we see there is nothing you can possess which I can not take away.
And you thought I'd given up.
You choose the wrong friends.
This time it will cost you.
"Too bad the Hovitos don't know you the way I do, Belloq."
Yes.
Too bad.
You could warn them...
if only you spoke Hovitos.
"Jock, start the engine!"
Get it up!
Be in the moment?
Programs!
Anybody need programs?
"Buy it now, buy it now."
Programs.
Programs.
Programs.
"Hey, you want a program, man?"
- Thanks.
I'm good.
- Cool.
I got ice cream.
Anyone?
Want ice cream?
"- No, I'm good."
"- Ice cream, guys."
Who's--who's hungry?
Ice cream?
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Meeting Dave.
What are you doing here?
"Well, Dave gave me this ticket and told me to meet him here."
- What a jerk.
"- Well, look, I have zero intention of sitting here with you all night, so..."
Fine.
It's cool.
I'll watch the game by myself.
No way.
I'm gonna watch the game by myself.
No.
"If you're going in, I'm going in."
They're no way that you're gonna go in.
Do you remember the coat?
- No.
- You do so!
You used to keep it spotless except for your dandruff.
- I didn't have dandruff.
- You did so!
"After you bought it, you stopped trying... to get me to go into the fields with you."
"It was the best contraceptive... ever invented, that coat."
It's in the attic.
How are ya?
"How are ya, Sharon?"
I'm pregnant.
Did I tell yous?
Ha ha ha!
"Yeah, well, I am."
She's bleedin' serious!
"- Well done, Sharon."
"- Thanks, Jackie."
"Yeah, Sharon."
Congrats.
"Thanks, Mary."
"Well done, Sharon, ya thick bitch, ya."
"Jesus, though, Sharon."
I know.
"It's terrible, really."
"- How long you gone, Sharon?"
- Sixteen weeks.
You don't look it.
I do.
I won't argue.
You're the expert.
I'm only messin'.
I never left you.
I could have lived with you.
And him.
Love cannot be wrong.
"But I will leave him, if it means losing you."
I give my life to you.
Tilo!
Tilo!
- Are you OK?
- (Coughs)
Are you OK?
I woke up and you were gone.
I read your note.
I crossed the bridge and just as I got to the other side the quake hit.
Are you sure you're OK?
Yes.
Let's get you out...
Let's get you out of here.
(Coughs)
"Tilo Mistress, you have shown your devotion to the spices."
The spices know you will never leave them.
"Doug, I'm not leaving."
You're staying with me.
I mean here.
I'm not leaving here.
"Tilo, there's nothing left here."
This is my home.
I guess I can help you rebuild it.
You never told me what my spice is.
Sesame.
Tilo.

"God bless the moon, and God bless me"
And God bless the somebody

Good morning.
Hey.
Sit down.
Thanks.
Guess what.
What?
I'm pregnant.
You're kidding.
Never more serious.
Wow.
"Oh, uh..."
Are you happy?
Yeah!
Are you happy?
I think so.
"Yeah, I think I am."
Sit down.
Should you sit down?
"I'm only two months along, I'm fine."
"Oh, my God."
A baby.
Straight ahead.
Turn left.
"Your kind of party, huh?"
I was never in a fraternity.
I was much too serious.
I bet you were 29 even when you were 19.
Put it this way.
"If I had to do it again,"
"I'd do it knowing that after you graduate, no one ever gives a fuck what your GPA was."
Hey!
Kim!
Hi!
"This is Sara, and Bridgitte and John."
- Hey.
How's it going?
- Cool.
Sorry about that.
"At the tone, please record your message."
"Chris, it's Jenna."
Michael and you both have your cell phones off.
"Listen, Izzy's dad just died."
"We're all gonna head over there, so I guess I'll see you guys there."
Bye.
Go ahead.
I'll be okay.
"- I want things to be okay, Daddy."
- I know.
Go ahead.
Take care of your friend.
I'm fine.
I really am.
You have no messages.
Move!
[shouts]
[gunshots]
[groans]
Drop it.
Drop it!
[whispers] Drop the gun.
"Stop, John."
You stop!
Stop!
I will fucking put a bullet in this motherfucking priest.
"It'll be ""bulletville."""
Drop it!
You wanna shoot that scattergun?
Shoot it.
You'll kill us both.
"Fuck it, John."
Just shoot this crazy piece of shit.
His life for mine.
[gun clicks]
Seat belts.
[cell phone buzzes]
Y'ello?
John?
This is Agent Armstrong of the FBI.
I thought you should know we have a line on the people that killed your wife and daughter.
...:
SiliconChip :...

Microsoft'sannualsalesof$ 58 billion.
"Crazy, this."
"One red one you eat, another you don't."
"Look, there's a fine one."
I don't like that one at all...
You silly thing.
Please...
Where are the others?
Where are they all?
- Where are the others?
- There aren't any others.
- What about Henry?
- He's... back there.
"Elisa, someone's looking for you!"
When my pal was dying in the battlefield he asked me to bring you this.
"Elisa, my child..."
Pull yourself together.
"Oh God, what now."
"I've left my message, so goodbye."
Elisa.
Look at me.
Daddy.
Your Grace.
"A great performance, Jean!"
"- Yes, you'll get a medal."
"- Thank you, your Grace..."
A medal?
!
I've got 'dozens of those!
"Goodness, what happened?"
Henry was killed.
I'm so sorry.
That's life for you... that's life...
"Do you love me, Frank?"
Sure.
You know I do.
"Don't worry about anything, okay?"
Don't tell me that.
Evening.
"You knew I had to stop here, didn't ya?"
She's beautiful.
I come by here all the time.
When'd you put her up?
-Just today.
-Had to be.
What was that?
-There's a damn cat up there.
"-Oh, yeah."
"Hey, they sound a lot like babies cryin' sometimes, don't they?"
"Yes, they do."
"Well, I expect I ought to get back to work."
"Yeah, well, we all got to sometime, that's for sure."
That's for sure.
Take care now.
"Yeah, I'll do that."
"Frank, get over here!"
"Oh, my God!"
What happened to the light?
I hit him!
I hit him!
-What happened?
-I hit him and all the lights went out!
Get on the phone.
Call an ambulance.
The cop came by and saw everything.
"- Excuse me, Jesse."
I've got to run.
- Have a great day.
"- Have yourself a ""morning air"" day."
- I will.
Filthy rich.
Let's call a spade a spade and a chicken a chicken.
"Julie, call me the minute that Peter Rickman is out of the OR."
- The very minute.
"- Yes, Dr. James."
Perhaps you can get me an update on Hook's progress.
"Yes, Dr. James."
"Okay, Elmer, there it is."
A three-pound universe.
What do you know?
Go back to sleep.
Elmer.
That nurse down there is no longer dancing to the sound of the Big Brass Band.
"Would you mind squirreling her away in a corner, please?"
Thank you.
What the hell did you just do?
I don't know.
How the hell should I know?
I'm just the dog.
Hook.
Yeah.
"Just slow down, Otto."
I'm on my way.
"Mrs. Rickman, I assure you..."
- Are you my husband's doctor?
- That would be Hook.
He was on call when Mr. Rickman was admitted.
It was the same day the girls disappeared.
I was at the farmhouse waiting for a brick.
- It was five in the morning.
- What kind of car was it?
A white Dyane 6.
He drove right past me.
The car had a sticker on the back window.
What kind of sticker?
A woman with long hair and a hat.
- How long?
This long?
- A little shorter.
- What was the hat like?
- Big.
Like a priest.
Like this?
I've seen this before somewhere.
"- Anything else, Fermin?"
- That's what I saw.
Hey.
I did see your problem.
The dead are waiting for you.
It's almost time.
He gave her these towels.
They were from the hotel where he worked in Malaga.
- What was her friend's name?
- Sebastian.
- Sebastian what?
- I don't know.
- Is he from around here?
- I don't know.
- Have you ever seen him?
Honey?
This reminds me of the time in college when we drove to Fort lauderdale in my Austin HeaIy.
I haven`t thought about that for a Iong time.
Remember what we did in the car?
It`s amazing we didn`t get in an accident.
Want to relive a fond memory?
Are you serious?
No!
Why not?
"Because, that`s why."
The kids are asleep.
Let`s just wait `tiII we get to a motel.
"Okay, we`II wait."
I`II find the best one on the road.
Do you want to put your head in my lap?
That`s not what I was thinking.
The wheel.
"There you go, out of your way."
Comfy?
clark?
My head`s stuck.
Quit kidding around!
It hurts!
It`s stuck.
Cut it out!
"I know what you`re trying to do, and I think it`s sick!"
The wheeI`s stuck!
That was a dirty trick!
The damn wheel is all screwed up.
You`re tired.
You get weird when you get tired.
Let`s just find a motel.
Zhou Sanzhao gave it to me on his own accord
Gave it to you?
"It's true, you don't believe me?"
Grab him
"Hey, don't move!"
You really want to fight?
"Kid, you do know some kung fu!"
This kid must be the apprentice of Zhou Sanzhao
We'll take him to Thunderstorm!
"Wait, Thunderstorm is my Master!"
How come he has an apprentice like you?
Who's that?
Who are you looking for?
Master Shi

It's Gao Jian!
"Gao Jian, what happened?"
"Master, I...they..."
What exactly has happened?
"Master, these three assholes"
"I told them I'm your apprentice, they ignored me"
- Ming-kai!
- Tat-chi!
So you're the representatives.
- Yes.
- Yes.
Fantastic!
I've already heard much about you.
This will be a magnificent fight!
This is really an honor.
Yes!
"Sir, I won't fight!"
Sir!
"Ming-kai, we must count on you."
"Tat-chi, the Shaolin are depending on you."
Start!
Go.
Go.
Sung-chi!
"No matter who wins, see that my orders are carried out."
This is a fair duel.
I'll decide the winner and the new ruler of the martial arts world.
Watch out!
Not bad!
"You've improved a lot, too."
Don't stop!
Fight!
Fight!
Watch out!
Why do you want to be a priest?
To avenge my master.
Why are you a monk?
To take vengeance for my sister.
(Laughing)
You try it.
"Come on, Michael, it don't hurt."
Give me your hand.
Mete Tu mano right there.
"Watch that, the water."
"Yeah, just like..."
Hold it right there.
"Wait for him, wait for him."
Ah!
You see that?
Yeah.
Bites.
Told you.
"Hey, um..."
"And thank you too, for sending me those pictures..."
While I was up north.
I don't know if I thanked you for that.
You're welcome.
Stop.
Just make sure you don't ride the clutch too much.
"You want to give her a break every once in a while,"
So she can last.
You pay for all this.
Otherwise you'll be back spending your money.
(Angela) Thank you.
You're welcome.
"(Hector) Manny, it's okay, papa, I'll close her out."
You sure?
"Yeah, esta bien."

(Dance music on television)
He raised me.
"I want to graduate, find a good job, and repay my Grandpa."
Hey.
Kick me.
Come on.
With all your might.
Are you OK?
Your posture is good.
You can learn ShaoIin Kung Fu.
Why ShaoIin Kung Fu?
I want to spread the art of Shaolin.
It was my Grandpa's dream.
OK...
I can try.

If you try Iacrosse.
Alright!
Yeah!
Come!
Wait!
What's lacrosse?
The future is veiled in darkness.
"Reach out to it without fear, and you will see light."

That was three years ago.
Naughty girl ...
Naughty.

It seems very friendly ...
"Do not worry with it, getting married next month."
"Really, who benefits?"
"So, something about you, Mr darkness ..."
- About me?
- Yes.
You do not need to profile even photos.
What can I say?
Hold them for me.
We waited in rare cases.
"Well, for me, is in order."
Damn.
And say once again.
Hey ... empty.

Thank you.
That's all right.

Hey!
We are ready to go.
It's the box step.
LAUGHTER
And the third one is my own personal favourite - the knee bounce.

The reason they use these moves is because they work for any show tune at all.

What's that?
Christmas.
Here we go.
"# Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way"
"# Oh, what fun it is to ride on a one-horse open sleigh... #"
"It's a bit camp, that one."
Have a happy Christmas.
I'm Charlie Baker.
Good night!
Thank you very much!
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
Charlie Baker!
"Thanks, Charlie."
I just thought maybe we could...
- Sorry.
- Are you okay?
JANINE:
Maybe if you just go over there.
"Just trying to you know, re-light the fire."
"Oh, honey."
Didn't you hear what I said before?
I really gotta finish these offerings.
Look I'm really trying here.
Do you wanna save our marriage?
Of course.
Me too.
"Tyrone, you cover 4 through 6 and pitch in with the bussers when you can."
Wait a minute.
I'm on 8 through 10.
"Hey, I been working here 18 months, 8 through 10."
ALEX:
Minor oversight.
"Luis, you cover 4 through 6, then."
"Dude, Luis quit like 10 months ago."
[WORKERS CHUCKLING]
MAN:
"Yeah, he quit."
Is there any reason we're even having this meeting?
Not really.
"- No, not for me."
ALEX:
Great.
Good.
Great.
Meeting adjourned.

Dad where's Wes?
Jacob.
We'll get him back.

What are you doing here?
-Why you never call me back?
What's that?
-I don't know.
What do you mean you don't know?
-I don't know.
"Look, I'm gonna race next week."
Alright?
"I'm gonna win for you and dad, whole town's gonna see it."
Okay.
"-I need you to be there, okay?"
You gotta tell Pam.
Wes?
[Ring]
Let me go.
"Hey mom's still at her bridge club, you wanna come in for a cold one."
(Hollis) I gotta get back.
"Everything's gonna work out just fine, man."
What 'you worried about.
Yeah.
Put some clothes on.
You scaring the kids.

"Well, come on, get in."
[Roaring engines].

So how was London?
Quiet.
"No bombing since Tuesday, apparently."
I meant the exhibition.
Very successful.
-You think so?
-Babe...
-...
I know so.
-Good.
I love a man who speaks his mind even when it's bullshit.
"Hey, stranger."
"-Hey, you."
-Hey.
What time did you come to bed?
-I tried to wake you.
-Really?
-You didn't move.
-I didn't even feel it.
How did it go yesterday?
-With the apartments.
-Good.
What's the status?
I saw a few things.
Most of them were pretty disgusting.
Yeah.
I think it's gonna take some time.
"I was sure there was something perfect in here, just ready to rent."
So how was work yesterday?
Strange.
"I had to deal with a 16-year-old having an Ecstasy-induced psychotic episode, and he thought I was a Nazi."
How ironic.
-Yeah.
-And upsetting.
"Yeah, he was pretty upset."
-I'm sure.
-This one looks good.
I will never let him near you.
Okay?
Ever.
I know you won't.
Good?
Yeah.
Riley and I will sweep this area.
Thank you.
Can I have my gun back?
No.
"Come on, just, come on."
"You guys know what a jammer looks like, right?"
Does it have like a fan on it?
Fuck.
I knew he'd find a way to fuck this up.
He always does.
He has not changed at all.
"Ollie, can you please just stop?"
He's still my brother.
It's not in here.
What the hell?
I already checked there.
What?
Nothing.
"Dude, I'm just sayin', don't let 'im talk to you like that."
Fuck 'im.
"No, seriously, you say the word,"
"I'll clan his ass, son."
"Don't worry about it, all right."
I need you to focus.
"Come on, Riley."
Help me out.
There you go.
"This beautiful, exquisite, amazing..."
Uh...!
What?
What?
Um...
Did you know that you have a thing
- What?
- on... on your back?
Like a...
like a freckle?
Like a mole.
Is it gross?
"It's,uh,um..."
It's pretty big.
You need a doctor to look at this.
"Okay,yeah,um, you know what?"
"Uh,we should get out."
Come on.
You know what I want to do?
I want to go on the computer and check out one of those medical sites.
"I mean,I'm sure that it's nothing, but I'm gonna worry about it until I know for sure."
How could such an ugly mole end up on such a foxy lady?
Nature screwed up.
Come on.
Thank you for being so sweet to me.
Why wouldn't I be?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry that I hurt you.
Come on.
Bella?
Hey.
Don't hurt me.
Please.
Please.
Call her.
What?
Your mother.
Hello?
Mom?
Is that you?
"Are you all right, sweetheart?"
"I want to come home, Mom."
Keep it going.
Keep it going.
You will.
"You will, soon."
But first I need to explain to you why I wasn't there to protect you.
What are you talking about?
It wasn't your fault that--
Yes.
"Yes, it was."
I need to explain to you why I did the things I did.
"I have an addiction, and it kept me from being the mother I should have been for you."
An addiction?
Why are you--
"No, no, don't interrupt me, please."
You just need to listen.
Listen carefully.
I know you're brave.
I know you don't cry.
But you need to come home.
Come back to our house.
He's not gonna let me.
- Yeah.
Shady Lady.
"Oh, my God."
Stop!
Whoa.
"Take a right, Nicolas!"
"Take a right, a right!"
Nicolas!
Nicolas!
"Hey, Nicolas!"
I need some help here.
Okay.
Somebody get a doctor!
"Hang on Nicolas, I'm going for help."
Nicolas!
"I swear to God, I don't know what happened."
He's epileptic.
I should have told you.
- I'll call an ambulance.
"- No, it will pass."
"It's okay, baby."
This hasn't happened for a while.
I didn't think to mention it.
I could kill myself for taking him on that ride.
"It's okay, it's not your fault."
He won't even remember it.
It'll be as if nothing ever happened.
Wanna come in?
I think you could use a drink.
I hope wine's okay with you.
That'll work.
What good is a home if you can't relax in it.
My daughter.
Where have you been?
"Maria, don't go!"
Don't leave me alone.
- Dad!
- Maria!
"- My baby, I missed you!"
- I'll tell Barbuda!
Where did your grandma take you?
Teach me how to walk on the tightrope.
I want to be part of your act.
- But you're so little!
"- Yeah, honey."
"Come on, please."
Teach me!
"We'll think about it, okay?"
Always remember that.
Aim at a spot ahead.
"Focus, and you won't fall."
"On the tips of your toes, then slide."
"Gently, just like that."
Yes.
Arms out and smile.
Smile to the crowd that's here to see you.
"Good, Maria."
"Did you see, Marcia?"
Our little acrobat!
Very good.
"Next, try it with the parasol."
Grab it either here or here.
Find the best grip.
Elegance.
Synchronize.
Take cover.
Squad charge!

# In the field artillery #
# Sing out the numbers loud and strong #
"# Two, three, four!"
#
"# Five, six, seven, eight. #"
(laughter)
"Oh, Ernie, I ain't never going to let you go again."
"Sure, sure, sure."
I'm going to take you into my business.
"In one year, it'll belong to me, pal."
(laughter)
"Come on, you dogfaces, let's hear it."
# Hi!
hi!
hee!
#
# In the field artillery... #
(buzzer sounding)
Roll call.
"Doberman, Anderson, Dober... (buzzer sounds repeatedly)"
"All right, all right, all right."
"Good morning, sir."
"Take it easy, will you?"
Just plug them in there.
So how come you are here?
I just came here for dinner.
"Anyway, I saw your designs."
Lovely.
They are awesome.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
You hid the secret for so long.
"Well, Vivek, I tried to show you my designs before."
But..
I couldn't show it.
"What do you mean, couldn't show it?"
I don't understand.
Shall we meet tomorrow and talk?
Few things I need to tell you.
Yeah.
Fine.
Okay.
Okay.
I will see you then.
- See you.
"Ma'am, hold on."
I will give it.
Take this.
"Sir, here is your lemonade and honey."
And towel.
You didn't bring today's newspaper?
"Sir, I am searching for today's newspaper since yesterday."
Shall I bring yesterday's newspaper?
Yes.
"If possible, bring a few years' old newspaper."
Bring 30-40 years' old.
"- Just myths, of course."
I doubt they're true.
That Hori...
Hiromitsu.
- Yes.
He died.
It's probably impossible to find out who has the other 11 tattoos.
Not at all.
But I'd like to know what this has to do with Lynn's death.
Nothing.
Just curious.
Actually I'm not supposed to give you this stuff.
Since you're on leave.
"Yeah, I know."
It's just for my report.
Oh well.
The case is closed.
"And anyway, you played a part in it, too."
Yeah?
"Yeah, did you check the list of names?"
Just a sec.
I got Lynn Wilson.
I need the other 11 people with a Hiromitsu.
Yes.
And all of them are reported dead or missing?
Thanks.
Thanks.
Schrader.
Schrader!
You aren't needed here.
Dix.
How observant.
Good!
# This is Flora's holiday... #
Yes!
# This is Flora's holiday. #
"Good night, Mr Kirkby."
Night.
I'm meeting my dad.
See you!
"See you, Hewitt."
"We've done the chairs, Mr Kirkby."
"Are you all right, Mr Kirkby?"
It's this leg.
Gets bad in the cold.
Just need a minute.
Do you want me to go and tell you when the bus is coming?
Then you don't have to stand in the cold.
I walk home.
I'm only down Pattison Street.
That's near me.
"I can walk with you, sir."
I don't think you walk as slow as me.
I can do.
I like walking slow.
"And if I walk on the side of your cold leg it might warm it up, and then it might feel better."
You can lean on me.
I'm dead strong.
I'm always carrying coal and spuds and that for Mam.
"Come on, Tubby!"
Hello!
"Oh, you came."
"Pauline, this is Tubby."
"You remember, I told you."
"Look, we gotta find a weapon."
All right?
There's nothing here.
What are you gonna do with that tiny knife?
Who are you?
- Who are you?
"- No, no."
Wait.
"Stay away, stay away."
We're not gonna hurt you.
"It was Vivian, right?"
Yeah.
Where's that guy that was with you?
I don't know.
I don't know him.
He was...
He was behind me.
Gimme your phone.
You have a phone?
Did you call someone?
"We did, we, got a call out."
Are they coming?
We're not sure.
They're not coming.
"The signal was in and out, but, it still might have gone through."
"Look, Vivian, we need to find a way out."
I can't.
I can't.
"Do you know of anything, any way out?"
Are you sure he was behind you?
Yes.
I don't trust her.
- Bishop Allen.
- Tilt up.
Tilt up.
There they are.
- Those guys were great.
- I say hi and then they say hi.
- This song was stuck in my head after.
"- Yeah, I love this song."
It's a great song.
It's a great song.
- This is one of my favorite...
- Is that her?
- That was the girl in the background.
- It was?
Here's one my favorite Ari Graynor moments.
Here it comes.
What?
Can we get a ride?
"- Oh, that's..."
- That's you.
"Is that ""we""?"
Here it comes.
"Sorry, Tris, the car's full."
- It is full.
- Is she gonna hiccup or something?
Are you mad at me?
What I love about that is the gum that's...
The gum is just about to fall out of your mouth.
You look so messy.
It's like Andy Capp.
"Remember the impossible, like, cigarette dangling?"
That's like you and the gum.
Yes.
How old are you?
Twelve.
Is there someone inside you?
Sometimes.
Who is it?
I don't know.
Is it Captain Howdy?
I don't know.
"If I ask him to tell me, will you let him answer?"
No.
Why not?
I'm afraid.
"If he talks to me, I think he'll leave you."
Do you want him to leave you?
Yes.
I'm speaking to the person inside of Regan now.
"If you are there, you, too, are hypnotized and must answer all my questions."
Come forward and answer me now.
Are you the person inside of Regan?
Who are you?
-Help me!
- Let go!
Father Karras?
Have we met?
"No, we haven't met, but they said I could tell."
That you look like a boxer.
William F. Kinderman.
Homicide.
What's this all about?
It's true.
You do look like a boxer.
Good night.
"Don't get too attached, Dale."
"Come on, Jill."
We're gonna go have a sleepover at Dale's tonight.
Drew!
You ok?
She needs a couple glasses of water and some sleep.
Let's go.
- Yeah.
"Come on, babe."
"Ah, that's disgusting."
No.
This is definitely picture worthy.
Is that her puke bucket?
Look at...
Becca's panties.
They're grannie panties.
Bowie.
He's gonna have the worst diarrhea in the morning.
"It's so weird getting older, isn't it?"
Everything just... changes so fast.
"Yeah, but that's supposed to be the exciting part, isn't it?"
Why haven't you ever dated Zach?
Because I never felt like I was...
good enough for him.
"But you like him a lot, right?"
Yeah.
And you think he's handsome.
Yeah.
And he likes that dog of yours.
Yeah.
He loves Bowie.
How?
Knocked him on the head.
And who's speaking?
"Ah, Yuri Nikolayevich!"
Meet you?
All right!
"Hey, man with a mustache!"
"Maria Vasilyevna, how are you?"
"I've been watching you for a long time, by the way."
It's hard to recognize you.
Good for you!
Hi.
And what's this round thing?
This round thing.
- You bought a cake?
"- No, it's a hat."
"Right, it's time."
Soon the last ones will fall down.
- Are we waiting for someone?
"- No, nobody."
And the flowers?
For you.
What?
No way!
God forbid!
Take them away!
I'm not some young girl!
What's so bad about it?
It's interesting.
"The interesting is around the corner to the left, as my granddaughter says."
"Come on, Maria Vasilyevna!"
"Look, what's going on?"
Stop!
My son is out there!
"No, wait."
"It's me, Hogarth."
Remember?
It's bad to kill.
Guns kill.
And you don't have to be a gun.
You are what you choose to be.
You choose.
Choose.
GIANT:
Hogarth.
(WHIMPERS)
It's okay.
It's okay.
We gotta show them you're good.
"Nautilus to Rogard, missile armed and ready."
"What are you saying, he's friendly?"
Yes.
Attacking him is triggering a defense mechanism.
"Don't listen, General!"
Destroy the monster while we still have the chance!
(GIANT'S FOOTSTEPS POUNDING)
"General, you shoot and the whole thing starts all over again."
- Stop it now!
Our future's at stake!
"- Orders, sir?"
"Which is why you have got to stop, General!"
- It's getting closer!
"Orders, sir?"
- Don't shoot!
What is going to be?
"The died hand, no?"
Help!
Help!
Espérame.
Espérame.
I already go.
You excuses.
They stand back.
The dead has escaped!
In the name of the Medicine.
Stop!

You run. you run.
Towards where?
"Delay, hopes."
By there.
"yes, by there."

What is this?
Sexual violence?
Have you seen a naked man enter?
-Naked?

"Cynthia, we're out of synch again."
"You know, you gotta paddle on the opposite side of the boat!"
"Well, Jason, I can't see which side you're paddling on!"
"Well, turn around and take a look every once in a while."
"Otherwise, we are gonna capsize again."
"You get that, right?"
It was an accident.
I'll bet it could have been avoided.
Right?
Am I right?
Baby' I need you to paddle.

Sit down.
You've got to sit down in the boat!

"I am so sorry, mom."
I was very busy with office work.
You always make excuses.
Your papa misses you a lot.
Okay.
Tell me.
How is your office?
"Very good, mom."
Even my boss is very friendly.

"Okay, mom."
I got to go.

I am very late for office.

"This place is my fortress, I'll get him at any cost."
"Enough of searching there, come on boys."
"Come on boys,"
Find him whether he is here.
Search inside.

How could I judge it?
I can get it from your scared face.
You're shivering.
You're sweating profusely.
Konda Reddy is scared because my son is here!

I became wrapped up in the world Saho-san taught me about.

Oh...
Familiar Loneliness.
You really are showing off!
"Now, now..."
What kind of book is it?
Sevigne de...
You have to read it the other way!
"Oh, yeah!"
Um...
The Letters od The Marquis de Sevigne!
"It really seems like an old book, Shizuru!"
Yeah.
"Shizuru, did you always read that type of book?"
"Oh yeah, Shizuru!"
"You went to the library with Saho-san, didn't you?"
Eh?
"You're still meeting up with Saho-san, Shizuru?"
!
You are the one that introduced them!
Yeah!
"That's true, but just listening to Saho-san makes me tired!"
It's so hard that I just can't keep up.
"You are too good, Shizuru."
Fumi!
You called her your teacher!
That was then!
I just want her to calm down a little!

It'll only take a minute.
I think Puff broke their back.
We can probably move in there tomorrow God willing and the river don't rise.

"Hello, Dad."
Why am I calling you dad;

-Not since I got old enough to know better.
Growing up.
"That's great, isn't it;"
Don't talk.

"Uh, Major..."
"Can I offer you, uh..."
"Oh, very decent of you."
Just a quick one.
Going to a memorial service.
Ah.
"Tie's a bit bright, isn't it, Major?"
- What?
- For a memorial service?
"Oh, I didn't like the chap."
One of those.
Know what I mean?
- Cheers.
"- Uh, Major... could you do me a favor?"
"Well, I'm a bit short myself, old boy."
"No, no, could you look after some money for me?"
I won it on that horse.

She stepped on a Punji stick.
He's afraid she's going to die.
- How is it?
- It's a nasty wound and it's infected.
"But if we can control it, she'll be all right."
Good as new.
Pretty tough way to find out about Punji sticks.
BECKWORTH:
Sure is.

This is the Chieftain of the village.
Does he speak English?

"No, sir."
He must trust us.

Hmm.

"Well, you'll take care of little Miss Nicki Kidman here till I get back, Mr. McConaughey?"
"- Sure, I will."

In your kitchen.

Don't make this about me.
You need to be in the kitchen.
"I'd be happy to work the room for you,Jack."
People don't like you as much as you think.
Move.
"Look, this came down from the Prince of Darkness."
It's happening.
But don't worry.
I put somebody in charge.

Don't touch the antipasto until Pop sees it.
He's not ugly...
What do you think of the nerve of those Japs?
Bombing us on Pop's birthday.
They didn't know it was Pop's birthday.
Not surprising after the oil embargo.
They've got no right dropping bombs!
Are you a Jap-lover?
"-30,000 enlisted this morning."
-Bunch of saps...
-Why are they saps?
-Let's not talk about the war.
You talk to Carlo.
Only saps risk their lives for strangers.
-That's Pop talking.
"-You're right, that's Pop talking!"
-They risk their lives for their country.
-Country isn't your blood.
-I don't feel that way.

It was Ellia.
But it wasn't her fault.
Over here!
Come on.
"No, no, you people need to go back to the village."
It is not safe here!
Who is that?
Don't you remember me?
No.
It can't be.
You were taken by the Daemus.
No father.
Father?
I don't understand.
You're his son?
"If my son were alive, he'd be 34 years old."
Precisely.
There's another one of those things out there.
Look what it did to Zaddik.
Is Mrs Ransom in?
"Yes, but I'm afraid she can't see anyone at the moment."
Then I'll wait.
"Please, couldn't you come back tomorrow?"
Mumsie...
Mumsie won't be in the least surprised to see me.
- Been rather an evening.
May I?
"- Yes, of course..."
No!

Gone off!

- It's Mumsie.
(Dennis) Good evening.
"Well, don't look so surprised."
"You expected me earlier, or did more pressing engagements banish it from your mind?"
"No, no, no..."
Of course I expected you.
- Won't you have a drink?
"- No, thank you."
- Your daughter warned me.
- Did she?
"Ethel, come here."
Excuse me.
Certainly.
Oh.

"Too bad for them, Harrison has a system."
"See a hat, don't be home."
"Come on, up on the stools, everybody."

"Happy birthday, Darren."
"Yeah, good lad."

It's not a bike.
"He's brilliant, isn't he?"
I know that!
"- Ooh, wow."
- Very nice.
It's a pump.
"It's a very good one, too."
"See, I'm gonna get you a wheel for your Christmas... and another wheel for your next birthday... and then the saddle, what."
Ha ha ha ha.
You can pump yourself to school every morning now.
"Go away, you."

"We are, of course."
"Kay, when you're ready."
Stay with me!
Warrick...
It's Grissom.
I was first on the scene.
Heard the shots.
I was in pursuit of the suspect.
What?
"No, Warrick, come on."
"Come on, Warrick!"
Where are the paramedics?
!
Please.
Please.
"Come on, Warrick."
You got to fight.

I started to walk west towards the diner.
I was in this area here when I heard the shots.
I saw a white adult male running north down the alley away from the vehicle.
I checked the vehicle-- observed CSI Brown bleeding from a gunshot wound.

"My... my father never looked like that, so he can't be."
He isn't.
"He isn't, he isn't."

"Physically, his cells were recoded for optimal capacity."
"Physically, he is the best version."
"Inside, however, I'm still just me."

And put out those candles.

How you doing?
FANCY:
Fine.
-You won't believe it. I hardly can.
"-What, Andy?"
My--my jeans?
My cowboy shirt?
What?
A few things might have come from there.
I don't know.
"Ok, then let's go the other way with it, ok?"
What didn't come from the big and tall shop?
Ok.
I will show you.
The thing is they use very good fabric.
"There's nothing in there, is there?"
"Yes, there is."
This.
"Ok, fine."
Great.
"Well, you know what?"
"This is what I'm gonna be wearing from now on, so you better get used to it, missy, ok?"
I can't feel my hands.
"Hi, babe."
What are you doin'?
Lookin' at myself in various stages of fatness.
Look at this.
Come here.
Watch this.
You can actually see me gaining weight.
Hey.
Watch this.
And there goes my neck.
"Ok, would you stop this now?"

Did you hear about Mr. Rossi.
"-No, what?"
-He's leaving town.
-Leaving?
"-Well, not really leaving."
They're trying to make him principal of a high school in Portland.
-Are you sure?
-Of course.
I got it first hand.
From Mr. Rossi?
"From Kathy, who got it from Betty, who got it from Miss Thornton."
I suppose that's first hand.
I guess we won't be able to keep him here.
-This is nice.
Can I try it on?
"-Sure, come on."

Merry Christmas.
It's been a long time and it is Christmas.

"-No, thank you."
"Well, come in, sit down."
"Well, I really came to... ls it really true that you might go to Portland?"
I received the offer.

You fucking killed her!
-I didn't kill her.I must have sat on her.

It's not.
It is like that.
"I love you, T."
"You're an amazing partner, but you're an even better friend."
Okay.
"- Oh, no."
- You even took a bullet for me.
"We don't really have to do this right now, okay?"
"I do, T. We all do, you know?"

Angel tears?

I'm actually looking for something a little different.
"Evan told me about it, but I can't remember the name."

But I'm glad to catch you.
Better get these iceblocks inside.
This won't take long.
Had us all quite worried that day you disappeared.
I told mum I was sorry.
Where'd you go?
Streets around Uncle Malcolm's.
I spoke to a bus driver.
Apparently a girl who looked a lot like you caught a bus out here that afternoon.
So?
So it wasn't you?
No.
I really gotta go.
Your father was quite desperate to find you.
He thought ms murnane may have harmed you.
She killed thom.
"He broke in, which was wrong, searching her house for you."
We found the jacket there.
I saw the news.
"Before he went over, I was talking to him on the phone."
So?
"-Goodbye, Amadeo."
-To you I do not salute to you.
He is amiable...
The cut practiced and the blood has been horrible.
I say to you that it is not possible...
"Boys, you watch."
"Is not the dandy, that of there?"
The dandy?
It seems a closet.
That enormous one?
He comes towards here.
"But, who is?"
We hope that he does not see us.
I already am in charge to flee.
Calm and caradura.
"No, calm and swollen face?"
you do not see as it is?
"Hello, Paulino."

They wanted to stop the broadcasts?
You know as much as I do.
"Yeah, but we didn't do anything wrong."
Right?
We were ambushed.
Sit back down.
All the audio files are there.
We had nothing to do with it.
So...
They can't blame us for anything.
Why are you looking at me like that?
- We're fine.
We were ambushed.

I am calm.
But what are we gonna do next?
I can look like a man.

"So we don't want to hear about that, is that right?"
I'm not the one who has to worry about that.
Very good!

True.

Can you watch anything else?
Yeah.

- [Thudding]
- Eh?
What is this?
Ow!
Yeow!
"Oh, ow, ow, oh!"
[Screaming]
[Crashing]
I think I'd better go see what Louis is up to.
What's the news?
Nothing special.
Take care.
Mrs Parvin!
I'm bringing you soup.
May your wishes come true.
is she well?
Yes.
Have you finished?
"If you hear me, hold the line, I'm going to higher ground."
I'm going higher up.
Hold the line.
"If you hear me, I'm not hanging up."
I'm going to higher ground so we can talk.
"If we're cut off, call me back."
"Yes, hello..."
It's you.
I thought it was Mrs Godarzi.
I told you not to call me.
I'll call you.
Godarzi calls me about work.
So why have you brought me all the way up here?
"I'm sorry, go ahead."
Really?
When?
I can't be there.
Tell them you couldn't reach me.
How is she?
Better?
"Hello, are you well, father?"
I'm listening. I'll be home soon.
I've bought it for you. lt's red.
I think we both know it didn't go as well as we'd have liked.
But I've heard from your previous employer and she speaks of you in glowing terms.
"So, I've decided to offer you the job."
Yes!
Yes!
"Yes, yes, yes!"
Bang!
Yes!
I got you the job!
I got you the job!
"Oh, I got a job!"
Oh!
That is brilliant.
I'm gonna take you for a walk on the seafront.
"- Cos, boy, do I know how to celebrate!"
- Yeah.
- We got a job.
- Yeah.
- Ajob!
"Yes, yes, yes!"
Oh!
"- Get out of here, you."
Oh!
You're dressed already.
What a shame.
- I'm not sure about this.
"- Oh, that was Number Two's."
He was a smallish gentleman.
That's why he only lasted such a short time.
But I think it's a close enough fit.
"Yeah, well, I usually go for a more relaxed vibe."
"Oh, but the great and the good are gathering."
"No, really, I'm fine."
Fine?
You must be exhausted.
"Multitasking, multi-flirting."
"No, I'm used to it."
"I think jealousy uses much more energy, negative energy."
Are you feeling okay?
"Oh yeah, I'm good."
I'm going over to Ricky's tonight.
"Okay, everyone out!"
"(SIGHS) Thanks, Adrian, see you around."
See you later.
Text me.
"So, let me guess."
You're going over to Ricky's to meet Amy?
"Yeah, she says she wants to meet me."
She wants to be friends.
"You know her, right?"
"Yeah, I know her."
And I kind of doubt she wants to be friends with you.
She's not going to like you.
She's probably setting you up.
It is a setup.
They're introducing me to someone.
Who?
"I don't know, but, uh, should be fun."
Could I have some more coffee?
"Oh, I'm sorry."
I just ran out.
I'll have to make you some new coffee.
Hi.
Hi yourself.
You can't do this.
"C'mon, I bet you enjoy this."
"C'mon, look at her."
Look at me.
Her name's Betty.
"Bet he's got a nice, big weenie."
Look at me...
"Please, look at me..."
"C'mon buddy, look at Betty."
Morons.
What the hell!
You morons.
Why don't you stop fucking around?
Weren't you taught to not bother others?
"Say something, dammit."
"Hey, man!"
Why don't you shut up?
"Don't hit us, we're just pretending!"
Pretend in the damn room!
"Manager, what're you doing?"
Shut the hell up!
I don't care!
I'm gonna quit this damn place!
You listen.
I'm gonna get a job at a nice hotel.
Then I'll pay you back.
And I'll find me a better girl!
Hey!
What's wrong?
Suzuki San?
I'm running away!
Need a bike?
It's heavy.
- More?
- Much more.
This man hasn't had a bath since the last time he fell off the boat.
Change of plans.
Going straight from Uncle Frank's Mayday to wounded Johnnie fixing the propeller.
"Hurry up, Rex."
We need you over here.
"Yes, sir."
Corning.
Quick as I can.
"Right, what can I do for you, sir?"
"Right, be careful."
Careful.
"And watch out for that-- Watch the wires, please."
- I thought you'd be at the office.
- Don't lean against it.
I was.
I read your ending.
You bagged it.
- You were almost there.
- Nowhere near.
I've been useless for weeks.
"I read your other stuff, too."
Oh?
- What did you think?
- Hmm.
Bit inconclusive.
I wasn't really sure where it was going next.
No.
"I wasn't too sure of that, either."
Crumbs.
I thought having you here was gonna teach you something.
-Then you go and do this.
-l didn't do anything.
You know what?
Your father's on his way here.
"So for now, go sit in the waiting room."
"-But, Dr. Pratt--"
-Waiting room.
Bag him.
-Got a second line?
-Vein keeps blowing.
Run first unit of O-neg.
Hold four more units ready to go.
So where's the reception gonna be?
He needs central access.
They haven't decided yet.
I'd go to Baby Joon's.
La Chiquita Roja is more romantic.
"Neela, place a subclavian."
Cordis and sterile sixes.
What was the other place?
MALlK:
The Mandarin Club.
No way.
-That's a bad idea.
-Turn his head to the left.
-Systolic's 84. I like The Mandarin.
-Got a flash.
Should definitely do Chiquita Roja.
"Candles, white table cloths, you know."
"No, Baby Joon's."
"I'm telling you, martinis and chili fries."
Jesus!
Where did you get this?
From him?
I was trying to escape.
No thanks to you.
How hard were you trying?
"Well, where the hell were you?"
"Watch it, watch it."
- What are you doing?
- For the fire!
How the hell are we going to get out of here?
I'm working on it!
I'm working on it!
"Well, whatever you're doing, do it faster."
Ah...
Where are you going?
Through that wall.
"Just get ready to run, whatever happens to me."
What do you mean by that?
Indy!
Damn it!
Don't you leave me down here by myself!
Indy!
Here we go!
Get ready!
"Indy, the torch is going out!"
Indy?
Marion!
Look.
Look.
They're going to fly it out of here.
"When that Ark gets loaded, we're already going to be on the plane."
You're looking for typefaces.
"You've got 45 seconds, two passes, remember."
Reveal the hive.
Helvetica.
Helvetica.
Press the letter?
Correct.
Simon.
30 seconds.
Two passes remaining.
20 seconds...
Pass.
"Pass, Helen."
Courier.
Courier?
Correct.
Simon.
"Ten seconds, one pass left."
Five seconds.
"No, you're out of time."
"Simon, you could've passed if you couldn't see it."
I did say.
One pass left.
You were concentrating...
It wouldn't have helped.
It wouldn't have helped!
All right.
"OK, let's see what you got."
"Courier, which is the standard typeface for writing plays."
And is the default setting in Hollywood.
You also found Helvetica.
Do you know where that was developed?
"Okay, I'm going to wash it."
So put the pillow on now.
Now person number one is going to go.
Might be me.
Might be Rebecca.
"- Okay, you go."
- I don't want your cooties.
Wipe it off.
Okay.
Person number two- citizen two is beginning now.
Get away.
- Can I have the washcloth?
- The wet one or the dry one?
The dry one.
"So, what was the difference?"
"Yeah, who was better- number one or number two?"
You were exactly the same.
I couldn't tell the difference.
"As far as everything goes with you,Jim-"
Are you guys all packed foryour mom's?
Yeah.
- What's that?
- Dave planted it.
What a romantic guy.
I'm in here.
Come in.
Okay.
"Well, I'm off."
I'm just brushing my teeth.
"God, I used to hate that nightgown."
"Other people have to look at it, but they can't read it."
That's the point.
- I am so glad that you guys are here.
"- Well, thank you for inviting us."
We miss you.
"Yeah, well, Eddie's been out on the road, you know."
- Eddie's been on the road?
- Yeah.
"So the midget says, ""Hey, that's why I became a taxidermist."" Ha-ha-ha."
- Hey.
- You can't say that anymore.
"Whatever. ""Munchkin."" It's a good joke."
It's a good joke.
It's a good joke.
- What?
What?
- I keep missing things.
- I'm actually working on that...
"- Whoa, whoa, whoa."
- Hey.
- I got it.
Under control.
Under control.
Where is he going?
"Hey, you guys know the one about the Wisconsin farmer"
- and the burnt barn?
- I'm sure you're gonna tell us.
- What's going on?
- Nothing.
We've been through this before.
It's gonna be fine.
- Is everybody gone?
"- Yeah, they're gone."
- I'm really sorry.
Good God.
Er...
Lucy's the little one?
Yes.
- And her husband did that to her?
- It happens.
Does this have something to do with the other day?
Yes.
- But you don't want to talk to me about it?
- I can't.
All right.
I...
I understand.
- You do?
- She's your friend.
"Whatever you were trying to do for her, get her away from him, to..."
"Barking, whatever..."
Even if it didn't work that...was a good thing for a friend to do.
- Timothy...
"- No, no, I understand."
I didn't before.
But...
I do now.
Thank you.
- I was hoping to see her at the end of the day.
"- Yes, well, you must."
- You will be back in time for this...
"- Yes, of course."
- He was in the rubble for three days?
"- With her body, yes."
Jesus!
- Who was the psychiatrist they sent him to?
- Yes?
- I wanna give you something.
- No.
"Yes, please."
I recently became ordained.
Weird story.
"Um, and I wanna be the one to marry you guys."
- Wait.
What?
!
"- Yeah, what?"
Yeah.
I think this is why I became a minister.
"No, you became a minister to piss off that dude at the restaurant."
"[Laughs] Oh, my Sweet Lord thundering Jesus!"
"Yeah, before you start crying there, Rob, we don't have time for a wedding."
All I have to do is sign a piece of paper.
W-would you have time for a little ceremony?
"God, no."
It would mean the world to my little lady.
Ew!
"Please, we'd be hitched by noon, I swear."
- Okay.
I'd be...
I'd be honored to.
- [Laughing]
"Oh, my lord!"
Oh!
Mwah!
Mwah!
Oh!
"- Yeah, just... uh, no, no."
Doing that interview would have been a really great opportunity for me.
"Last interviews are hard to get, because you never know."
I know this guy.
I like his work.
- I had lunch with him recently.
- You did?
- I did.
- IKE:
You had lunch with him?
- Yes.
"- Lunch, and, whoo!"
(LAUGHS)
"Oh, well."
"Erm... you know, I'm looking forward to reading your work."
"Hey, hey, hey, don't buy a copy."
I got plenty here.
You can have one of mine.
"Anyway, listen..."
"I gotta go to bed, OK?"
Old Ikey has got to get some rest.
Why don't you stay here tonight?
I've got a meeting at the college tomorrow.
You can drive me there.
- Erm...
- Is that good?
- Yeah.
- OK.
- I didn't bring a toothbrush.
"- Good night, everybody."
Good night.
- Night.
- Good night to you.
Yeah.
That's fantastic.
"Well, where to begin?"
"Well, first off, it's not just a bunch of nude farming."
Dad.
- Wow.
- Let's look at Stonehenge.
Obviously not a coincidence.
They didn't have the machinery to move those rocks.
They're huge.
"- Yeah, they're heavy."
- Of course.
"[""IF I NEVER SEE YOUR FACE AGAIN"" BY MAROON 5 PLAYING ON STEREO]"
- I'm Nathan.
And this is Bruce.
- Gigi.
- Gigi.
Hi.
- Hey.
So how do you guys know Alex?
We don't.
Our friend Mary heard about this from some guy named Conor.
And how do you know Alex?
I hope...
I'm pretty sure that something's about to happen between us.
BRUCE:
Ooh.
NATHAN:
Oh.
"So are you here as, like, a guest, or, like, his date?"
"Oh, I hate that."
When you don't know if you're a date.
"Hiya, Red."
Here?
Bring him in.
Bring him down.
"I think you'll unbutton your lip now, Joe."
Maybe you'll talk to your son.
My what?
Here.
"Hiya, sonny boy!"
"Had a long trip today, huh?"
"Oh, sort of confused."
"Well, your old man's confused, too."
My father?
Is my father here?
Where?
"Right here, the great Joe Krozac."
"He's been pining for you, sonny boy."
Father?
That's not my father.
Sure it is.
Ain't he pretty?
Are you all crazy?
"Y- you're kidding, ain't you?"
How do I know this is my-my-
This ought to make it sink home.
See?
That's my father.
That's dads and mother.
"You're just kidnappers, aren't you?"
I see what you're heading for.
"No use trying anything with this kid, see?"
Because that ain't a picture of that dame.
Two minutes to target.
Clear the area.
Get back in there!
The Department of Homeland Security..
Get in there!
This is a mandatory evacuation..
Emily.
"No, please, please, baby."
Look at me.
I'm right here.
Tabriz targeted.
Confirm Tabriz.
"Please, baby, you gotta turn around and look at me."
Damn it.
Evacuate this area immediately!
"We need you to move back, people!"
Move back now!
Emily!
Get out of here!
There's an air strike coming!
My daughter was in there.
Emily Cale.
She's still in there.
Wait!
Emily!
What is with this family?
Wait for me!
Confirm Tehran.
Targeting complete.
Armed for nuclear launch.
You have 15 seconds to initiate.
"Fifteen, 14.."
"Police, stay!"
Told you to stay!
My father may have Alzheimer's now.
He was awesome in South Asia 30 years ago.
You playing me?
I can't find the guy.
I give you 2 days to find him.
Or you are dead.
That's it.
What's wrong with you?
You've never listened.
Go to the toilet.
You too?
What the hell?
What?
"Look, numskull!"
You hit a cop?
How dare you are?
It's a tiger head.
Should have said so.
Forget it.
Let's go...
"Hey, who are you looking for?"
Someone with a scorpion tattoo.
Scorpion Yong?
I know where he is.
Let me go.
Wasn't that an intense toilet experience?
Intense?
Come later and I could have died.
"Well, you're the one who needed the toilet."
I asked you to come along.
SlPOWlCZ:
What's up?
- Guy in a wheelchair.
- He's got a gun on four hostages.
- I know this guy.
Let me talk to him.
- Wait for the negotiating team.
- You sure the guy's going to wait?
SERGEANT:
Get him a vest.
OFFICER:
Got it.
Ernie Dowd!
It's Detective Sipowicz!
"- I'm coming in, Ernie!"
ERNIE:
I got no beef with you.
"We'll be done in here in a while, then everyone can come in."
You got no problem with the bartender.
Why don't you let the bartender out?
"Yeah, go ahead."
- Put this on my tab.
BARTENDER:
Sure.
SlPOWlCZ:
Come on.
"I'm coming in, Ernie."
"You were over there, weren't you?"
"Couple inches the other way, I'd be just like you."
"You gotta cut this out, man."
They got guns out there.
They don't know these three are assholes.
Public loves to watch stars suffer like regular people.
Tito's Burritos para todos.
So any joy?
Ah.
These four windows.
I caught film of the victim on the night they were broken into.
What about Kai Ng or the blondie with her at The Edison?
Here.
The night Vicki DeMille was robbed.
There's Vicki and Chelsea and there's Kai.
I might have something.
February 10th footage.
Fast forward to 12:02:16.
Chelsea Sennett?
Mmm-hmm.
All right.
"Now March 5th, rewind to 04:42:03."
There's Chelsea again.
"All four times, Chelsea was with the burglary victim on the night they were robbed."
"One, that's random, two's coincidence."
Four?
That's a pattern.
"So what do you say, Manto?"
Eight.
Eight?
They're worth 120 retail.
Not anymore.
"Story's all over TMZ, AH, CNN."
You hit the big time.
We should take off for Palm Springs now.
It's just one more.
We need the money.
I'm okay.
Come here.
You're okay now?
You're okay now?
Drink up.
Good girl.
Leave it.
I want to tidy up a little.
Leave it.
We've got the shaman to thank for everything.
Get some rest.
You must be exhausted.
Shaman
Damn fool.
Suspect arrested in the mushroom-tonic case...
Victims have developed severe mental derangement...
Mr. Yang E-sam?
Yes.
The landlady was a victim.
"Your uncle must've taken the tonic, too."
It's turned the town upside down.
We've gotta bring him in.
You should get a lawyer.
"After all, he's a victim, too."
What the fuck?
What are you doing here?
Get out.
Missed calls
- Shaman
What the hell?
What the...?
Hello.
Please.
"Good, together."
Why didn't you shoot?
-And you?
It's much worse for him to live like this.
You'd do him a favour by killing him.
That the bastard's ending like this...
-Excellent.
Couldn't be better.
Can I do anything for you?
"-No, I don't need any help."
I could buy the collected works of Marx and Lenin from you.
They're for my son when he graduates.
He'll never read them.
-You don't know that.
Elinor?
Marianne.
"Marianne, I do believe you're better."
"Yes, I feel better."
(CARRIAGE APPROACHES)
How long have I been in bed?
I don't even know.
"It is ten o'clock, exactly as the Colonel promised."
Mama is here.
Mama?
"Oh, Mama!"
Do not excite yourself... for her sake.
Elinor!
"Oh, my darling, are we in time?"
You're smiling!
"- Oh, Marianne."
- I know.
And your leopard pants.
- Too much fun.
Too much fun.
- And my shorts.
Totally.
- They're so nice.
"- Mom, can we just please go home?"
- You are no fun.
This is why you're the designated driver.
You're the responsible one.
"That's funny, honey."
That's really funny.
- Unlike us.
You are so not responsible.
- I'm responsible sometimes.
Where are you girls gonna go to school?
"Where are you gonna apply to college, huh?"
- CalArts.
Yeah.
- Ohh.
- Great.
- UCSB.
- Yeah.
- You see?
"Both of them, local."
"Oh, my God."
"This one, she wants to apply someplace like the University of Lithuania."
Ha-ha-ha!
I don't even know where I want to apply yet.
- Lithuania.
"- I mean, it's like the East Coast, right?"
All right.
He'll probably call me.
"No, no waiting."
We are in this situation because of your bullshit...
So sort yourself out and take care of the matter tonight.
Was that Vlad?
"I am going to smash your face in, you fucker!"
Why did you say Elena ran away?
Are you mad?
"It wasn't me, I said nothing."
Must be the Shark!
"He's a good guy, he wouldn't have squealed!"
"I swear it's not me, Niko!"
Word of honour.
Tell the girls to get ready.
"Tonight, I want them to work flat-out."
I see them.
Do you see them?
- Yes.
Great.
There are five...
"No, six."
Take their pictures.
Hurry up!
"- Yes, I'm hurrying."
- Is it OK?
Wait...
On the bridge on the right there.
I can't believe it.
It's Ronaldo.
Do you see him?
- Wait.
This isn't good.
This is fabulous.
I love it.
"Oh, Cookie shake."
"Oh, he loves it too."
And Cookie's never wrong.
It's a hit.
You guys are amazing.
"Amazing, yes."
"I was just saying, the minute I wrote it,"
I knew it was the song for you.
"Well done, Megan."
"Come on, Cookie, let's find someone who can take you for a walk."
Love the layers...
"Tanya, can you believe it?"
Livi loves the song I wrote for her.
We're now officially
"""amazing..."""
Where have you been'?
An ice-cold milkshake for you.
Forget the drinks.
I've got just the task for you.
"If you do it well, you can record your own song, become rich and famous and make a gazillion new friends."
How does that sound?
I'm all ears.
Uh...
- Oh.
"- That was, um, original."
Thanks.
It's called Funky Sitar Groove To The Max.
"Oh, Yeah."
Uh...
Watch yourself.
Watch yourself.
There's glass.
What happened?
"I told her I wasn't thirsty, and she kept sticking that goddamn straw in my face."
[Sighs] Fuck.
"If you keep running off all these nurses, there's gonna be no one left, dad."
It's a simple job.
You water me and feed me.
I'm a fucking plant.
But that goddamn woman...
She's trying to do the Tijuana waterboard on me!
"Okay, dad, you can't say that shit."
Come on.
[Chuckles]
"But, hey."
I lied.
I am thirsty.
[Pill bottles clacking]
I want you to get me a drink.
A real one.
You sure you're...
Allowed to do that?
Does it really matter?
"- Yeah, that's a good point."
- Thank you.
"Now, let's be a couple of outlaws and get me a fucking drink."
[Chuckling] Okay.
Okay.
[Exhales sharply]
"Yeah, why not?"
[Music playing]
"Paolo took me to a residence,... where the practice was to swap partners."
"-Yes, who is it?"
-Roberto.
Oscar sent me.
"Well, we have arrived."
-Are you coming in?
-One moment.
-Good evening and welcome friends.
-Good evening.
Have you got something for the cloakroom?
Perhaps you don't need your handbag.
Do you know the local?
"No, but others of the same style."
"The ones that pay for drinks, will know."
They'll see.
Let's go.
What would you like?
-What would you like to drink dear?
-Nothing.
"To watch, we must consume something."
-A whisky on the rocks.
-One with Coca-Cola. for me.
-Here you are.
-Thanks.
Here we go.
Have another?
-How much is it?
"-100,000."
-Thanks.
-Thanking you.
Take it.
"Come, we find someplace to sit."
The sign says 'Booneville. '
Excuse me.
I'm so sorry to bother you.
Which way is 44th?
- That way.
- Great.
Thanks.
- I got asked directions.
- I saw.
He took me for a native.
That's so cool.
That's very impressive.
44th is the other way.
- No.
- It's all right.
"Man, I should go find him."
He'll figure it out when he sees the numbers getting smaller.
He still thought I was a native.
That's cool.
I'm your witness.
"- Well, I should go."
- Okay.
I got to go to my mom's graduation.
- And give her Belinda.
- And give her Belinda.
Go on.
I'll check on the guy.
I'll make sure he's not wandering around looking for 44th.
Why did you come here?
- What?
"- I said, why did you come here?"
You ditched school and everything.
I'll put you up after Cassie.
"Arnie, listen, man, I had a sales call in Bakersfield and it went long, okay?"
"I--and I have to go get the groceries, you understand?"
I have to sit down and have dinner with my wife and kid.
I've gotta plan out this goddamn christening!
"What am I, Dear Abby now?"
1:45.
"You can be a fucking dickhead, you know that, Arnie?"
Heavy is the head that wears the crown.
Nick.
- [Nick] Hey.
"- Hey, hey, hey."
- How are ya?
- Good.
- How are you?
"- Yeah, good--good to see you."
Good.
This must be Tawny.
- [chuckles] Hi.
- Yes.
"My wife, Olivia."
Hi.
So nice to meet you.
"Last time I was invited to a house this nice, it had a grotto, so."
[laughter]
"Holy guacamole, I-I love marble."
- Yeah.
- [Tawny] Yeah.
"[laughs] Oh, my God, so cute!"
Can we have them for dinner?
'Cause I could just eat them up.
"Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum."
"-Fredo, this is Johnny Ola."
-We need some more help.
-Johnny?
"Jesus Christ, what the hell time is it?"
"-Who's that, honey?"
"-Listen good, Fredo."
Why are you calling me?
I don't want to talk to you.
Pentangeli is going to accept the Rosato brothers' deal.
"-Oh, God."
-Will he come alone?
I don't know.
You've got me in deep enough already.
Everything will be all right.
Pentangeli says he's willing to make a deal.
"All we want to know is if he's on the level, or if he'll bring his boys."
You lied to me.
I don't want you to call me anymore.
-Your brother won't find out we talked.
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-Who was that?
-Wrong number.
"-Frankie, I've got nobody here."
"-Wait in the car, Cicc'."
-Frankie.
"-That's okay, Cicc'."
-What's this?
-A lucky C note for our new deal.
Ritchie.
Give us a taste.
"We were all real happy about your decision, Frankie."
-You won't regret it.
Me neither.
"Easy, now."
You went through the trouble to save my life.
It'd be a shame to kill me.
"You all right, Rodney?"
"Yeah, just peachy."
What the hell was that?
The retrovirus is having the opposite effect than we intended.
I guess so.
"Oh, god."
On the...
"Yeah, but..."
Ellia?
You poor girl.
You never deserved this.
I know part of you is still there.
"Ellia, please."
This isn't you.
Zaddik!
Are you all right?
Don't try to move.
It was Ellia... but it wasn't her fault.
Over here!
"Here, come on!"
"No, no, no!"
You people need to go back to the village!
It is not safe here.
Who is that?
Don't you remember me?
No... it can't be.
You were taken by the Daimos.
"No, father."
YOU CAN COME AND VISIT.
YOU WANT TO GO OUT AND PLAY?
YES.
GO.
"PRAMOD, PRAMOD."
"No, you've already had some."
Go away!
"Come on, Pramod."
You have to go to class.
- They want to meet you.
- Me?
What do you mean?
- They want to meet you.
- Why?
I don't know.
They just want to meet you.
The CEO is Danish.
He wants to shake your hand before giving us the money.
Perhaps he doesn't trust us Indians.
"- Let him come, I'll shake his hand."
- They want you to go to Copenhagen.
"I know what he wants, but I'm not going there."
"""This is the cat..."""
"""...that killed the rat."""
It's not possible.
I can't leave the kids.
"""That lay in the house..."""
"""...that Jack built."""
Pramod has a birthday soon.
"It's not possible, Mrs. Shaw."
"""That worried the cat..."""
"Come on, I'm messing with you."
"It's nothing, really."
I'm ok.
This isn't your fault.
"Actually, it is."
You're a team leader.
You made a tactical decision.
And you got hurt.
Again.
You did what you thought was right.
And that's all you can do.
"The rest of it, that's not up to us."
That's the job.
"This is nothing, really."
"I mean, the thing with Doyle, that..."
I'm kidding!
I'm...

Maria.
"Come on, sweetie."
"Maria, my child."
Come on and bring your bag.
"Let's get going or we'll be late, sweetie."
- See you later.
- Bye.
"Maria, say bye."
"Gosh, I hope we didn't miss the bus."
My stomach is killing me.
"Foguinho, you can't handle fire eating anymore."
But I'm not sure about my magic yet.
Why?
"Oh, Carol."
"Oh, God!"
"Hey, Jack."
Amy told me the good news.
"In my culture, when two people start dating, you give them a present."
They're condoms.
"Hm, I really thought these would have wrappers."
You seem to be enjoying this.
Nice to see cocky Jack Gordon uncomfortable for once.
Yeah.
Especially because of that secret you have with Jack.
[laughs]
I don't know what you're talking about.
"Oh, I think you do."
A real challenge... delicious!
Just tell me what happened.
Sex?
Rehab?
Embezzlement?
Sex?
Animal fighting?
Hit and run?
Sex?
Roland's secret son?
"Damn it, woman!"
You're showing no emotion!
How is this possible?
!
I'm British.
"I think the real question should be, Mason, why the obsession with secrets?"
Who betrayed you?
Who said anything about dough?
"Well, uh, at least sit down and have a drink."
Why not make it two?
One for you.
"- Well, I'll have a little one."
- Good.
Heh.
How much?
"Oh, about two ounces."
One for each kidney.
[LAUGHING]
Here.
"Oh, uh, chaser?"
- Always have been.
- Oh...
[BOTH LAUGHING]
I walked in.
What are you doing?
This guy's a murderer.
A murderer!
Do you understand that?
"Well, I think about my wife tracy every day,"
And then I see his face.
I wanted something to put him away.
All right.
"I'll tell you what, if you're right,"
I'll help you.
But you better be right.
"Woman Oh, my god."
What are you doing to her?
You shouldn't be here.
You're sick!

"Oh, hey."
You're home.
Thought you were gonna go pick up those patches for the screen door.
"Well, I was, and then I thought that sounded like a good errand for you."
[Chuckles]
Ooh.
Orange Julius.
[Slurping]
"Ok, honey, I told you before."
"If it's empty by the time you get home, leave the cup in the car."
Don't come in here showboatin' with it.
Sorry.
So did you get me anything?
"Um, as a matter of fact, yes, I did."
Ah!
Oh!
Look at this.
"Hi, shirt."
You get to be draped across my nipples.
Congrats!
"Ok, well, you two get acquainted."
I'm gonna go put this stuff away.
"Hey, dad."
Franz is coming too.
"Yes, he'll join us this evening."
You know him and me are friends.
All right.
Then I can talk to you about Franz.
Sure.
Where is he?
Freienwalde.
Karl will drive us.
There must be lots you can tell me about Franz.
"Yeah, lots."
"He's a good fellow, if a bit of a softie."
He cried on the stairs last night.
He wants out.
He's not a criminal!
- He's starting that again?
- Not him ― me!
"You, kitten?"
I see.
Let's have a kiss.
Kiss me!
You're quite a girl!
You give me ideas!
To think he works with men like you!
Shame on you!
"Yeah, shame on me!"
Let me go or I'll scream!
Go ahead!
Scream your head off!
Here.
Think you can run home and rat on me to Franz?
"""Reinhold tried to kiss me, and I let him have it!"""
Come with me.
(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)
Do you dance?
"Oh, but the treatment."
Try this.
"Oh, that's wonderful."
Try it again.
Turn around.
(MUSIC STOPS)
But what about the treatment?
"Oh, I know what great lovers you Frenchmen are."
Kiss me.
"Oh, that's good."
You!
What are you doing with my wife?
"Uh, massaging the scalp."
"Oh, oh, pardon moi."
The jacket.
It's very warm here.
The jacket.
"Merci beaucoup, mademoiselle."
I ought to kill you for this.
(GRUNTING)
If you lay one...
"If you lay un hand on me, you know what I will do?"
What?
I'll bleed.
Au revoir.
"If I ever see your ugly face again, I'll kill you."
I want you to get out of town and stay out.
"(IN NORMAL VOICE) Yeah, all right, but I can't leave from up here."
Is there anything else?
"I'm telling you, those moms are scary, snobby and judgmental."
And you're not judgmental?
"Hey, it's not called judgmental when you're right."
It's called right.
"I mean, I know Ritchie likes it there, but, God, I wish I fit in better, you know?"
Is this Portuguese?
Hold this.
"Yeah, it's close enough."
Let's go.
Give me a hug.
"Quick, big hug."
Ooh.
"- Adios, or whatever."
- Yeah.
- Okay.
Oh.
Your map of Portugal.
- Map of Portugal.
Right.
- There you go.
- Yeah.
Play nice.
"You too, Ritchie."
Ah.
Portugal.
Jewel of Iberia.
Largest producer of cork in the world...
And that's all I know about Portugal.
"And yet, you still might be the world's foremost authority."
"All right, I'm gonna get going."
I'll see you later.
All right.
Don't let him get in your head.
"Don't let him get in your head, Dave."
I know a place you will like.
Really?
Yes.
You will love it.
What kind of place?
Like a place that has dancing?
There is everything.
Everything?
"Oh, my God, you guys, I want to go dancing!"
You want to go?
"Yes, please, regard me."
Follow me.
"Oh, my God, yeah, I want to go!"
It'll be a girls' night!
"Okay, but, honey, honey, honey..."
"Oh, my God."
You should just slow down here for a second maybe?
That's exactly what I need!
It's the second guitar solo that sorts the men from the boys.
"I was kind of counting on that, Sctan."
Joey?
Yeah?
I think it's time to show the donkey the snake.
"Cut his head, cut his head, cut his head!"
"Go, go, go!"
Dave!

Cut his head!
Big finish.

"ON JANUARY 13, 1950, RACHEL GAVE BIRTH TO A BABY GIRL, SHARON."
JACKIE STOOD OUTSIDE THE YMCA IN HARLEM
ANNOUNCING THE GOOD NEWS AND PASSING OUT CIGARS.
ARE YOU NERVOUS?
"A LITTLE, MAYBE."
BUT I WON'T BE WHEN WE GET OUT ON THE FIELD.
ANOTHER HOUR AND WE'LL BEGIN.
WOULD YOU RATHER I DIDN'T GO?
NO.
YOU MIGHT AS WELL COME TO THE GAME.

"THE FILM GOT MIXED REVIEWS, THOUGH CRITICS"
DID PRAISE ROBINSON'S UNDERSTATED PERFORMANCE.
"MR. RICKEY, DO YOU WANT A BALLPLAYER"
WHO'S AFRAID TO FIGHT BACK?
"Look, I don't believe you're ill at all."
You just need more strength.
Take mine.
Really.
I have too much of it.
- No.
- Yes.
I want you so.
- No.
- Oh!
Forgive me.
I... fear that we would harm the memory of our beautiful afternoon.
Yes.
"Yes, of course."
All right.
Who's taught you to be afraid?
No wonder you're choking to death.
Someone's got to show you how to breathe.
Come on.
Come on.
You need light and air.
You need to move about.
Why stay inside wrestling with perfection?
Come outside!
Perfection is flowing all around you!
- MALLEFIILLE:
George!
- No!
"Run, Chopin!"
- Excuse me?
- Yes.
I won't kill you here as you deserve.
Look son.
You should be careful in such situations.
Otherwise you will stumble.
Who stumbled?
No... no one.
I was just saying he should be careful in life... otherwise one stumbles.
Yes.
That's a good advice.
Right.
And son.
You know whom we're sending you to in Delhi.
Your uncle sub-inspector Zoravar.
Yes.
He'll take good care of you.
And I've heard he's no ordinary man.
The whole of Delhi's afraid of him.
I've heard that people fear him... more than 'Chulbul Pandey' and 'Singham'.
Zoravar's so feared... that he always catches the goons he's after.
Help.
Police.
Help.
Police.
Help.
Don't beat me.
Don't beat me.
Beat him.
Uncle.
I never imagined...
I'd come to Delhi and see you in this condition.
- How did this happen?
- Nephew.
They were 20 and I was alone.
!
I told you dumbasses to shovel the walk!
Crap.
It's Dad.
He's coming for us.
We're so dead!
You get your asses out of there before that thing collapses and traps you in an icy tomb.
Stay strong.
We're untouchable in here.
Untouchable?
I'll show you untouchable!
He's shimmying!
"Oh, no!"
He's entering the snow fort!
I never thought this would happen!
Ah!
I'm stuck!
I can't move my arms!
My arms are stuck!
How are your arms stuck?
It's snow.
It's soft.
I'm wedged in!
My circulation's failing me!
I can feel it!
I'm gonna die in here!
He thinks he's dying.
Stop laughing!
Stop laughing at me right now!
Why are we hiding from this man?
Look at him.
These are my last breaths!
No.
Does anybody?
Probably.
Okay.
Pine Street.
Windward Elementary.
"""Sunset."" Where the hell is ""Sunset""?"
Sandstone paint.
Sand.
"$651,000."
"That's what, 55 years of back pay the government never gave you?"
They owe me.
They stole my star.
They took my pension.
Who are you?
"I wrote a book about Alcatraz, and pretty much everything in it is wrong."
You write about me?
- No.
- Why not?
I was there.
I was important.
The Warden said so himself.
"Gave me the royal treatment, him and his lady head-shrinker."
There were no female doctors on Alcatraz.
Let's go.
Both of you.
Where?
Sunset Beach.
The location of the land mines are hidden in the lyrics of the song.
He painted the mines to blend in with the sand.
That's where we'll find Hauser.
Or what's left of him.
Better!
[Groans]
"Okay, Lance."
Here you go.
Excellent.
Mother will be most pleased.
"Oh, you be sure to say hi."
Such a nice lady.
"Please, Mrs. Forman, there's no need to keep up the charade."
Fine.
She's cold.
Get out.
I just want you to know that I don't need these fries.
I choose to eat them because I desire their salty taste.
"Please, just take the fries."
"You need me to take them, don't you?"
Needy bastard.
"Hi, Fez."
Can I talk to you?
"Oh, you need permission, do you?"
I think I was a little too hasty breaking up with you.
- Really?
- Yes.
I like the new Fez.
- What about the old Fez?
- Not so much.
"You know what, Nina?"
There's only one Fez... and that is a Fez with needs.
"And if you don't like that, then we shouldn't be together."
"- But, Fez, I-"
- Shh!
"Sorry, baby."

"Right, diesel engines."
Three makers didn't do diesel engines.
Honda - they've done it.
Saab - they did it.
"Now, the last one has now gone."
Jaguar.
No!
It's terrible.
JEREMY MIMICS A JAGUAR ENGINE
Are you OK?
That's nasty.
It's horrific news.
"They're doing a V6 in the S-type, and a four cylinder in the X-type."
Which has nothing to do with Ford.
"It won't be a Ford engine, it's a Jaguar engine in every way!"
Yep.
"But if you pick at ""Jaguar"", it might say "".. ord"" underneath."
I have worries about this.
"Jaguar is stealthy, sleek..."
Is it going to work?
Have a look - we have one here.
We'll see if it works.
Stig.
Yeah.
ENGINE RATTLES
Oh dear.
LAUGHTER
That simply won't work.
"It loses something, doesn't it?"
"Relax, okay?"
Scanning.
- Video link confirmed.
- Up.
This next part might hurt.
Maybe quite a lot.
"But it won't last long, I promise."
Almost there.
Welder.
You can do it.
"Wonderful, Henry."
Squeeze.
Harder.
"Cool, right?"
Integument?
Please don't move your hand.
You probably don't recall.
You were never a big fan of my work.
Maybe this will change your mind.
Right?
Memory's a funny thing.
I'm an expert and I don't know if you'll ever get yours back.
"You don't remember me at all, do you, Henry?"
My name is Estelle.
You and I were... we still are... husband and wife.
"I love you, Henry."
I can't wait to hear you say it.
Henry.
His memories are still catching up with him.
"Oh, Jesus."
- I'm Robbie.
- The sorcerer of sound.
In one moment.
I'm just dealing with this gentleman.
"- Yes, Mr. Thurston..."
- What?
- I was wondering...
- I need change for this!
In a moment.
I'm dealing with this gentleman.
But I have a taxi driver waiting.
Surely this gentleman wouldn't mind if you just gave me change.
- Do you?
"- No, no."
Go ahead.
- There you are.
- Thank you.
Can you tell me how to get to Glendower Street?
"Now, I've booked a room and bath with a sea view for three nights."
- Glendower Street?
- Yes.
You haven't finished with me.
Missus...?
Mrs. Richards.
Mrs. Alice Richards.
"Mrs. Richards, Mr. Thurston."
"Mr. Thurston, Mrs. Richards."
Mr. Thurston is the gentleman I'm attending to at the moment.
What?
Mr. Thurston is the gentleman I'm attending...
Don't shout.
I'm not deaf.
"Mr. Thurston was here before you, Mrs. Richards."
But you were serving me!
Make this quick.
"We're all gonna pull you through this, all right?"
Positive attitude - that's everything.
"Hey, pal, he got shot in the leg."
I think he'll be fine.
Let's hope so.
Be careful with him!

[ Grunting ] Why do they make these things out of metal?

"No, it's coming."
It's coming!

- It's coming!
Shit!

Why the fuck is it snowing now?

"- Oh, of course."
- Do you have another...
"Well, I love Australia."
Down under.
And the president needs you to vote no on tonight's bill.
Are you guys... are you...
Are you serious?
"Okay, the president, she wants me to vote against her bill?"
- Am I being stupid here?
- Yes.
Yes.
No.
"I mean, you're..."
"No, you're not being..."
"It's, yes, you need to vote no."
"Okay, I can..."
love it.
"Don't get it, but it's all right."
I just want to help.
"But, yeah, just let me know where I'm going."
- You need to know now?
"- Yeah, that would be great."
"What'd you say, ma'am?"
Mm-hmm.
How could I?
With all the stuff I was bringing.
"Nina, will Tasik bring Irishka from the kindergarten?"
"I must tell you something, only don't get scared, please."
- What?
- Stasik and I are separated.
- Divorced?
"- Not yet, but it's going to happen."
"- Oh, Nina!"
"- Mama, I beg you!"
"Oh, my God!"
"Mama, please."
"I'm begging you, mama."
I wouldn't have told you if I knew you'd be bewailing.
"How can you, you got a daughter!"
"I've just informed you, that's all."
I wish I'd never come here!
I'm going away from here.
Nina!
Nina!
"- What is it, mom?"
- They're there with those snags!
"And look, up there!"
Your man!
A real hero!
"Oh, mama!"
It's for me.
- Why for you?
- I swear.
Listening.
Playing again?
No brains mean a cripple.
Something's very wrong here.
I don't know these people.
I have never been here before.
I'm from DC.
Look.
"It's a wallet, okay?"
Wallet?
I'm from DC.
My name is John Klein.
Washington Post?
Yes.
Yes.
Can I get out of this shower now?
"You can wait for me outside, Mr. Klein."
We'll run a check on him.
"Anyone else comes by, forget the gun."
Just call me.
Just find out what he wants.
"So, you didn't actually see the guy before tonight?"
No.
But I heard the knocking.
Three nights in a row.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
"I'm gonna give you a ride into town, unless you wanna sleep in your car."
I can call for a tow in the morning.
You're a long way from DC.
What are you doing here?
Driving through.
"We're not on the way to anyplace, Mr. Klein."
I recognize you.

Hello.
Whoo!
"Well, here's your problem."
His head's not screwed on right.
"When you wish upon a star, you get lots of stuff."
"Well, I wish for a nice, quiet evening where you go to sleep and I raid the icebox."
Okay.

I don't want any cops.
I don't want any hostage negotiator or any of that Dog Day Afternoon crap...
Everything's gonna be okay.
I'm not gonna let anyone hurt you.
RAY:
"One SWAT team or anything, I start shooting these people."
Good.
I want someone here in 15 minutes.
"There is a problem here right now, Allie, but it's gonna be all right."
Ray is just a little angry.
"""Ray is just a little angry""?"
"No, Ray is majorly pissed off."

What Helen said?
She has arrested someone?
"You do not say anything, right?"

She must've crawled under there for warmth.
Are you fucking crazy?
You fucking killed her!
-I didn't kill her.
I must have sat on her.
-Jesus.

I knew you'd outlive me.
"I'm invincible, sweetheart."
"All right, let's see who won the pool."
When did you wake up?
"Uh, let's call it 11:20."
That's my square!

"I love you, Frank."
"I love you too, dollface."
Five minutes off.
You bet on my dad's death?
You didn't?
"Ah, baby, you won the over/unders."
100 bucks.
Everybody's a winner.
"Stink hand, watch the door."
Daddy needs a cigar.
"- Oh, no, no, no, no, no."
"- Oh, for God's sakes, Frank."
"No, no, Dad, Dad, Dad, come on."
I think...
Why don't you just order Italian beef while you're at it?
"- Jesus, Frank."
"- That's a good idea, honey."
W...
"Jesus Christ, I can't get that goddamn song out of my head."
I didn't get your invitation card.
Damn it.
"If I'd a gun,"
I'd have blown his head off.
"Pity, you've been suspended."
I'll get a gun tomorrow.
Is that easy to buy one in HK?
"A toy gun would do, baby."
This is it.
Chinese Tea.
You can go home when we are done.
Sure.
Take care of Lisa.
I know you'll take good care of her.

Fight now?
"Michael, wait."
Be careful...
Did you kill my brother Lin Long?
Lin Long?
I killed many in my fights.
But we'd signed fight contracts.
Which clan are you from?
We are the police!
"Whatever, please put down your gun."
I'm afraid of guns.
I beg you.
EZRA:
"Hey, Nathan."
Get back here.
You can't have Nathan.
He's one of my investors.
"Funny, he didn't mention that when he signed on."
"Now, can we discuss this another time?"
I have a rendezvous.
"Afternoon, Maude."
A woman like this renews a man's faith.
In what?
"Hi, Buck."
Lucy?
What are you doing in here?
You're gonna have to leave.
Not what you said last time we were in here.
"Hell, that was a long time ago."
"Oh, Buck. I've seen all that."
"You certainly don't have to be modest in front of me, of all people."
I think I do now.
"-Lucy, we gotta talk."
LUCY:
Don't I know it.
There are a thousand things to discuss.
The honeymoon.
Where we'll live.
-Lucy--
-And baby names.
"I like Randolph for a boy, and Eudora for a girl."
-What do you think?
-What I think...
... isthatyoucan 'tsee orhear anymore.
Mr. Truesdale.
"Evenin', Lyle."
I knew the German girl worked at the lodge.
That's why I called Greg.
"I didn't want to bother you, sir."
You-
"- You told him that, didn't you, Greg?"
Yeah.
"Uh, Dad wanted to come."
I insisted.
Hilla was one of my best employees.
Melvin.
Mr. Truesdale.
"Uh, she's back here."
Oh.
You were close?
Uh--
Yeah.
We were friends.
"I-- Ah, he's a good-looking kid."
Lots of girls at the lodge have their eye on him.
"Suck it up, Greg."
[ Chuckles ] Kid's got his mother's stomach.
Seems like there was more to it than that.
Her name's Hilla.
Hilla Danner.
I hired her as a desk clerk at the beginning of the season.
"She, uh, have any family?"
I believe they were all killed during the war.
"Well, looks like you're gonna have to bury her in potter's field."
I'll pay for it.
"Well, that's real nice of you, sir."
Linda's coming in.
"Uh, okay."
"Well, you do that."
I'm just gonna drink a lot of wine.
That guy must really know what he's doing.
"Why, because he's slurping?"
Mm...
Ugh!
"Oh, my."
Excuse me!
Hey!
Hi!
Are you some kind of an expert?
I just overheard you doing that sound...
Oh.
I'm a wine enthusiast.
Although I'm not enthused by this first flight.
Oh!
He's hysterical.
You should come taste with us.
Oh!
You can give us tips on how to get tipsy.
Sure.
"Lin, no."
I don't want to drink with that guy.
Why?
"I do, Bobby."
He's an expert.
"Well, I was looking forward to a relaxing day off."
"I wasn't even gonna talk to you that much, to be honest."
I just don't want to drink with the guy...
Hi...
No!
- Teddy...
"- Oh, damn."
Damn.
Oh.
- What?
"- What happened, Ted?"
- I did what you asked for.
- I'm tired.
- I've been fighting you for so long.
- You don't have to fight any more.
"He's a liar, Ted."
I said it all ends today.
These agents.
It all ends today.
- What does that mean?
- It means he's decided on an endgame.
He's going to kill himself and the hostages.
"Ted, no one on this train is an agent but me."
No one else.
I'm the only one.
You can let everybody else go.
"I don't think so, Ted."
Do you?
"Dr. Bryar, we need to get this woman help."
"I don't think so, Ted."
Do you?
"Dr. Bryar, we need to get this woman help."
Who's going to help me?
The Higher Authorities can help you.
They're not what you think.
They're not the enemy.
And are still talking.
"We're still here for you, brother."
-Go ahead.
-All right.
It starts with a loss ...
"No, no, no."
Sorry for the moment passed.
"I forgot what I was going to say, maybe tomorrow."
"No, I'm sorry!"
"Is not flowing, the show is over!"
"-Please, sir."
What?
Their story is about flight?
-Where are you?
-From the land of the emperors.
And what's your name?
Erik.
In Insvelândia had many brave warriors
Erik called.
-Seriously.
"Yes, of course."
Everyone!
"Your attention, please."
"I dedicate my comforting much celebrated saga to my brave friend, Erik."
Erik!

It begins with a story ...
From my home!

Are you a cop?
Talk to this man!
She's like your sister...
Your sister maybe!
"To me, she looks like a ravishing film-star!"
Don't touch me.
Or else...
I haven't yet.
But here goes!
I'll show you now...!
Let me see what you have.
Let go of my hand!

I want to ask your Mom what she ate before delivering you!
Shera!
Ashok!
Kaliya!
I spare you because you're a woman.
Or else...
Don't just stand here!
"Well, what do they say?"
That I should die.
"That I'm worthless, that I'm evil, stupid."
- I'm so sorry.
- That I'm...
"No, it's, um..."
"Yeah, it's terrifying."
Do they ever say good things?
"You know, like:"
"""Your hair smells like cupcakes."""
Or:
"""I don't wanna leave you."""
"No, they never say that."
"Well, then your voices are idiots."
- What is it?
- It's a labyrinth.
"You think of a question,"
- okay?
- A question.
Mm-hm.
Something in your life that needs an answer and then you just walk the path.
And maybe you'll get an answer.
Okay.
A question.
Lucy.
- He hates you.
- This is when you die.
I can't.
I can't do this.
You're disgusting.
- I can't.
- You're disgusting.
"It doesn't hurt, does it?"
- Yang flame.
"- Yang flame, too?"
"Wong Fei-hung, are you trying to kill me?"
Put the fire out!
Don't kill me!
It really works!
That's enough!
Feeling better?
You're good!
Good!
Bastard!
How dare you hit me!
How many hands did you fight with?
You're incredible!
I'm completely won over!
See you soon!
I hate the cut of this jacket!
You can have it.

"Fellow villagers, welcome to the opening of the Southern River Association."
"We're honored to have the lion-dance master from Po Chi Lam,"

It talks about all the different stages of forgiveness.
"- You know, they say that""s very important."
"- Thank you, sweetie."
"Daddy""s home."
How do I look?
You look great.
Thank you.
Do you like it?
Yeah.
I got some strawberries.
Do you want me to say things?
Dirty things?
Is that what you want?
How does she touch you?
Does she touch you like this?
"Does she let you, you know..."
- Would you like me to try that?
"- Don""t talk, Clara."
"I will try it for you, David."
It might excite me.
"You excite me, David."
See how we fit?
"I can hold you all night, David."
"- I hate it, Clara."
- I love it.
"- Oh, my gosh, y""all!"
"Lt""s beautiful."
- Wait.
"Hold that up higher, honey."
You have to come back to me!
"Do you hear me, Josie?"

I said her name.
I forgot.
It's all right.
"Garcia, were you able to trace it?"
No.
I was so close.
But I have the cell tower it pinged off of.
I just sent that to your phones.
"What's this area like, Sergeant?"
Mostly blue-collar residential.
What about that area?
It looks pretty secluded.
That's where the old railroad spur line used to come into town.
Mostly just abandoned structures out there now.
We're on it.
There.
"If nothing else, kill me, please."
Make this end.
- You're gonna be...
"You're gonna be okay, Mary."
You're gonna be okay.

You will tell him and he'll hurt me!
- Isabel.
Isabel.
"Please, you can trust me."
- You keep calling me Isabel.
I am Mary.
But I remember you.
Margaret!
"- Jesus Christ, what did they do to you?"
What did they do to you?
- I dreamt I killed you.
- I'm still here.
- Did I hurt you?
Margaret!
No!
How can it be?
Why would you help me if I did this to you?
- You're my friend.
I know it wasn't you who did that.
We can't stay here.
You have to tell me everything.
"Yes, Cedric."
- Ethel will find you a taxi.
- Taxi?
"Oh, thank you very much."
"Before I dropped off, didn't you have a moustache, Sergeant?"
"Yes, Cedric."
"That dropped off, too."
Away with you.
"Well, good luck to your endeavours."
Thank you.
We'll need it.
"Oh, dear."
Oh...
"- Now, where were we?"
- My plan.
I'll polish him off but I'll need an alibi from you.
Hey!
I asked you to sit down.
Get that thing out of my face.
I've been abducted by aliens.
You think I care about your little toy trumpet?

DR PENZLER:
Give me the gun.
Give me the gun.
"Please, give it to her, Ray."
Thanks.
Is that it?
We shouldn't be doing this as partners.

Some place on Melrose.
I'm waiting for these limited-edition Japanese imports.
They've got blue and orange on the side and this red mesh on the soles.

"I could ask her to put you on it too, if you want."
If you don't mind matching.

We get enough of that when the nannies take a break.

Couldn't stop thinking about it when they described the Middle Eastern-y part.
Oh.
Hummus.
Fun idea.

"Uh, I guess she stepped away."
Ugh.

"Oh, that does sound good."
And roasted red peppers.
"Oh, me make it."
Right.
"Belinda, are you in there?"
I need you.
"Christine, for God's sake, I asked for that sangria a week ago."

One of the soldier's had this kit bag and suddenly it woofed!
It gave us such a fright.
It was a dog.
And one of them Frenches tried to kiss her.
I'm scared now of what your dad might do.
No!

Are you done?
Against the wall!
I've to search you!
Don't go too far!
Why?
I suspect you're an illegal immigrant!
You're Lisa's boyfriend?
"I meant ex-boyfriend, Michael?"
Michael!
You've suspended?
Why are you here?
Let go!
Do I need to escort you out personally?
"How are you, David?"
"Mr. Lin, welcome back."
"Just give me the keys, I'll follow."
Thanks.
"Anything else you need, Mr. Lin?"
You're great.
No wonder my brother praised you.
Thanks.
Goodbye.
"Lisa, is there a Lo Keung amongst my brother's friends?"
"No, why do you ask?"
Just wondering.
You suspect a friend killed him?
It doesn't seem like a robbery.
I'm not convinced.
My brother values his life.
"- Thank you, Pete."
And this is my attorney:
Lance Lord.
I believe these are yours.
- Thank you.
- Yeah.
Hi.
How are you?
Thank you for doing this on a Sunday.
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.
- Don't mind if I do.
- Yeah.
"To be honest, I'm a little fuzzy on what this is we're doing."
"Uh, Dr. Barrett's made an offer on the farm."
An offer to buy it.
I've accepted.
I just need you to review these terms.
I represent supplies in the farm-to-table business.
We buy non-working farms and get them working again.
Okay.
Um...
"Dr. Barrett, if you can give us a moment,"
I need to confer with my client.
- Lance...
- It's just a quick chat.
If you don't mind.
"It's, uh, it's okay."
Of course.
"Uh, take all the time you need."
"I'll be, uh, outside."
Lance:
- Hi.
"- No, thanks."
Why not?
"If I let you, it'll cost me more."
"All right, all right, fair enough."
"How about if I can get you to say the word ""seventeen""?"
"I bet I can get you to say ""seventeen,"" and if I do, you have to join us."
- You're on.
- All right.
- What's two plus two?
- Four.
- Four plus four?
- Eight.
- Eight plus eight?
- Sixteen.
"See, I told you I could get you to say ""sixteen."""
"- No, you said ""sevente""..."
- See?
What?
You walked right into that one.
"Okay, I'm impressed."
"All right, you can buy me a drink now."
- All right.
- What's going on here?
Mr. Heller.
"Gary, you... know this one?"
Ms. Keyes works for me.
Really?
Give your HR person a bonus.
"All right, all right."
What are you doing here?
I live right around the corner.
"Yes, much is found!"
"Give it to Brother Lone, it's very important!"
Greet Brother Lone.
Brother Lone.
I heard steps.
And it's far away...
"It's late, Brother Lone, let's call it a day."
Wait for me.
Super swords and capital chopper.
I can tell it's a trap.
The prosecutor is cocky!
Who the hell is he?
A very sharp-tongued lawyer.
"What a co-incidence, he is Ho Chun's boss, named Ho Chung."
Who is his boss then?
"His dad, Ho Sai."
Ho Sai?
"He is a rich merchant, and is the council member."
He owns many properties in Western District.
Sai?
"Yes, Sai."
"Hearing this word ""Sai"", I..."
Did it ring your bell?
"Right, because I remember Foon has..."
What?
"A piece ofjade which the word ""Sai"" is carved."
"Maybe, there is another story."
"This may be related to the poor orphan, Ho Foon."
Wu Man.
Hubby.
Do you know anything about Ho Sai?
"He is a Catholic, a righteous man."
I'm sure Dad would have been here if he could.
[SNIFFS]
She's such a slut.
So?
"Personally, I'm very pro-slut."
"-What happened, anyway?"
"-She banged Jamie Jaffe, that's what."
She gave him the reverse cowgirl and everything.
"Hi, Taylor."
How was your weekend?
"Fine, I guess."
You didn't go to the rodeo?

The other night he couldn't stop talking.
"I mean, 100-foot robots and whatnot."
A hundred-foot robot?
That's nutty!
What else did he say?
"No, wait, stop!"
Excuse me.
What is going on in there?
Are you all right?
I'm fine.
"You know, this sort of thing is why it's so important..."

That a boy.
"Eat up, eat up, eat up."
He could still be around here.
You see that?
"- Excuse me, sir?"
- Every time I come across...
- Sir?
- It was off...
Gotta call you back.
"Hey, bro."
Where did you get the uniform?
Traded for it.
Not really my style.
But the guy threw in a phone too.
"- Pretty sweet deal, huh?"
- We're gonna need that phone.
"So, what are you gonna trade for it?"
How about a pair of handcuffs?
"Yes, thank you very much."
Okay.
So Dana Thorpe and her fiancé Craig Ellers landed at Honolulu International this morning.
Checked into a hotel ten minutes ago.
- Chin.
"- Hey, H.P.D. found the car."
Dawkins abandoned it about 15 minutes ago.
"- Parking lot, Kaka'ako Beach Park."
- Got it.
That's three blocks away from where Craig and Dana are staying.
- Whoa.
- Ha-ha-ha.
"Oh, my God."
I couldn't stand it.
"Oh, my God."
Me neither.
"Yummy, and you could be having that all day!"
"_Me,?"
A' es'!
- Is that him?
- Yeah!
"A looker, isn't he?"
"Jean, what's happening?"
Jean!
My hair flew away!
His hair comes off!
You look good in anything.
Just look at him!
He's real handsome.
My hair!
- We'll set things right.
- Right!
I bet those monsters at the mill are in on this.
"Get away, you monsters!"
I'm off to investigate.
Such a draft again!
You do it on purpose!
My poor head!
The pain'll kill me.
"At least it'll be over, without Elisa I have nothing."
I'm a lonely and deserted orphan...
"- No, you have me!"
- Exactly.
"Don't worry, your Grace."
I'm here to help you.
"Who are you, an apparition?"
The ghost of aunt Bertha Gloria.
"Ghost, my foot."
Hey.
Hey.
You go to bed last night?
What?
"Uh, no."
[ Clears throat ]
"No, ""Rudy"" was on."

Sam:

"I did find us a case, though."
"Oh, yeah?"
"Yeah, was a strange death in Stillwater, Minnesota."
A competitive eater died after a hot dog-eating contest.
"So, what?"
Death by tube steak?
If only.
Dean:
"He got attacked in his car, but, uh, get this -- he shrunk from 300 pounds to 90 pounds."
Witchcraft?
Or a heavy-duty laxative.
You game?
Yeah.
Good.
Looks like it's a whore's bath for me.
I'll be ready in five.
"You sure you're okay, Dean?"

It's a sore.
How long has she been treating you?
Half a year.
Wow that's a long time.
Doctor Imm's patients never get better.
Stop bitching you chink.
"Chinky, stop chatting in Line."
Focus on me a little?
Here for you.
Doctor Imm.
"Tell him if he has to stay awake, do not stay awake for more than 1 day."
Take the bedtime pills.
And get some rest.
I feel the chemistry inside my body is changing.
But I don't know what it is.
Oh!
"Tell him, do not scratch."
Doc....

"Hey, you're just supposed to read it."
Can I please just reply her?
Doc.
I am sorry about last month.

Can I just read her reply?
Happy New Year.
Get some rest.
Turn off your computer and go to the beach.
See the sunrise or something.
Same to you...
That's enough.
"Yeah, how do we know we're not asking a ballerina, or a lawyer, or a math teacher to take off her clothes?"
We just got to go for it.
"Frank, I think I need to see the money."
"Excuse me, miss, do you have a minute?"
"Uh, ma'am?"
Get out of my way.
Excuse me.
Yes?
Are you a prostitute?
What?
Will you take your clothes off for $103.62?
"Thanks, Kevin."
What?
What'd I do?
-You all right?
-No.
"Psst, psst, psst."
Guys...
You guys need some help?
Are you talking to us?
Yeah.
We want to see a naked lady.
"Ooh, how much money you got?"
$103.62.
Really?
That'll do it.
Come on.
Right through here.
"Come on, come on, come on."
Where?
There are naked women in here?
"Guys, you got to trust me."
- Me?
- What is that... ketchup?
What?
"- Okay, not bad."
- You felt it?
"A bit, a bit."
"- Okay, my turn."
- All right.
Taxi!
- I'm so sorry.
- No worries.
"Ooh, man, only a slight breeze that time."
- Yeah?
"- Yeah, it's getting better."
All right.
Ready for some driving?
"- Yeah, let's do it."
- Let's go.
"I could use a little ""Viva La Vida"" right about now."

I've got Cool Ranch and barbecue!
What in the world...
Oh!
I thought I told him to pick these up.
Shouldn't they be there by now?
What's taking them so long?
"Hey, these guys are professionals."
They're the best.
Come on!
They're not lying down on the job.
Go on without me!
Just go!
A good soldier never leaves a man behind.
"Okay, everybody, come on."
Everybody settle down.
"Now, kids."
Everybody...
You sit in a circle.
"No, Andy."
Da Ran...
It's me.
Yoon Jae...
I...
"I was so very, very worried!"
I felt like this all happened because I got angry and threw a fit...
I was so very worried because I thought it was all my fault!
Because I...
Because I needlessly said those words...
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry too.
The words I was going to say to you...
I'll say them now.
Ppuing-ppuing.
"I'm sorry, ppuing-ppuing!"
He's not coming back.
"I'm saying, he didn't come back."
I'm Kang Gyung Joon!
Your face looks very disappointed.
Hello?
Teacher Gil.
Get your senses back.
Where are we right now?
Does this...
All seem like a child's joke to you right now?
Is it fun?
Why is an adult crying at a child's joke?
Being fooled by a kid like you...
I'm the one at fault.
Is it my fault that we didn't switch back?
Why is she getting mad at me?
Where are my belongings?
"""No!"
Get the fuck off of her!
"""Get the fuck off of her!"
"""She's coming home with us!"
She's coming home with us!
"""Get the fuck--get-- Get off of her!"
"""Stop it!"
Stop it!
Stop it!
Stop it!
"""Stop it, bitch!"
Stop it!
Ha!
"""Stop it!"
Stop it!
"No, let me talk to her."
"""Karen, look at me, Karen."
"""Sweetie, you're drunk, okay?"
"""If he wants to take you out, he's gonna wait"
"""till the freakin' sun comes up and take you out"
"""on a respectable date like an adult."
"""We came together."
We're leaving together.
"""Fuck you, Tyrone!"
We came together.
"We're leaving together."""
"And then the girlfriend-- Then the girlfriend, she's all fucking like this."
"She's like, ""I don't know, Karen."""
Her name's Karen too.
"""I don't know, Karen."
"""I mean, he's still nice."
"""I really can't stand up straight right now,"
It was a brilliant fight.
And then I fell?
I suppose I swooned away like a woman.
You were overcome by...
the violence of what you'd done.
You're a sensitive man.
It was very hard.
- I remember the gun was shaking so.
- You see?
You're stronger than you knew.
And I thought you needed me.
But I do need you.
Drink your milk.
Where are the others?
They've gone.
- Gone?
- Mm-hm.
But how will we get back to Paris?
Why don't we stay here for a few days?
It's peaceful.
It's discreet.
Chopin.
Do you love me?
"God help me, I do."
You are superb.
Don't.
What is wrong?
I'm frightened.
Of me?
Certain acts are unseemly.
They are unsuitable.
Chopin.
"And if we're going to survive it, we can't turn on each other."
We're all we have.
I know.
I'll never do anything like that again.
Do you think you can ever forgive me?
"Yeah, I forgive you."
(engine starting)
(tires squealing)
"== sync, corrected by elderman =="
(crying)
We broke up.
WOMAN:
Hello?
SHUTTER CLICKS
"What do you want, pig?"
Can I trust you to pass this on?
What have you got?
"Sorry, are you married?"
I live alone.
Oh.
Liz Fletcher.
"Do you ever go in the loft, Mr Moss?"
I rarely venture beyond the ground floor.
Peggy?
Where the hell are you?
"You shouldn't really be here, Len, You know that, right?"
You're retired.
Argh!
SQUEAKING
KNOCKING
"Come on, she's out."
Karate-chop me or something!
That is not...
Okay.
All right.
Let's just do one simple move.
Okay.
"Now, this won't wrinkle my top, will it?"
Ohh!
Wow.
That was actually fun!
Show me one more time.
"Oh, no!"
"Oh, my gosh."
I thought I lost you again.
"Wait, wait, wait."
Back up.
Again?
"Oh, yeah, when we almost got killed,"
I thought I lost my phone.
It was really scary.
"Mentos-pramp-climb, test number two."
"Lesson learned... when pressure builds to dangerous levels, it must be released."
Is your lip getting better or your face getting redder?
Just gonna pop into the family room.
What the hell was that?

"Oh, I'm just getting started!"
Ohh!
Why do you have to be such a silly...
"Haley, stop!"
Mom!
"Phil, honey."
"- Yes, fine, thanks."
Hello.
"Oh, hello!"
Your first night with no phone wasn't too hard?
It was.
But I made an effort...
"Sorry, I must have seemed ridiculous yesterday, right?"
No.
Sometimes people blow it.
I saw you had a car.
Are you going back to Bordeaux?
Yes!
"Oh, yes!"
I'm leaving...
Oh dear!
In 5 minutes.
Could you handle a stowaway?
"I've a son, Louis, who lives abroad."
The rebel of the family.
"At 18, with a culinary arts diploma, he went off to Asia."
He's in Vietnam now.
I tried to stop him.
Well... in my own way.
"Now he's opened a restaurant, and is doing well."
His taste for adventure doesn't come from me.
- Is Vietnam nice?
- I've never been there.
Even to see him.
I'm a disgrace.
"Stupid, isn't it?"
Am I boring you?
Yes.
"Carried away all my stuff,"
For the bride didn't care!
What's up?
Did you wind it up?
No.
Guys from our fish factory gave it to me.
"As a joke, they wrote on it:"
Don't oversleep the fishing season.
"It works alright, but rings whenever it likes."
Excuse me.
Are we almost there?
"- Maria, may I call you?"
- All right.
- Shall I give you a lift?
I got a car.
- No.
Come on!
Come on!
"Fast train number 71 ""Bogachyovo — Suvorsk"""
is arriving at track one.
The train stops for 5 minutes.
Cars numbered from the tail.
"- Oh, daughter!"
- Mama dear!
"Oh, my God!"
"Careful, mama!"
Hi!
Welcome!
- When are the exercises?
- Tomorrow.
I was traveling in style!
Do you wear glasses now?
You all right?
What do you mean?
You look a bit...
I'm fine.
"Loudest club in the west, mate."
You gonna be all right?
Yeah.
I'll be fine.
"Hey, Tony..."
"Hey, Cass."
Are we going somewhere?
"Oh, yes..."
- You sure you're ready for this?
- I'm totally ready.
Isn't that sweet?
I'm sad about them.
Aren't you?
I'm fine and dandy.
Good.
We're just fine and dandy...
Come on.
You can buy me a drink.
"I think that since Sid and Michelle are together, we should do the same."
"What, go out?"
Yeah!
Get dressed up?
Go on a date?
Yeah!
"And we'd talk and eat dim sum,"
- and I'd take you home...
- And I'd walk you upstairs...
But I'd knock my head on the door frame and fall down.
The End.
I'm pretty sure that's cheating.
Ha.
"It worked, didn't it?"
Hmm.
Who's next in our little contest?
Oh.
Has anyone seen the mice?
Are we there yet?
- Ha.
- Okay.
I think it's time for a story that's actually scary.
Pff.
"Yeah, whatever."
Whoop.
"Pshh, pshh, pshh."
You had your chance.
"Now, then..."
Something beyond comprehension was happening to a little boy on this street... in this house.
A man had come as a last resort.
Because... no one else would go near the place.
Gah!
I hear you've been expecting me.
- You are the...
- That's right.
I am... the babysitter.
"Yes, sir, yes, thank goodness you've come."
My boy.
I don't know what's gotten into him.
I've-a never seen anything like it.
"Trust me, buddy."
I've got three little ogres at home.
The bell rang!
I'll murder that guy!
I'll murder him!
They're trying to pull a fast one!
We've been crossed!
I'll kill that tagger!
He called me a fink!
- What's he talking about?
"- Tell him, Tiny!"
Tell him!
- It looks bad!
- Yeah!
- I can see all right!
"- Okay, it's your funeral!"
"Hurry up and tell him, Tiny!"
"We ain't got much time, so listen!"
"You got to lay down, Stoker!"
- Lay down?
- It's in the bag!
There's 20 bucks extra in it for you!
Maybe 30!
- But I can stop him!
"- No, you can't, Stoker!"
This is Little Boy's fix!
He's paying us to go in the tank!
You know Little Boy if you cross him!
You gotta go down!
Go down on the first good punch!
- Take the count!
Let's get out of here!
- Yeah!
Ten seconds!

[Man] You are being read into the Have Blue program.
This is a top-secret U.S. Government project... administered by the Department of Defense.
You must have some pretty powerful friends to get us here on a Sunday.
To get us here at all.
We're not supposed to be talking about this to anyone.
Not even our wives.
They have people watching our wives.
You know that?
Making sure we haven't blabbed to them.
"Well, I'm the guy that's gonna make sure that you don't."
Mmm.
Concealed weapon.
The gun's going to the lab ;
you're coming with us.
"Let's go, guys."
You shoot Julio ?
I didn't cap nobody.
That's all right.
We'll get the bullet from autopsy.
"Well, when you do, get back to me."
Are we done ?
"Not quite, Luis."
What's that ?
That is your confession for another murder.
What murder ?
Bob Keaton.
Muzzle stamp's identical.
"Bob's chest, your gun."
800 or deal is off.
Then it's off.
"Wait, wait, wait, wait."
Five.
I'll give you five.
Now you negotiate ?
"Luis, show him my counteroffer."
- I'm out of here.
"- Wait, wait, wait, wait."
You killed him.
Julio's the boss.
"Maybe you took care of that, too."
"No, I swear."
I didn't.
And I was the one who saw him first.
"Oh, don't be ridiculous."
Very well.
We'll use the joint account.
- Don't be angry with me.
"- I'm not angry with you, Ursula."
I'm just gonna get the washing.
"No, no, I'll do it."
I'll do it!
"Oh, Ursula."
[Men chattering]
[Dorcas]:
"Not cheap, is it?"
[Man]:
It is for everyone else.
You can afford it.
It's just as well.
[Men chattering]
[Dorcas]:
I want some pilchards.
[Man]:
No more left.
"What do you mean, haven't got any left?"
I did have half an hour ago.
"What have you done with it, then?"
All right.
Phyllis has got 'em up at the shed.
She'd better have.
[Woman]:
What's she want pilchards for?
Stargazey pie.
What's the matter with coley fish?
Hello?
"Crowe, wait up!"
There's no one there.
Crowe?
Hey.
Do you hear me or wh...
"Think of him in terms of Leslie... someone she might've known, someone who liked her a lot."
You got something?
I got an I.D. From an orderly.
The guy's name is Neal Booker.
- Neal Booker?
- Yes.
You know him?
The orderly.
He's so quiet... like he's not even there.
- He working now?
- I don't know.
I think this could be Neal... if he were really angry and scared.
"Ridge, get down to personnel."
Find out where this guy is.
"Your eyes are different, Leslie."
They gave them to her.
They're not the right color.
They... they took the corneas.
Just the clear window on top.
The windows of the soul.
I've been looking for you.
In all of them.
I... saw them... carry pieces of you away.
I'm here.
Put it on.
You have 30 seconds.
- Who is slave?
"I am a soldier, too, please."
- You're what?
Regimental bhisti.
"Proud ox, where is your army?"
How soon are they to follow?
Wouldn't you like to know?
Why don't you look in your crystal ball?
Make the ox talk.
You dirty pack of cowards!
Never mind him.
Now.
He's next.
- I'm waiting.
Will you speak?
- I don't know.
"Hold on, Mac, old boy!"
Stop.
Look.
"See them down there... coiling and wiggling, sticking their pretty tongues out?"
Are you going to speak?
Throw him in.
He'll talk from there.
"- No, I can't stand it!"
- Will you speak?
All right.
"If I ain't kissed by one of them snakes, I'll tell you."
Take me outside.
"- Be a man, Mac."
"- I can't go it, mates!"
"Come back, Mac, old boy!"
"- Well, Sergeant?"
I got you!
You traitor!
You get your hands off of me!
Snakes!
"Oh, sh... oh, at your feet!"
The girl was mine!
She's of no use to us.
Only our mission for the führer matters.
"I wonder sometimes, Monsieur, if you have that clearly in mind."
"It was not to be, chérie."
You bastards!
I'll get you for this!
Indiana Jones... adieu.
No!
Take this.
Wave it at anything that slithers.
Thank you.
"Oh, my God, this whole place is slithering."
Indy!
Ow!
Jesus!
Where did you get this?
From him?
I was trying to escape.
No thanks to you.
How hard were you trying?
"Well, where the hell were you?"
"Watch it, watch it."
What are you doing?
For the fire!
How the hell are we going to get out of here?
I'm working on it!
"If you do this well, there are more jobs coming."
"Doc, don't worry."
I won't break my promise.
Hey...
You can't charge your laptop here.
"Sir,"
I really need to download some work.
Just a little while?
Yes.
This medicine may make you sleepy.
I'm taking it doc.
Shit!
Damn it!
Only half an hour left.
Are you done?
Here.
Thank you.
Just half for now.
Tomorrow morning I will send you the rest.
You haven't finished it yet?
This is a big project.
"Je, what are you doing?"
I'm calling Jerd.
Why are you calling him?
Tomorrow you will get it.
Yoon.
"Je, don't call."
Send it now or we're screwed.
"Je, stop dialing."
You have another 50% to finish.
It's not...
Doesn't matter.
"Oh, he's already left for work."
I hear him go 7:40 on the dot every morning.
Oh.
Does he live on his own?
Joe?
You bet he does.
Nobody'd put up with the grumpy old bastard.
"I'm Kieron, by the way."
We keep missing each other.
"Oh, Michael."
"Oh, let me get it."
"Oh, thanks."

He wasn't even here.
He was out looking for you to help.

-Died.
"- Well, I'm very sorry."
- We were hunted down one by one.
All that they died for is this.
It's a Purean.
It contains a collective data of human progression as well as Draconian war plans.
Information that could be very helpful in our cause in overcoming them.

"And these curtains, they were on fire."
And I was in this corner.
Right.
"(STAMMERING) And I was looking out, and there was someone else there."
She was staring at me through the flames.

- There's a man's bag and hat.
So what?
Lots of men in Marseille wear hats.
Marseille?
When were we in Marseille?
"What do you mean, Marseille?"
"I told you, this is Paris."
You just said Marseille.
"I made a mistake, so what?"
I'm not feeling well.
- Just tell us who took the picture.
- I did!
"Don't be angry, Aunt Rosa."
When Morn and Dorona came you'd just had surgery.
You couldn't have taken it.
What surgery?
- Eye surgery.
- Oh...
But that wasn't then.
"I'm telling you, I took the picture."
Then your mom photographed me with Doborobon-.
I'll show you.
- What?
- Your whole hat theory...
I feel like an idiot.
Why does she call me Doborobon?
It's been half an hour.
She fell asleep.
"Check her, maybe she's dead."
"If you love me, then you need to let me go."
"Oh, she's gone."
I wish I could cry on demand.

Go ahead.
I'll just find a place to park.
"You mean, you're not gonna drive off and disappear for 6 months?"
"Because this is my car, and my lease is up soon."
I'll be right back.
"Baby, get ready to get fragged."
"- Hey, where's Brian?"
- Parking.
Where's Adam?
"Oh, he's outside obsessing over the briquettes."
Is this even gonna work?
"Maybe we should hide the knives, just in case."
Oh!
Oh!
No!
No!
You cheated.
You cheated.
"Oh, come on."
"You looked away, honey pie."
I didn't cheat.
- Slap it.
Slap it!
"- Slapping of the... no, no."
See?
That's why I don't play with you anymore.

You are so cute when you pout.
There's no other woman.

At your age.
You keep fit enough.
You're sweet.
I know you're not cheating on me.
I'd notice it in seconds.
You would?
How?
Everything.
I know you through and through.
Ab.
What are you doing?
What are you up to?
Talk to me.
"If you don't know, you can't tell."
Can't tell?
"Can't spill the beans, you mean."
We can never forget this.
We owe it to Arie.

The names Horn and Boulanger.
Give me all you've got.
What's with the Zerbib case?
"Juliette, wait, wait."
"Okay, Juliette."

"Now, Juliette, remember, what you're about to see is just me."
Juliette?

What did I do?
I-I warned her.
I told you what would happen if--
"Look, this doesn't have anything to do with you."

You gotta help me!
Don't leave me here!
I'm in hillbilly hell!
My IQ's dropping by the second!

I know a thing or two about getting the truth out of people.
I look forward to seeing that.
Too bad we gotta keep him alive.
"Since we do, we'd best get us some help."
Come on.
J.D. :
"Hey, Buck."
Josiah.
We gotta ride.
Split them up.
Everybody takes a man.

Hold it right there.

MAN:
Don't shoot.
Don't shoot.
vin:
"You're finished, Eli."
Yates?
Where is he?
Where is he?
I got no problem killing you.
Won't change the fact he's gone.
Took off early.
Yeah.
"I was very, very hurt."
I'm kidding.
"Brown, take the brown ones."
Don't take the white ones or the
Red ones.
Why brown?
Because brown is the
Ibuprofen.
The red and the white ones are
Left over from when I was
Seriously addicted to pills.
"Well, why didn't you just"
Throw them away?
Because I'm sentimental.
About pills?
Sarcasm.
"All right, so, uh, the red,"
Right?
Brown.
Brown.
Gonna take the brown.
Tell me he's not color blind.
I hope not.
Are you sure there's not
Anything I can do?
"Honey, come on, look."
"You handle the kids, right?"
You drive them to
And from school.
You take them to their games.
You do their laundry.
- Hi.
And this is McGee.
Tim McGee.
Tim.
Of course.
Ellie's been singing your praises all year.
It's great to finally meet you both.
"Emphasis on ""finally."""
Yeah.
I know.
"Um, I'm sorry again, Abby, about missing your Halloween party."
"Oh, that's okay-- I'm sure you had some... super big, top secret emergency NSA meeting that you couldn't miss."
"Uh, we were being audited, actually."
"But yes-- once again, my job forced a last-minute change of plans."
But not tonight.
No.
"We are spending the holiday in Turks and Caicos with Jake's family, no matter what."
"You better get going, then."
Gibbs.
This is...
"Jake, yeah."
How you doing?
Gibbs.
Wow.
I'm good.
"Um, listen, I can't thank you enough for what you've meant to Ellie this past year."
All of you.
She's earned it.
"Turks, huh?"
Turks for Turkey Day.
Yeah.
"Uh, the country Turkey might have been a little too on the nose."

You could've told me.

We didn't know exactly when it would stop nearby.
Nearby!
We walked almost for two hours.

Nothing.
"Okay, you know what?"
I can't believe that you just ignored the dirtiest text I've ever sent you.
"Well, dirty text?"
What dirty text?
I didn't get any dirty text.
I got...
"Ooh, geez."
No.
"The last text I got from you said, ""Never mind."
"- I forgot I had eaten beets."""
- No.
(sighs)
- Oh... (murmuring)

I think that's the dirtiest text anybody's ever sent anybody.
You like it like that.

Go ahead.
I'll be back.
"Okay, Glenda."
"Here we go, a little stick, okay?"

I'm Dan Rydell alongside Casey McCall.

It's time for spring training.
"You hear that, gentlemen?"
This is the sound of opportunity knocking.
Don't be slow to answer the door.
J.D. :
I still can't believe you did it.
You know this is material evidence.
Did I say it wasn't?
"Either we do this together, Minks, or every man for himself."
I'm hungry.
How about you?
I'll see you tomorrow.
As you like.
"Yeah, what's up?"
What's so damned urgent anyway?
Order me a beer at the bar.
"I'll be right there, okay?"
Sorry.
"Hey... 2 beers, please."
Recognize her?
I found her.
Minks' daughter.
Got it?
She's been here since last Sunday.
I didn't realize it until we talked to each other.
Marie?
"This is Marc, the friend I told you about."
Yeah.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Can I have a beer?
I have to talk to her.
You really just want to talk?
What if she doesn't want to?
- What?
Go back to her old man?
Will you leave her alone?
- Yeah.
- What are you doing?
Turn around!
"- Man, I have my rights."
"- What do you mean, your rights?"
"Who's the boss here, huh?"
"Hey, who's running this outfit?"
- I am.
- You are?
- What are you doing here?
Who sent you down?
- Just runnin' around.
"Don't talk back to me, man."
What are you doing here?
"- We saw the car, man."
- You heist this car?
No.
We was breaking down the tires.
That's all it was.

Here you go.

- You don't want any.
"Erm, I get the feeling you know what's going on here."
"Lena, talk to me."
'Dr Sigapelli to cardiology.
Dr Sigapelli.'
I thought it was his imagination.
He kept telling me he felt them.
He felt them.
Wait a minute.
Felt who?
"About two weeks ago, he started to act different, nervous."
"This week, it was worse."
He couldn't even sleep.
"And then yesterday, he..."
Did you say anything stupid?
"By ""anything stupid,"" I mean anything at all."
Look at you.
"Mouth open, vocal chords a-twitter."
We'll talk about it later.
"Right now, you out."
Ten minutes ago.
Go on.
"There are laws, detective."
Have your kindergarten teacher read them to you.
Go grab a juice box.
Have a nap.
Go on.
All right.

Public masturbation.
- What?
I don't get it.
What's the kick?
"Why don't you do it at home with a big flat-screen TV, 50 channels of pay-per-view?"
In a Starbucks.
That's nice.
"That ain't me, man."
I...
I was the guy who was selling meth.
Allegedly.
Okay.
# Breathe on my dreams don't blow them apart

Morning.
You see that ceiling?
All them tiles might have to come down.
Sorry.
Hang on.

Tubby.
Mr Brierley.
I'm glad I've seen you.
"Look, about the other day."
My wife's a bit...
She's at a funny age.
No. it was a very nice occasion.
Crisp breads.
Very gentlemanly of you.
Could we make amends?
Could I invite you and the lady...?
Enid.
That's it.
Could you both perhaps come to dinner?
Then I'll just get back to work.
"Trevor, not yet."
I need to ask you for a UA.
Look like rain.
Radio says there's a storm on the way.
They said right.
I'd say it's already here.
You are on the first shift?
- Yeah.
- Me too.
"Funny, I never seen you before."
I've been here.
I work in the pit.
I just picked up Reynolds' shift.
Where's Reynolds?
Feds picked him up.
On warrant.
I'm Ivan.
Trevor.
"Well, I guess I'd better begin by..."
I hear that Tucker guy can be a real prick.
You got that right.
I'll see you around.
What's wrong?
I just want to lie here.
We can do that.
I'm so tired.
"You can fall asleep if you want, off the meter."
That is the problem.
I can't sleep.
Nothing helps.
Don't worry about it honey.
We're gonna miss out on all this money.
- Anybody could kick that guy's ass.
- I know.
Come on.
You could kick...
You-You could kick that guy's ass.
You think?
"Oh, my God."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Oh, you're, like, the second toughest guy I know."
I did bash Charlie good a couple times.
- You almost hurt him once.
- With the bottle?
"- Yeah, and that's next to impossible."
- That was good.
- You're...
You're good.
- I am good.
Yeah.
Tell you what.
Um...
Why don't you go stretch out.
I'll talk to the bookie and let him know that Clown Baby... has arrived.
- Let's do it.
- All right.
Goddamn it.
"- Frankie, what's the deal?"
- She got arrested.
- Ah!
I knew that skinny bitch would chicken out.
- So we'll never get the fight.
Oh my!
It's so hot outside!
And these things I bought are so heavy!
Sis?
"Sis, why?"
What happened?
.
Why am I being like this?
What's the matter?
.
Come here.
"Don't cry sis, it doesn't look good on you."
"Because of my jealousy, because of my suspicions, I'm turning into something else."
"If I keep on being like this, Migs wouldn't like me."
"Come on Sis, you know you're not really like that, right?"
.
I'm already choking Migs.
"I've smothered him so much,"
"You know, it's like this Sis don't put him on a leash."
He has to be with you because he loves you.
Right?
Come on!
Brother Migs!
Happy Birthday!
"By the way, my sister left your cell phone."
She told me to give it to you.
Wait a second okay?
.
Brother!
-Who's that girl?
-I'm your wife!
"Bela, what's this?"
I acted foolishly as well.
"No hard feelings, aye?"
I'll buy you a refreshment.
"Please, allow me."
I shall buy you a refreshment.
"No, no, I'll buy you one."
I insist.
"No, I must buy you one, to make amends."
It's all right.
I'll buy.
"- No, I will buy."
- I'll buy.
"- No, I will buy."
- I'll buy.
"- No, I will."
- I will.
- I will.
- Me!

A SUBURBAN TALE
Directed by Sakari Kirjavainen
My name is Ben Laine.
I will help you through the day.
I know that you're anxious.
You've had nightmares or didn't sleep at all.
Count with me from three to one.
"Three, two, one."
Good.
You can feel your entire body relax.
"Make some coffee, Viljanen."
"I'm talking about getting very, very rich."
"You count cards, right?"
All of you?
"As a team, yes."
- When?
- Weekends.
And Christian holidays.
- Where?
"- Vegas, baby."
"So, why are you telling me?"
"Well, let's just say a spot opened up on our roster."
How?
Jimmy got a job at Google.
- Jimmy got a job at Google?
"- Yeah, it's catchy, I know."
"Well, if you're making so much money at this, then why did he take it?"
"Ben, I said Google, not Sizzler."
Yeah...
This is crazy.
"No, Ben."
This is profitable.
"Yeah, I can't do it."
"So, I'm sorry."
"- Come on, Ben."
It'll be fun.
"- Yeah, Ben, it'll be fun."
"No, it's not that."
It's...
"I just got a promotion at my job, so it's kind of not a good time for me."
We pay better.
"Look, I can't just go to Vegas on weekends."
Why not?
"- Oh, is that what you call it?"
- Violet!
What?
"I almost forgot, I got something for you too."
Really?
- Why are you giving this to me?
- You have a unique world of view.
Now you can share with others... in a new way.
"Thanks a lot, mister."
I need the police.
"Yes, that's my address."
What are you doin'?
He's writing a letter.
To who?
"To ""whom""."
To whom?
His daughter.
I'll do it.
What?
I'll write it for you.
Alright.
Thank you.
So where was I?
"""Dear April..."""
That's it?
"So far, yeah."
"""Dear April,"
"I don't know if you'll ever read this, but I hope you do."
In any case...
It's time we finally talk.
"Please, take care of yourself."
I managed to put some money in your bank account.
Is that paint?
"Yeah, looks like it."
"Hey, Gabby!"
"- Take a sample from her left fingers,"
- Left hand.
"Excuse me, Mr. Monk?"
I have a nephew.
He's ten years old.
He's your biggest fan.
He clips articles.
He thinks you're cooler than Spider-man.
Really?
Kids!
"If I could get your autograph, he'd think i'm some kind of hero."
"Sorry, Mr. Monk is working."
Maybe when he's finished.
- I'm sorry.
- Anything else?
"Clues, clues, scanning, scanning."
"No, that's it, all done."
You said something about an autograph?
That would be great.
Thank you so much.
I got.
Would you mind?
Would you mind?
Perpendicular.
Put your head down.
Your hair's in the way.
"Head down, head down."
Are you okay?
- She's fine.
-No!
"-Mom, if I eat all my pizza, can I have some alien slime?"
This cannot be happening to me.
-A stranger.
-From the outside.
Greetings.
I am Buzz Lightyear.
I come in peace.
"Before your space journey, re-energise yourself with a slice of pepperoni, now boarding at counter three."
This is an intergalactic emergency.
I need to commandeer your vessel to Sector 1 2.
Who's in charge here?
The claw!
The claw is our master.
The claw chooses who will go and who will stay.
-This is ludicrous.
"-Hey, bozo, you got a brain in there?"
Take that!
"Oh, no!"
Sid!
Get down!
What's gotten into you?
I was...
You are the one that decided to climb into this...
"The claw, it moves."
I have been chosen!
"Farewell, my friends."
I go on to a better place.
Gotcha!
A Buzz Lightyear?
No way!
Yes!
- Could be a bad thing.
- Tara!
"See ya on ""Trisha""."
I was thinking of asking you to speak at the school.
Speak?
About drugs.
Speak about drugs?
To the kids.
Speak to the kids about drugs?
They need to hear about the harsh realities 'cause... people talk so much shit about drugs.
Yeah.
I know I do.
Half your sixth form come round here anyway.
You could call a register here some weeks.
"Ah, now, that's another good topic."
What's it like working from home?
(KNOCK AT DOOR)
"Well, the hours are terrible, but then I hardly do owt."
So it balances itself out.
"Jesus! ""Hellraiser III:"
"Hell On Earth""."
"- It's been a while, lads."
"- Been off on tour, haven't we?"
"- Been having some mad times, y'know."
Mad.
- Mad!
"- Hello, Miss."
- Lee.
Jason.
Miss.
- How are you both?
- Wicked.
See you off?
I feel very sorry for you too!
"Miss Bridget, it's time to board the plane!"
"Hey Yank, don't go away!"
"Hey Yank, what about the money?"
"I want cash, no credit cards!"
I've paid her already!
Yes!
I've donated it in your names to the War Relief Fund.
You're great!
I thank you for the four hundred million people.
See you after our country wins the war!
- Allow me!
- Thank you!
"It's all your fault, me posing as Hiroshima."
Now we've got no money and no woman!
Hey Yank!
What is it?
Remember to get Hiroshima for me!
What?
Don't forget to fix Hiroshima for me.
OK!
"No money, no woman, that means we have nothing."
I guess we're friends again!
Sure we are!
"6th August, 1945."
The American finished Hiroshima.

I was dead.
"I mean,"
I was really dead.
Really.
Tell me about it.
What's it like to be dead?
I'd got loose.
It were as if I was getting out of my body.
"My body was staying here, and I..."
I was flying.
You were floating?
Yes.
"I heard that dog, and a woman screaming."
"They were around me, panicking and... then I heard that noise."
It was like a whistle.

"I'm trying, Terhi."
I'm the secret garden of your lusts.
I'm taking off my panties now.
My orchid is opening up.
"Where are you going at this hour, Jemina?"
Where were we?
You said Jemina.
-So?
"Terhi, let's pretend that my name is Jesse."
I don't believe it.
Remember Pepita the Elephant?
Give me some phone sex now.
"Do I have to, Jesse?"
I'm fucking paying for this.
"Fine, let's go then."
My pussy is all wet.
I can hear you open your zipper.

And melting the silver into bullets?
"Man, Dean, we were raised like warriors."
"Lock the doors, the windows, close the shades."
-Most important--
-Watch out for Sammy.
[GROWLS]
I don't understand the blind faith you have in the man.
-It's called being a good son.
"-Dad's gonna be here, right?"
"He'll be here, promise."
"-Where is he, anyway?"
-On business.
-That's why you ran away.
-I was going to college.
"It was Dad who said if I was gonna go, I should stay gone."
"Your brother and me, we needed you."
"You walked away, Sam."
-You walked away.
DEAN:
Stop it.
You're the one who said don't come back.
"You closed that door, not me!"
This isn't the life I wanted for you.
[SCREAMING]
"BUT NOW'S NOT THE TIME TO SAY ""I TOLD YOU SO."""
"THIS ISN'T LIKE YOU, MICHAEL."
I KNOW.
"FIONA,I NEED YOUR HELP."
"OH,SO YOU'RE NOT GONNA HANDLE THIS ONE ON YOUR OWN."
"YOU JUST COULDN'T HELP YOURSELF, COULD YOU?"
"SADLY,NO."
TAKE DOUG BACK TO THE LOFT.
LOCK HIM DOWN TIGHT.

I'M GLAD ONE OF US IS HAVING FUN.
"You're not missing the damsel in distress,are you?"
"""Michael,my son!"
I'm afraid!
"Please,Michael!"""
You changed.
This is more my style.
- Who?
Finnerman?
I won't let her.
"I couldn't protect you before, Allison."
But I can now.
"Dad, what have you done?"
You weren't supposed to see this.
You should go.
"Dad, no!"
No!
"Help us, someone, please help us!"
Protect... protect the innocent ones.
No!
"No, Dad."
"Hey, stay with me, okay?"
You're gonna be okay.
Just...
Just stay with me.
"Stay with me, okay?"
"Please, someone help us!"

You're doing great.
"I'm doing so great, how come you're right up on my ass?"
I'm drafting you.
"(laughs) Not for long, you're not."
(gears shift)
No.
"Anyway, uh..."
So I can still have Daisy this weekend if that's OK?
"No, that's great."
"But you could have called to tell me that, so why are you really here?"
"Well, I just wondered if you, you know, fancied a drink or a bite to eat tonight?"
Um...
I...
I can't.
I'm...
I'm having dinner with someone.
OK.
Cool.
Yeah.
Have a good night.
"Happy anniversary, Harry,"
You too.
"What the hell are you doing here, Harry?"
I've come to win my money back off you.
You're deluded.
Fortune favors the brave.
"If fortune favored you, you wouldn't be drinking here alone."
"So why don't you have a drink with me, Freddie?"
Unburden yourself.
"Take your hands off me, Harry."
Do you mind?
(MAN SHOUTS)
Look at me!
I need your help.
I need to talk to Freddie!
"Look, Kayleigh's gone, JC!"
She's disappeared!
Eat.

Right?
I'll go see.
Sada-don!
Sadakichi-don!
Yes.
Where's the fire?
There's anyone on the rooftop?
I'm on my way.
It's in the Honjo district.
You know?
Also the wind comes from the northwest.
Don't worry.
Matsuki-san?
The son of the neighbor!
Isn't he?
!
The love of Matsuki-san for fire will give him trouble.
Right?
Matsuki!
Where did he go?
Told you to keep an eye on him if the fire bell was heard.
Where did the keeper go?
Send people to the fire chief place.
Tell him I said not to let him in to the place of fire.
It took a lot of dealing.
You heard it?
"Dear, will you talk about that again?"
It's because Naritaya-san has a reputation of being meticulous.
"in ""Assistant""."
I left my coat on the bus.
- Can you describe it?
"Yes, it had eight wheels, hard plastic seats, and when it stopped, it went, ""sh-h-h-h"""
"Harry, he means the coat."
"- Oh, oh!"
"Um, well, it kind of looked like this one, only it was furry.."
don't have it.
Next.
Night Eddie.
- See you Monday.
He's got my coat.
"- Harry, be a man."
"Hey, Mister, that's my coat."
No it isn't.
"- Yeah, that's his coat."
"If it's his coat, how come I'm wearing it?"
Good point.
Hey babes.
"Good morning Dick, did you sleep well?"
"Once the adrenaline wore off, like a baby."
"You know when you've been riding the bullet train to ""yuk-ville"", it's kind of hard to slow down."
I've been up all night faxing jokes to Leno.
What have we here?
Eleven banana cream pies!
One for every letter in my name.
Am I right?
Right.
Oh girls.
You shouldn't have.
"Oh, we had to."
Really.
"Come, come, come."
You must be famished.
"Let me help you, my dear."
There we go.
That's better.
"Now, quite comfy, hmm?"
"Ha, ha."
"It's not often that we have such a lovely dinner guest, eh, Eric?"
[Match strikes]
"Uh, do you like it?"
It is rather a fine one.
"- [Laughs] - [Woman] Oh, my."
"[Clears throat] Sorry, Grim."
"Why, Eric, that's the first time I've seen you smile in weeks."
"Ah, very amusing. [sniffs]"

I'm really sorry about Stephanie.
Sam...
"Hey, sweetie."

You weren't there.
You didn't even hear that.
"Tris, we need to leave now, all right?"
"I'm sorry, Four."
What?
I'm sorry I didn't tell you that I was gonna go.
I wanted to say goodbye and I just didn't know how.
I didn't know how.
What are you talking about?
So even though I didn't get to say it in real life at least I get to say it now.
Even if it is just in the sim.
"Tris, we're not in a sim."
Don't you think I'd know if I was in a sim?
"Four, you're not in a sim."
You are the sim.
"Wait, wait."

He's no cop!

"Lying bastard, I shouldn't have trusted you!"
The guy's a cop.
I recognize him!
You've got it wrong.
"Chang, I'll get him!"
That shithead!
Don't move!
"Goddamn mess, assho--"
Finish your sentence.
Ass... assho--
"Inspector Li, the suspect Eddie Hung held a hostage... in a crowded trolley car..."
Could you see him clearly?
"One time, we had a warning of an attack."
We had the entire village like this.
"When the raiders came, we jumped up and chased them back to the beach."
But there was one small problem.
You couldn't find the village again.
Have I told you the story before?
"Now, remember, just remove the leader."
Jacob moore.
"If we take him, we gain a significant advantage."

It caught me in a net!
It tried to capture me.
"We all ride, one of us is bound to cross his path."
Mathematical certainty.
You got a chance to finish this now.
You may not get another one.
"Alrighty, then."
Meet up at my wagon in 20 minutes.

"-You gotta understand, Buck."
-What do I gotta understand?
Luther is the father of my baby.
But he wouldn't admit it.
"So l-- Well, I made a play for you, Buck."
"Oh, wait, are you telling me I was second choice to him?"
"No, no, it was only a play to force his hand."

"Good morning, Master Law!"

Any better now?
"Yes, Master!"
Fung-wu!
Do all our students understand the mystery of the sword?
"Yes, Master!"
They all understand!
"Good morning, Master Law!"
Let's get together tonight at the old place.
I'll be the host.
"No, I should be the host!"
I will be the host!
I'll be the host!
I've told you I'll be the host!
I'll be the host!
Don't argue!
No...
I will!
Don't argue!
"I'll be the host, do you hear?"
Fung-wu...
What's happened to you?
There's nothing to argue about!
Don't snatch!
Who's the host really?
I am!
I am!
"Fung-wu, try to use our sword skills!"
"Jun-kit, attack him with the Shaolin fist!"
- What's she like?
"Short and fat, with a moustache."
- A beaver.
- close.
We miss you.
"Bye, kitten."
Attempted murder.
Good morning.

Go slow and call when you get there.
Not a prostitute.
I receive training.
I'm sorry.
I didn't know.
I didn't mean to insult you.
But how can they impose that on you?
I chose.
What do you mean.
You chose?
Between a long sentence in prison and this.
This was shorter.
Because...
That way.
They'll give me back...
Look.
I can't talk to patients about this.
I mean outside...
If they were to find me...
- Is Eva your real name?
No.
I can't use my real name anymore.
- What is it?
I can't give it to you.
Come on.
It's just a name.
You don't understand.
I'm in prison.
There are rules.
It's bad enough as it is.
If...
Look.
I have to disconnect.

"I'd been sick for about three months... uh, and he was just so amazing."
"He took such great care of me and the kids, and..."
- This is gonna sound weird. [Chuckles]
- Please.
My life?
No judgment.
L-lt's not that I wanted him to be sick or anything like that... but I...
I wanted... the opportunity... to show him that I could be there for him.
You know?
I haven't always been.
I've been going on and on.
You haven't.
This is what recovery is all about.
"You know, opening up, being honest."
Okay.

Yeah.
"Hey, Moe, Harbor found one of Superboy's shoes."
What about the socks?
They find them too?

Jack Rector's comin' in tomorrow at 9:00.

Who's his lawyer?

"Ooh, big gun."

"Oh, Ray's all grieving and depressed."

"Alright, alright, listen!"
None of dat is my business anyway.
But you?

But I tied him up.

I will go find him then--
"But I bet you could, right?"
It's doubtful.

Did you get him something for Christmas?
-I took care of it.
"-What was it, so I'll know."
It was a little car with an electric motor that he can ride in.
It's nice.
"Thank you, Al."
"Fellows, could you step outside for a minute?"
Where's my brother?
Roth got out on a private boat.

Why don't we just sit down... and discuss this?

They're gonna do that all the way home.

I'll see how much we've collected.
- The money too?
"- Yeah, I'll count it."
Okay.
- Really bad handwriting.
- Yeah.
You'd swear a doctor had written it.
It's barely legible.
Looking forward to school?
- Well...
- It starts soon.
- Where did you go to school before?
- In Vienna.
A lot more going on there.
We've already collected a tidy sum.
"If somebody else gives as much as him, we'll have done pretty well."
Mm-hmm.
We'll see how much more we get.
What do you do all day?
Not much.
I have to go to the toilet.

"10 years ago to this day, his father died here."
He was waiting for a train as he did every evening.
"He had a good job, happy family."
"And one evening, he'd had enough."
"And when the express came by, he jumped."
Was he a friend of yours?
"And these last few days,"
Dennis has come here every evening.
- Every evening.
- Do you ever answer a question?
Look at him.
- Why should I?
- Look at him.
"Because in about two minutes,"
Dennis there will be dead.

Come in.
- Back to Washington?
- Yeah.
- Do you have to go?

- If this is about today...
"- No, it's not."
I got a message.
I have to go home.
I have to be there noon on Friday.
"John, do you realize what's happening to you?"
I have to go.
"Hey, it's me."
- Connie?
- Yeah.
"I thought we could chat for, say, 10 or 15 minutes."
- I'm sorry.
Can I call you back?
"- No,you can't."
- I booked you a flight.
- What?
"It leaves Dulles for Columbus, Ohio at 1:45."
"I tried to get you on the one to Charleston, but they're all booked up."
"So if you leave now, you'll just make it."
I can't.
"It's Christmas Eve, John."
You shouldn't be alone.
I can't.
"Yeah, you can."
You know... when Mary got sick...
I couldn't help thinking... this isn't real.
I can stop this.
"Mano, Erik!"

-Glory!
"My beautiful boys, I you never see them."
We have to find a way to take you there.
"Honey, everyone is looking for a way out."
"If there is an exit, we'll find."
"Do not worry, Dad."
"Today, the Uncle Mano took an enormous elephant seal a large black hole."
But that hole was quite different.
-But he drew.
"-Mano, can bring a fish for my children."
"-For me, too."
"-Here, too."
"Okay, will do my best."
"Hey, listen!"
There's a way of freeing almost all of you.
"I'm going to delelândia, I'll bring some friends."

"- Yeah, totally."
"You've got the pony bug now, and there's no cure for that."
- Granddaughter 1 returns.
- That's my girl.
Back in time for dinner.
"Okay, I've had the most insane day."
I don't know where to start.
Uh...
"Sam, she asked me to help with Raven, he's a horse."
"And Pin was like, ""Back off, tourist."""
- And I...
- You've been at the stables?
"It sounds like you had fun, whatever you were doing."
Everybody's actually kind of cool.
Apart from Mia...
I don't want you riding.
What?
Why?
Because I need you keeping an eye on Rosie.
- She could come with me.
- Rosie at a stable?
I don't think so.
Okay.
It's fine.
She doesn't have to be with me the whole time.
This isn't up for discussion.
I've got enough to worry about with Gramps and your dad and...
Just... promise me.
No riding.
Sure.
No riding.
"You will go back to school, won't you?"
"Well, if we was to go back to school, could we get as smart as Tia and Tony?"
- Maybe even smarter.
"- Yeah, sure."
Let's give it a shot.
Great.
I hope the school can take it.
"- Goodbye, Yo-Yo."
- Goodbye.
"- See you later, Yo-Yo."
- You promised.
"Tia, open the gate."
"No, everybody join hands."
Cool!
All right!

Will we ever see you again?
"Well, it's... it's kind of hard to say."
Thanks for everything.
And especially for letting me be in your gang.
"Take care of Alfred for me, OK?"
There you are.
- Where's your luggage?
"- Uh, we lost it."
There were a few problems.
- But you did have fun?
"- Oh, terrible."
I just knew we should have gone surfing.
Hey.
Let's do it the way Tia and Tony taught us.
Yeah.
- Ready?
And she became a billionaire.
Weren't you going to call Philip?
- Who do we know with money?
"- Philip, Jonas and Tommy."
Why?
We'II do what Anna Nicole Smith did.
Hook a guy with money.
- Sounds a bit risky to me.
- What else can we do?
Move to Virum and end up like Vanessa?
Add Bjarke to the list.
He's dying to screw me.
- Patricia?
- Sofie?
Where have you been?
- What happened?
- Simon's been really worried.
- I've been sleeping in the park.
- Why?
- I said no and that's that.
- I'm sick of you.
You never think of anyone but yourself and I'm sick of school...
I hate you.
"Stop it, Simon."
"I am not in the mood, OK?"
- She looks just like you.
- You creep!
You'd be great in porn.
You fuck just like her.
Didn't you hear mum?
She totally lost it.
What did she say?
- R-Right.
Turn the right tap.
- He's messing with you!
It's up to Chris.
He's saying left so that you'll pick right.
Maybe it's because I don't wanna hurt Gemma.
You don't care who you hurt.
One.
Left.
- I choose the left tap.
- Left tap turning on.
"Good call, Chris."
"Babe, babe, I'm sorry."
"I'm sorry, babe, he made me choose."
I suppose a date's out of the question now.
I'm so sorry.
"He made me choose, all right?"
He just made me.
"Round, and round, and round it goes... where it stops... nobody knows."
All right.
I'll play.
Truth.
Why us?
Why you?
Why us five?
Why did you choose us?
A photograph by Felix's bed.
Five faces scratched out.
- Your faces.
- That doesn't prove anything.
"- Fucking hell, a photograph."
- It was good enough for Felix... it's good enough for me.

A SITUATION WITH AN ABUSIVE FATHER AND A VULNERABLE KID
IS GONNA MAKE YOU ANGRY.
"THAT CAN BE MOTIVATING, BUT IT CAN ALSO BE DANGEROUS."
"WELL, SHE'S A LOOKER."
WHAT'S THE STORY?
HUSBAND RAN OFF WITH HER KID.
"YOU ALL RIGHT, MIKE?"
I'M GONNA FIND THIS GUY.
FACTS ARE THE HALLMARK OF A GOOD FALSE IDENTITY.
IT'S HARDER TO CREATE HISTORY THAN IT IS TO ALTER IT.
"PLUS, THE MORE TRUTH TO YOUR LIE,"
THE EASIER IT IS TO REMEMBER.
"I DON'T SEE YOU FOR WEEKS,"
AND YOU START GOING THROUGH THE CLOSETS?
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?
WHERE IS THAT BOX YOU USED TO KEEP ALL MY STUFF IN?
THE MEMORY BOX?
SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT.
I DON'T REMEMBER.
I'M KIDDING.
EXCUSE ME.
"OH, GOD, LOOK, HUH?"
FIRST PLACE.
"GOD, THE TROPHY WAS BIGGER THAN YOU WERE."
"COULD WE SPEED THIS UP, MA?"
I NEED MY MEDICAL RECORDS AND MY BIRTH CERTIFICATE.
ALL RIGHT.
- Not for idea.
"Yes, yes."
- Not gonna happen.
"Strength, me dia."
"Then, Mr. Duncan Lloyd..."
Are you serious?
- Only when I can not breathe.
Did you really recognize that border guard?
A few years ago I made a film about Balkan beauties.
How do you speak Serbian?
- I've been here during the war.
We have a problem.
It must be from civil war.
"- No, there were floods."
Do you see all those locked woods there?
Water has passed.
A nice nuisance.
This is not a scene with a destroyed bridge.
It is a scene with a very different obstacle.
An obstacle to me and my past difficult.
Duncan!
Duncan Lloyd!
It's me!
Dragan!
OMG.
"What the hell are you doing here, man?"
I?
What the hell are you doing in my Serbia?
Get your camcorder and movie.
"Dragan, brother."
- Duncan the Beone.
My friend.
"""..."
"Even holy waher cannoh whihen you."""
How do you know that poem?
Our teacher recites poems to us from time to time.
For homework?
No.
He recites and I learn them.
You must be a good student.
Yes.
Well done!
What grade did you get in the third term?
We haven't finished our exams yet.
"In the second term, then?"
Twelve.
And the first term?
Ten.
When do the exams end?
They start today and go on for two weeks.
- Good luck.
- Come in.
How is she?
Who?
- You don't know who I mean?
- Mrs Malek?
She's so-so.
What does that mean?
She's still in bed.
"She doesn't eat, she doesn't speak."
"Wait, I'll fetch it."
Here.
Just a second.
I'm tying my shoelace.
Yeah.
"Oh, I'm sorry."
But I can't work like this.
"So, you're going to have to choose."
All right.
Then I guess I quit.
Thank God.
"Well, call the station manager, and tell him to find somebody else."
"No, I quit you."
I quit us.
"Monk, stop crying."
I don't know where she is.
It's going to be okay.
No.
"No, I can't, Monk."
I'm at the gym.
"No, you don't want to come down here."
Believe me.
There are naked people here.
Look.
I tell you what.
I've got to work late tonight.
Why don't you come by the office?
Good.
Okay.
See you then.
"Hello, everybody."
I'm Natalie Teeger.
Who's ready to make lotto history?
Our super jackpot is worth $212 million.
Why did I make her choose?
Of course she'd choose to leave.
Good.
"You haven,t eaten, I hope."
- Nice trip?
- Us?
"We got lost at first, but after that it was easy."
"Here,s the paperwork."
"CIaudine, Jean-MicheI, against the wall, please."
Very good.
Now undress.
"That,s right - undress."
"Lab coats off, shoulders against the wall."
"Jean-MicheI, tell us how you met."
Me or...
"Sure, CIaudine."
"At some friends, dinner party."
"I hadn,t really noticed him."
"But at a certain point our eyes met,"
",cause we were both bored."
- You were bored?
- Yes.
THEY WERE BORED.
He smiled and then -
"It wasn,t Iove at first sight, but..."
I was surprised when he called me afterwards.
",We got to know each other, Iike in the song."
What song?
By Hugues Aufray.
could you sing it for us?
"No, not Iike this."
REFUSES TO SING
- How about you?
"- I don,t know it."
Why do you ask?
Might she remember?
Did you put this in Regan's bedroom?
She's going to be well?
"Karl, if you put this in Regan's bedroom, I want you to tell me."
"Now, did you?"
"No, not me."
I didn't.
This was under Regan's pillow.
Did you put it there?
"Of course, I didn't."
I didn't put it.
"Excuse me, madam."
What?
-A man to see you.
-What man?
You're a very nice lady.
-Thank you.
-You're a nice man.
I'll come back when she's feeling better.
"No, she was heavily sedated."
It's serious?
"Yes, I'm afraid it is."
May I ask...?
We still don't know.
Watch out for drafts.
"A draft in the fall, when the house is hot, is a magic carpet for bacteria."
"Excuse me, madam."
Anything else?
"No, Karl, we're fine."
Thank you.
It's all right.
I can always make a new one.
I'd rather lose my engine than seeing it misused by a villain.
This is it.
Here I go.
"I do this and this, and then..."
"Professor, here we come!"
"Oh, no!"
Ouch!
Ouch!
Ouch!
Wait!
"He has the devil's luck, indeed."
Did you see that?
Two planes are leading.
Mac's and Hudson's.
Everybody's here.
Dear!
Helen!
Here.
Congratulations on your victory.
"Congratulations, Mac."
Thank you very much.
I owe my victory entirely to your kindness.
"No, it's due to your excellent engine."
Or perhaps to Mrs. Hudson's lunch basket.
"Oh, that may be right."
I wished I could have asked Professor Moriarty how he liked the dessert.
I bet it was the bitterest cake he had ever tasted.
Ouch...
Shall we raise our glasses?
Cheers!
"Professor... we completely blew it, didn't we?"
The humans barely put up a fight.
"Yes, your majesty."
"Give the word, and I'll send in the second wave of xborgs to finish them."
The special weapons I've developed will assure our victory.
"I wish I had a device that could locate your lost brother, Vrak."
Thank you.
But we must assume
Vrak fell in battle.
"We will avenge my brother's destruction, and claim Earth as our own."

"So then this Miss Elvina comes in, she must have been 100 years old, and I tell her, I say,"

[voice fades]
♫♫
Zelda.
Zelda?
Oh.
Did she get what she wanted?
I hope so.
I beat it out of there the minute Roger got back.
I'm sorry.
Sometimes I...
I get goin' on a story.
"Not at all, John."
I like it.
It speaks to your general enthusiasm.
"Well, I do have that."
I have something else.
My pin.
"You know what this means, right?"
I surely do.
"Where is everybody, Mama?"
I'm here.
I mean Daddy.
Rotary Club.
"All right, then."
"Well, Zelda, baby, how is everything?"
What?
"Just, you know, wondering how everything is?"
"You are so bad at faking' things, Mama."
"You know, don't you?"
A foreign lab?
"Actually, no."
"Garcia, isn't Annandale where Morgan and Hotch are?"
That's not a gas main explosion.
Please pick up.
Please pick up.
Please pick up.
"Yeah, it's Morgan."
Hello?
"Garcia, can you hear me?"
We saw the explosion on TV.
"Yeah, I know."
We lost a S.W.A.T. agent.
"Oh, God."
Don't worry.
Don't think you're gonna get rid of me that easy.
Do you need anything?
I know who to call if I do.
"Thanks, baby doll."
They're all right?
Yeah.
We lost a S.W.A.T. agent.
Son of a bitch.
Sorry about Kenny.
"Yeah, me, too."
The chatter was a set-up.
They knew we'd be listening.
They led us straight here.
Just tell me you know where to look next.
Not yet.
They're okay?
We were right about the trap.
"Three, judge."
"Thank you, judge."
Three for the judge.
Ten dollars.
I'll let you off with a light sentence.
Pair of nines.
Pair of dogs.
"I didn't know you had a twin brother, judge."
"All right, Brock, the door's open."
"It's temporary, anyhow."
"Who opened it for me, Bill;"
I suppose I ought to say thanks.
I don't know the party.
Ho!
[playing piano]
"Brock, you're home."
"Papa, Brock's home."
"Well, were you still as lucky;"
"Oh, sure, I'm always lucky."
"-Stop that, play something else."
-Like;
"Well, anything but that funeral march."
Play something with people in it.
Can't have a funeral without people.
Have dinner;
Yeah.
Ate at Bailey's place on the way out.
"-Brock said he was lucky again, Papa."
-Really;
That's funny.
-Looks to me like the boys took him.
-They tried.
Hold me.

"(Danny) Uh-oh, back that shit up."
Enrique mento!
"Hey, Mike!"
Want to bat?
"Come on, Mike!"
Yeah...
Yeah!
Remember how we used to do it?
"Hey, he's gonna mess up the whole flow of the game."
"Dejalo, dejalo..."
Come on.
That's gonna throw everything off.
"Danny, just throw the ball, dude."
"Man, he's gonna take my spot."
All right.
"Remember how we used to do it in little league, right?"
"Choke up on the bat, put your shoulder into it."
"Come on, throw him a nice juicy one so he can smack it!"
"Yo, what if he hits a home run?"
"Yo, just shut up and throw the ball, B."
Okay.
"Ponsela, ponsela!"
"Come on, Michael!"
"Esta seria, aqui."
"Go, go!"
"Go, run it out!"
"Run Michael, run it out, run it out!"
Run!
"It's okay, that's okay."
"That'll be a buck, thank you."
Oh.
I got it.
- Thank you.
- Yeah.
"Well, pretty good shooting, Billy."
"Hello, the house."
Anybody home?
[man] Come on in.
I'm in the kitchen.
"Hi, perry, how you doing?"
Saw you drive up.
"Just fixing myself something to eat, come on in."
It smells great.
- You hungry?
"- No, I just ate."
"Uh, what are you cooking?"
"Uh, sit down."
How do you like the place?
"You haven't been over here since Daddy died, have you?"
- No.
- I fixed the place up.
Cost me an arm and a leg.
"Well, I'll bet it did."
"I'll tell ya, things are gettin' so expensive,"
I don't know what I'll be able to afford.
I don't work.
maybe I need a secretary.
I used to love canned peaches.
I can't afford 'em anymore.
No way I could buy those.
Where's Stu?
Does Kim know about this?
Yeah.
From you?
I haven't had a chance to talk to her myself yet.
"You square this with her, Chase, you understand me?"
Just make that right.
And get back to me as soon as Nina gives you anything.
I will.
Are we up yet?
Yep.
"Video's piped in, voice analysis, vitals, transcription."
- We're all set.
"- Nick, do you copy?"
"- Yeah, I read you."
- We're ready to go.
"All right, recording to hard drive now."
"So, Tony's doing this?"
Yeah.
Is that going to be weird for you?
What do you mean?
Didn't-didn't he and Nina go out?
Yeah.
We set?
Yeah.
All right.
I want you to do a hi-res on her eyes.
She's tired.
We might be able to pick up a tell.
Okay.
"So, we all right?"
Yeah.
We're fine.
"Look man, you don't have to be nice to me cause I'm going out with Haley, okay?"
I'm not.
Team sucks on a day without you man.
Ask Whitey.
I'm trying to avoid him.
That's cool.
Do what you got to do.
Usually do.
Am I hallucinating?
Did I just see you talking to Lucas?
"No, he was trying to talk to me."
The whole nice guy thing's wearing kind of thin.
You want to walk to English?
"Actually, I think I'm gonna cut out of here a little bit early."
Wanna join me?
Are you serious?
"Yeah, why not?"
You up for it?
"I can't, Nathan."
Alright.
"Well, look, I gotta get out of here so I'll catch you later."
Okay.
You know what?
Catch me now.
- Oh My God!
"- Nice, huh?"
"So, are we trying to get killed?"
"I told you, my dad's in Charlotte, it's okay."
I've never seen you like this.
Now you have.
- Let's go inside.
- Okay.
"Let's start by analyzing that drug of yours, shall we?"
"Oh, yes."
Of course.
Would you like some tea?
"Oh, thank you."
"Oh, no, thank you."
Would you like some?
No.
Are you sure?
It's very good.
I said no.
Maybe some biscuits?
I baked them myself.
Stay away from me!
Ronon!
It's all right.
It's okay.
"They hate me, don't they, father?"
No.
"No, no, no."
They just don't know you.
Was that really necessary?
"You can dress her up and teach her table manners, but it's not going to change who she is."
"Teyla, this is Sheppard."
Come in.
"Go ahead, colonel."
Is Ellia still in the cave?
Yes.
Has she been there the whole time?
Yes.
Why?
They just found another victim.
Guess he wasn't a person after all.
"V, Cash said that you took the money."
That's not true.
"I, I believe you, but... you got to tell Waltzer in person."
Um...
"T ell me where you are, and I'll come to you."
V?
Got to...
"Oh, shit."
Got to get out of here.
Okay.
Oh!
Excuse me.
"Sorry, excuse me."
Thank you.
Who do I need to find?
What am I doing?
"Uh, Dad."
Dad.
Find Dad.
"Um, excuse me."
I'm looking for Frank's father.
He's a teacher here.
"Oh, what's his goddamn name?"
"His name is, um..."
T om.
"T om, that's his name."
...the edges on the sedge.
That's one of the ways you can tell-- sedges have edges.
"Now, if you look at the composition of this soil closely under a microscope, you could see traces of thousands and thousands of years of evolution."
"Thanks, Mr. Wheeler."
"You're welcome, Nate."
- You changed your mind?
- They saw your gun and your wire cutters.
What can I say?
Hope is contagious.
- But Death Valley...
- We have a plan.
"We, uh... cut the phone cords and the power to the watchtower lights first."
- Safer in the dark.
- George!
Wait.
Danny.
"Danny, I'm sorry, lad, but we can only take five."
I want to help.
No.
Stay inside.
Stay safe.
Lifted it from the guards' latrine on cleaning duty.
What's it for?
Protection.
I won't allow it.
"Don't do anything daft, Danny."
How long does it take the guards to reach the far side?
Two minutes.
"OK, then."
"Two minutes from now, we run."
"Go, go, go."
Cut the wire!
Hey!
What are you doing?
_

Let's get a drink.
Thanks.
Excuse me.
This came for you earlier.
And your wife called.
She said to call her back.
What's wrong?
A guy wants to see you.
He's drunk and he has a shotgun.
Who are you guys?
We're police.
We heard you wanted to see us.
Put down the shotgun.
"No, you guys aren't cops."
We don't sleep in uniform.
Put that down.
- Wanna see my badge?
- Stay back.
I'll show you my badge and you put down the shotgun.
It's not loaded.
I only wanted to talk.
I'm sorry.
Beatriz was my girlfriend.
He killed her.
He killed Adela too.
He chops them up and dumps them in the river.
That's why they only found the foot.
What foot?
It was her shoe.
I gave it to her.
She said she was coming back.
Back from where?
I'm so sorry!
"- Don't worry, Jocelyn."
How do you know my name?
I don't know.
"This is Paul Rochester, Deputy Art Director."
Hello.
Have a nice tour.
Thanks.
Well... you go...

- Where to now?
- The Beauty Department.
"- What, what is it?"
- Whore!
- Who?
- Whore is here.
- Roxane Rochett?
"- Not that whore, the nail enamel!"
- Whore!
- What does it mean?
"It means fuck me, but respect me."
"Worship my body, but the upkeep is going to be costly."
"Stripe me, spurn me, treat me as your Spaniel."
I'm your dog and I'm gonna break the leash on you!
"- Calm down, Cornelia!"
Arf!
Arf!

Just transports me to a dirty corner of 42nd street.

"""You were always my little boy."""
You really were.
Maybe we... we were blessed that...
Please don't go.
Please don't leave me.
I can't do this on my own.
"Dad, I'm scared."
What's gonna happen?
I don't know.
"Oh, God, Adam."
I don't know.
Dad?
Nina!
Nina!
"- It's OK, it's OK."
"All right, all right."
- What does he need?
"I'm sorry, Adam."
I think he knew it was gonna happen.
That's why he came back to Wales.
He wanted to die here.
- This is it.
I'm on my own.
"- Oh, no, you're not."
You and Nina are just dealing with a problem.
That's all I am to you.
"Look, I can't pretend to know how you're feeling, cos personally I haven't been through it."
I know.
You're just a kid.
"Yeah, but, whatever you're feeling... you can tell me, I'll listen."
We have been looking for you.

This is Factionless?
This is insane.
Tobias.
Mother.
(WHISPERING) I thought she was dead.
Me too.
Someone please tell me what's going on here.
Tobias' father was very abusive.
I knew the only way I could ever truly escape him would be to disappear completely.
Abnegation helped me fake my death.
Anything to protect Marcus' image.
But you just left him there alone with Marcus?
I was very young-
I reached out to him about a year ago.
I felt it was finally time to reconnect.
(LAUGHS)
- What the fuck?
- Come on!
"Down, set, go!"
TTD:
"There it is, right there."
"Put it on, quarterback!"

"- Dude, run!"
Y'all take five.
Good play.
Take five.
- Come here.
- Where the hell are you throwing?
"Sorry, Rick."
You know what a skinny post is?
"Why the fuck are you throwing it so high, man, and behind me?"
"Man, we don't even call plays at my school."
School?
What you... you in...
what school you go to?
- Miami-Dade High.
- You in high school?
- Get the fuck out of here.
- Really?
I'ma really kick your ass if you don't get to step...
Get out of here.
"T, you ought to be ashamed of yourself."
"We got Amendola, Gronk, and Edelman working with Brady."
On the road.
At the edge of town.
- Did they have boyfriends?
- No.
Is it true they wanted to leave town?
- Who doesn't?
- I don't.
- You're lame.
- And you're jealous.
Okay.
- Did they ever say where?
- Anywhere is better than this.
"- Any friends with a white car, a Citroën?"
- No.
It's Quini.
- What?
- Her boyfriend is outside.
Can we go now?
You can leave.
- Your son?
- The youngest.
He's in Germany.
He's been working there for two years.
I have two more in Barcelona...
- ...and my daughter's in France.
- Can you tell me what you saw?
On the bend.
That's where it stopped.
- Did you see how many people were in the car?
- No.
- Were they forced into the car?
- I think they knew each other.
I don't have time for this.
"I am sick, damn it!"
I'm the one that is out of time.
"Jacob, I am dying."
You have to stay and do what we have decided.
- Nothing has been decided.
- Anna will need you.
And Helene...
And the boys...
"They're so young, Jacob."
"Look at me, Jacob!"
Don't you see that there is a point to all of this?
"You have a responsibility here, Jacob."
Do I have to live on the other side of the world to get your help?
"Hi, Anna."
It's Jacob.
Would you please call me?
I need to speak to you.
Call as soon as you can.
I'm leaving now.
I have to go take care of my hubbie.
Anna?
Is something wrong?
- Can I sleep here?
"- Yes, of course."
"Anna, what happened?"
There.
- Hello.
"- Mrs. Shaw, it's Jacob."
"- Hi, Jacob."
Want to talk to Pramod?
"- No, just let him sleep."
I want to come with you.
"No, out of the question."
"You don't want to, Helene."
It's sons and their father in the woods.
Or else they'll turn out gay.
Promise to use a life vest and water wings.
And the boys too.
- Bye bye!
- Bye.
Hi.
- Can we talk?
- What do you want to talk about?
- We could start with Jorgen?
- Stop already.
Listen.
Can I come in?
Thanks.
- So talk about Jorgen.
- Can we sit down?
We could find a chair.
This is fine.
May I sit here?
Okay...
Did you know Jorgen asked me to administer a fund?
- No.
What fund?
- It's aid work.
With Anna.
- You'll run it with Anna?
- With Anna.
"It's a very generous offer, but he's dragging things out."
I want to know what's going on.
Took me a Iong time to understand that rhyme.
J. D.
"Hey, come on, J. D."
(speaking spanish)
What are we gonna do about Mundo?
"He's young, he's weak."
"But I think we ought to let him in, show him the way, you know?"
Órale.
(speaking spanish)
Come here.
Give me your hand.
"You know what, ese?"
"White Fence, Maravilla, Lomita, they've been around a lot longer than us, you know?"
It's cool.
(SPEAKS spanish)
"We're finally getting into our own, you know."
Gaining respect.
(SPEAKS spanish)
"Our families, that's all we got, ese."
(SPEAKS spanish)
J. D. :
"When we were kids, belonging felt good."
"But having respect, that feels even better."
SANTANA:
"You know, La Primera lives through us, ese."
It gives to us.
It is us.
"We make it, carnal."
"We don't fake you, we just take you."
'Cause La Primera's ese.
J. D. :
"Always has been, always will be."
Now tell me his name.
- Are you interrogating him?
"- Yes, I am."
Don't you dare!
He's dying!
He's got blood in his lungs and they're filling up and there's fuck all in here that I can use to stop it.
I can still hear all this.
"Okay, Dad."
Just relax.
Just keep calm.
Fine.
"Clare, what do you need?"
Okay.
I need something sharp to stab into his chest to release the pressure.
- That's fine.
I have a knife.
- That's no good.
"- A valve, I need a valve."
- I've got a pen in my back pocket.
"- Yes, a pen."
A pen will work.
- Here.
Okay?
Yes.
Perfect.
"Take that bit out, then slice off the end."
"All right, Dad, just keep breathing for me."
That's right...
I've got you...
I've got you...
- Are you good?
- All right.
"That's, please don't take that call."
"I've got to, booty calls."
"I'm looking for the truth, Mr Sugar."
Alan?
"Alan, someone who's smashed up the shop."
Mr Sugar?
"You got some sort of problem, boy?"
We've got some talking to do.
And I'm looking for the truth.
"Yeah, well, I'm telling you the truth."
You want to smash my shop up?
Not particularly.
"Let's smash, let's smash it up."
Let's smash it up!
Come on!
Come on!
Let's smash it up!
I appreciate you're a little bit angry...
HE LAUGHS
Have one!
Have one!
These are beautiful.
They're great.
What do you want to ask me?
What do you want to know?
Have a nice fruit salad.
One of your five-a-day.
Thank you.
Yeah.
You can eat them...
Why have you got it in for Cowell?
"Cowell sent his boys around here, did you know that?"
I can see you're attaching electrodes to the boy's chest.
What are those for?
"- What are those for, Dr. Ross?"
- Patch me through to County.
Dr. Ross has just asked me to patch him through to County General.
- You need a red key.
- Look out for the Lost Soul.
- Use the rocket launcher.
- Mount Sinai's shooting us.
- They're cheaters!
Get them!
- You do it!
- I need a bulletproof vest.
- Blast him with a BFG 9000!
"Look, his guts are all over the place!"
"Quiet, you guys."
This is County General.
Go ahead.
This is Chopper Five from Channel Five News.
We've got a Dr. Ross flying in a hypothermic kid.
- Doug Ross?
- That is correct.
"Hold on, Chopper Five."
"Mark, Doug is on a news chopper bringing in a hypothermic kid."
- What?
- It's on the MICN.
- What's he doing on a news chopper?
"- Look, there's Dr. Ross."
- Turn up the volume.
- Where's the remote?
"Doug, do you read me?"
"- Mark, is that you?"
Gone.
They've gone.
Where'd they go?
To the mountains.
(dramatic music)
Allow me.
(laughing)
(whimpering)
"It's okay, Xiao-Mei."
"Spare me, I beg you!"
"Mr. Cheng, let me go!"
Let you go?
"You killed so many people, I'm putting you in jail!"
(triumphant Western music)
"Brother Jeng, you're going."
You will come back?
Just as soon as I can.
Really?
"Of course, and then I'll take you to see a doctor."
Take care.
Let's go.
See you!
See you.
Hello?
- 120 over 80.
"- Okay, Bob."
That oughta do it.
Good.
How's everything look?
"Everything seems fine: solids, liquids, triglycerides, cholesterol, blood sugar, E.K.G."
"Actually, it is one of the most boring physicals I have ever given."
France isn't there.
For three points.
Maybe look for countries.
Belgium?
No.
No...
No...
"Hungary, or...?"
What's the country?
It must be something?
"Yes indeed, it must be something, but you haven't found it."
I'm going to throw it over for a bonus point to the Araucarians?
"Oh, yes, I've got the country."
We think it's Chagall and...
Belarus?
Show me your first letters.
Let's see if you're right.
Yes you are.
Chagall and Belarus.
"Chagall, one of the leading artists of the 20th century, came from Belarus."
Settled in France.
Anyone know the town he was born in a Belarus?
Minsk?
Vitebsk!
"And whenever he did his paintings, he said, ""Whenever I paint,"
"""I'm thinking of Vitebsk."" Anyway, there you are."
"Araucarians, we're with you."
Reveal the hive.
One of them's oxygen?
Oxygen's not there.
I know.
Fluorine.
-In the back.
Gimme a bromo for my friend here.
"I'll take a small steak, two eggs on top some fries, juice, and a side order of toast...."
"Yes, sure."
Right away.
"Look out for that stomach, huh?"
Here we fix you up one second.
You'll feel much better.
Okay.
"See you, huh?"
We'll have your steak ready in a minute.
Where's my buddy?
"Oh, he left."
He left?
-What are you talkin' about?
"-Hey, what's a matter?"
You okay?
The guy drove off on me.
How are you gonna figure that?
"Oh, I think your steak's ready."
Thank you.
"Oh, no!"
-What?
-He took my wallet.
I left the raincoat in the car and....
I can't even pay you for this.
"Tell me, where you goin' anyway?"
-Down to L.A.
-Why?
I was goin' down for a job.
The whole thing's in the wallet.
-What kind of job?
Missed calls
- Shaman
What the hell?
What the...?
Hello.
It's me.
Where are you?
What about you?
Don't ask me anything.
You need to get to your daughter.
Now.
Tell me what's going on?
I'm at your place.
"Get back to your house, now."
First tell me what's going on.
L.
I misread the divination.
It's not him.
What are you talking about?
I cast the hex on the wrong ghost.
I saw a woman in front of your house.
I made a grave mistake.
"A terrible, terrible mistake."
It's not the Japanese man.
That woman is the evil spirit.
It was all her doing.
"So, go home now."
"I'm on my way there, too."
"Then""."
Who's the Japanese man?
He was trying to kill that woman in order to save people from her.
Understand?
"Gibbs, Lance Corporal Finn's fiancée's upstairs."
She saw a report on the local news last night.
"How, Doctor?"
"As soon as I know, you'll know."
Her name is Siri Albert.
"She's 25, lives in Manassas, and works as a physical therapist."
- Finn's fiancée is here.
I put her in the conference room.
- You did?
I did.
"No, I did."
His fiancée?
"Yeah, his fiancée."
Tall ?
Like brown hair ?
Red hair.
Someone has made a huge mistake.
James isn't dead.
He's been writing me letters from Iraq.
It's a common name.
"The news said he was born in Jackson, Pennsylvania."
It's a small town.
That James Finn has been dead three months.
He left for Iraq three months ago.
I saw him the morning he went away.
And I just got a letter from him last week.
He says he misses me and he's working a lot.
We'll need those.
"Okay, but I want them back."
It's his handwriting.
I recognize it.
They've been coming for months.
AndI 'mcomingforyou .
"Peace out, loser."
- He's at the Fun Zone.
Gear up.
- This ends tonight.
Uh!
- Ow!
"- Oh, sorry, babe."
- What were you aiming for?
"- Hey, got you a bag of Blue Rad-berry slushie for the swelling."
"I would've just gotten ice, but a possum died in the ice machine."
- Cool.
- Yeah.
- Why do we keep hurting each other?
- I don't know.
Maybe I'm overthinking it.
It just feels like we're not--
- On the same page.
- Clicking.
That was basically the same thing.
I count that.
- Yeah.
"- Look, I know this isn't the right time for some big talk, but I just-- want us to be normal again."
"- Yeah, me too."
- I hope you're a better kisser than Holt.
- What?
- Why did I say that?
- Why did you kiss Holt?
- I didn't.
I did.
"We did it to get out of jail, but it didn't mean anything."
"Just forget I said anything, right?"
Sculptor?
"Yeah, every family's got a"
Black sheep.
"Most families get, like, a"
"Retard, or a guy that likes to"
"Wear dresses, we got a sculptor."
"Yeah, retard, sculptor."
Same thing really.
"Yeah, there was a retard"
Sculptor.
60 minutes did a piece on him I
Think.
Yeah.
Really brilliant work.
"And he was real quick, too."
He'd make like one or two
Statues a day.
Only one problem though.
What was that?
He liked the taste of clay.
"So you're saying... yeah, he'd eat his own work."
"Goddamn, what a waste."
"Not really, you know every"
"Time he took a shit, genius."
"Ah, Lou."
"T, you and the probie go down"
"That way, Franco and I are gonna"
Head this way.
"What'd they say, 5 people on"
This floor?
"I said 5, 5."
Whoa.
What...
What is going on?
I needed to see you.
And this is how you do it?
Uh...
You abandoned me.
You walked away from me when I needed you the most.
- I'm sorry.
- That's not good enough!
"After the accident, I had to get my life together."
And what about my damn life?
It took me two years to get back on my feet.
You were the only thing that kept me going.
"Kaman, what happened to you?"
What do you think happened to me?
[Boy] Mommy?
Who else is here?
"Mommy, what's wrong?"
[Woman] That's my sister's son.
"Uh, go back upstairs, baby."
- Go back upstairs.
- Wait a minute.
Wait.
"He said ""Mama."""
"The boy's confused, Kaman."
Is that your son?
"[Tracy] No, Kaman."
Don't you stand in front of me and lie to my face.
"Kaman, drop it."
"You shoot me, I drop this, and they burn."
Then what?
"You move, you die."
For real?
Yup.
Do you want jumping rabbits in the background?
"Okay if the client wants it, I'll do it."
"Being in relationship isn't a waste of time, really?"
It is.
But I made my choice.
Actually it's quite fun.
I've learned new things.
Learned what?
Not telling.
I don't want to spoil anything.
Holding back on me now.
I've learned how to love.
How was that for a sweet answer?
But don't you argue?
It's a lot of hard work.
Surprisingly it feels good.
Weird huh?
So did you hit it yet?
Hell there's nothing to hit!
Rash: 0
Shit!
They're all gone!
Shit.
They're all gone.
So I don't have to go see the doctor anymore?
March.
I thought you weren't coming.
Why are you late today?
Well I couldn't sleep last night.
Oh!
(TIRES SCREECH)
Excuse me.
Suri.
(SIGHS) DI Orwell's here.
Why?
Our new chief called him in when you didn't answer any of my calls.
That's grand.
"Listen, Harry."
I deleted your text from his phone before Orwell got here.
- What?
- Harry!
You look like shit.
What were you up to last night?
Getting lucky.
We think this is Freddie Lau.
Owner of the London Green Dragon Casino.
DI Clayton knows who he is.
"Come on, Ben, let's give Harry some room, shall we?"
"- Do you want some notes, Chohan?"
- Sure.
I need a laugh.
- HARRY:
Strangled?
- Yeah.
Lau's PIN was one-two-three-four.
"Why are you texting a dead man, Harry?"
This is not going to affect our investigation.
- No.
That's not good enough.
"- You have to trust me on this, Suri."
"Jesus, Harry, we can't investigate a murder if you're considered a suspect."
You know I'm not a suspect.
"Hey, Bella."
Do you want to jump in bed?
Do you want?
OK then!
Zıplıyoruz bed!
See?
This place is not bad I said to you!
- What is Jade?
"- Hi, Mike."
"- Sculpture, where is it?"
- I told you I wanted to go.
So sendeymiş.
Wow!
You t.şaklıymışsın vulgar.
- I want $ 1 million.
- How about meeting me?
We'll talk.
"If I make it, die."
Statue when you die.
So I'll do this as follows:
I'll tell you the location of the transmitter.
Give me my money.
Then he'll tell you where to find the statue.
"You play a dangerous game, Mike."
You can not hide from me.
I promise you:
"The one you will not hurt, burn, Mike."
Do not have to do this to me.
Bring the money to the donor.
Then you get the statue.
"Okay, Jade?"
Look ...
I am king.
IMANDINKA GROWLSI
Do you realize that you came this close to hitting me out there?
"Gosh, Ed."
I'm sorry.
"-I'm really miffed, Alan."
-My mind wasn't on it.
I was thinking about that Donahue Show I gotta do tomorrow.
He's ruthless.
Ed.
Ed....
BILLIE:
"No, I don't want-"
- No--
-Just look at him.
"When they dragged him out, his face looked like a pizza."
"Come on, come on, he's right over here."
"Look at him, he's fine."
Hi. toots.
-Hey. you're not allowed in here.
-We've got passes.
-We're looking for Bull Shannon.
-Who?
He's a big guy.
Kind of weird-looking.
"All right, let's have your attention."
"Gents and ladies, meet the next wrestling champion of the world."
IWHININGI Hey. you promised me I'd be champ next.
"Don't get bitchy, Ed."
[NORMAL VOICE] I'm sorry.
I've been on the edge lately.
This new fabric softener isn't working out at all.
Now he wants to be mortal again...
To repay society for his sins...
To emerge from his world of darkness...
From his endless forever night.
Thanks for your help.
I appreciate it.
"Your name, please?"
Angie W.
"[CHUCKLES] Angie W., Tricia S., Tony D."
Don't any of you people have any last names?
"Look, I heard the gunshot,"
"I saw the fire, just like a hundred other people, all right?"
Can I go now?
"Yeah, yeah, you can go."
"Hey, but first, uh..."
"Can I bum a smoke, please?"
[LAUGHS] Sure.
Thanks.
I really appreciate it.
"All right, here."
Right.
Having a rough time?
"Nasty, nasty habit."
I'm handling it.
That's what they all say.
"Seriously, I'm just down to one a day, a pack a month, tops."
Really.
"And, um, how many more do you bum?"
"A few, and you must be Clara B., right?"
Clara Barton?
No.
Monica.
Let's go.
Hail Mahadev!
Look.
I've already been punished for my crimes.
Let's end this enmity.
For that one needs to kill the enemy.
Understand!
Go on.
Kill him!
Catch him.
No matter what color you paint on black... it'll still remain black.
Raghunath.
He's already slipped out of our hands.
And now he's out of Satyakant Shashtri's life too.
Shiv.
Listen carefully.
Satyakant has just one son.
And that's you.
And you.
Satyakant.
Get out of here.
There's no place for a murderer in Dharam kunj.
From today you're dead for me and for all of us.
You're dead!
You're dead!
Brother!
Brother!
Brother!
So Boss.
You should've called me instead uncle.
No no it's always the needy that come to the provider.
How can someone like you be sulking?
Thank God.
Idiot!
What's up bro?
"A busy day, huh?"
How is your aunt Shukran?
I want to visit heragain but she neverpicks up the phone.
She is still looking for a job.
I told her.
She could work here.
She can't...
Her new boyfriend is overly jealous.
Anyway...
Bitch.
Don't be late.
I hold yourroom free the whole day.
"Madam, it is every Turkish men's duty to serve his country as a soldier."
Yourson is no exception but he is a draft dodger.

That so?
Is cozier like this.
Isn't this nice?
What do you want?
Not a thing...
Can't a guy count his money?
Your guy got a pass?
Yes.
When you'd see him last?
Two months ago.
"Oh, boy!"
What a time you're going to have!
Where'll you go?
I don't know.
A hotel...
Here...
Thas for you.
What for?
I'd like you to stay in the fanciest hotel in town.
In the most expensive room.
With a bathroom for your smelly boyfriend.
Come all over a great big bed.
Order champagne on a silver tray and drink it in bed.
Sound good to you?
Yes...
But you have to earn it.
How?
I'd like you to nurse my buddy...
He's an orphan and he loves milk...
He'd enjoy it...
"- So let's sit down, and we'll..."
"- Nope, stay on up here."
Really?
Do one more scenario.
"Maggie, you're at your car."
You're fumbling for your keys.
- Okay.
"- Emma, attack."
"Uh, okay, um, Mags, let's just take it easy..."
- [grunts]
- Ah!
- [grunting and yelling]
- You're dead!
She's still alive!
"Keep it moving, keep it moving."
"- No, no!"
"- I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead!"
Why are you still talking?
"Yeah, that's right."
Dead men tell no tales.
- [yells]
"- Oh, God!"
You're dead.
And that's self defense... [softly] For moms.

Samantha.
"You've just--you've just grown up so beautifully, you know?"
- l have?
- Yeah.
You should see me.
I'm kind of goofy-looking?
Ha ha!
"Lucky for you, you look like your mom."
You think Mom was pretty?
"Yes, she was."
She was really pretty.
Do you mind if l--
What?
Can you lean toward me?
is that allowed?
Here.
You're not that bad.
"[laughs] I got both my eyes, my nose, my mouth."
[clicks] All my teeth.
"Me, too."
Yeah.
"Samantha, um, about everything--"
You don't have to say anything.
"Well, let me--let me-- l did this to you."
"And if nothing else comes of this, at least you can finally hear me say how sorry I am."
"I'm--l'm really sorry, honey."
[crying] I'm sorry.
She doesn't belong there.
"I mean, it's for retarded people."
She doesn't belong in that place.
Samantha signed a consent form.
- Do you understand?
"And Richard, you either tell me right now what's got your brother so riled up, or I end this goddamn thing right now!"
Tell him.
"Tell him, or I'll show him."
- Show him what?
- [Richie sighs]
She's a... a...
What she means  is that she's not a...
"Say goodbye, Reina!"
You're goin' home!
[grunts]
Ah!
[roaring]
What the... ?
So that's what you were tryin' to tell me.
That's not all.
[roaring] [grunting]
"Oh, this is some serious B-movie shit."
[gagging] [gun clicking]
Ah!
[Groans]

- What the hell are you doing?
Gotta take care of this son of a bitch old school!

"Just look at me, man."

Enough of doing it that way.
"All right,so..."
"Now, Claudia..."
Okay...
"Now, focus."
Don't just write it.
Believe it.
- No...
- Yes.
I will not disobay Arite.
How long you been working on that?
Since I lost my father.
"Artie, I'm sorry."
When did he die?
"Oh, he's alive."
I just hope that finishing this
Will help us find each other again.
Myka.
Yeah?
"So listen, I'm taking the girls out"
"For a little night on the town,"
"You know, which, in this part of South Dakota means"
Going for ice cream.
You wanna come?
I'm beat.
All right.
You want me to bring you something back?
You know I don't eat sugar.
"Right, butter pecan, caramel sauce,"
Chocolate sprinkles.
You all right?
Be a good girl.
"Whoa, Annie!"
Just the bars!
Alert the guards!
- Wake up!
- What?
The Thugs are here!
Why didn't you say so?
I'd like to get a crack at them.
What happened?
- Dacoits slipped in and stole elephant.
- What's that?
Thugs stole Annie.
Stole Annie?
They'll stoop to anything.
How many were there?
- Couldn't see.
- Where did they go?
- The hills.
- Sound assembly.
"Sgt. Ballantine, pick 16 men and follow me."
"MacCheesecake, if this is another of your tricks..."
Fall in the remainder!
Put every man on guard duty!
"- Very good, sir."
"- Steal Annie, will they?"
I'll break every Thug's back in India!
"Din, are you sure you're on the right trail?"
"Yes, sahib."
"Here is the bridge, sahib."
- Is this bridge safe?
"- It's safe, sahib."
The worst for me.

A respectable girl who wants the worst.
"Does this suffering, we like to suffer."
And in theater you really have?
"The try, hear, I will help you."

The proper thing to do would be to finish him off quick.
Unless he has a chance of pulling through.
(SCOFFS)
Pulling through?
You saw what that grizz did to him.
He'll be dead inside an hour.
Mmm-hmm.
"Yeah, we all will be if he don't quit wailing like that."

I'll hold him.
Go.

You mean like this?
Yeah.
Where did that come from?
My spa treatment.
Cupping.
Cupping?
Yeah.
"You know, I thought it was gonna hurt, but honestly, I snoozed through the whole thing."
"By the time I woke up, I was down two dress sizes."
"Before the cupping, did you eat any pudding?"
Darn tootin'.
Licked the bowl clean.

"Donna, do you remember who did this treatment?"
"Oh, yeah."

I was scared by the lightning and Stan hasn't gotten home yet and I just didn't want to be alone in the house.
When do you expect him?
He didn't say when he'd be back.
I'm terribly sorry.
"But as you probably know, Lynn and I are concerned about Stan."
I had a feeling that something was wrong with Stan.
A hunch.
So I drove out to see if everything was okay.
- I'm sorry.
"- Of course, I understand."
It was nice to see you again.
"Bye-bye, Lynn."
"Douglas, what is it?"

"You and I met the other night at the fair, remember?"
My head still hurts from the gin.
- How did you get here?

See anyone go in or out of the farmhouse?
I don't like that place.
Nothing but ghosts around.
Can I go?
- How much do you get for Bambi?

"What is it, Haribhai?"
I was terribly sorry... to hear of your mother's death.
When?
Oh yes... just now!
"She's dead, isn't she?"
Absolutely!
But that's an old story.
There's something new.
She's here.
Who's that?
Aunty!
I know that.
How did you know?
You told me just now.
Didn't you?
Damn it!
I speak a lot!
So what's the important thing you've got to discuss?
How do you know I had something to discuss?
How?
You didn't tell me.
Neither did Haribhai.
But I know it.
And how?
The fact that you're here means it's important!
First drive the Gujju out.
I'll go away.
But I must tell you something before I leave!
"You know I'm a widow, don't you, Jai?"
What is a man who loses his wife called?
A widow?

"What's wrong, Nathan?"
Somebody you know?
He's my father.
Hyah!
NATHAN:
How much further to Eagle Bend?
Town's just over that rise.
We should take a look before we ride in.

"Can't do this, sheriff."
"No disrespect, judge, but this is my town."
-Looks like a hanging party.
-Let me see.
To the right of the water tower.
NATHAN:
That's my father.
"Now, hold on, Nathan."
No sense riding into a lynch mob without a plan.
Let's do this together.
Come on.
Enough of this.
We don't need a trial.
Let's go.
Somebody grab some rope and tie up his hands.
-The man deserves a trial.
-l can walk. I'm a free man.
"Yeah, you're free to swing."
Get a rope.
Tie up his hands.
That's not living.
Okay.
- Call me when you get home safe?
- Mm-hm.
Okay.
"- Bye, Stefan."
- Goodbye.
Don't look at me like that.
- Are you crazy?
"- Save the lecture, look..."
Damn it.

From 1864.
They were in the tomb.
Yeah.
About that.
Matt.
- Matt.
"- I don't wanna hear it, Mom."
"Matty, please."
"Do you know what I was doing tonight, Mom?"
I was having fun.
Trying to forget about all the crap that I have to deal with every day.
Just enjoy a night with my friends.
"And then, there you are."
"Wasted at the bar, where I work, by the way to pay the bills that you don't pay."
And then you're off acting like a freaking kid?
Hooking up with some guy half your age.
"I'm the kid, Mom."
You're supposed to be responsible for me.
"I know, Matt."
How was your night?
"- You know, mooning about."
"Daydreaming, singing to herself."
"You haven't noticed, hmm?"
"Oh, well, I..."
- Sebastian?
- Hmm?
I know you've been keeping something from me.
[Gulps] Keeping something?
About Ariel?
- Ariel?
"- In love, hmm?"
"[Whimpers] I tried to stop her, sir!"
She wouldn't listen!

They are bad!
- They are trouble!

What about humans?
Humans?

"If you wish, all you want is yours."
"Now, go."
Bye!

"You know, when everything goes wrong running away is not the solution."
Okay.
Need to find itself a way to solve.
-Right.
-All right.

You can not dance or fly but when you discover is all yours.

"Yes, that's okay."

"The world is changing, Bill."

- He's with his mom in Budapest.
"- Where's Budapest, in the Negev?"
"She's in school there, pest."
If you married her she wouldn't have left.
But like an idiot you told her you're bi.
- 'Cause I'm not a liar.
"- ""Bi"" my ass"
There's no such thing as bi.
"What is it, a bivalve?"
"What are you, an oyster?"
Go ahead and laugh.
Budapest...
Everyone there is anti-Semitic.
- They closed them.
- Closed what?
"The concentration camps, didn't you hear?"
"Just you wait, what was, shall be again and there's nothing new under the sun."
- Hello.
- Hello.

You're so unreasonable.
Let me do my work first?
Only 2 photos left and I'm done.
Shit.
I can't breathe.
Hey body.
"You really mean to get back at me now, right?"
Bring it on.
I'm not afraid.
Death is a natural thing for me.
I used to think we should all design our own funerals.
I want my funeral... to not be at a temple.
It can be in this room.
Just a nice coffin and flowers.
I like TK a lot.
Never seen them live.
I would want them to sing at my funeral.
I want them to sing the song 'Handkerchief'.
It's a hit song so everyone can sing along.

"- What's your name, doctor?"
- Doug Ross.
Dr. Doug Ross from County General.
Just minutes ago Dr. Ross rescued a boy from a storm drain.
"Marcia's a very pretty girl, isn't she?"
Oui.
"Yes, sir."
"That's what frightens you, isn't it?"
"Why no, sir, I..."
You're afraid I'll become interested in Marcia.
"Why well, if you..."
If you want to...
What?
!
What?
!
You're not very clear.
"Well, sir, I..."
Oh.
"Oh, you poor child."
"I'm such a tease, aren't I?"
Such a tease.
"Yes, sir."
What a lucky man I am to be loved this way.
But supposing I did have to leave you for a while?
"Leave, sir?"
When?
"I'm not saying when, I said ""suppose."""
Well...
Supposing I had to take a trip from time to time?
You...
You mean... soon?
"Well, now, I don't know."
"Oh, you mustn't look so worried."
"It won't be for a long, long time."
"Oh, I see."
-Whoa Anthony--
He's a big boy.
He knows what he said.
What'd ya say?
"Funny, how?"
"Just, you know."
You're funny.
Let me understand this.
"Maybe it's me I'm a little fucked up, maybe."
"But, I'm funny, how?"
Funny like a clown?
I amuse you?
I make you laugh?
I'm here to fucking amuse you?
"What do you mean, funny?"
How am I funny?
"You know, how you tell a story...what?"
"No, I don't know."
You said it.
How do I know?
You said I'm funny.
How the fuck am I funny?
What the fuck is so funny about me?
Tell me what's funny!
"Get the fuck out of here, Tommy."
Motherfucker!
I almost had him!
"You stuttering prick, ya!"
"Frankie, was he shaking?"
"I wonder about you sometimes, Henry."
You may fold under questioning!
What the fuck is it with you?
Who is this?
Look at that.
Get in!
-Son Son.
-OK.
OK.
"Come on, boy."
Come here.
"Lu, what did you say this guy?"
Nothing.
He said you told him I I killed a woman and a child from that type.
What?
It's the same thing for you.
You're supposed to be representative Act.
What is this shit?
Fuck off.
Both.
Have you two last words you want to say to each other?
"Toni, I think it should be to kill them now."
"It will be tough for them outside,"
Since they will not know how to handle them.
Maybe Ray is killed while resisting arrest.
Came home late at night...
Burglar could kill him.
"Uneasily with you, boy?"
Get up!
You look uncomfortable.
I'm sorry.
What?
-I'm sorry.
-What did you say?
"I will not kill you, son."
I would never betray you like that.
You're right.
"You're right, I'm sorry."
I...
I'm losing my mind.
It's all right.
We're partners.
We figure this out together.
You know what you are?
You're a nurturer.
Me...
I couldn't even keep my own little dog alive.
Little shit.
"All he needed was some food, a place to take a dump, pee."
Me?
"I just take, take, take."
So I have to take this.
Just...
Don't start crying.
Okay?
And don't kill yourself.
- Hey.
- Have you met her yet?
- Who?
- Audrey.
Your date.
Do you usually meet them first?
"Grace, if you want me to call this off..."
No.
I'm just curious.
"Sometimes I meet them, sometimes I don't."
Just seems so strange.
- Stronger.
- What?
[Scoffs] Michael Jackson couldn't have handled those.
Where'd you get those?
Will it show up on the test?
Will these narcotics show up on a drug test?
- Hey.
- What?
"Seriously, why don't we do this more often?"
- Okay.
- [Laughs]
[Knock on door]
"Uh, lieutenant, you got some visitors."
They're early.
My sister has ruined more nooners for me than the rest of the world combined.
You had a lot of these growing up?
How do you think I put myself through med school?
[Laughs]
"Come on, aunt Hallie."
It starts in five minutes.
"Uh-oh, what do we have here?"
VIP guests for the parade?
- Aunt Hallie!
- Hey.
"- Hey, Viv."
Hey.
- How ya doing?
- Can't complain.
- Good?
"- How's, um--how's your mom?"
- Viv.
"No, it's fine."
Put me down.
Put me down!
Henry.
"They underestimate you, okay?"
Let them get close and then engage.
Engage!
No.
Henry!
Fight back!
Come on!
"No, stop it!"

Stop it!
- What?
- Stop it!
- Estelle...
No!
"You're a fucking rabbit in the headlights, aren't you?"
It's all right.
I'm not here to hurt you.
Is your speech module installed?
Shit.
"Well, at least we know you're not deaf."
"It's all right, you can put your hands down now."
3 years I've been waiting for this moment and I get Charlie fucking Chaplin.
"Fuck's sake, come on!"
"All right, let's have a look at you."
"Open the glove box, please."
Take out that whole contraption.
You gotta untangle the wires.
Is that a wedding ring?
Are you... are you married?

"Me, sir."

Give it back.
"Under Major Hogan's orders, I held Torrecastro long enough to effect an uprising."
I deemed my duty done and thought it prudent to return to await further orders sir
"You did damn well, Sharpe."
Napoleon will be in a fearful rage about Torrecastro.
Heads will roll.
Morale will suffer.
Which is all to the good.
"Because next month, I mean to cross into Spain and give Marshal Victor a damn good thrashing."
Pity about James Rothschild.

What do you want me to do?
"If you kill them,"
Boss will reward you handsomely.
"Before I do so,"
I want to get my hands on So Seo-No that wrectch.
"As you wish, Commander,"
I just want to get rid of them.
"Then I'll leave this to you, Commander."
Have a safe trip.
-Let's go.
-Yes.
Are we really going to kill them?
"If what he said is true, if he really is a Prince of BuYeo"
We'll get into deep trouble.
Capturing So Seo-No is our first priority.
"Han-Dang that rascal, I'm going to kill him."
Really?
Is that true?
"Yes, it is."
"Besides Ju-Mong, we have Oh-Yi, Ma-Ri, and Hyeop-Bo too."
We might even have a chance of nabbing So Seo-No.
I'm...
I'm...going to be rich!
"Eh wait, why am I still sitting here?"
I'm off to tell Prince Young-Po the good news.
-Han-Dang...

"What can I do for you, gentlemen?"
Anything!
Just tell me

"- This afternoon, an associate of ours offered you $10,000."
You should have taken it!
Wait a minute.
This is in regards to what's-his-name?
Badger!
Brandon Mayhew.
The uncle.
That was your guy?
"No offense, guys, but I don't take bribes from strangers, you know?"
Better safe than sorry.
That's my motto.
- But I'll take your money!
Sure!
- No.
"That offer's expired, yo."
It was kind of low anyways.
"But okay, okay, I'll take it."
Not what I'm saying.
And I'm sorry that I said that about Anna-Kat.
And I'm sorry that I missed so many things when you were younger.
- Mm.
"- You know, like that weird, um, break-dancing thing."
- Mm-hmm.
- It was always so important to you.
"Well, it's never too late, Mom."
Okay?
Okay.
Unh!
Unh-unh!
Unh!
Wow.
Mm-mm-mm!
That's something.
"All right, why don't you help me get out of this thing, and then we can go downstairs and enjoy ourselves before Viv's happy pills wear off?"
"I mean, where did you get this thing?"
"Oh, I visited Ruth Jackson in the home."
- Mm-hmm.
- And this was in her closet.
- Mm.
- That woman doesn't have a clue.
- No.
"- Half the time, she goes to lunch nude."
Thank you for your gift earlier.
- Oh!
- It did the job.
I've got gobs of them.
I'm really glad you came.
Wow.
These pills are powerful.
An error ..
"Lord, you mistake."
I was in the bathroom.
There I got the message.
What message?

Bad guys don't turn that down.
Okay?

What are you doing?
Watching my girlfriend.
I got some bad news.

You're a coward!
Admit it!

You fool!
"Don't turn around, I told you."
What if I do?
You wanna bite me?
"Of course I won't bite you, but if you don't leave in 5 minutes, you're done!"
Because the car's going to explode.
You think I'm a fool?
Can't I get out in 5 minutes?
"Oh no, not 5 minutes, but 5 seconds!"
5 seconds?

Get out.
It's been a long time since we were in the bath together.
That's disgusting.
I feel like getting out of here right now.
You're blushing.
You're shy?
Your skin's so thin?
Who's the one that wants to get out?
- Tell me clearly.
- Shuddap.
When we were bathing together while you were young didn't you like to put your legs like this?
- What kind of joke was that?

You're early.

- I know I switched it off.
Maybe he did something while I was out of the room.
An oversight.
Won't happen again.
The incoming signal must have interfered with the upload sequence.
Every synapse in his brain lit up at once.
Then went dead.

You said he shouted something.

Do I have a reply?
Nothing else?
Well.. she couldn't care less about who were you dating.
That she only cared about when you're with me.
And that she weren't calm we I'd leave.
What does Clara mean by that?
I want to meet Luisa.
Do you want to know how is she?
-Yes.
Luisa sings.
Does she play the guitar?
I don't think so.
Why not if she sings?
She doesn't sings modern songs.
She sings opera?
-Yes.
She's studying.
She haven't performed yet.
Then Berta was right.
She's much younger than you.
She is exactly 23 years old.
Much younger than mom.
And even younger than Berta!
He's 18.
He's studying economics.
He's 5 years older than you?
And what do you talk about?
Dunno.

Why not?

"-You're gonna marry him, aren't you?"
"-Oh, my God."

Don't be silly.
Of course not.
Where did you ever get an idea like that?
But you like him.
Of course I like him.
"I like pizzas too, but I'm not gonna marry one."
You don't like him like Daddy?
"Regan, I love your daddy."
"I'll always love your daddy, honey."
We have to come up with something.
It won't be easy.
He'll think of something.
"Come, I'll help you."
I'm sure he would've taken us to the embassy in Sofia.
"No way, Louise."
The Turks may take offence at the King's frolic.
It may result in a diplomatic incident.
He would've taken us to Istanbul to avoid a scandal.
We are going home.

It's just a shame that Orwell got him.
- How do you ever know?
- Know what?
- If someone's right for you?
- I don't know why you're asking me.
"I, er, suppose you just do."
"But when you do, make sure you hold onto it."

- Are you OK?
- Yeah.
"- Ben, are you hit?"
He has a nose like a damn bloodhound.
Yeah?
Has he ever caught you?
Yeah.
Many times.
"Well, listen."
Since I already lost my deposit and all maybe we should light up.
"No, thanks."
You sure?
"Well, is it cool if I burn one?"
Maybe you'll change your mind.
"Do what you wanna do, I guess."
Hey.
What'd I say?
Nothing.
I just have to go is all.
What's this?
My 18-month chip.
I'm in recovery.
"And, you know, pot is like stepping stones."
Recovery?
That's cool.
Right on.
I respect that.
"You know, I don't really burn much anymore."
It's just a sometime thing.
"But no more, like, in the house."
So you wanna go grab some dinner?
I could really go for some Chinese.
"No, I better hit it."
We...
We cool?
What?
Maybe there.
"Let Ricky talk, and you take a good look."
Yes?
"Excuse me, are you Mr. Maurice Leon?"
Yes.
"Sorry to disturb you, we need your help."

- We're looking for...
Give me the photo.
Do you know this woman?
"No, I don't know her."
Sorry.
- Why are you looking for her?
- We aren't looking for her.
She died three weeks ago.
Are you sure you don't recognize her?
"No, I'm sorry."
I can't help you.
You'll excuse me.
I don't think I've ever seen him.
Are you sure?
Did you see how he reacted to the photo?
- How?
- He trembled.
Didn't he tremble?
- What are you doing?
- Knocking.
- What for?
I told you I can't help you.
What do you want now?

INTERVIEWER:
What's happening here?
We're gonna set a man on fire.
INTERVIEWER:
Why?
Because it's cool.
INTERVIEWER:

Because the school has blown up.
It's nothing serious..
- Hey...
I want the answer.
- Sir...
He had been taking photos of the women coming to the restaurant discreetly...
A customer noticed it.
He was caught.
"When everyone started hitting him, he escaped."
"If we report it to the police, our restaurant will get a bad name..."
So we handled the situation and let it go.
Where is he now?
Is nobody there in the neighbouring house?
"No idea, Sir."
The guy who was working at Beach Walk restaurant.
His name is Dinesh.
It's him.
Yes.
He was working in some hotel.
- Where is he?
"I don't know, Sir."
He should be somewhere around.
Thanks.
(boys chattering)
"Sorry, Sir."
Please throw the ball.
I just said sorry.
"Throw the ball, Sir."
"Oh, here you are!"
Met him?
They came searching for you.
"Hey, stop!"
Hey!
It was a dark and stormy night...
Gingy?
My girlfriend kicked me out.
"You know, something about me being too into myself."
You?
But you are so adorable.
"I know, that's what I keep telling her!"
"I need a good woman, Muffin Man."
"I can help you, Gingy."
How about this one?
- I don't know.
- You like her?
No.
Weird hair.
- How about this one?
- Too skinny.
No!
Don't like it!
OK.
"Well, how about this one?"
Yes!
That's it!
She's perfect.
The girl of my dreams.
Wait.
More sugar.
But that is not the recipe.
"Trust me, Muffin Man, this girl's gotta be real sweet."
I want someone who will love me forever.
"I must warn you, Gingy."
No one has ever made cookies with this much sugar.
You are tampering with forces far beyond your comprehension!
"Porter, have you heard of her?"
Exactly.
Nouveau riche.
"- Excuse me, Gunther."
- Mm-hmm.
- What's down that way?
- That wing is forbidden for a woman like you.
Oh.
This way.
This is a... this spot's reserved.
"- Oh, anywhere is fine."
- Oh...
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
"If you need any... anything at all, you..."
Oh.
Thank you.

I apologize for the unorthodox introduction.
I'm Dr. Cairn.

"- Oh, yes."
The institute is...
lovely.
- I'm happy that you're pleased.
You may be feeling stress.
So... this tonic may calm your nerves.
How are you responding to the tonic?
- I feel better already.
"Blair, we gotta help her."
"We're gonna help her, but we can't help anyone until we get a signal."
It's gonna take two seconds to get our-
- Both of you stop.
Blair's right.
"Connor, shut up."
I'll help her.
Riley and I got this.
"Hey, what?"
No.
Right?
Fuck it.
Let's do it.
We're staying together.
Just go find a signal.
Go.
"We'll go, we'll go."
No.
Wait.
The door.
Spirits.
"Oh, no no no."
Connor!
Yeah.
Are you okay?
"Yeah, we're fine."
"Look, we're gonna, we're gonna figure out how to get her out of that thing, then we'll find a way out."
"Just, find a signal."
"No, we're not leaving you."
"Blair, just go find a signal, okay."
"We gotta go, we gotta go."
We'll be back.
- Nitrous?
"- Yes, please."
No.
More booze for me.
Seems all right?
"""Seems"" being the operative word, mate."
This will cheer you up.
"Shame Felix can't be here, he's always talking about you guys."
Really?
Yeah.
"I mean, you're his friends, right?"
"Yes, we are his very, very, very good friends, aren't we?"
Good old Mr. Felix.
"So, tell us about Chile."
Musta been a big decision.
"Uh, the family thought it would do him good."
Toughen him up finally.
Make him big and strong like his big brother.
"Oh, my God."
You have to feel this.
"It's like a rock, Gemma."
You'll have to excuse her.
- She isn't house-trained.
"- No, seriously, come on, have a big..."
- I'm so sorry.
- That's all right.
I'll sort it out.
My God.
Go on.
"Oh, sorry."
"Hi, there."
You've got a lot of scars.
What?
That woman...
What woman?
The one whose house burned down...
I knew I'd seen her before.
It's that naked woman from last night.
What?
The woman who was standing here last night.
Crazy fools.
They didn't burn to death.
They were stabbed.
All three of them?
Yeah.
"Freaked the hell out of me, too."
Prime suspect is the missus who hung herself.
What the heck happened?
Beats me.
Over here.
In here.
What?
Give us a hand.
A little more.

Idiot!
Don't touch it with your bare hands!

"It's going to take the two of us, all right?"
- You're right.
- Okay.
"Come on, Gray!"
"Oh, man."
You got my boots wet.
"Jefferson, you did it!"
"We did it, man."
"Gideon, take us back to Rip."
Damn it!
I wanted to be the one to kill him.
"Again, I mean."
Um...
I don't think our problems are over yet.
I'm on it.
On what?
It's not working.
The radiation buildup is too progressive.

There's going to be music here soon.
Their music?
Yuck!
I want Macarena!
"Sing the song you sang the other day, aunty."
Not today.
I have an irritation in my throat today.
No one sings a song when we assemble for it!
Yes.
Some can't sing and some have a bad throat.
Sharma!
You can't even speak!
How will you sing?
"You sing a song, aunty."
Yes.
"Sing for us, Laxmi."
What was that?
Pali or Sanskrit?
"Explain the meaning of the song to us, Laxmi."
Very well.
It was fun...
I see you wearing that for the first time.
You look great.
"Is it only for today, or..."
"Don't get excited, aunt."

I would have if you had cooperated.
What else you want to do?
Choose the material.
I'll take the piece on your hand.
Cut it.
I know you're the Demon Tailor!
Why do you want to kill me?
My Big Brother Tam King is angry with you.
Can you tell Mr. Tam?
"I want to be his friend, Liang Foon!"

It's difficult to clean.

Can you tell?
"- She's a frigate, sir."
"Hear that, Mr. Scott-Padget?"
A single frigate.

Beat to quarters!
They think it's a safe road.

"When I was a kid, a tenement on our block collapsed."
Buried some people alive.
"From then on, every time I passed that spot,"
I believed I could always hear them moaning and crying for help.
You through there?
Get started upstairs.
"Why don't you go to bed, Stan?"
Why should I?
Because you make me sick to my stomach.
Douglas...
"All right, Stan."
"You've had enough, let's go."
Mr. Gordon will excuse you.
Let's go.
Excuse me?
Do you think I had too much to drink?

I-I--
I didn't mean to!
I didn't know!
You see?
"The contract's legal, binding and completely unbreakable... even foryou."
"Ofcourse, I always was a girl with an eye for a bargain."
The daughter ofthe great sea king is a very precious commodity.
But I might be willing to make an exchange... for someone even better.
"- Eric, what are you doing?"
"- Grim, I lost her once."
I'm not gonna lose her again!
"Now, do we have a deal?"

Sometimes I think your mind is its own.
"Tell me, what is beyond the school?"
More-school.
-And then.
"There is nothing beyond the school, a school are endless."
Everything has an end.
"See, I'm here."
And it's not a happy ending.
"It makes sense, Bill."
If I swim to the opposite of the school end up coming ...
At the end of the world.
Very well.

But she asked about you.
What did she say?
She said:
"""I'm looking for your partner."""
Those were her exact words.
- Is that all she said?
- No.
"She said that roses were dead, and violets were too."
She's fled after that and that's the end of it.
How long have you been here?
She's taller than I thought.
"How long have you been here, Daze?"
I can't really tell.
"Time is bend up now, so I don't know."

What's that?
"Oh, that?"
That's his.

What do you mean?
There's something very strange about him.
"God, I don't know how to explain it."
At first I thought it was just a crush.
But...
I think that Mikey's in love with me.
He's only nine years old.
"He's not normal nine-year-old, Rachel!"
"Jessie, you're upset."
You've had a huge shock.
Rachel!
"Would you listen to me, please?"
- Mikey said stuff.
- What stuff?
That David was being punished for killing Rosie and that now I could love only him.
I think that he killed David.
Jessie--
"Rachel, listen to me!"
Your son is dangerous!
"If there's something wrong with Mikey,"

Someone who knew what they were doing.
No signs of a struggle.
Clean shot.
It's professional.
I've got another question.
Where's the tenth piece?

"I tell Chicky, ""Hey, there's no hard feelings."""
"You know, it's worth a thousand to get my wheelchair back."
She gets me in touch with her friends.
SlPOWlCZ:
I don't care what happens to them.
"But if they're hurt, you'll wind up either dead or in jail."
- So what?
"- So your room is bad, jail's worse."
"- Well, that leaves dead."
"- No, I don't want that."
I've seen too many good men go down.
Do you want a drink?
It's on the house.
"I can't, Ernie."
I'm a drunk.

Robbie.
"Hey, Sonny."
"Tell me, boy or girl?"
I got a son.
"That's great, man."
Let's go see the family.
Why don't you have a drink with me first?
The doc wants them to rest up for a little while.
Everything okay?
Everything's all right.
"Julia, she's just knocked out, though."
She was in labor for 15 hours.
You're kidding me.
I'm not kidding.
How's the kid?
How's the kid?
He's great.
Black Jack.
That's terrific.
How much did he weigh?

-Got torn.
I only stitched it together.

Yes
Where is the chef?
It's one week since he left for hometown.
Then what about this vada?
"Well, he made it before leaving."
Oh!
Damn you all.
Why did you leave the table?

Yes I am Das.
Haridas.

-I am Karthik.
-So what?
- I am a lawyer and I need a house for rent.
A lawyer?
- You look too timid.
Can you raise your voice?
"- Yes, I can."
It's very difficult to find a house for a lawyer.
It's quite a nice old place.
At least the roof doesn't leak.
"To your health, my lord."
And your delightful family.
(Lord Meldrum) Thank you.
Do we eat this or is just for ornamentation?
"Give it to Foster, he'll crawl up it."

Oh.
"Yes, of course."
Erm... been in any good pubs lately?
"You see, my Olive doesn't like me coming home breathing beer fumes."
"You can't blame her, can you?"
That's the soup gone up.
If he's involved...
I said no.
I'm not going to rest this entire investigation on a glance.
"Maybe he was looking past the photo, through the wall, down the street to a church to ask God what in the hell he did to deserve this torture."
"What then, Dr. Ryan?"
I'm done.
Get Wickes in here.

"Phil, they think it's you."
Are you involved?
No.
He believes him.
You?
Yes.
(door opens)
(sighs)
Wickes say anything else?
He signed a nondisclosure agreement.
"Oh, so he's being cooperative?"
I've enlisted in the Marines.
-Why didn't you come to us?
-What do you mean?
-Pop managed to get you a deferment.

"And the witness, Mario De Santis, for the crimes of forgery, impersonation and resisting arrest."
"Quirino, they're crazy, where are you?"
I've nothing to do with it!
"I'm Mario De Santis, and he's De Santis, Mario!"
"Wretch, then it is true!"
- Ben and Mike.
- Mike?
- Jade trying to kid.
- He should be.
Someone else could not.
"- This is true, and I go on and kill."
I will not have to do that.
I'll do.
- Let me find a statue of a she.
- Here's what I want to say.
- You got your passport?
"- Yes, sir."
I always forget mine.

"We wanted to ask if you once made a film, a movie with Isabelle Moretti."
I didn't make anything.
And now I'll ask you not to disturb me.
If Mom were alive I'd strangle her.
Are you sure his face...
- I've never seen him.
- He has an Arab accent.
- Cut it out.
- Why are you pushing?
I'm fed up!
"Mom had an Arab accent, too."
"She came from Algeria, not some kibbutz in Sweden."
So what?
So she's an Arab and he's an Arab and so are you.
- Are you cursing me?
- Yes.
"And I'm an Arab and he's an Arab and we're all Arabs, okay?"
Now lay off.
"Get down, he's coming out."
"- We lost him, damn it."
- Where are we?
- Where to?
- I don't know.
Sir?
Sir?
I'm calling an ambulance.
I'm starving.
Where are your sandwiches when we need them?
Maybe that's the doctor.
About time.
It's not the doctor.
"Oh, yes."
Even in Hawaii we're famous for our gardens.
It's right around there.
"And for our weddings too, of course."
Thank you very much.
You're welcome.
That was a fast answer.
Have you ever been married?
No.

What that has to do with my green card?
Ridiculous.

-Let's tell Mike.
Like he doesn't know.
"Poor kid. I tried to straighten her out. i mean, I really tried."
-l even prayed for her.
You believe it?
-Talk about last night.
"I saw her a lot, you know, maybe too much."
"Maybe I even loved her a little, even, you know, like..."
... takingcareof herand everything and making sure she was safe.
"-That kind of love, know what I mean?"
"-Last night, Mike."
ROBERTS:
What about it?
She died.
-When did you see her last?
Yesterday. I saw her with you guys.
You guys saw.

I'll do the thinking!

- Never felt better!
Good!
Let's go!
"Looks like we get home early, all right!"
"Hey, why don't you stop that?"
Cheating on yourself!
Good crowd!
Make a showing and you're in!
- Watch out!

- I knew I could take him!
"- Nice going, Luth!"
- Thanks!

The Lithuanian Angel against the Masked Mastodon!
Ooh-ooh
And it went allright
It went allright
It went allright
It went allright
Oh
So we walked out
Hardly speaking
Disappearing
In the night
Saw each other
A few time safter
But we never really got it right
We weren't lovers
Just brave strangers
As we rolled and we tumbled through the night
We were players
Not arrangers
And we jammed till the dawn's early light
- Just brave strangers
- Early light
- Just brave strangers
- Whoa-oh
Whoa-oh
Whoa-oh
Whoa-oh-oh

How come?
I have to work.
What about Lydia?
She doesn't need me anymore.
Have you split up?
You could say that.
Believe me.
I could see it coming.
"Don't ask me how, but I did."
"There was something in your relationship, forgive me, that didn't work."
When are you leaving?
"Very soon, but I'll see you before."
I hope so.
I'm sorry you're going.
"Hey, Rosa."
"Hey, Marco."
I'm off.
"Benigno, see you soon."
Yes.
"Rosa, goodbye."
good bye.
Has her period come yet?
Not yet.
Going by last month's nursing report it should have come.
"Yes, it is a bit late."
It's over two weeks.
That's too much.
Are you sure she had one last month?
I put the towel on her myself.
It was the week you had flu.
She even seems swollen.
"Yes, but at times they can be irregular."
Okay?
Mm-hmm.
Tell us what happened.
"Joe was coming on to me, and I told him no."
And Officer Taggot told him to get lost.
And all hell broke loose.
So who started the fight?
Joe...
I think.
Maybe it was Bobby.
I don't know.
It all happened so fast.
"Did Officer Taggot hit you or shove you at any time, even by accident?"
No.
No way.
It wasn't him.
How could you be so sure if it all happened so fast?
"'Cause Roy would never, never..."
Valerie?
"Okay, Valerie?"
Valerie.
Going down is much faster.
- You claustrophobic?
- Just a tad.
I'm scared of heights.
"We make a call on Sears Tower, it's all you."
You do realize they have an elevator?
- They also have stairs.
- It's 108 floors.
That's not my problem.
"A Polish, uh, mustard, and a jumbo."
There she is.
- Amy!
"- Amy, be careful!"
Go on!
"Get outta here, you hear me?"

Hey!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Go on!
"- Now, easy."
- Go!
Just go!
Come on.
Come on.
"Please, you have to leave."
"You broke your arm, Georgie."
Is it true you did it trick riding?
Or was it broken some other way?
You think I'm abused?
I didn't say that.
Why do you say that?
"Look, I know how the game goes."
"You people are always trying to put words in my mouth, trying to make me say things I don't mean."
"Now, that's not true."
I want you to feel you can tell me things.
You're in a safe place...
I'm not abused.
"Okay, I broke my arm when I was doing a trick riding routine for my aunt Crystal."
It was my fault.
I shouldn't have been doing it with her alone.
- Lou and Peter don't let me.
- Okay.
Stop.
What's wrong?
Stop.
"I don't want to hear any more of it, and put that back where you found it."
Why?
What's... what's wrong?
"You okay there, Duval?"
You said that I could do this.
"Well, now I'm saying you can't."
"Just because you don't talk about him, doesn't mean that no one else can."
I'm your father and I told you to put it away!
So put that thing away now!
[Cork rattles]
I know.
That was wrong.
I know.
I'll apologize to Gracie in a minute.
Did something happen at work?
Yeah.
No.
I...
Let me ask you a question.
"If Dad came back, right now..."
What would you say to him?
"Oh, my god."
It's happening.
"It's finally happening, isn't it?"
What?
What's happening?
"Well, you're letting in that Dad is gone."
He's gone.
He's not coming back.
I got you a key chain.

It's a Native American dream catcher.
It's supposed to keep all the nightmares out and only let the good dreams in to protect your home.
- It's flypaper for nightmares?
- Mm-hmm.
Let's keep it.
Yeah.
"Hang it where, the car?"
It's not much of a home.
Maybe it's time we get a real place.
Are you saying...
NEAL:
Why not?
We've been on the road long enough.
Maybe it's time to retire the Bonnie and Clyde act.
"Settle down, I think it's time."
Together?
Don't you wanna?
He was a foreigner too... a Frenchman.
She welcomed the kindness he showed her.
"But later, she was fired."
He lost touch with her.

No.
You have offered him flowers?
You've written him a poem?

That's a great proof of love.
"And you, champ?"
What is proof of your great love?
"It is you, florist Melanie."
Jessica is there?
"Whoo, yeah!"
You think the city's big.
It's huge!
And lots of naked ladies.
"If I had my own naked lady, I'd never leave my room."
"If you had your own naked lady, I'd never leave your room."
"So, hold on-- do you got the money?"
We got everything!
Whoo!

"Oh, no."
I want to go back.

Beautiful.
"Oh, my God."
Do you believe this?
"This woman gave birth to her own head, and it sang to her."
-Wow.
-Wow.
"Hey, Cash, where you going?"
You don't ask me that.
Never ask me that!
"Okay, I'm sorry."
I just forgot for a second.
"Guys, come here."
Whoa!
This is going to be tougher than we thought.
How do we tell a prostitute from everybody else?

It just occurred to me.
Try it out.
"If it works, I've got another trick."
- Just a little one.
- Could you open the door a little?
Well put!
It's all about opening the door and ringing the bell.
- Isn't that Mia's brother?
- Mads?
Yes.
"- Hi, Mads."
- Hi.
- Nice guy.
"- Yes, and one hell of a lawyer."
- Hi.
How was your swing?
- Fine.
I just bought a painting marketed as being mouth painted.
"John, listen..."
I've never done what you do.
I know.
Just ask him for the time.
"Or a light, or whatever."
You can do that.
I'll do the rest.
Do you want some fudge?
I've eaten tonnes.
I'd better save some for Manuela.

Yeah.
Can you...stop the car.

Are either of the kid's fathers gonna turn up to this dance of theirs?
Abby's dad sends money in a card each birthday.
"Rob's dad, nothing at all."
I could come if you want.
To the dance.
They'd love that.
"They think you're great, you know?"
Rob said you were cool.
Got some catching up to do.
"Like you said, you're not going anywhere, right?"
"They're good kids, Jess."
You've done a brilliant job with them.
I can't find my shoe anywhere.
I'll need it for the beach.

By all means.
Yes.

Yeah.
I know I've never tasted it before.
But there's something about the aroma I recognize.
Hey.
This is dog food!
Dog food?
!
Are you nuts or something?
"Yes, sir?"
"Box F, sir."
Right this way.
"Now, all together, boys."
Two pints.
"Oh, oh."
A tip.
"A tip, of course."
"Seven shillings, sir?"
Why...
- Why not?
"You work hard, don't you?"
"- Yes, sir."
"Bless you, sir."
"- You have a family, no doubt."
- Yes.
"Yes, sir."
Thank you.
- Did you hurt yourself?
- What the...?
"Oh, what a pity."
"You were thinking of the children, no doubt?"
"Now, have that barmaid bring me some champagne."
- Ivy ain't allowed to leave the bar.
- I don't think you understood me.
- What's all this here?
"- This gent here wants champagne, sir."
Champagne?
"All right, then, bring it, bring it."
- But he wants Ivy to serve it.
- Of course Ivy will serve it.
Go on.
We're just sitting here.
Let's go there tonight.
Let's make them pay for this.
"Sure, sure now we're doing drive bys."
Just like a fucking street gang.
Then what are we going to do?
I don't know?
I don't know?
"You know if you put your gun away, it will help you bury your cousin."
Italian
"wow, wow."
What did you call me?
"All right, all right."
Enough.
Enough.
What did you call me?
"Dino, dino."
"Dino let him up, dino!"
Are you listening to me?
Are you trying to kill him?
Shut up Vic.
"Yes, I'm trying to kill him."
I will kill him.
God damn it.
"Rudy just give the man what he wants, huh?"
Did I hear you say you were sorry?
Tell him?
Did I hear you say I'm sorry?
Did I hear you say I'm sorry?
Jesus Christ.
"Did I hear you say you're sorry, huh?"
I'm sorry.
More and more of the Germans.
Watch out for that Jerry!
I'm going to have to take a chance.
"Your pistol, Sergeant Major."
Thank God for the Navy.
Get down to the boats.
Come on there.
Hurry upl
"Come on at the double, get a move on!"
"Sergeant Box and his party, hurry, hurry!"
Get a move on!
"Don't play around in the bloody sand, you bloody fools!"
"All the other boats are loaded, Sir."
"All right, all away."
Take it away.
I thought you weren't going to make it.
So did I. We met a German destroyer outside the port.
"Here you are, boys."
Ta.
Thanks.
"Well, what was it like?"
"I don't know, very foggy."
The Germans?
"Oh, I couldn't understand a word they said."

"Yes, he's behind the screen."
"He's still under a sedative, so please don't stay too long."
Thank you.
"Hello, Corporal."
Who is it?
"Blimey, it's the Yank."
"-Lie still, kid."
Lie still;
Not while I'm still breathing in and out.
Lying still comes later.
"Not much later, though, huh, doc;"
"Hello, sheriff."
Somebody left a note for you.
Right side of you.
Brock.
"Your sister sends her love, son."
Good girl.
"Good, bright girl."
"She told me, Brock."
She told me why you ducked out.
"And, Brock, your mother..."
-...there's something--
"-Dad, let's go down to Charley's, huh;"
Let's drink all the boys under the table.
"And then when there's just me and you left, I'll drink you under."
Ask Charley.

He said you forgot.
"Graciously, but he said it."

"He thought it would inspire the guys to try a little bit harder but the other team's coach saw it, protested, and had him kicked off the team and they lost without him."
"So, maybe his name is not on a plaque."

"I have friends dropping over, too."
"Hi, Amy."
Hi.

Yeah.
This is Jack.
And we're Christians.
Oh.
Interesting.
Clementine is at the same college that Ricky and Jack go to.
"Hi, Clementine."
Hi.
I should be going.
"Oh, no, please stay."
Ricky's just getting John down to bed.
I really should be going.
Thank you so much for inviting me over and letting me meet you and John.
Ricky loves you both so much.
But the meatballs...
I have work tomorrow.
"Hey, it was nice meeting you, uh..."
It's Grace.
But where do I put it?
The pupil's gone.
Your eye just looks like a ping-pong ball.
I think it rolled up into my head.
"Look, just... just do the other one."

You look like one of those blind jazz guys.
Where are you?
I can't see anything.

I don't like this.

"Me and my brother's daddy was white, did you know that?"
"Of course, we never knew him."
He had another family.
That's why I kind of look white.
Because my daddy was white.
"You figured since I kind of look white, you could fuck me, what the hell."
"Because I was kind of black you could dump me, what the hell."

"Hi, Mr. Charlie."

"Ronnie, this is Ray."

"Give it to me, all right?"

"If you know something about Lila being here, you tell these gentlemen."
I don't want you being in trouble.
"No, ma'am."
I don't know nothing about that.
June Hawkins told me he was out last night digging frogs.
"Oh, really?"
- For who?
- Us.
"Good one, dangerous one in the Backstreet Boys."
Hey.
I could not believe you guys are here.
"When I was a kid, I humped all of your posters."
"Wow, really?"
Which one of us was your favourite?
OK.
OK.
Don't make a fool of yourself.
- Hey.
- These are my friends!
Anyway.
"Yeah, good one."
Almost beard to beard.
Nice.
No.
Justin actually wrote us a letter asking for a simple favor.
So...
"- Yeah, you're on, buddy."
"- Don't blow it, dude."
I won't.
Are all the Backstreet boys taking a poo together?
"Uh, Candace I, I believe that when you meet the person that you're supposed to of your life with, you shouldn't wait around."
You should just know it and go for it.
So with that said...
Holy crap balls!
"- Oh, my God."
"Oh, my God."
- I love you.
But it's not good.
There you are.
I had a dream about you.
Yeah?
Hope a good one.
"There was some kind of... disaster... nuclear, maybe, I don't know."
[muttering]
Seemed like the whole world was burned.
And I was looking for you.
"I couldn't find you, and I was..."
I was calling your name.
So not a good one.
You've been working too hard.
So why don't we stay in bed all day?
Order some food in.
Watch movies.
What?
What is it?
It's Sunday.
Yeah.
I know what day it is.
"Yeah, it's Marius' deadline."
Yeah.
"I know that, too."
"If you ruin Eddie's hands, you'll never get a chance to expose Mukherjee."
So you want me to give Eddie a pass.
Yeah.
"Hey, tell me something."
Yeah.
"I need to ask you something, and I want you to be honest with me."
Of course.
Do you still care about Marius?
That's what I'm thinking.
How did this happen?
"Last week, they're asking me to run the network, and tomorrow, I'm gonna be blowing guys just to get a job."
Figuratively.
Of course.
"For the record, I've never blown anyone for a job."
Impressive!
Mm-hmm.
"Oh, wait."
There we go.
"When I first started out,"
I gave a handjob to the head of development at nickelodeon.
Nickelodeon?

He was an adult.
"It's for kids, not run by kids."
Oh.
Right.
I suddenly had an image.
"Yeah, like I'd Jack off some 12-year-old for a job."
I really don't think I would.
Good.
Unless it was like some amazing...
Stop talking.
"Yeah, okay."
Good morning.

"Oh, I see dad wants some coffee."
"Mom, I have to go now."

"Watch out, God damn it!"
How many have you broken so far.

"Get away from me, you asshole!"
"Auntie, what do you find in that animal?"
That's exactly what I like in him:
The animal in my bed.
Take down those pictures.
I'm sure they drive him crazy.
"Well, he hates me anyway."
He can fuck off...
I'll kick him out soon.
Is this forthe rent?
It's been 9 months and I still don't have a job...

You dropped this in the Randolph Hotel.

I didn't miss it until I got home.
I wondered where I lost it.
"Won't you, uh, come in a minute?"

"Oh, it's all there."
All I wanted was the card.
I didn't mean it that way.

Alcatraz Season 1 Episode 6
Previously on Alcatraz...
Meet the '63s.
The worst criminals this country has ever known are coming back.
My grandfather wasn't a guard.
He was an inmate.
That's him.
"Tommy Madsen, he killed my partner."
Police.
So we have to find these '63s?
We need to find who took them.
I need you to watch them.
"You know, they're not so bad."
"Lucy, get down!"
Welcome to Alcatraz...
Dr. Sengupta.
"Thank you, Warden James."
"I don't know, Hauser."
Maybe the pirate life ain't for you.
No.
You want some ice?
"No, no, no, no, no."
But she was something special to me.
"I mean, everybody felt that, but she was."
"I wouldn't be won'th a damn today, if it wasrt for her."
And it was more than that.
She was my friend.
Hey.
"Take it easy, Ward..."
"Exactly what time did it happen, Lieutenant?"
"Last night, sir."
About ten minutes to nine.
Ten minutes to nine.
God knows what I was doing when she could have used my help.
"Alone in my room, probably, with some idiot script."
"You were not, you were watching the ballgame with me."
I was?
A ballgame?
(SCOFFS)
"Oh, God."
I hope I wasrt.
I was alone.
I hope I wasrt...
But you werert alone.
"Listen, Lieutenant, he's upset."
"He's nervous, you know?"
And he...
"Mark, for God's sakes!"
Will you stop it!
This isn't one of my shows!
This actually happened.
You knew he's gonna be here.
He's probably didn't expect me!

What's the matter with you?
Did you get bit?
Huh?
"Say something, dammit."
He's the criminal.
"You're scaring me, man."
Snap out of it.
It wasn't just one or two people.
He took pictures of them when they were alive- and then went back for more when they went crazy and died.
What the hell are you going on about?
He's the criminal.
That's enough.
I'll deal with you later.
I'm sure of it.
He...
He took his victims' belongings and did something with them.

You don't know what it feels like to be outside of everything.
I think you're scared.
"Duh, under it all, you're boring, like everyone else."
"Sophie's phone, leave a message."
What are you doing?
My job.
What are you doing here?
"My daughter, she's inside."
What's happening?
Why am I not informed?
I have a warrant.
We're seizing the Clios collection.
Sold to the gentleman in the back for 2 hundred thousand Euros.
Thank you all very much nd goodnight.
Thank you.
Christos!
"Christos, stop it!"
Stop it!

Would you fucking get it!
Please!
Please!
Neck!
Just find a vein!
Just fucking do it!
"You're gonna take yourself out, John."
You're gonna take yourself out.
Take a long vacation in Greece.
Pick up the law again.
Go the way of William O'Dwyer.
He fucked up and played ambassador to Mexico.
I'm not that ambitious.
"Then suck it up, and find some other way."
Listen to you.
I thought I'd see a boy's tears.
The tears are there.
Just can't see them right now.
"You got the stuff, Pappy."
I love to see it in a guy.

"Hey, who's got my hat?"
"Look, I'm Woody!"
"Howdy, howdy, howdy!"
Gimme that!
"Say there, Lizard and Stretchy Dog, let me show you something."
It looks as though I've been accepted into your culture.
"Your chief, Andy, inscribed his name on me."
Wow!
With permanent ink too!
"Well, I must get back to repairing my ship."
"Don't let it get to you, Woody."
Let what?
I don't...
What do you mean?
Who?
I know Andy's excited about Buzz.
But you know he'll always have a special place for you.
"-Yeah, like the attic."
"-All right, that's it!"
Unidirectional bonding strip.
Mr Lightyear wants more tape.
"Listen, Light Snack, you stay away from Andy."
So that I don't blurt something.
I would probably try to suggest that I'm peaceful.
Good afternoon.
Can we ask you one...
-One?
-I think we've already been here.
Only one?
!
Release me!
We come in peace!
From the galaxy!
-I'll give you galaxy!

You'll break my arm!
-You won't make fun of me!
-Rascals!
-Let me go!
-I'll break the door down with you!
- Let me go!
I'm not here for anyone's fun!
I've just finished a night shift!
-And they call themselves intelligent creatures!
-Calm down.
I'll tell you who they are.
-Aggressive louts.
-Calm down.
I won't stay here a minute longer.
-We are flying back.
-And what about our mission?
-What will we tell home?
-The truth.
Previously on The Vampire Diaries:
STEFAN:
"For over a century, I have lived in secret."
Until now.
"I know the risk, but I have to know her."
Johnathan Gilbert had an invention that was stolen by a vampire.
- Her name was Pearl.
- I gave your device to Damon.
Why don't you ask him for it yourself?
[SQUISHES]
Mom!
Mom!
Mama!
"My wife, Isobel, spent her life researching paranormal activity in this area."
- What have you done?
- I turned her.
- Why do I look like Katherine?
- You were adopted.
"This girl showed up, 16 and about to give birth."
- What else do you know?
- Just her name:
Isobel.
Stop looking.
She doesn't wanna know you.
She's alive?
Does that mean that she's a...?
[HORN HONKS] [ELENA SCREAMS]
ISOBEL:
"Hello, Ric."
Isobel.
It's good to see you.
You look good.
You are their son.
"What you are doing is wrong, wrong, wrong!"
Do you mind?
You're killing the romance in here.
"Well, it was a grueling two weeks, but you have your son back."
Ooh.
Mom.
Dad.
I missed you.
Aww!
[ Kissing ]

Huh?
Huh?

[ Laughing Continues ] Funny.
That was delightful.
Did you see that?
That mouse butchered that cat like a hog.!
Is all TV this wonderful?
"Um, I'd kind of like to go home now."
Like a hog!
I-
- What?
What was that?
"Mr. Burns, I don't want to seem ungrateful... but I want to go home to my family."
[ Sighs ] I was hoping I wouldn't have to tell you this... but I'm afraid your family doesn't want you back.
[ Stilted Speech ] I do not miss Bart at all.
"Quiet with those hands, If you are better than I,"
"Eh, is passing something here."
We are going to see.
"It quiets about that purse,"
"I have not made anything, Help,"
Sight as it beats.
Has done me one trap?
you do not understand it?
Help.
"You wanted to deceive to me, eh?"
displeased!
"They see here, pig."
For already with that purse.
"Wretches, you are not going to help me?"
And you also.
And you.
Displeased.
Antonio!
-Antonio?
Who is Antonio?
"-Damn it is, has called to the dandy."
-It quiets.
It quiets.
-Larguémonos.
They see here.
"-It starts, that comes the dandy."
"Damn bastard, children of puta."
Children of grandísima puta.
I am going to kill them.
-You have seen what they have done to me?
-What have they done to you?
You know them?
Abduct the mandible.
- I need to sit down.
- Don't move.
- V-tach.
"- All right, I'm in."
"Let go, Gallant."
- Charge is 200.
- Hyperventilating.
- Sats are 90.
- Clear.
- Sinus rhythm.
"- Okay, full trauma panel."
"C- spine, chest and pelvis."
"Gallant, why don't you go get yourself some air?"
Want a facial CT?
"Yeah, good idea."
Why don't we get a full head series?
Call RT.
Let's get a vent.
"Give him four of Ativan, seven of Pav."
"Nice work, John."
Bet that was a new one.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Look, I'm sorry."
I just thought I was gonna be sick.
It's better if you keep your head down.
It'll be okay.
"It just caught me by surprise, you know?"
Relax.
Take a minute.
"You know, sometimes I don't think I can do this."
-Oh!
Alice!
Isn't he a darling?
"- Oh, he's the most adorable thing I've ever seen. -(giggles) l-ls it all right if I pick him up?"
"Oh, sure, go ahead."
"Oh, I've never felt anything so cuddly in my whole life."
- Where'd you get him?
"-Well, Mrs. Manicotti went to the pound today to get a dog for her kids,"
-Mm-hmm.
So I went along with her.
I took one look at this character and I was a goner.
Did you ever see such eyes?
What kind of a dog is he?
"Well, he's a cross between a cocker spaniel"
-and a French poodle.
-Mm.
It's a...
"I guess you'd call it a ""cockerpoodle."""
Mm-hmm.
(cooing)
"Aw, Trixie, you'd better put him back in the box,"
-'cause I got to feed him now.
-All right.
There.
"Get a look at that, ""choice horse meat."""
- Horse meat?
-Uh-huh.
- Ew!
"-Oh, they must know what they're doing, Trix, 'cause the dogs are nuts about it."
Ah.
Is that gonna be enough for him?
"Oh, sure."
Are you gonna call me?
I'll call you.
"Unlock the door, Jenna."
I'm packing.
Come back later.
The house will be empty.
No.
You have to come talk to me.
Things are not going to end like this.
- Like I did this.
Move your foot.
- I panicked.
I made a huge mistake.
Fuck!
"Jenna, open the door!"
Michael?
- Is anything wrong?
- Everything's fine.
I locked myself out.
"- Jenna, you're having our baby!"
"- Yeah, well, maybe I won't keep it!"
"Don't you ever say that, Jenna."
Don't ever say anything like that ever again!
I can do whatever the hell I want.
"We're not married, remember?"
"- We're both free, just like you wanted."
- I made a mistake.
You're right.
"Too late, man."
Move your goddamn foot.
Hi.
"Hi, darling."
Okay.
"Thank you, Brian."
Thank you very much.
It's okay.
We're just gonna look.
My God.
Here you are.
We were just making sure there was adequate closet space.
Good.
"Well, this house is yours if you want it... but you have to decide right now."
We'll take it.
-Really?
"Oh, my God!"
You know what I kept thinking when we were looking at that house?
That we should get a mattress for that closet.
I kept thinking that it felt like a dream come true.
Come here.
- How fast can you drive this thing?
- Really fast.
Let's see.
Okay.
"- We bought a really, really..."
- Excuse me.
We bought a house.
We bought a big house.
¡Mary!
¡Mary!
¡Mary!
"Mary, are you all right?"
"Mary, talk to me."
Are you okay?
Can you hear me?
We can wear as many rings as we want on our fingers.
But women wear only one matrimonial necklace around their neck.
Laxi!
You're not in the mood!
But that's all right.
I'll await your answer.
And I'll wait for my husband!
...my God!
Aunty!
Here comes the detective for you!
"Hey, wait...!"
I've got to follow the woman!
Not the vehicle!
Watch where you're going!
Mister... does the dog bite?
No.
Out of my way...!
You said it wouldn't bite!
It's not my dog.
Laxmi!
Haribhai?

"Don't call me ""bhai"" (brother)!"
Anything else will do!
All right.
I have something important to say to you.
Of course.
Come inside...
No.
Keep walking...
"You gave me a rose, right?"
Did I?
Can't get better than that nοw.

"Fuck me, it's Τrudy."
"- Oh, Τrudy!"
- Rocky Sullivan?
- Yeah.
- Does he know I'm here?
- Sure.
Didn't you want me to tell him?
That's all right.
Send him in.
"Well, well, Rocky!"
This is a surprise.
- What do you hear?
What do you say?
- I had the date on the calendar.
I thought it was next month.
Otherwise I would've met you with a brass band.
"I thought it was funny you didn't show, but you've been busy the last three years."
You got a swell layout here.
Looks like you're in the dough.
"- Yes, only..."
"Well, you know Mac Keefer."
- Mac Keefer?
"Yeah, heard of him."
- He owns the town.
Can buy and sell it.
- Only he doesn't buy it.
He sells it.
"- That's soft, eh?"
- Softer than that store cot I've been sleeping on for the last three years.
"- Well, you're out now, Rocky."
- Yeah.
- Where's that dough?
- What?
The hundred grand?
"- Plus, he won the Civil War."
- What about Leo?
- What'd I do?
- As running mate.
Bartlet-McGarry.
- Done.
"- It's not absurd, you know."
- It is.
- It's not totally absurd.
"- Yes, it is."
- He wants your parking space.
- I really do.
- It's not totally absurd.
You have a good parking space.
"You know, if it weren't for the drinking and the Valium... ."
"- Yet, Grant... ."
- That's right.
"They told Lincoln, ""Grant's a drunk."" He said:"
"""Send my generals a case of what he drinks."""
- I see a 30-second spot.
- An alcoholic can't be vice president?
You really think the 20th century didn't see an alcoholic in the West Wing?
I'll be around.
"Hey, Leo."
- They didn't mean anything.
"- Yeah, I didn't take anything."
What's going on in Idaho?
The tunnel's still hot.
We're looking at evacuating Elk Horn.
"- Elk Horn's 20,000."
- Yeah.
- We've done this before?
"Emma is my daughter and my granddaughter, and Ritchie's sister and Ritchie's aunt."
"And if we had Emma, she'd be your daughter and niece, and Ritchie's sister and cousin."
What?
What?
!
Why are you doing this?
Why do you keep trying to make us have a baby?
!
I don't know.
I don't know why I'm doing any of this.
Who is it?
Is everything okay?
Richard told me you had diarrhea.
"Oh, God."
Should I put it on the board?
Get out.
Are you okay?
"Yeah, I'm fine."
I don't have... that.
What happened?
Why did you leave?
I don't know.
I just freaked out.
I had to come home and get it straight.
I charted what our family tree would look like.
- Looks confusing.
- Confusing?
!
"Connect the dots, you get a map of freakin' Alabama!"
Aren't you getting a little ahead of yourself?
"No, I'm not."
- Who's Emma?
"Full ten points, very well done."
Team Araucarians - are you ready?
I hope so.
I can tell you you will be looking for...
"You've two minutes, reveal the hive."
Right.
There's Kil...mar...nock.
Along the top.
"I don't think that's a red herring, because it's right in the corner."
So let's pick that one out.
Have you got Blane?
Is that Oban?
Let's try and think of small places.
"Dumbarton, is Dumbarton in there?"
No.
Is there Dun-anything?
Dumfries?
Dumfries?
That sort of works around that edge.
"Yes, it does, you're right."
Let's go for that.
Enter.
Cum...?
Cumbernauld?
Cumber...
"Yes, that goes all the way around there."
There's Ayr.
"No, hang on, Cumber..."
"Oh, that way, oh yes!"
"So, around there."
Cumber...
And then...

"Between you and me, the staff are concerned about you working for us."
- But so long as you're discreet...
- I'm sorry.
- I'm not sure I follow...
- Sorry.
I need to take this.
"Noreen, can you help Kitty get settled?"
Thanks.
Your office is this way.
"Not quite what you're used to, huh?"
"No makeup, no stylists."
This office is seriously lacking in glamour.
"Well, I worked in basic cable, so..."
Ooh.
- No glamour there.
No.
I don't know what it is.
Do you?
Not yet.
Now we are done here.
I apologize again.
For what?
Keeping me waiting or lying to me?
Both.
Good evening.
Sabine will show you out.
"Picked the wrong House to crash, Ma'am."
Chthon is pretty picky.
I was looking for my daughter.
She was there.
"A lot of people pass through them, Ma'am."
What's that?
An extract of garlic.
I'd say this is gonna hurt a little but I'd be lying.
I've always hated garlic.
This will be the last time you'll be able to smell it.
I promise.
"Oh my god, mom!"
What are you doing?
Get out of the way.

Huh... huh?
"Early this morning, a friend of mine got mugged."
I think they did it.
"A black man, this morning?"
You know anything about that?
"No, I don't know anything about it."
"Wait, no, wait... no, no!"
Uh...

I'm here to arrest Wong Fei-hung.
This doesn't concern you.
Step aside.
"Marshal, have you met Wong Fei-hung?"
Of course!
We've even fought!
You fought him?
Does Wong Fei-hung look like me?
"No, Wong Fei-hung is a young man."
"At most, 22 years old."
"If he were that young, he'd invite you for tea to celebrate."
Why did you call him a despicable cad?
Are you messing with me?
"Marshal, I'll be honest with you."
I'm Wong Fei-hung.
You're Wong Fei-hung's father?
"Wong Fei-hung, stay there."
But that didn't mean she had to like him.

Thank you for asking me.
Let's do it again sometime.
It was great.
Good night.

I wanted to get on with my life... but I just can't see him that way.
Why is that?

Tony should be into Dulles about now.
DiNozzo-- that's who's missing.
His father's flying in from London.
Maybe you'll see him there.
Or maybe not.
Airport's gonna be nuts.
"Actually, I'm thinking the snow might thin the crowds a little."
"All right, well, we'll see you guys."
Nice meeting you.
Your attention please--
Do not leave any baggage unattended...
Are you sure I was okay?
You heard Abby-- you were adorable.
"But that Gibbs-- I was babbling away about Turkey, and he's just looking at me with that look."
The Gibbs look.
Hello?
Did you think I was making it up?
You were great.
Really.
You okay?
You seem on edge lately.
The flight?
"No, no."
I'm good flying.
Okay.
"Just, um, I don't know, the holidays, I guess."
I'm fine.
Okay.
I KNOW.
I JUST FEEL LIKE I SHOULD DO SOMETHING.
YOU SHOULD.
YOU SHOULD BE CAREFUL BECAUSE SHE'S STILL OUT THERE.
[ CELLPHONE RINGS ] RIGHT ON TIME.
YEAH?
Evelyn:
Change your mind?
ENOUGH OF THIS.
"YOU WANT A DEAL, YOU DEAL WITH ME."
YOU LEAVE LUCY OUT OF IT.
Done.
Lucy has no more to fear from me.
"You see, I can be reasonable."
"Of course, I still have a job to do."
And the next target will have to be Sam or Fiona or... or -
- I know -
- Mommy.
"Sooner or later, I'll find someone you care about more than Doug."
So you call me when you want it to stop.
"SHE'S NOT LEAVING TOWN, IS SHE?"
THAT WOULD BE A NO.
Doug:
"IF SHE KNOWS ALL THIS ABOUT YOU,"
SHE'LL PROBABLY COME HERE.
SHE WON'T PLAY THIS OUT ON MY TURF.
SHE'LL KEEP THE PRESSURE ON UNTIL SHE GETS AN OPENING.
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.
"I'M A CPA,FOR CHRIST'S SAKE."
A CPA BROUGHT DOWN AL CAPONE.
THERE'S A REASON WHY THE FEDS WANT YOU TO TESTIFY.
I SAY WE HUNT HER DOWN.
- I don't know.
It's OK.
I've got my badges.
- Why?
"- Look, all I know is that... that there was a girl, some stripper who worked in Soho."
"Freddie Lau stole her from Grey, and Grey went mental."
- Kayleigh Fenchurch?
"- Stop the machine, I'm dying here!"
Come on.
"One last push, JC."
Huh?
"He was wearing a barman's outfit when he came in, wasn't he?"
Try the King's Oak in Chinatown.
Cough fit.
It's all the rage in LA.
I need to see Lily-Anne.
"- It's not gonna happen, Grey."
- Why?
"What do you mean, why?"
You're the prime suspect in her father's murder.
I need her help to get me out of it.
Time is running out for me.
Like it was running out for poor Freddie.
Either she helps me get out of here or they're gonna catch me.
And I will not keep my mouth shut.
All right?
- There you are.
"- Thank you, Stan."
Kevin Grey is now working in Kinzoku.
Lily-Anne Lau's karaoke bar.
- Who's that?
- No-one.
HOLD THAT THERE.
"WHEN I SAY,""NOW,"" YOU'RE GONNA OPEN THAT DOOR."
NOW!
"SHOOT A PROPANE TANK,"
AND YOU'LL JUST GET A BIG POT OF COLD GAS.
YOU NEED AN OPEN FLAME AND REAL GOOD AIM.
GET DOWN!
"YEAH,SAM, I HAD TO DRIVE AROUND,"
MAKE SURE WE WEREN'T FOLLOWED.
SHE COULD BE ANYWHERE NOW.
GOT TO GO.
WHAT'S HAPPENING?
WE'LL GET TO THAT.
I NEED TO KNOW WHY SOMEONE WANTS YOU DEAD.
IT'S A LONG STORY.
"WELL,IT'S A LONG STORY"
"THAT STARTS WITH GREENWAY CARGO,RIGHT?"
GIVE ME THE SHORT VERSION FOR NOW.
I WAS THE CONTROLLER --
"MOSTLY WROTE CHECKS, DID INVOICES."
IT WAS A JOB.
I'VE BEEN A CPA FOR 15 YEARS.
NEED TO GET TO THE MARKED-FOR-DEATH PART.
"AFTER A WHILE,"
I REALIZED I WAS PAYING VENDORS I HAD NEVER HEARD OF
FOR CARGO THAT WAS NEVER DELIVERED.
FRONT COMPANIES?
THEY WERE INTO ALL KINDS OF STUFF --
"WEAPONS,IVORY,HUMAN CARGO."
THAT'S WHAT THE FBI SAID.
"ANYWAY, THEY CAME TO MY HOUSE,"
"SAID THEY WERE INVESTIGATING THE COMPANY,INVESTIGATING ME."
Wiss Hey!
Can not you do something with this meal?
The food we had on the planet 64 stinks!
it's true.
it is prepared only once every 164 years.
When you destroyed that planet.
I told you I'm sick of this food!
Bills-sama.
End soon with that.
We reach the North Kaio planet in about 10 minutes.
Really?
Why?
!
Why Bills Ki-sama coming to this planet ?
!
Curse!
he's getting closer!
why are you acting weird?
G-Goku!
Are you still here ?

You do not have to go to Bulma's birthday party?
I do not really like parties... you lose friends!
I have also curious to know why you're acting so weird.
Me I'm weird ?
!

I'm strange.
strange.
I'm strange.
You really have something strange ... training or me ?
!
"the West Sitting Hall, and the president's bedroom."
"Killick, he's trying to burn the place."
Second floor.
Send your men.
Tyler?
Turn off the goddamn sprinklers!
Who makes this shit?
"Oh, shit!"
What was that?
I've been waiting all day to kill you.
Stop hurting my White House!
German mantle clock.
Empire style.
"Killick, report!"
"Killick, what the hell is happening?"
Report!
Killick can't come to the phone.
Where's my daughter?
Dad!
She's here with me..
"in the Oval Office, so why don't you come down and get her?"
What are you gonna do?
What do you think?
Why do you make all this shit personal?
"Oh, you're talking to me about personal.."
when you wanna blow up half the world for your kid!
What are you gonna do?
What I should've done in the beginning.
I'm gonna kill this prick.
Hey!
What?
You lied to all of us.
"So if she's a fucking head case, why do you even want to get involved with this one?"
I think she just needs some guidance.
And I've already had some sponsors asking about her.
- Who?
- Slaughter Water.
- Did you pitch Ryan?
"- Yeah, they don't want him."
He has an image problem I have to figure out.
Fuck.
Too fucked up for Slaughter Water.
How'd that happen?
Yeah?
- Hey.
- Hi.
Mario Goldsmith can be here by 4:00.
- Perfect.
- You did not.
I'm just gonna apologize to him.
I'm gonna smooth things over.
"You know what, I don't even care."
Just keep rubbing my feet.
Enjoy your meal.
Welcome to Patty Palace.
Can I take your...
Order?
[Sighs]
Terry:
I'll take a triple cheeseburger.
- [Cash register beeping]
- Extra onions...
And chili.
And...
- A tantalising invitation.
"- David, please..."
"Drink up, darling."
"- You'll be packed and ready, won't you?"
- You needn't worry.
I'm ready now.
Good.
Daddy.
"Mother, I apologise for David."
He finds it difficult to be with people now.
- You understand?
"- Of course, darling."
- My poor girl.
- No.
I'm all right.
We're all all right.
"Aren't we, Tom?"
"Aye, indeed we are."
"Well, goodbye, Mistress."
These are for you and your husband.
There's little enough to eat in London at the moment.
"Thank you, Tom."
"Thank you, Tom."
"Come on, Tom."
He's drunk.
- Is he always like that?
"- Most of the time, but he's a good friend."
"Any time you want to come home, you and Jo..."
No.
"My home is here, Mother, with David and Jo."
It was you who told me not to expect marriage to be uninterrupted pleasure.
- I'm afraid it was.
- No!
"- I don't need to go to a doctor, no."
"- Meemaw, Meemaw..."
"- No, no, no."
"- Meemaw, I promised..."
"I promised my mom that I would take you to the doctor, okay?"
Okay.
Then I'm gonna drive.
"You're not gonna drive, Meemaw."
- I'm gonna drive.
- No.
Too many DUls.
"Hey, scoot over, four eyes."
- Oh...
"- Come on, come on."
"- Martha, just..."
- But you're not...
You're not on my insurance policy.
"Oh, we won't tell anybody."
"Well, legally, I have to call the police if you drive."
"Legal, schmegal."
"Move over, honey."
Wow.
Ten years I haven't driven.
"Chip, what's new?"
What's happening at the Arby's?
"Uh, I don't work there anymore."
I'm a professional clown.
Oh.
"So, that means you're the breadwinner, Martha, darling?"
What do you mean?
"A man shouldn't rely on his wife for money, Chip."
Ha ha.
"Touché, Eddie."
"Come on, let's go and pay for the stuff."
I've remembered why we shouldn't be here.
- We have no cash.
"- Eddie, I am a celebrity."
Celebrities don't need money.
- Next.
- Ha ha ha.
Boo!
"Hello, love."
"It's me, Richie Rich."
A-ha!
It's just cancer crunch and a trolley of meat.
I'll give you a mensh on my next prog.
"£200, please."
"My dear girl, you don't seem to understand."
"I, Richie Rich, am offering you, nobody, a mensh on my next prog."
- Right.
This requires subtle handling.
"- £200, please."
How does it feel to be a checkout girl who's reached the peak of your potential?
How does it feel to know that you're a talentless git who never even had any potential?
- I see.
"- £200, please."
Uh.
Stitch that.
I think you're on there.
I know a come-on when I see it.
This is ridiculous.
Somebody here tell donkey face who I am.
We don't know.
(woman laughing)
- Great tush?
Mike:
Great.
- 'Cause you're a fucking fag.
"- No, I'm not a fag, I just appreciate a great tush when I see one."
"- No offense, Mike, but you are a fag."
- You're a fag.
"- No-- I am not a fag, you're not a fag."
"- Hey, Iâm not-- I'm not a fag."
"- Oh, yeah?"
Prove it.
"- All right, all right, all right."
"All right, he said it 'cause--"
- What?
- He said it 'cause you said it.
He said it 'cause you said it.
- But I'm not a fag.
"- Yeah, no, we know you're not a fag."
"Right, you said it, 'cause you retaliated."
"- Yeah, I said it 'cause you said I was--"
- Right?
- Yes.
"- All right, it's okay, Pete."
- Watch your mouth.
- It's okay.
- You watch my mouth.
- What?
- Nothing.
"- Okay, okay."
"All right, Mike."
"Mike, let me get-- Let me buy you a beer."
It seems there was an argument.
She fell down the stairs.
Potentially a blow to the head before she fell.
Potentially?
- l don't have all the facts yet.
- Is she all right?
"No, she's badly hurt."
Her brain.
They already arrested Albert.
I sent Clay and Sadie down there.
I'll have to go down there myself.
I promised Shannon I'd take her to the Father-Daughter Dance at the club tonight.
"I have no idea how long l'll be with Albert, so--"
"Oh, Dad, Dad--"
"Just drive her over there, and I'll catch up."
- Just drive her there?
"- Yeah, right."
Samantha's case is up.
All right.
Where is he?
I don't know.
Well... she's up.
Um... will you be OK here?
His hotel room is just a block away.
I'll be right back.
I'm late.
Your-- Your dad went home.
"So, um... your ne_ hearing is in 28 days."
OK.
And we will get you moved then.
28 days.
That's when we'll move you.
It must be at least 18 years now.
"We drive up to Germany, up to the Fuhrer's headquarters."
"To Berchtesgaden, and then to the Eagle's Nest."
Because it interests me.
A couple of times now they've questioned me.
The police.
"The Gestapo, or whatever."
It's not called the Gestapo anymore.
I'm on their list.
My name shows up.
They look in their computer:
"""Ochs, Josef."
Marz...
"Holy Christ!"""
It means you have quite a record.
My sweet little mouse.
"Sophia, Sophia."
My darling.
Your cheeks are all red.
Are you warm?
We'll take your bonnet off.
"Look, where are we?"
"Look, in Daddy's basement."
Look!
At night he's down here at the computer.
He works all night.
"Look, my little mouse."
Look at all the paper he needs.
"That doesn't interest you, sure."
"It's fun, you can watch TV."
"Look, sweetie."
You can see yourself in the TV.
- Do you guys remember?
- He did.
That was uncomfortable.
- Yeah.
On-stage.
"- But I stopped it, didn't I?"
- There we go.
"- Yeah, he was trying to get me back..."
"Oh, my gosh."
"- But, Mike, I averted your..."
"- Yeah, you did."
We were on stage doing a QA in Toronto and Rafi said:
"""Mike, sing that song that you always sang to me on set."""
And he was getting me back because of this prank we had played on him in Toronto.
He was getting you back for the $20 prank?
"Yes, exactly."
"Oh, I felt..."
I was really...
That was not a good moment.
"And he looked at me, like, the most sadistic look."
"Well, and then he got his, like, Rafi little-kid thing of like:"
"""Mike, you did it to me."""
Hilarious.
"And then I played, like, mom."
I was mom there.
"I was like, ""No."
"Michael does not do it."""
"- Yeah, that was nice."
- Here we go.
Bishop Allen.
"Oh, Mike."
"Oh, yeah, here we go."
-Perfect!
"-keep quiet, she already comes."
Thanks.
-Young lady.
-Yes?
You often suffers migraine?
From time to time.
"You feel nauseous, dispepsia, schizophrenia?"
"Good, in fact..."
"Sickness, pains to the legs?"
Why?
I am ill?
-It is possible.
-It could be serious.
"Please, Professor, help me."
We would have to examine you.
-I undress?
-You are not embaressed?
"-Good, in fact..."
"-Young lady, we are doctors."
We on a daily basis see a great amount of naked women.
"Good, then..."
"Well, we will help you."
-Lie down in the sofa.
-Comfortable position.
We are going to examine you.
"-Lie down, trust us."
We undo this...
"-Everything, Doctor?"
"-Yes, it is better."
He already is...
"The next time, a bad zipper"
I'm answering all your questions.
You're a fucking sadist is what you are.
A little.
"Wait, look."
Wow!
[Laughs]
Whoo!
"Look at these features, huh?"
"I mean, the fucking cheekbones right here?"
Are you kidding me?
I look like an angel.
- Look at that.
- [Camera shutter clicks]
[Laughs]
Babe.
"Oh, you look good."
Thank you.
- [Air hisses]
- Drew:
Try it.
That's original flavor.
I'm pregnant.
I probably shouldn't.
"Ah, it's harmless."
Every ingredient on that can is natural...
Or a near-perfect synthetic match.
"Okay, drew, I've got a lot of other meetings with sponsors."
What do you want to do?
I love Ryan.
You know that.
But I was at his last fight.
He did not look good.
Stupid?
I was gonna say sophisticated.
"That's no sophisticated, that's British."
Don't be confused.
Right.
What's he doing in Vegas?
Losing a bet.
Huh?
I bet him I could bring in more money than him in the next 24 hours.
Loser leaves Vegas for good.
"Oh, Sam, are you sure that's wise?"
The guy is a legend.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
You know what I mean.
"I'm the number one casino host in Las Vegas, no matter who my competition is."
Right.
"Anyway, I have an ace up my sleeve, so I can't lose."
An ace?
Mm-hmm.
Mr. Wu.
He plays at least a million a visit.
That sounds like an ace.
Mm-hmm.
"Mr. Wu, hi."
Let's get you to a table.
"I don't think so, Sam."
"Uh, is there a problem?"
I'll say.
You have a ghost?
"Oh, the ghost."
[Chuckles]
That's absurd.
- Shut up!
"- Dude, come on..."
- I said shut up!
Go!
get me out of here!
Help!
"Excuse me, can I see your ticket?"
That trunk yours...?
TRAIN STARTS TO MOVE...
"Eat some now, save some for later..."
"Eat some now, save some for later..."
REV.DECENIO
"Hey, it's Fred!"
My life is a horror movie!
It's so scary!
I'm so scared!
"And you'll be, too, once you hear about it."
You'll be scared and scarred.
Scare-arr-red!
"That's a new word I just made up, scared and scarred combined."
Which is what you'll be.
I'm gonna go get a snack.
Do you want to hear about it or not?
Meet me in the kitchen.
"Usually, I lead a very normal life, go to school, hang with friends, see my girl."
"You remember Judy, right?"
Freddie
Judy.
"Yeah, we broke up."
Dumped her.
"-Don't go, Fred."
WOMAN 1:
Operator.
Hello.
Can I please have long distance?
"For long distance, dial 110."
"Oh, all right, thank you."
WOMAN 2:
Long Distance.
Hello?
"Oh, hello, long distance."
"I would like to place a call, please, to Mrs. Karen Blair, that's Colonel Blair's wife, at March Field, California."
"One moment, please."
"Yes, thank you, I'll wait."
Long distance?
Are you still there?
Are you ready for your call?
"Yes, I'm ready."
KAREN:
Hello?
"(MIMICKING GRETCHEN) Karen, darling."
How divine to talk to you again.
It's been a long time.
"Yes, it has been a long time, hasn't it?"
"Much too long, you naughty girl, you."
We must get together again real soon for a rousing game of mahjong.
"Oh, I'd just love to."
"Oh, by the way, Karen, my dear."
I have an enormous favor to ask of you.
My Bobby...
Booby?
"No, not booby."
Bobby.
"- Oh, my."
Now that's going to leave a mark.
[Pants]
All aboard for the transdimensional express.
Huh?
[sighs]
Why me?
This can't be good for my cold.
But this is no time for selfish thoughts.
It's time for a little turnabout.
Ew!
Can you get any more disgusting?
Don't make me come in there.
Wait a second. [sniffs]
Smells like... ambush!
"Mucal invader, is there no end to your oozing?"
[Pants] Adaptor!
[Pants] Adaptor!
Adaptor!
Thanks.
I've had enough chasing.
"It's your turn now, Thorozpog."
Thrakkorzog!
Thrakkorzog!
"With a K. Boy, are you ever rude."
Eat your brain!
No brains today.
"We're only serving humble pie, Whatchimozog."
"- Listen, for the last time it's..."
- Thoraxinabog?
- Thrakkorzog!
"- Ah, Laxativelog."
I really want to do well at this job.
I can't do well if everybody thinks that I got my job by sleeping with my boss.
"So if you will excuse me, I am meeting with the EM very shortly..."
- EM?
- It's the executive matchmaker.
Now silence.
Mother.
You want help with that bar?
There you go.
- Hey.
"- Oh, hey!"
You made it.
Yeah.
"I didn't want Major Pain to make me do extra pushups, so I ran here."
- Wow.
"- Hey, you should check them out."
"Oh, yeah."
That...
Nice.
- I got yours in my bag.
- Great.
You need to break them in.
What are you doing tomorrow?
"- Say, around 11?"
- I...
I work.
I'm...
I'm a lawyer.
That's too bad.
"Not that you're a lawyer, that you're not free."
"Well, you know, I work pretty flexible hours."
Cool.
Richie Rich.
Ooh-hoo-hoo!
- Here we go.
Break a leg.
- OK.
"Get off, you maniac."
"Hello, hello."
Shut up.
"Hi, God bless and if you can't be good, be careful."
Ho ho ho.
Right.
"It's full up in here, as the vicar said with his hand up Sam Fox's blouse."
Show us your tits.
"But seriously, folks."
The Good Lord gave us the gift of laughter.
- Get off!
- Ha ha ha.
"Thank God the likes of Tony Benn can't take that away from us, although he'd like to."
"Tell us a joke, then, you fat bastard."
I hear Arthur Scargill's blind stick lost his hairdresser.
"- You have to laugh, don't you?"
- Not at you.
"Two, three, four..."
Happiness
Happiness...
Thank you.
"God bless you, one and all."
- Get off!
- The greatest thing
That I possess...
"The smile of a child, a beautiful woman, just simply being..."
British.
- Good.
"- Photo IDs, please."
Thank you.
- What are you guys looking for?
Explosives.
This is awesome.
"Park up on the left, go into the East Lobby."
Have a good one.
Did you know that the president travels in an 18-ton military-armoured modified Cadillac CTS built to withstand gas chemical and missile attacks?
- That's on the Internet?
- Wikipedia.
"- Capitol Police, off-duty."
- Have to check your weapon.
All right.
Check her good.
"- Hey, Torn."
"- Hey, buddy."
So how is your blog coming along?
"Nobody says ""blog"" anymore, John."
"What do you mean, they don't say ""blog""?"
"- I just learned ""blog."""
- Hi.
Hi.
"Just for 20 seconds, act like you don't hate me."
- I'm Carol Finnerty.
- Hi.
John.
- Carol?
- Cale.
"Oh, my God."
Carol Wilkes.
"Actually, I'm Carol Finnerty now."
He's shooting at me!
Why is he shooting at me?
I haven't gone this fast in years.
I'm gonna blow a gasket or somethin'.
Serpentine!
"Serpentine, serpentine!"
What in the blue blazes?
Crazy hot-rodder.
"I'm telling you, man, every third blink is slower."
"The sixties weren't good to you, were they?"
What?
That's not the Interstate!
Ah!
Oh!
"Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!"
"No, no, no, no, no, no!"
Ow!
"I'm not the only one seeing this, right?"
- Incoming!
"- Whoa, man."
- No!
- Hey!
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!"
My tires!
"Fly away, Stanley."
Be free!
"Boy, you're in a heap of trouble."
"We're live at the Los Angeles International Speedway as the first competitor, Lightning McQueen, is arriving at the track."
Is it true he's gonna pose for Cargirl?
What's your strategy?
What?
Did I forget to wipe my mud flaps?
"Brother Foon, he's the one!"
"- Mousy, you have a go!"
- I can't do it!
My legs go weak when I see him.
Brother Foon is a really good fighter.
I'd be happy if I was half as good as him.
Does it hurt?
I forbid you to scream!
"You've got to smile, too!"
Smile like you mean it!
Mousy.
"Next time you see Mousy, I want you to smile like you mean it."
- Brother Mousy...
- Don't you know what to do?
Scram!
"Brother Foon, you're brilliant."
"When you meet people like that, you've got to behave like a bully."
I can't act fierce.
"Brother Foon, you're my idol."
Everything will be OK if Sifu Wong agrees to take me on.
"OK, I'll put in a good word for you."
We're done for the day.
I've got to dash.
What are you doing?
"Excuse me, please."
Stop clowning around!
Let me pass!
Help!
Help!
This actor is trying to kill me!
Make way!
"Make way, please!"
"He says he loves me, Pam."
"L""m human."
Okay?
"Lt""s okay to be human."
"You won""t win this one, Lisa."
"- Hey, Boo Boo."
- Hi.
"- I don""t believe it."
Not him.
"- It""s true."
"And it""s poisoning the entire office."
"L""m telling you, after a day of watching them, I go home physically sick."
"You""ve seen the way she bends to pick up a pencil at the waist instead of the knees... like any decent woman."
- He has lost weight.
"- He""s drinking Slim-Fast for lunch."
Slim-Fast?
Really?
- Does she know?
- No.
"And I""m not gonna tell her."
"David Harris, last person I ever thought would cheat on his wife."
Yeah.
"Hey, Boo Boo."
"Why don""t you come in and keep me company?"
"You know, you could afford liposuction, Dad."
"God, I can""t believe you use this stuff."
It makes you look all orange.
I listened to this music when I was 12.
"I know you""re sleeping with Lisa, Daddy."
"Kiddo, you don""t buy into that office gossip?"
Not my smart girl.
"Dad, admit it."
Every young student doctor...
She wanted to know my menstrual history.
I didn't know what she was talking about till she told me.
I felt like a right bleeding'eejit.
"Why didn't she just say ""your periods""?"
"We'll weigh you now, Sharon."
Doctors are always like that.
"""Menstrual history."""
"I got a ""C"" in that in me inter."
How are your movements?
Not bad.
How's yours?
There's the heartbeat now.
See it?
Yeah.
Only one heart.
What?
There aren't twins in there.
"Oh, yeah."
That there is a leg.
See it?
"Oh, yeah."
Sharon?
Why didn't you come in this morning?
Had a checkup.
I swapped with Mona.
You should be on check...
Ask her.
You should be on check-out now.
I can't do it!
Why not?
'Cause I have to keep going to the toilet!
Feel with your fingertips
I can't reach it.
- Don't kill him!
"- Can't just let him live, can I?"
- Please!
"- Weakness, Luke!"
Weakness!
"Gem... come on, you can do it."
Reach.
Tell you what... three bullets left.
50-50 chance of getting a live round.
If he lives...
I'll let him go.
- You want me to sh-shoot him?
"- Wake up, Luke!"
"I'm giving you the chance to save him, or you can point the gun at me, but you'll only get one chance, and if there's no bullet... well... it's all over for you."
"- Please, please don't shoot me."
Please.
"- It's not up to me, sunshine."
"Decision time, Luke."
Me or the fag?
"Either way, it's 50-50."
Time to pick a side.
Five seconds...
Four...
- No!
- Three...
Two...
- One.
"- Please don't, please, Luke, Luke..."
"- No, Gem, Gem, run, run."
- But what about you and Paul?
"When he gives the order, don't do anything, call me."
Do as I say...
- Understand?
- No.
- Perfect.
- What's the matter?
.
- Nothing.
- Nothing?
- Nothing.
"- Okay, then I'II leave."
- I wanted to know...
What?
Can you confirm that FriuIi's below Austria?
- Why are you going to Pordenone?
- Where?
Pordenone.
"There's no sun, there's no sea."
There's no me.
"If you have something to say, okay, if not, I'II go back to the festival."
"Every time I have something to tell you, you gotta leave."
- What transfer?
.
- You're staying here?
Fire calling fuse.

"The music's done, they're wantin' the 'works."
"I don't understand a word, could you repeat clearly?"
I can neverunderstand a word when you talk!
"Mattia, hearme?"
Shoot!
"- hello, Mattia?"
I wouldn't hurt you.
I'm sorry.
Are you expecting somebody?
No.
Can I talk to my sister for a minute?
It's okay.
I had this whole speech planned. so-- wait wait.
Just-- what I'm trying to say is that l-- but it wasn't for lack of trying.
Dad split... and Mom passed away.
And we got stuck with Rod.
And... you know?
I'm not your responsibility anymore.
I know that.
That's what I came here to say.
I know you're not a little girl anymore.
And... you-- you grew up to be this really beautiful woman.
And you deserve better.
And I'm gonna have to learn to let you go. but I'm gonna try.
okay?
Thank you.
Thank you.
He's not such a bad guy.
I know.
He's not.
I'm gonna go.
Are you okay?
it was my mom's ring.
I didn't know he had it.
I'm gonna be leaving.
I want you to come with me.
Of course.
- Yeah?
Got a minute?
I'm off the clock.
I want you to give Griff his job back.
- No.
"There, less than a minute!"
"- Well, let's talk about this."
- He almost killed a patient.
- It was an accident!
It's still no.
- Just like that?
- Yup.
- No discussion?
"- Uh, no."
Alright.
I'm not leaving until we talk about this.
Close the door on the way out.
I need to eat.
"Frank, wait!"
Nicole...
"It's OK, I just,"
"I just wanna sit with her for a bit, OK?"
OK.
I yelled down the stairs.
- What?
"- When she left for work, I was too tired to go downstairs and kiss her goodbye."
You didn't know.
No one does.
I never in a million years thought I'd marry a woman.
"I had a boyfriend, we were serious, and..."
"I met Stephanie at some first responders thing, fundraiser, and  all my everything turned upside down."
I do.
"I do,"
Don't go now- or you'll all die.
"If you go now, your whole family will perish."
What are you talking about?
The Jap is waiting for you... to annihilate your family.
He's dead.
He's not dead.
Death cannot touch him.
The demon will soon enter your home.
You've seen the demon?
At the house of the hanged woman.
It was a dream.
It was no dream.
I laid a trap for it.
"Wait here, until he's caught."
That's all you need to do.
What are you?
A woman or a ghost?
Why do you ask?
I need to know...
If I can put my faith in you.
"Just believe, and your family will be saved."
What are you?
Someone trying to save your daughter.
A woman.
I called all her friends...
Hvo-jm?
Hyo-jin!
Baby.
"Baby""."
When will the demon come?
It's already there.
Hyo-jin.
Down...
Down..
Whoa.
"Carefully, carefully!"
"You all right, Indy?"
"Now gently, boys."
"Gently, gently!"
Whoa...
I told you it will be all right.
Huh...
"Sallah, get down here!"
You pour.
"Oh, that's good."
Whoops.
"What is this stuff, Rene?"
I grew up with this.
It's my family label.
Well...
"I have to be going now, Rene."
"I like you, Rene, very much."
Perhaps we'll meet someday under better circumstances.
"We meet again, Fraulein."
"You Americans, you're all the same."
Always overdressing for the wrong occasions.
Now... what shall we talk about?
All right... take it up!
Easy!
You're as stubborn as that girl.
"You like her too much, I think."
Your methods of archaeology are too primitive for me.
You would use a bulldozer to find a...
China cup.
It's a million-horsepower engine

Don't miss that elephant.
Gotcha!
My!
It's coming here!
"Hey,this is a real elephant."
Where did this come from?
This is a real baby elephant.
I'm going to make it my pet.
Stop it!
It's prohibited to capture real animals.
"Don't you dare to stop me, stupid robot!"
I'm sure it came from some hunting prohibited area nearby.
"This is a safari park made only with robots, right?"
It's his fault for coming here.
Why can't I hunt it?
"Wh, what are you!"
I'm Atom.
Stop it!
"You are a robot, right?"
Hey!
Come here.
The Little Elephant Pura
"- Yes, sir. keep my luggage inside."
"Daddy, I am so sorry I am late."
You are always late!
"Have a seat, dear!"
"Mr. Rajesh, meet my daughter seema."
I have already met her in a pleasurable way.
l..
I am still ashamed for that.
You are embarrassing me by saying this.
Please have a seat.
- Thank you.
Great!
Have this.
- Thank you!
Not so much!
Enough!
- Have some more!
You too have some.
My plate is already full.

"Look, don""t feel shy. otherwise I will think that you are still angry with me."
You are giving me so much food.
I will have to go to the hospital from here.
"lf such a situation arises, then I will be your nurse."
You can surely kill me.
Sing it with me.
You know the words.
"No, thanks, man."
You've been singin' that shit all week.
"If you try that at M.S.U. this Saturday, I'll kick your ass."
Our last game is this Saturday.
[ Snickers ]
"Yeah, well, shit."
I've got this lacrosse game.
It's really important.
It's our last game.
"Central almost beat us last time, so this time I really wanna kick their ass."
"But it's gonna be cool, because the game's at State, which means afterwards I'll be able to stop by."
So you can't sing at the competition.
[ Sighing ]
"Heather, I'm sorry."
I totally blew it.
It's okay.
You should... do what makes you happy.
All right.
"Listen, thanks for understanding."
Yeah.
"So, uh, I guess I'll see you later ?"
Mm-hmm.
[ Whistling ]
"Hey, Kevin."
- You seen shit-brick lately ?
- Why ?
What did you do to him ?
Me ?
Nothing.
"See, I'm the one whose ass he kicked."
"Why can't you harness that strength to eat?"""
"""But why?"
"Why do I need to eat?"""
Captain Carpenter.
"I would like to talk to Lieutenant Gerard, please."
Lieutenant Gerard isn't here.
Be glad to take a message.
I'd like to talk to him.
"It's about this fellow, uh, Kimble."
Kimble?
You have something on Kimble?
I sure have.
I'd like to say it to the lieutenant.
I'm afraid you'll have to say it to me.
Lieutenant Gerard's out of town.
SOPHlE:
"I never liked him, right from the beginning."
"So when I saw this picture, I called the cops."
"You think he killed your friend, Priamos?"
Sure he killed him.
"Gus found out who he was, so he killed him."
"He's been spotted before, and he didn't kill."
"What do you mean, ""didn't kill""?"
"He killed his wife, didn't he?"
The law says he did.
Okay.
"So if Gus ain't dead, where is he?"
He hasn't been seen all day.
"The car's gone, and the money's gone."
Where's the money?
What money?
"Gus had 8,000 bucks."
They're Granddad's teeth.
Granddad's teeth.

They're two years above us.
Jackie's got Geography with the one called Tom.
She says he just moved here from London.
London!
I knew they were cosmopolitan.
Apparently their family just opened an organic shop on the high street.
Dishy and nutritious.
"So, G, Tom or Robbie?"
Which brother do you want?
- What about me?
"- El, we saw them first."
That's not fair!
"Ellen, you have to be emotionally sorted to be ready for a boyfriend."
Jas and I are there.
We even devised a snogging scale.
That proves it.
"We have to know ourselves, to see how boys see us."
Can you handle that?
"Okay, so it's time for the Physical Attractiveness Test."
Finished.
You lot are so sweet.
I got mostly eights for everything.
"- So did I. - Me, too."
"Hey, who gave me a four for my nose?"
And look.
- May God give you more.
Afiyet olsun.
"Mehmet, where's our tea?"
"Just kidding, sit down."
Eat your food.
It's Memo's day today.
"Eat all you can, Memo."
That's what I call a börek... ... health be upon your mother's hands.
Eat from that çörek as well.
It's the çörek my dad sells the most.
- I already ate 3 of those.
- Whoa!
"Mmm, this one is delicious as well."
This doesn't look like bakery material tho.
Where is this from?
From a certain çirkin.

"""Maybe now is time to push our anger aside."
"What do you say?"""
"""I talked with your lawyer."""
"""I told him, I could be your witness if it is seen necessary."""
"""He said Barış's statement is the important one."""
"Yep, and now they'll do speeches."
"""When he was a little boy..."""
"- When I was a little boy... ...he, of course, ""also had a grandma."" - ...I also had a grandma."
"And in his whole life ""he couldn't, and I could."""
"- But in my whole life, I could not manage to disappoint her to death."
But he could!
"And thus, Kostya Inochkin began his clandestine life."
"- Hey, Nelya."
Do you know how to dance Charleston?

"- You know, make people do stuff with your mind."
"- Kosmos, Kosmos!"
Come here!

- Easy.
Like what?
"- I don't know, something."
- Hang on.

He did that on his own.

Or a badger.

You're opposing me?
Fuck off.
Take that back.
Take that back.
"- What's your problem, bro?"
- Take that hand away.
"Lay a hand on that boy again, I'll rip your hand off."
"- They are just joking around, abi."
- They won't joke around from now on.
No one will raise a hand against this boy again.
No one will make him do their stuff from now on.
"- Abi, it's not a big deal."
- It is a big deal for me!
It is a big deal.
"What is going on, brother?"
What is your problem?
"You are my problem, dick heads."
I ruined my youth not to be like him.
"All right... ""children in costumes orderly proceed to the square."""
And march!

Choose.
Jackie Chan or Taekwondo.
I can do both well!
Fine.
Ten more laps then.
Master!
Said you gotta do both.
A National is only two weeks away and you're 3 kg over.
Pick up the speed!
Another weight loss?
Don't get me started.
Go get me some water.
Ji-hwan...
"You're losing weight to avoid facing Young-hoon, right?"
Think what you like.
"As I told you before, my goal is not winning a Gold but to graduate."
He will only bring her back.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
So what have you decided?
I will bring her.
Not because I love her but since I need money.
Money?!
Money is not a problem.
Tell me how much you want.
I will ask after I get her back.
Gave me one cigarette.
"Sir, cigarette."
"Hey, why are you thundering like that?"
Could you not remember me all these days?
"Anyway, now that you came, stay here for some time."
The both of us can play together.
You can never marry him now.
"I am coming mom, I am coming dad."

Who permitted you to do so?
Couldn't you find any other tree for burning Holi?
I'll not spare you people today!
Let my son come home.
Your son.
You call the delicate darling your son.
And what will he do?
Will he stick the branches back to the tree?
Isn't it?
He's very strong.
- I see.
He can uproot the entire tree and plant it back in his house.
I will shoot you today..
Why shoot us?
Ha Ni went to school already.
We know.
We just thought about So Pal Bok Noodles all of a sudden.
Seafood noodles?
With a lot of fresh raw oyster.
"I got it, i got it!"
Over here!
Two seafood noodles with a lot of fresh raw oyster.
Ooh!
Bong Joon Gu!
Sounds like it's your territory.
"Super charismatic, huh?"
"Right, huh?"
Should I buy Ha Ni a pair of glasses?
"Everyone else says I have charisma, but Ha Ni is the only one that doesn't see it."
"Joon Gu, if you're too pushy, Ha Ni will just get bored."
What...what did you say?
"Bong Joon Gu, you really don't know women."
Do you know why Ha Ni can't stand up against Seung Jo?
Because Seung Jo is cold.
What?
Cold?
"To women, if a man is far away, they want to get closer."
"If they come towards us, we want to run away."
Is that true?
Yeah.
"If you keep it up, she'll dislike you more and more, Bong Joon Gu."
"No, no."
Chef kept talking about being sought after!
So I tried it out...
But it does not really fit the personality
"And I can not play, For hard to reach."
Too modern.
Too empty.
Too touristy.
Your knees gone yet?

What are you doing here in Paris?
It's our wedding anniversary.

Once the kids have gone...
What's left of us?
Beckett says  'Do we mean love when we say love?'
What else do we mean?
That's stupid.
Oooh!
"- Oh God, Nick!"
You cannot love and hate the same person.
[laughing]
- It really hurts!
Usually in the space of 5 minutes in my experience.
I think we've earned a very good time.
People don't change.
They do.
They can get worse!
[French accent]
"Do I please you, monsieur?"
Here's the bill.

So let me tell you what cutting edge astronomy looked like not so long ago.
It looked like this.
"First of all, that's just a sketch."
"Somebody stood at a telescope from night after night, incidentally wearing a top hat, sketching what they could see."
"And secondly, they're looking at a single object."
"In this case, it's what was known as a spiral nebula."
An island universe.
All right.

Your injuries were fatal.
Was it vampire blood?
"That, and, uh..."
This ring protects me from death at the hands of supernatural beings.
A vampire hunter who can't be killed by vampires.

And call the firm and tell them about this scandal.
Güney Bey has a guest.
Simay Canay.
He is mentally challenged.
He's obsessed.
You heard him.
How he threatened me.
He is very determined to get me in trouble.
Güney Bey...
You have a guest waiting at the reception.
- Simay Canay...
- No way.
Tell them to send her away.
How many times I have to tell you not to let that woman in this building?
You still asking?
He doesn't want to see her.
Güney Bey isn't in the company.
His car is here though.
This is what they told me.
I was going to give him something that belongs to him.

When are the So Pal Bak noodles coming out?
Oh!
Hi!
Did you get home safely?
Yesterday?
"Ah yes, of course!"
I did get home safely.
I knew you would be safe because of Kyung Sunbae.
"But, it seems like you did worry about me."
"Anyways, it was fun."
It was like we were shooting a movie.
"""Gangsters and Hae Rin"""
I'm glad that you got home safely.
Let's go inside.
Look at this.
"Wonderful perfection, a goddess."
You sure did take a lot of pictures.
"Wow, look at this."
"She looks pretty, right?"
"So, what happened yesterday?"
"You did have a date, right?"
What date?
We just ate and left right after.
"Ah, I should have paid for the food."
"Ah, what is that?!"
How could you when you had the perfect chance?!
You should have confessed.
Confession...
I did plan on doing it.
"Ah, I see."

- Okay Güney.
You thought I could be the murderer.
You accused me in your head.
You didn't believe me.
But see what happened?
The truth has come out.
You accused me for nothing.
Was it worth it?
But you were talking in your sleep.
You said it yourself.
Honey...
"Look, it was only your imagination."
You gotta admit that yourself.
Stop doubting me.
Erase the suspicions in your mind.
"Don't do this to us, if you want us to be like before."

All I want is to divorce as soon as possible.
You didn't have to come all the way here.
I think there's a misunderstanding.

There is nothing left to do for your father..
We have to wait for the hearing...

"As I was sleeping yesterday, I suddenly had an inspiration!"
"So, I came early because I wanted to complete the choreography."

Go and rest for a few days.

Did we get a schedule?
Ah!
Did we get a commercial?

Yes.
In being disciplined...

- Inochkin.
- Fill the gap.
"- So, what about talents?"
- I've got three.
- From the entire troop?
"Don't tell me there are no talents among you, my friends."
"Sorry, I don't believe that for a moment."
"- Half a meatball, everyone."
"- And if you can't sing or dance, you can recite a poem."
You are stone.

Today I ask for my son's life.
Please grant my son his life!

"Renu, I have good news for you."
Hello!
Where is Suraj?
- He is at a military hospital.
Hospital!
There's no cause for worry.
He's perfectly all right.
A bullet hit his shoulder and now it's out.
He'll be dancing within a week.
I told you that nothing would happen to Suraj.
God heard my prayers.
This means that our hero is perfectly all right.
He is no ordinary hero.
His plane caught fire and it crashed.
He landed with his parachute right in the midst of the enemy.
He was 20 miles away from our side... ... and he came back avoiding the shower of bullets.
Can we meet Suraj?
The visiting hours are from 4 to 6.
You can meet him then.
Goodbye!
"Come, aunty."
This is Suraj's room.
You can go in.
"Hello, aunty!"
Are you all right?

What are you doing?
Are you crazy?
Why are you doing this?
This is practice.
Practice?
The timing is important.
Look at this.
If the girl says
"""What is this?"
"What are you doing?!"" then you put your hands like this"
"""If you can forget me, try forgetting me."" and just go in for the kiss."
Hey!
"You have talent, it's very real."
- Really?
"- Wow, so if the girls say ""What are you doing?"""
"Then, slam..."
"""If you can forget me, try forgetting me"""
Wait!
"Here, the timing is important."
When the girl lifts her head like this...
"Then,"
When she lifts her head...
"""Why?"
"What are you doing?"""
"Slam.  "" Try to forget me if you can."""
That's right.
That's it!

"(Energetic) ""Hurricane"" MV THE END!"
This is Washington D.C.
After a little break some members will get ready.
I heard Him Chan and Jong Up will be filming first.
I didn't want to waste time in the hotel.
I heard the set is near here so I came out to skateboard.
I like it here so much.
"Hi, I'm Him Chan."
"""Hurricane"" MV is over."
We were filming for a real long time.
There were many different places we went to.
"And today, we came over to Washington D.C."
"As soon as we got here, Jong Up and I had to film for the ""Coffee Shop"" MV."
So we're out here and it's pretty nice.
Zelo is here too.
Zelo seems to like America a lot.
Look at him.
But I'm a little worried about something.
L.A. and San Francisco were very natural and free cities.
Washington D.C. seems like a noble place.
I'm worried that Zelo will get scolded.
We're at the MV shooting set.
Wish us luck.
Goodbye.
We're heading to New York now.
New York is the final destination.
We'll try our best in NY too and head back safely.

"Professor, can you lend me some money?"
How much do you want?
"Professor, you're a rich man, whatever you can spare."
For Tanya.
- For Tanya.
Give me tea and bread.

"Brother Kundan."""
"Brother Kundan, do you want to stay unmarried all your life?"
"Have you ever thought about love, marriage, girls.. ..or will I have to do that for you as well."
I did.
I also did.

"It was very beautiful and the song was called ""Natural Woman"" and I thought that you really was one."
D:

D:
"The jury agreed, Camilla, and what do you think the policeman over there think?"
CL:
"He thinks that everything I do is fantastic, so he just got another confirmation now."
D:
Do you know what I believe?
I think that the cop thought it was touching.
D:
Thanks to the jury.
Thank you so much Camilla and Kristjan.
J:
"Camilla, this is almost like a dream."
What great praise you got from the jury.

Connor:
We need to find an elevator to get back to the surface.
Matt:
"Yeah, if James knows where they are..."
James:
"Look, if we follow the tunnels we'll get out."
Kate:
But... what about the people down there?
They could still be alive couldn't they?
Connor:
"Even if they are, there's nothing we can do for them."
Connor:
The best we can do is get out and try and get help.
Kate:
But if the radiation did that to them... then...
James:
No - we're safe now the machine's off.
James:
It's just the ring itself that's radioactive.
We're safe here.
Amy:
"Oh my god, all those people..."
Amy:
How could this happen?
James:
It couldn't have happened.
You can't turn the machine on when there are people down there.
James:
There are interlock systems everywhere.
Matt:
"Well somebody fucked up, and it wasn't me!"
Connor:
I will after we do it once.
I feel so refreshed.
Thought I was gonna die.
"The dumber they are, the stronger they are."
What did you just say?!
What?
Are you yelling at me?
"I mean, what did you say?"
I said you're good.
I heard what you were saying.
Dammit!
I did you a favor.
What did you say!
You did me as a favor?
What a crap!
Where did you pick up such bad manners?
Don't you think you're going too far?
You're feeling pretty mighty all of a sudden.
It wasn't good because you were good.
It's because I was born sensitive.
"Still, aren't you being too hard on me?"
"Alright, brat."
Such pride...
If you only studied like that.
Dammit!
"Okay, okay."
Enough!
A man doesn't get pissed off over such things...
Let's do it later.
Let's just talk now.
- About what?
-What painters do you like?
- There.
Have you buried the gold here?
"You will be buried here, sheikh."
Why was the bullet fired?

"I won""t spare you!"
As per our information lran lnterpol had raided the place. sheikh Padar was killed.
And Tiger singh fled.

You're lonely， I've come to keep you company
Please come in and sit down Yes
Come， come
Come， come
Look
Good.
See how you'll end up
You really are wicked
What's going on at this hour?
You're lonely， I've come to keep you company
Come in and sit down
Why don't you turn round?
Go and sit down
"Remember, when Tina comes， tell her to take off everything"
Then you take off everything to go to bed with her
lf any girls come， tell her to go home.
No... not you.
"Okay, I'll hang up now."
This IG seems very loyal to the Law.
It seems we must think of the other scheme.
I've thought of one.
What's that?
You'll disguise goons... ...and I'll become a police officer.
Then?
And we'll kidnap Shreekant's darling daughter Radha.
It seems someone is coming.
Have the goons gone?
Take me out from here.
Please...
Just a minute.
"Sheela, someone is passing."
- Don't make noise.
Move away!
- Stop!
I said move!
- What are you doing?
Leave!
Leave me!
- What are you doing?
I will not spare him!
"- Stop, sir."
"If you'll start firing, there'll be bloodshed here."
Damodar!
Damodar!
"See, what's does."
What's written in this letter?
"Mr. Shreekan, your daughter Radha will remain... ...in my custody, until Pasha is in law's custody."
Remember!
Perhaps you've got no family.
That's why you all have become emotionless.
When you didn't love anyone how will you know about it?
I feel suffocation over here.
I feel I'm jailed.
"Neither I can move about freely, nor can I sing."
And you've got no idea about music.
And you...
"Don't worry, baby."
We're with you.
It's just a matter of few days.
Moment the risk of goons is reduced we'll drop you home.
You'd never feel that.
Perhaps you've got no family.
That's why you all have become emotionless.
When you didn't love anyone how will you know about it?
Om!
Om!
Om!
Mother!
Mother!
"What happened, mother?"
Mother!
Mother!
Mother!
Mother!
- Shanta!
God!
Take care of my Kishan after my death.
"Don't say that, Shanta."
Today I'll bring all your medicines.
Today...
Are you serious?
(nervously) Wait.
"No, no!"
"No, no, please, please, no!"
No... (speaks indistinctly)
"I don't know how to play, no."
(hyperventilates)
"Oh, my God."
I'm so scared.
"I don't know how it even starts yet and I'm already scared, man."
"This reminds me of ""The Hunger Games."""
"I'm gonna, like, get eaten by one of those dogs."
I don't even know where to go.
(chuckling) Where am I going?
Am I going the right way?
This kind of reminds me of my home.
"I live, like, deep in the forest."
"(singsong) Come out, come out, wherever you are."
I feel like I'm actually in the dark.
This isn't as scary as I thought.
What is that?
No.
"Okay, never mind."
I'm shaking.
(chuckles nervously)
Is that the wind?
Is that the wind that I hear?
I think that's the wind.
I don't want to go in this building.
I really don't.
- (footsteps) - There we go.
There's a page.
"Let it be, tormentor."
Let our eyes remain close.
I found your love.
This is my fortunes.
"Let it be, tormentor."
Let our eyes remain close.
"This beauty, o beloved."
ls smitten by you.
Look here.
Let eyes lock.
And let love happen.
You rule my heart.
You can ask people.
You are not aware. of the chaos that eyes have created.

Where is the gold?
"- I have the gold, sheikh."
But how could I have brought it here?
I have hidden it in the mountain.
You can take your share.
"Let""s go."
Where is the gold?
"Aigoo, you even fold clothes so well."
"Hey, when I did all this housework, it got so tiring, but now that I have you to talk to."
It's so fun!
Its really true that a person can't live all by themselves
"Yes, it's true."
"Oh, Ha Ni!"
Can you get the laundry from Seung Jo's room?
Tomorrow is Eun Jo's day to take his P.E. outfit.
It seems I have forgotten!
"Sure, I'll be right back"
"You know that closet towards the inside, right?"
I know
OH!
It's the couples T-shirt!
He still has it.
Room for rent
Part time job?
What are you doing in someone else's room?
You came?
She told me to bring Eun Jo's gym clothes.
Then you should have just gotten it and left.
What are you looking through?
"Truthfully, I heard something from Kyung Soo Sunbae."
He said that you might even move out of this house.
"Cham... anyways, he's a little weird, right?"
It's true.
Huh?
I'm going to leave this house.
Why?
What do you mean why?
Do I need to get your permission for that too?
That's not it....
No!
Are you alright?
That fellow has taken a hostage!
We have to get him.
Go!
Seize him!
So you mean... my Eun Hye... ...disappeared while looking for the dead Hong Gil Dong?
She ran out to help Hong Gil Dong.
But she disappeared.
What will we do if she gets hurt while she's with him?
What if she gets caught with him?
I will find her myself. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Your Excellency!&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
Miss Eun Hye has been taken hostage by thugs!
What?
They're dangerous!
Please send for more men!
They must not be caught!
Eun Hye...!
It's alright now.
Just stay here and then go home.
Let's see.
I must have stepped on a broken piece of pottery.
You got cut.
How did you run in this state?
Because I had to run fast to get you out of danger.
"Young Master, are you alright now?"
Yes.
Why were you so agitated just now?
And what was that about not losing me?
- That was...
- Were you troubled because I was angry at you?
Yes.

I suppose that would be okay.
Sure.
- [ Engine Off ]

That was a bad idea.
I'm sorry I invited you.
- What are you talkin' about ?
- Please.
I asked you because I thought you might actually be worth going with.
But you are just a jock.
"No, wait."
You're a jerk.
Wait !

SUNDAY DOCUMENTARY
ROSLlNG'S WORLD
"I slept in the kids' room, or rather, the grandkids' room."
That way I won't wake Agneta.
As usual we were...
When I left Stockholm we weren't done with the presentation.
At midnight I downloaded the final version.
It's only four AM and the paper has already come.
There...
"When you hold a lecture, you need to make sure you're up on the news."
"Better than me, better than its dad, better than both of us together."
"Please, let it be a girl..."
Why am I acting this way?
Am I a pervert?
"Good night, Princess."
How are things with your boyfriend?
Your boyfriend...
Is it going well?
Did you propose to my sister?
You argued with your boyfriend?
You aren't speaking?
What a dunce.
Did you... propose to my sister?
"Don't worry, don't worry."
I'll find a better boyfriend for you.
You want to...
You want to make up with him...?
"Ah, you need some money?"
I'll give you some.
He really is thick-headed.
Sister-in-law.
I also have...
"I have a worry, too."
But don't...
Don't tell your sister.
Your sister...
Here... flowers...
She wants me to propose like this.
Why'd she hit me?
Not enough money?

I ...wanted to ask ... if your dog was taken ill.
Why should he?
Perhaps an old hurt he always growls.
"Well, no, boy!"
Dick is my friend!
He saved my life!
It happened like this...
That's how dick got written of for the border guard.
"So he is a real hero, that dog!"
"You bet, he is!"
Now I will draw!
- Give back the crayons!
Do you want a candy? - what?
Let's have it!
Here!
Have a treat!
"Watch out Sasha, don't eat it."
It'll turn you into stone!
Why did you bring it here at all?!
"Don't be angry, Valerian I'll bring you some chocolate tomorrow"
And me?
And you?
You'll get an ice cream! ans I'll buy you... a sausage.
"Mitya, have you perhaps seen my tablet somewhere?"
"I did, grandpa, here it is, your magic tablet!"
"Haha, It's not really a magic tablet I was just joking!"
See?
I'm healthy again!
So I don't need medication any more!
"Grandfather, Look!"
Why did he pretend it was only a joke?!?
The End Subs by Chapaev &amp;amp; Eus
2307.5 times one... is just that!
2307.5 times one!
Ah.. is there anyone here? heeeeeelp!
"I think you got it backwards there, buddy."
The duck is the thing you love.
The rabbit is the thing you hate.
What?
"Yeah, I got to agree."
"Ducks up, rabbits down."
Definitely.
Ducks are better than rabbits.
"I, I get, ducks are, ducks are..."
Rabbits are adorable.
"Ducks are, they're, have you ever been in a fight with a duck?"
"I mean, ducks are jerks."
(offscreen voice) This led to one of the most intense arguments our group has ever had.
Duck is delicious.
Rabbit is all gamey.
"We're not talking about flavor, Ted."
Flavor counts.
Who carries around a duck's foot for good luck?
Anyone?
You wrap yourself in comforter stuffed with rabbit hair.
I'll wrap myself in one stuffed with duck feathers.
Who's cozier?
Oh...
No no no no no no.
But who's cozier?
Hold on.
I have to get another book.
I concede!
You win.
"Honestly, I didn't care."
"This is exactly why I didn't want you in the loop, Elena."
"Yeah, because now you can't do whatever you want."
- Damn it!
- Hey!
Everything all right out here?
Hey.
"Jamie, go back inside, ok?"
Please.
Trust me.
It's better off for you there.
I don't think so.
I'd listen to her.
"Get back upstairs, man."
I said I don't think so.
"Get back upstairs before I tear your damn throat out, do you understand me?"
I don't think you realize how bad you've gotten!
"This is the way it has to be, Elena."
"Oh, yeah, right."
Out-villain the villain.
I get it.
You're not supposed to be here.
"Jamie, what are you doing?"
What I was told.
He's not supposed to be here.
"Elena, he's compelled."
What was that?!
What are you doing here?
"Ah, looking for a bunny."
You're good.
For now.
You still obsessed with Meredith?
Oh!
"How sweet, Tanya."
Red heart shaped box.
Very nice.
"Bunty, will you marry me?"
That's your favourite Question.
"Right, Tanya?"
You keep giving me a fright by asking this question again and again.
What's there to be afraid of?
"And if I wanted to frighten you.. ..I would've said ""Please marry me, I'm pregnant with your child""."
That would've been better.
Less scary.
Listen Sweetie.
If you want we can move in together.
Live-in is ok.
We can be partners.
But no Mister and Misses.
And no marriage.
I've promised grandpa.. ..that I'll get married.
And that too only to you.
"Then you can't fulfill your promise in this lifetime, Tanya."
"Bunty, marriage is an institution."
"A mental institution, Tanya."
And the living examples are my parents.
"Marriage is the end of love, Tanya.. - Bunty.."
You will know what I am talking about.. ..once you meet my parents.
10.
- 13.
10.
- 11.
"10, that's it."
10.
A great sage from Dwarka set out for a journey on foot.. ..and that afternoon the sun was really scorching.. ..l gave him a jug of water to drink.
He was so pleased.
And gave me this idol.
And this idol turned my luck around.
"I bought this, once a rented shop.. ..and a three room house in Bhooleshwar."
With terrace.
With terrace.
Amazing!
"Mr. Kanji, sell this idol to me."
I am in big trouble.
I'll rot in hell if I even think of selling my Lord.
Sell the God?
Look at what he's saying.
Mischievous...
Lord.
Listen carefully.
- Yes.
You can hear His flute.
It's time for him to play His flute.
What are you saying?
- Try to hear with devotion.
"Listen, you can hear the echo of Mathura."
"Rajastan, Om Sai Ram."
Heard it?
Can you hear?
"- Yes, yes."
Now leave.
- Sell this idol to me.
"Please, Mr. Kanji."
I'll let this idol out of my sight.. ..only when that special person arrives.
The chosen one.
Who is that?
I finally got a chance...
I should've brought a plain white t-shirt.
Excuse me.
"Excuse me, sir."
Let's start!
I want to hurry up and make something.
My mind and body aren't working together.
I can do this in my head.
None
"I was good a long time ago, really, a long time ago."
I drew very well a long time ago
When I followed friends around tagging graffiti walls
I thought I was pretty good.
I'm not used to this so I keep messing up.
A simple line should be easy to draw. but I can't even do that.
- I'm screwed.
- I'm screwed too.
I tried and tried to fix it.
But I messed up.
Where's yours?
- What picture is this?
- It's supposed to be...
- It should have a meaning.
- This is just a pattern.
The color wore off today.
So I tried another color...
None
I have a dream.
Never give up.
"Neat, huh?"
I'm finished.
My shoes.
"Hey, a daughter wants to talk to her dead mother."
- She is just being a good daughter.
- It's her business.
"If this makes everyone uncomfortable, I'll go there by myself."
- You'll walk there yourself.
Good idea.
- Add.
This is too much.
Do you have a heart?
"Hey, if you don't want to go with me, Get out of the truck."
What did you just say?
Read my lips.
I won't go.
I'm not going either.
"Ood, Add, where are you going?"
Come back now.
I won't.
What is this?
I'm not going.
"Since you have picked us up and raised us, you never did this to me."
Who is she?
You've just met her.
She's a liar.
Why are you serious with a whore?
What the...
Don't ever say that again.
I don't want to cause any more troubles.
I'll go.
Hold on.
"Shut up, you two."
Don't ever talk to my woman like that.
I don't like it.
Don't move
No!
Come back here!
Let her go or I'll destroy you!
One!
Two!
Three!
Where did she go?
Has anyone seen her?
No one?
Let me find her
Everyone!
"If you need to apologize, do it sincerely"
That's our lesson
Did you enjoy the show?
That's the end of Jo-gu Ma's Horror illusion
Come on out
Amazing!
"Great job, today"
Just keep it up
You were great
It'd be nice if you were taller and your face smaller
Touch up your nose and eyes?
Great job
Thank you
You're a natural
Live with an actual ghost or something?
Wait
Don't go We're all going out for drinks
I have an appointment
You always say that
I have many appointments
"They asked students to turn off their cell phones in libraries, classes, hospitals and concerts and..."
Mom
- Mom!
- Huh?
Aren't you going to let me out?
What's wrong?
Does your stomach hurt?
No...
I'm okay.
Should I drive?
You don't even have a license.
You know what I mean.
"It's frustrating, unnerving,"
"- scary, sad, and futile."
-What is?
Poverty.
You know how long it's been?
Three years.
"But in those three years, nothing has changed."
I worked here part-time back then and I work here part-time now.
You've changed... you've grown much prettier.
You had no job then and you don't have one now.
"What drives me crazy is, in the future I'll be still here, and you'll be still unemployed."
Do you need a bag?
It costs 50 won.
- The total is 24 dollars and 80 cents.
"-Wait a bit more, give me a chance."
- I know I can do better.
- I've been waiting three years.
Hurry up and pay.
Will this work?
I think so...
I danced on stage with all my might.
"So my bones are thick, not thin."
Scanning Zelo's leg's to the end.
Shall we get started!
Shall we get started!
Who is this?
Shall we get started on filming?
It's my turn to lip sync for the MV.
I'm looking forward to it.
Since the background is so pretty.
Anybody with that background will come out very well for sure.
- Great job.
- Great job.
Great work.
MV lip sync is over.
Great work.
None
We have to shoot again.
My face is probably bloated right now.
I slept a lot.
It was past three thirty when I checked in the car earlier.
I feel tired but it was a good all-nighter.
"- oh, Jong Up is here too."
- Hi.
He's my manager for the day.
- Bring me some water.
- Water?
Then I gotta dig up soil...
"Then hurry and dig, here."
- It's cement so you'll be done in no time.
"- I don't think I can, I'm too sleepy."
This is an elevator in Las Vegas.
"-Anthony, not all French men are gay."
That sounds a little bit racist.
"-Okay, well, earlier today, he was doing some really questionable things."
"This is the living room, and I'll show you--"
Why are you holding my hand?
-Why would I not?
-Not gay!
-What?
-Not gay!
-What are you doing?
-Looking at gay porn.
"-Not g-- okay, that might be a little gay."
"-Anthony, you can't be so racist."
Just because his culture is different it doesn't mean you can spread lies about his sexual orientation.
-He was looking at gay porn.
-And who doesn't from time to time?
-True.
"-Dude, I gotta go."
I've been looking for French fries for the past five hours and I can't find them anywhere.
-(Pierre) I want to be... [knock on door]
"-(Anthony) Hey Pierre, are these your friends?"
They look like Richard Simmons.
"-You idiot, that's the Italian mafia."
-What the hell are they doing here?
-I have a lot of gambling debt.
I just can't say no to naked Twister.
"-Okay, it's time to eat s--t and die, sillies!"
-Yeah!
"You've messed with the wrong Italians, Pierre."
-I'm so scared right now.
Hold me.
-What?
I go to my post abroad tomorrow.
It's for a year.
Why didn't you tell me?
Let's meet and talk.
- Let's talk later.
I'm busy.
"-Wait, don't hang up."
- Wait...
-What do you want?
I'm sorry.
Call me later?
Here.
30 dollars.
Have you had lunch?
"If you haven't, would you like to eat together?"
"I'll treat, to thank you for everything."
You look like a young miss.
Isn't that your guy?
Bastard.
He told me he was away on business.
Where are you going?
"You can't be too happy right now, let's go for some fresh air?"
I don't understand guys like him.
Definitely not my type.
What's with the sunglasses?
They don't even suit you.
-Wait here.
I'll be back right away.. - I thought you were buying me lunch.
- Oh...
I didn't recognize you.
Hello.
- Don't pretend to know her!
We will see him together.
Okay have your seats.
He will be here soon.
Thank you.
"I see you put on a ring, Sami Bey."
"Yes, we did."
- Hayırlı olsun.
"- Amin, to all of us."
It's not much until 13 February.
"Yes, we're almost there."
- Excited?
- I'm too old to get excited like that.
Why do you say that?
You are still young.
You will have many great years together with Sami Amca.
"But still, you shouldn't listen to Cemre's marriage advices."
- Why?
"- I am getting divorced, that's why she's saying that."
"But Zeynepciğim, not even you can break my spirit today."
- I am so sorry.
- Don't be sorry.
"I mean, I am getting rid of my hunchback."
I filed my petition.
Soon it will be over.
- I wish you the best.
"- By the way, no one had forced Cemre to marry..."
I made a big mistake.
Everything is for the humans.
Hello Can Bey.
"Yes, yes, we had sent them to the factory."
"Okay, I'll be there in half an hour."
See you.
Shame on you!
Hello!
I wanted to surprise you.
I went through here and I had to stop by.
- How is your new job and....
- Serdar...
Live me alone.
What?
Look around you.
Everybody is looking at us... me...
Do you know what is being widow here?
"Narin, what are you talking about?"
"I, with my family and child, will have a new life."
Stay away from me.
Don't come anymore.
"When you see me somewhere, go to other side."
"Forget me,"
"So what's the prognosis, Fertile Myrtle?"
Minus or plus?
There it is this little pink plus sign is so unholy.
That ain't no Etch-a-Sketch.
"This is one doodle that can't be undid, homeskillet."
Just tell them.
I'm pregnant.
Who's the father?
It's Paulie Bleeker.
Paulie Bleeker?
I didn't know he had it in him!
"I know, right?"
Did you see that coming?
Yeah.
But I was hoping she was expelled or into hard drugs.
"I saw the window was open, I thought that maybe..."
Jesus!
I have a request.
I have something to ask you.
A request.
A request?
Just don't ask me to take this off.
I want to paint you.
Your face.
"Don't smile at me, My knees will go weak."
"Oh, wait!"
"I can't explain why I'm doing this, but you are difficult, too."
Just once... don't be so difficult!
Say something.
Say I'm not a thug.
I'll say something.
Those guys there are thugs.
"Hey, I asked you to say something!"
Wait!
"May10, 1995."
He's never a romantic but today after some romantic time suddenly he threw his body on me.
That bastard...
Beast!
Dad?
An unwished-for thing has happened.
That day I got pregnant.
"I got so scared, I ran to him."
"Abort it, he says."
That scoundrel...
Bastard!
I'll raise it.
"Healthy, smart, good-natured."
"No Ri,"
"Eun Jo, I'm fine."
I'm going to get healed quickly and come over to your house.
I will definitely come over too.
Yes.
You must come.
"Yes, I will definitely come."
No Ri didn't cry... and he held it in really well.
He's probably had to say goodbye to a friend that's gotten discharged first before.
Even though he's sad too.
"Eun Jo, we're going."
Eun Jo!
Congratulations on your discharge from the hospital!
"Ha Ni, you came back well!"
"Dad, what is all this?"
It seemed like I didn't know how you felt... and that I was being stubborn about doing things my way.
Dad.
"Up til now, the upstairs room... was really uncomfortable, wasn't it?"
"Seeing you cry (laugh?) at the hospital, I thought that you must be a part of this family."
Welcome Ha Ni.
(Seung Jo's) Mother.
Yeah.
"Welcome back, Ha Ni!"
"Thank you, Ahjushi."
Then what about my room?
Your room is with your brother.
No!
I don't want to give up my room again.
You need to say thank you to your noona.
No.
I just did what I had to do.
I'm tired.
Jana:
Our...
"Ju: with ""It Rains""."
Ju:
"Guys, since I listened to this song for the first time, I fell in love with him."
"I love his voice, the voice that doesn't belong to that 19 years old body!"
It's perfect!
"I like ""Wild and Young ""too, but every time I listen to this one..."
"""Wild and Young"" is good, but there is something especial about ""It Rains""."
Ju:
4th Place is Exo- Growl!
Ju:
What amazing song!
"Definitely, it is one of the best songs of the year."
I have...
Jana:
Of the year?
Ju:
One of... it's not THE best song.
"The best song for me is still ""Smoky Girl""  Jana:"
And one of Exo's best songs.
Ju:
Third Place F(x)- Rum Pum Pum Pum.
Ju:
"We did a MV Reaction, and I wanted to listen to again to see if I could like this song."
"And that's what happened, I really like it."
"The choreography is weird and cool, the song too."
"The lyrics are weird, it's about the wisdom tooth, and I mean they compare the wisdom tooth to their first love."
I thought that the lyrics were so crazy that that's why I liked Rum Pum Pum Pum.
So 2nd Place... my divas!
My band!
My Band!
I don't want to hear anything.
You will have to promise that you will not tell Suraj anything.
Why are you silent?
Promise me that you will not tell Suraj anything.
"All right, Vandana."
I'll do as you say.
I've got it!
This!
What did you get?
Did you find some treasure?
He is screaming as though he has found a treasure.
You'll dance forjoy when you hear the news.
My name and my picture will be in the papers tomorrow.
At least tell us about it.
What is the matter?
"Aunty, read this out to them."
Yes.
With your blessings.
Let me also see it.
- Wait!
"Oh, all right!"
Let her also read it.
"Congratulations, Suraj!"
I am delighted.
My friends have thrown a party and I'd like to take Renu along.
"Yes, of course. ..."
"Go and get ready, my child."
"Go and get ready, my child!"
Which is your favourite colour?
- What!
I mean.
Which colour sari should I wear?
He has a muffler round his neck and wore kurta pyjama.
Its all right.
I will search.
Did you see a person in kurta pyjama and a muffler.
No sir.
See the other side.
You dont worry.
I am asking.
Look that side.
"Sir, please wait sir."
Dad!
Are you here?
"No, I am under the train."
Come on.
"Listen, my father is has boarded the train."
"Wait madam, I am searching."
I am saying that my father is has boarded the train.
I said I am searching.
Why dont you understand?
My father is in the train.
What?
He is in the train?
Come soon.
"O rain, do not go away after dropping on the eyes."
Stay with me always just like the showers and lightning.
Why did you go away having roused the feeling of love?
If you want to come will I stop you?
Why are you standing here?
He could not catch the train.
What can you do about it?
Come on.
"How is your health, father?"
Okay.
"All right, all right !"
"- Good hustle, guys."
- Good hustle.
But you can still lose.
You all saw what happened to Oz out there.
I don't want to ever see any of you thinking you're gonna score.
You don't score until you score.
- Until you score.
"- That's right, baby !"
[ Coach ]
It all boils down to today.
"For you seniors, this marks the culmination..."
- of the past four years.
- Culmination.
[ Coach ]
I want you to think about what this means to you.
Do you guys wanna look back on your days at East... and know that you used the time you had ?
"- Hell, yeah !"
- You do !
- Ah !
"Good attitude, Ostreicher."
"- Good luck, fellas."
"Christ, I didn't tell ya to leave the game."
"I'm sorry, Coach."
"You got someplace more important to be, Ostreicher ?"
Yeah.
Ostreicher !
Oz ?
Fuckface ?
[ Coach ]
Ostreicher !
You took a lot of risk for us till now.

"Yes, we will also come with you."
You go from here.

They have entered the forest.
We got a message from Kasi.
He said that he will kill that man and .. .. bring the girl before the hour of marriage.
He said he will not be your brother if he fails.
"Uncle, make me as bridegroom."
He kept the ring I gave to him.
That means father lied to me.
And I believed his words.
I did a big mistake.
Come on.
Move away.
Do you want to die?
What do you want?
- I want a lift.
This bus belongs to a marriage party.
You will not get the lift.
"This is your bus brother, come inside."

The person Kanji had mortgaged his house to.. ..has sold it to me.
Here are the documents.
"And, Kanji bhai, sorry for that joke about God."
What's this?
How can he sell my house to him?
I was about to pay him on time.
I already paid him.
This isn't done.
This is my house.
Nobody can just buy it.
Relax.
Chill.
"When you get your compensation from God.. ..you can repay me, I will leave."
"And anyway, I always leave after my project is over."
Why buy the house when you want to leave?
Are you a agent?
I am not that low.
I've a consultancy firm.
I give advice to people.

Public service.
Service open to all.
A solution to every problem.

That'll be better for both of us.
"Come on, pull yourself together."
Bravo...
Bravo...
You've convinced even me.

- Look...
For years... ...
I worked my ass off to establish this empire.
"I'll strangle you, if I lose it because of you."
I will kill you!
"- Reşat, get out!"
- Shut up!
What are we gonna do now?
Tell me what's gonna happen now?
Soon they'll find Kerim too.
- What are we gonna do when they make Kerim talk?
- Kerim won't say anything.
- He wants to leave the country.
- Come on...
- He was threatening you to confess everything.
- Not anymore.
- We talked with him last night.
He's going abroad.
- So you saw him?
"- You didn't listen to me, is that it?"
- He had called Erdoğan...
God damn Erdoğan!
What did I tell you?
I want to go somewhere quiet.
What about you?
What's wrong?
No.
It's just... a bit uncomfortable.
Is it very discomforting?
"The world seems strange, doesn't it?"
Don't worry.
No one knows.
Let's go some place far.
It's so strange.
I don't think I'll ever come to a place like this again.
My heart is racing like a fish's.
"My heart's beating like a goldfish's, too."
Are we really going to do this?
"We don't even have any protection, do we?"
Condoms?
We come all the way here and don't do it?
Okay.
I'll go get some.
This place is not bad.
"Look at you, getting nervous."
Your face is burning.
I'm not nervous.
Wow!
You're really sensitive.
I am a little.
I like sensitive women.
Hey!
That tickles!
Don't!
I'm gonna start from the toe.
I -- wait -- 44875 -- did you leave out the number 6?
"Same as she did, OK."
You've got a seven-digit number -- call out any six of them loud and clear.
Volunteer:
"0, 7, 9, 0, 4, 4."
I think you left out the number 3?
AB:
That's three.
"The odds of me getting all four of these right by random guessing would be one in 10,000:"
10 to the fourth power.
"OK, any six of them."
(Laughter)
"Really scramble them up this time, please."
Volunteer:
"2, 6, 3, 9, 7, 2."
Did you leave out the number 7?
And let's give all four of these people a nice round of applause.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
(Applause ends)
"For my next number -- (Laughter) while I mentally recharge my batteries,"
I have one more question for the audience.
"By any chance, does anybody here happen to know the day of the week that they were born on?"
"If you think you know your birth day, raise your hand."
"Let's see, starting with -- let's start with a gentleman first."
"What year was it, first of all?"
That's why I pick a gentleman first.
Audience:
1953.
"1953, and the month?"
November what?
23rd -- was that a Monday?
[laughter]
David:
"Okay, [laughter] there are some asexual people who will masturbate."
"But I know that's like very, very difficult."
Joy: asexual
David:
"It seems counterintuitive, but yeah, thank you for saying that."
Think about it: you can like having sex with a man and not like having sex with a woman
You can like having sex with yourself and not like having sex with a partner.
Joy:
Yeah.
Star:
Wait.
"Now, you're describing something that's-"
Joy:
You didn't answer the question.
Do you like to have sex with yourself?
David:
"Oh, me, personally?"
Joy:
Yes.
David:
I've tried it.
I mean it was all right.
Joy:
It's not all that?
[laughter]
David:
Yeah.
[laughter]
Joy.
It's not all that.
Shame on you.
Shame on you.
"No, shame on you..."
For you raised that demon.
Shame on you.
How's your foot?
Is it swollen?
I see you wrapped it.
But heat won't do good if it's sprained.
Let's go see a doctor before it gets worse.
Don't be stubborn.
We can have breakfast too.
And buy you some clothes.
That's enough...
That's all we wanted to say.
It's up to you now.
Isn't she his sister?
Hoşgeldin.

"- Nothing, come on inside."
It's something that can't be forgotten.
Let everyone know that.
He should never come back to town again.
- Is he talking about Kerim?
- Never mind him.
You heard me Galip Usta?
He better not come back just because his abla is here.
Or he'll have his answer from the town folks.
What's this?
What are you trying to do?
"Meryem Hanım, let's go inside."
"It's Reşat Yaşaran who is making you do this, isn't he?"
And from that blood I'll write a name... ...outside Shreekant's bungalow.
Radha!
"That's great, mister!"
You lost before fighting a battle?
"No, sir."
I've not defeated.
Ever since my parents have died... ...I've been fighting life since then.
Sometimes with the name Jaikishan and sometimes as Jackie.
"My names kept changing, people kept changing."
But my destiny did not.
"But Mr. Bharat, the life of Jackie... ...is much better than Jaikishan."
Jackie is a goon.
Shreekant called me a goon.
- Mr. Jackie!
He called me a goon!
- Mr. Jackie!
Mr. Jackie!
"- Yes, I'm a goon, Shreekant."
I'm a goon.
"Fine, I don't want your daughter."
What do you think?
Will I come and beg at you?
Mr. Jackie!
- So what if I'm poor and orphan... ...I've lived on my own.
I'm very strong.
- Mr. Jackie.
I'm very strong!
"Jackie, the don!"
"Jackie, the don!"
"Jackie, the don!"
"Jackie, the don!"
Never mind if Radha's wedding cards are distributed... ...but I don't like Jimmy's character.

What makes me joyful this Saturday is this...
And a little terrified and really excited. woman:
"Oh, my God, did you feel that?"

Goodness.
Now your mama has made herself a little copy of Mama.
[woman speaking native language]
man singing:
I want to drink from the clearest water.
I want to eat the things I ought to.
"I just want to know that I feel strong, you know."
I want to reach the greatest mountain.
"Well, here."
What is this?
The monthly rent you paid us while you were living in our home.
This person couldn't bring herself to use it.
Why are you giving this back to me?
You shouldn't do this.
You helped us so much during that time.
I can't accept this.
Here.
"Ki Dong shi, are you really going to be like that?"
"If you don't accept it, I'm going to be mad."
Yes.
Just as your restaurant was getting really popular..
I know that you were going to build a second floor.
"And because of the new house, and Ha Ni..."
I also know that you couldn't do anything.
"But, still... this."
"Ki Dong shi, don't be like that and... just come live with us again?"
Yes?
I came out because of Ha Ni.
This is better for Ha Ni.
Pardon?
For Ha Ni?
How can you not know your daughter's heart?
"Actually, Ha Ni and Seung Jo... you don't know that they're trying to hide something from us do you?"
Pardon?
Hide something?
Those two have even kissed!
And Seung Jo did it first.
Kiss?
Seung Jo did?
Yes.
Take him to the hospital.
He being bit by a stroke!
Pay your debt first!
Give me the money!
He is dying and you're still thinking about your money?
It's only his nose to big deal!
The stroke is going to kill him.
Let me call the ambulance for you.
"Ping, get me the phone."
Anything wrong with your nose?
Is it the police or the hospital?
"Just the same, anyway."
I've got some loan shark here bleeding.
Please come quickly.
It's alright now!
He's managed to stop the bleeding.
Thanks.
Mom was right in saying that everything is predestined.
"Ever since Sylvester picked up those two letters, ...bad things take place one after the other."

"""The news-vendor kid called."
Sylvester's being hitting.
Come!
Hurry!
Look!
I don't live here!
"- Kerim, are you at work?"
"No, abi..."
I've quit the job.
What's up?
"Oh, why?"
"Anyways, maybe this is the best for us."
- Listen to me now...
"- What's wrong, abi?"
Come home now...
Or don't...
As there are still many reporters here.
It's better you park your car in the auto-park near the shore.
Then walk over here and call me when you're two streets away from us.
But don't let anyone see you.
- I don't get what this is about.
- I'll take you away from here for a few days.
It was five of six years ago.
Your dad made me buy this house.
This land is valuable.
You can do anything you want here.
"You can change it completely, if you want."
Why would I change it.
What is it to me.
"This land and this house is yours, Kerim."
"No, abi."
We're just guests here.
"Besides, I don't want a house or anything."
"We'll just spend a few days here, that's all."
- Thank you.
- Anyway... ...
It's too early to talk about all this.
There it is.
"Hey, look, I know it's hard."
But Jenna's gone.
And you're allowed to move on.
"Oh, you're still alive?"
I assume that means
Klaus didn't get his coffins.
"Well, don't look so happy."
I was only able to get one of them out in time.
The locked one.
Probably a good choice.
Yeah.
"You know, if you're banking on Bonnie's mama to open it, you're screwed."
She doesn't have any powers.
Ah.
Doesn't surprise me.
It's been that kind of night.
Is Elena ok?
I take it you two had a heart to heart.
And I take it you don't want to talk about it.
Noted.
So why don't we talk about this?
What did you do?
You have your family back.
Finally.
You're going to open them?
Not quite yet.
I still have some unfinished business to take care of.
What business?
"So, Niklaus..."
Elijah?
What did I miss?

Go with Serdar Bey.
"Good evenin, Zilan"
Ohhh. welcome...
"You are coming with full hands, again, I see..."
What can I say?
I am a middle man.
Serdar Bey buys and we carry the stuff.
How are you doing?
Are you okay?
Do you get weary?
"May God thank you, Inci abla, and Serdar Bey."
"If I said my prayers have been accepted, it would be true."
Are all your dreams this?
"A comfortable job, place?"
Enough money.. anything else?
Ali Asker... a person never stops dreaming of more...
"But, we don't have the strength (right) to ask for more than this."
"Nothing is certain, Zilan..."
"You are okay, right?"
Not bad...
"You are saying you are not good, then?"
"You are saying, 'don't even ask.."""
Good night.
Good night.
Didn't I say that you were not go there?
"That if you wanted to see your mother, to go during the day?!"
"And, Serdar is the one to drop you off!"
Why is this doctor still in our life???
Why do you bring this man to our door?
"I didn't want to, I said I could come by myself."
My mother said..
Why don't you listen to me?
- Show- off.
I'll just get a job probably.
As if someone would hire you!
"You really sucked at high school, didn't you?"
"If you didn't study in high school, you should at least study at college."
Going after housewives!

Miss Dewdrop.
I think I'm just going to go home.
Why?
To go study?
No.
You're disrespecting me and I can't stand it.

Fine!
Okay.
But we're only eating.
"Well, of course."
What else can we do with that thing...
Total mental castration...
My thing is fine.

- Huh?
I have to go somewhere.
Take a taxi or walk.

You missed an interesting spectacle.
That's alright.

We cannot force anyone.
Do you how much I had at that time?
Only 20 rupees.
Only 20 rupees.
Remember?
So do you know what I did?
I was wearing a similar gold chain.
And I gave that to him.
It's all about faith.
Anything you give is less.

Wow.
What a thought.
"Not just my gold chain, I will give up my gold ring too."
That's it.

"And the predicate is the verb, that's the action word that gets this subject up and out."

- I heard there were cases of whooping-cough in the village.
We must make sure our kids avoid all contact.
- Avoid any contact... contact... contact...
"- Oh, dear, I shudder to think about the parents' day."
As if we didn't have enough trouble with locals.
Now we'll get some walking infections from the city.
- So what.
It's all good!
"- Why, why does he insist on this ""parents' day?"""
- They say Mitrofanov will be coming.
- Aaah.
[counting]
- ...24 ...25.
- Put on your slippers!
Everyone put on your slippers!
- What's the matter?
"898 01:13:43,485 --&amp;gt; 01:13:46,715 Yes, you can dress up in my room, no one is upstairs."
"899 01:13:46,715 --&amp;gt; 01:13:48,000 Okay."

"903 01:14:18,067 --&amp;gt; 01:14:21,300 I am sorry but I am not in a good mood."
"904 01:14:23,000 --&amp;gt; 01:14:25,635 Do you know what is your problem ?"

We got married right away.
"908 01:14:40,135 --&amp;gt; 01:14:43,580 And this was the best decision in our live."
"909 01:14:46,100 --&amp;gt; 01:14:51,300 As child he use to say he would become an engineer, architect..."

I know he will make it now!
"913 01:14:58,500 --&amp;gt; 01:15:01,900 She will be an engineer and architect, like you."
"914 01:15:02,000 --&amp;gt; 01:15:05,400 Hopefully!"
My mom is excited.
"915 01:15:05,483 --&amp;gt; 01:15:07,351 You should get excited, you."
"916 01:15:07,351 --&amp;gt; 01:15:09,749 Of course dear, make everyone be ashamed, 917 01:15:09,800 --&amp;gt; 01:15:14,500 Make gumtree (Great surprise) to those who say: "" He will be like his big brother"""

"919 01:15:32,800 --&amp;gt; 01:15:36,700 Run, come on."

"927 01:16:11,300 --&amp;gt; 01:16:15,300 I saw him."

Thats one section
Alright
Hi
I am Roberto Toledo
I'm 19 years old.
I live in the city of Guanajuato.
In Mexico!
Guanajuato is north of Mexico City.
And it's a city of much culture and history.
This is my family.
"My Dad, Tomás"
He is a doctor.
Everyone says he's very serious.
"My mom, Berta who is in a travel agency here, en Guanajuato."
"My sister, Daniela."
"And Julio, my best friend."
"In this city, there's always many tourists."
"Last year, two North American tourists from San Antonio,"
Texas
"Good afternoon, and how can I help you?"
"Good afternoon, I am Carmen Toledo, and my daughter Linda."
"Venimos de San Antonio, Tejas."
"El Señor Balzar of the Agency ""Fuera"" spoke with you last week about making a reservation for us."
"Oh, yes of course."
Welcome to Guanajuato.
"I am Berta Toledo, at your service."
Pleased to meet you.
(Berta) Everything is ready.
I have a reservation for all of you in one of the best hotels.
"Oh, I'm so sorry."
Rumors have spread everywhere.
Huh?!
Are you sad?
Since the girl that was following you has left?
Seung Jo ah!
"Oh, it's the main lead of the rumor."
"Miss Calm Cat,"
When did you become like that with Kyung sunbae?
Have you heard?
The rumor that doesn't make any sense.
I'm leaving first.
Good luck
Congratulations.
Can you stay here by yourself until your brother comes back?
Of course.
I don't know when Seung Jo is coming though.
Do you think I'm a baby?
I also.... need to spend some time alone.
Look at you.
That's right.
"Alright, Eun Jo, We'll see you tomorrow."
Hurry!
Don't play too many games.
I won't.
Just leave quickly.
Let's go.
Ok
Aigoo
Alright!
Oh!
"""Seung Jo ah"" &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I came all the way here without even realizing it. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; How did I end up here? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;And it wasn't that long ago when I was so happy that we had our first date."
Let them be happy...
Sorry...
You bring us tea and etc...
That's why...
Bring your tea when you come next time.
I'll brew it for you...
"Please, no money!"
Mustooo!
My brother!
How are you?
Eh?
Look what Muko brother has brought for you...
Do you remember what you did to neighbourhood's dogs and cats?
"Wasn't this Uncle Aslan's dog, Kral (King)?"
Do you remember this?
We used to hunt with this in the garden of your village house.
You were the best slingshooter.
The children of the village still have marks on their head.
All of them are your marks...
"Look, do you remember this?"
"You did this to me, remember?"
"He doesn't even look, dude..."
He is completely lost.
Unbelievable...
My brother...
My dearest brother...
Come on...
Take this.
Musto???
You see...
"He took the sling, dude."
"Keep your maniac under control, brother..."
"JlN Dal-rae, from Youngbyun, Yaksan!"
"Dad, you named me, so don't forget it."
Okay?
"Dad, you're losing weight."
"Good morning! &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;That's Ji-hwan, a friend from neighborhood.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"I was out exercising, brought these for you. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Stopped his mental age around ten.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;How pitiful, so I play with him.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"Dal-rae! &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;He's Young-hoon, my boyfriend.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Good looking, huh?"
"Master of Taekwondo as well.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Always finishing in 1st place.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Took some time, but finally found myself the one.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
Hi!
Keep practicing.
I missed you.
Changed your hair.
It's pretty.
Let me walk you to the lecture hall.
That's okay.
Hey...
Took three months just to grab your hand.
Feels good!
Looking for Ji-hwan?
Yes.
I don't see him anywhere.
Hasn't come to practice.
Doesn't answer the phone either.
Hmm...
Do it for love of movies.
"Hi, how are you?"
"Good, how are you?"
"Excuse me, but..."
Can you hand me the tissues?
Damn!
Stop!
I'll kill you!
And be quick.
"Ok, boss."
Here the connection is removed.
Let us put it in the girls room.
"Hey Anjanna, put this lantern in the girls room."
"Hey, he is escaping with the girl."
Catch him.
Is everyone safe?
Let us go from here.
We are waiting for a long time now.
We didnt see any train.
I am scared.
Is there any train now?
Why are you scared?
Not for myself.
I am feared about Shailu.
I asked in the enquiry.
"There is only one train, that too goods."
It will not stop in this station.
Still Venkat and Jagan has not came.
How can we leave them?
Venkat told us to leave with Shailu whether he comes or not.
I dont come until Venkat is here.
Here they come.
Venkat!
Is everything all right?
Do you know how scared I am?
When will the train arrive?
There is only one goods now.
Let us somehow try to catch it.
You are not coming with us.
What are you saying?
So what?
Things are expensive!
Don't you have a job yourself?
How much can I make?
How about Moon?
What can he do?
I won't count on him.
Go to hell and don't ever come back! 你干嘛挂啦?
What are you doing?
Why begged him for his money?
I'll have money next week.
Thank you very much!
I don't want your dirty money.
What do you mean my ditry money?
You think his money is clean?
"Don't worry mon, I'm different now."
You can ask Ms.Lee.
I thought you said you'd go back to school.
Did you do that?
You're the same as your father.
Are you OK?
You may go home after 10 mins...
When will she come back again to further consultation with a doctor?
I'll call and inform you.
Make your daughter have a rest.
Hi there!
Your daughter got a stroke?
Stroke yourself.
Let me remind you.
You played me last time.
Don't ever try play tracks with me!
Pay!
He has forgotten all of us.
Hatun Abla...
Look...Maybe this baby will be born but...
Mustafa won't even recognize it.
"What kind of husband or man... ...or father he will be, that I don't know, but..."
"If you and the doctor ask and if Narin helps and goes to the hospital to see him,  maybe he will get better."
Stay away from Narin!
Enough of your malice!
Enough!
"Hatun Abla, for every cruelty I did to you... for my every misbehaviour, forgive me!"
Please...
"Look, I will cary you on my back until I die."
I will clean you...
I will be your slave.
"Please, forgive me Hatun Abla."
"Doctor, please help..."
"Look, If you want, I can give you golds I kept at my mom's house."
"Fatma, take me..."
"Hatun Abla, please!"
"Hatun Abla, please forgive me."
Pull yourself together...
Get up...
Please...
Inci Teyze...
Get up my girl...
"Hatun Abla, please..."
Asiye...Pull yourself together...
Maybe you should give her some medicine???
"Not now, mom..."
Let me take you home.
They will be worried.
Who will worry about me?
Move over.
Let's go to the station first.
I'm gonna throw them into the can!
I'm gonna throw you into hell!!
"-You guys come along too, we need witness."
- Ok.
You stop!
Stop there!
You stop right there.
"Come here, you..."
Don't come any closer.
Let go of me.
Don't follow me!
Stop right there!
"Man, I'm dumb."
"I should have ran downhill. if you don't have the smarts, the body suffers."
"Dammit, look who it is?"
Dear hubby.
You bastard.
You put someone after me!
Where are you?
Tell me now!
I You're dead!
You crazy?
Tell you where I am?
You think I won't catch you?
I'll chase you to the end and throw you in the can.
Sure.
I'll just go to the ends of the earth and wait.
We'll have it out there!
Are you in your right mind?
Making jokes?
What sight of love did you cast on me!
You made my plight bad.
Even beautiful face is a vice.
My heart is yours.
I promise you.
My heart is yours.
I promise you.
I understand your intentions.
I have already studied the book of heart.
What sight of love did you cast on me!
You made my plight bad.
Even beautiful face is a vice.
People only cast evil sight.
What sight of love did you cast on me!
Greetings.
- Greetings.
Good!

Why are you inviting trouble?
"lf Tiger singh found out, he will not spare you!"
Get lost!
Hey!
"Don""t aggravate the matter!"
Fine!
I am dead for you!
"But don""t instigate my son!"
Who are you to separate me from my son? son?
Whose son?
"A criminal""s son?"
"A smuggler""s son?"
Take your son!
I hate him! seema!
You can hate me as much as you want!
"But don""t abuse my son."
Nobody is born evil in this world.
"People""s circumstances make them evil."
"20 years ago, destiny played a cruel joke on my family."
You know.. my father used to work in the lighthouse. stop!
Think before you do anything!
I have thought about it!
"Let""s inform the police!"
How will we reach to the police? smugglers have surrounded the lighthouse!
Have you also joined hands with them?
You may think so.
Traitors!
"Today because of people like you.. ..the country""s state is bad!"
Patriot! sheela!
You! - shekhar!
What happened to you?
- Father!
Who has done this to you?
Traitors!
Raman has joined hands with the smugglers!
Today I saw him.. and he did this to me!
"I won""t spare him!"
So there are lots of seafood restaurants near here.
"Like Busan of Korea, sort of?"
I think I'm near the coastline.
"Yes, that's where I'm filming for the MV."
Young Jae looks really like a model today.
We're finished with lip-synching now. only one last scene in San Francisco remains.
I'm scared.
They don't bite right?
Nah they don't.
They say this is a town for rich people.
Doesn't it look like a set?
I guess these places are models for sets.
None
It's pretty good.
I hear Americans usually sprinkle cold lemon on shrimp to eat.
But I think Koreans heat up shrimp to eat.
I guess only Americans do this.
I think for some people it suits their tastes.
I don't really like seafood.
"San Francisco video shoot is a wrap! okay, good job for now."
Good bye.
Now we'll be moving on from San Francisco to Las Vegas to film.
This is Las Vegas.
The weather is really nice.
It's warm.
Las Vegas!
It's warm.
"Weather is good, scenery is good."
I feel good.
"""Seoul, Tokyo N New York City"""
Everyone is making bets going around.
Las Vegas!
Will you... will you listen to me?
You can ask for my life.
Because now I will not be able to live without you.
Kishan!
You...
You... surrender yourself.
"Sacrifice makes love immortal, Kishan."
Love is a test.
"And those who fear it's result, their love is just a pretence."
You may be a criminal in the eyes of society... ...but you are a true man in my eyes.
And I want to show this to the world.
- Radha!
Kishan!
Show them that even your heart is full of love.
You too can feel pain.
You are a true person.
I'll do as you say.
- Kishan!
Radha!
Don't cry!
"Don't cry, Radha."
Now that I've got you... ...I don't even fear gallows.
I'll surrender myself.
Kishan!
I'm proud of your love.
And I'll always be proud of it.
- Radha!
"Kishan, promise me that whenever you'll return... ...we'll meet at this place."
Near this temple.
- Sure!
If I'll come back.
"Don't say that, Kishan."
"Mira!&amp;gt; Okay , we will talk later."
Can you stop for a minute?
I am trying to explain you something.
Can you wait for a minute?-it's OK.
Stop it!
Stop it!
Please!
You always are like this.
Go!

- Who are you protecting?
- I killed Ferhat.
Brother.
"Hey, brother."

We just wanted to wake you up for breakfast.

- Yes.
What else did they say?
"My friends also say.. when men become fervent.. ..then they should meet the girl""s father and not the girl."
I think your friends have fallen in love with me.
And by teaching you wrong things they want to get rid of you.
And they want to form a relationship with me. seema.. how is your friend?

"Look, I'm telling you the truth."
"You've gotta trust me, Pete."
"Mate, you've put me right fucking in it."
If I don't convince those boys... ...that the head of their firm was not just taken by a fucking Yank journo... ...the GSE is done.
So I'm gonna go out there... ...and I'm gonna tell them that Bov's got it wrong... ...and that you're one of us.
And I had better be fucking right.
"So, Bovver... ...is there anything else you wanna tell us?"
"Listen, Tom, please."
This is how it's gotta go down.
"You're the only one going down, little Bovver."
Grass.
Fuck.
This shit with Bovver could tear this firm apart.
"Mate, I need you."
"Stay with us, just through Millwall."
I'm not gonna help you.

"Hello, Terry."
Fuck off!
Terry.
Terry.
Look who's back in the fucking Abbey after all these years.
Just get it out.
"If you keep squirming, maybe I'll feel sorry for you."
You've changed.
Something's different about you.
You're stronger.
Tougher.
"You're not the only one who changed, Stefan."
We all had to.
That's good to know.
There's something I have to tell you.
And it's not because I feel guilty that it happened.
It's because I feel guilty that you don't know.
I kissed Damon.
There.
All done.
What happened to him?
He was found in the woods.
An actual animal attack.
Bite marks and gashes over half his body.
Lost about 3 liters of blood.
"Well, is he going to make it?"
Nope.
At least not on his own.
What is that?
Exactly what you think it is.
Vampire blood.
You wanted to know my secret?
I cheat.
I'm a doctor and I hate when people die.
"So when I have the ability to do something about it,"
I do.
Stefan...
Today...
I'll sell all my flutes on half rates.
Now leave your hopes for me.
And take care of yourself.
Doctor has warned you not to play flute.
Doctor only identifies our disease... ...but not our pain and poverty.
"Shanta, you are my life."
I can't live without you.
Don't say that.
Yet our Kishan has to grow up.
He has to study and be a good citizen.
"Yes, okay, Shanta."
I'll not play flute.
But at least I can sell them.
"C'mon, Kishan, today we'll sell all the flutes."
"Ramu, come here."
Come!
You won't get anything by playing flutes.
Mr. Pasha!
My wife is very sick.
I'm in need of money.
Do you want money?
Take this money.
Take it.
Buy all my flutes and give me the charges.
Flutes?
What will I do with your flutes?
Play some tune!
Your favourite one.
The one that expresses love.
"Yes, I'll play it too."
I'll play all the tunes.
Do you see this star?
I want you to draw this star down here.
Take your time.
You worked so hard on that!
I want you to pick up a penny in one hand and then you're going to put it in these fingers.
Drop it in here.
OK can you do three of them?
You do one at a time.
Take one from that hand and put it in that one.
Great job!
Let's put them back.
This time I'm going to count while you do it and then time you.
So you're going to go as fast as you can when I say go.
Ready?
Go.
OK.
Let's do it one more time.
Ready?
Go.
OK.
Start with one hand and one foot in front of us and the other hand and other foot are going to be behind us.
I'm going to jump and switch them.
Jump and switch them.
Can you try it?
Alright.
You have to switch your hands and your feet at the same time.
OK are you ready?
When I say go I want you to go until I say stop.
Ready?
Go.
Good.
Stop.
"Oh-ah, oh-ah."
"It feels like a perfect night,"
"For breakfast at midnight,"
To fall in love with strangers.
"Oh-ah, oh-ah."
Yeah!
"We're happy, free, confused,"
"And lonely at the same time,"
It's miserable and magical.
Oh yeah!
"Tonight's the night when,"
"We forget about the deadlines,"
"It's time, uh-oh!"
"I don't know about you,"
But I'm feeling twenty-two!
"Everything will be alright if,"
You keep me next to you.
"You don't know about me,"
"But I'll bet you want to,"
"Everything will be alright,"
"If we just keep dancing,"
"Like we're, twenty-two, twenty-two!"
"It seems like one of those nights,"
"This place is too crowded,"
Too many cool kids.
(Who's Taylor Swift anyway?
Ew).
"Oh-ah, oh-ah."
"It seems like one of those nights,"
"We ditch the whole scene,"
And end up dreaming instead of sleeping.
Yeah!
And transformation magic
"Overrated, right?"
I needed something really unique
Just then
I saw a strange woman
One more time?
She never smiled
Like she had a dark secret
I can't really explain it
So
I followed that mysterious woman
It felt so strange
How should I put it?
Like a ghost was about to pop out of a wardrobe
Just then
I had an awesome idea!
Exorcist magician
Rattle
Wardrobe ghost
Magic spell!
HORROR MAGlC SHOW
Jo-gu Ma Rocks!

SPELLBOUND
Why did you come here?
The one who killed you is here?
Is the killer watching you
"That was because I felt like you were doing the wrong thing, not because I hated you."
"We're friends, that's why I..."
I took care of Choi Chul Joo.
The girls have all been returned to their parents.
And Choi Chul Joo... paid for his crimes.
Did you do it?
That's great!
"Well done, Young Master!"
I always knew you were a good person!
You're smiling!
Look at that!
"If you do good, you'll smile automatically!"
Look at how nice you look when you smile!
That's enough.
Fine.
You're so stiff.
Why did you hug me like that just now?
"Young Master, do you...?"
Did any suspicious men come for you?
How did you know that?
- Then what happened?
- Suspicious men did come for me.
Who are you?
Are you Heo Yi Nok?
"That's right. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Yi Nok, what are you doing?&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
Send him away!
I...
I'm so full that I've laid down.
How did they...?
"My granddaughter has never been full in her life, you fools!"
That's fortunate.
I'm really lucky.
It doesn't have to fall on you.
The coffin is spelled shut.
That makes it a witch problem.
So it does fall on me.
I was bound to see my mother again sooner or later.
Sooner.
"Abby Bennett Wilson, Monroe, North Carolina."
"Born in Mystic Falls hospital, graduated Mystic Falls High, blah, blah, blah."
A little compulsion helps to speed up the research process.
This is her.
"Yep, road trip."
I call shotgun.
"Yeah, no."
Why?
You want me to hang out in the back with you?
"You're not coming, Damon."
Why?
I'm the one who found her.
"Ok, Damon, look,"
Bonnie hasn't seen her mom in over 15 years.
We don't need your snarky commentary narrating the experience.
What's going on with you two?
We kissed.
Now it's weird.
Have a great trip.
What are you doing here?
I came to apologize.
Apologize?
You bit me.
I could have died.
"I think we're way past apologies, Tyler."
That's the problem.
Look there.
Gods are bare-bodied.
Like this.
They're never fully covered.
"That's your wedding photo, right?"
- Yes.
Wearing that traditional attire.
"So, did you only wear a traditional attire.. ..since your wedding?"
"No, right?"
- No.
See.
That's our older image.
"Conch in one hand, mace in the other."
Where are yours?
"lf I keep holding them all day, won't my arms hurt?"
Think.
"Actually, our latest photos haven't been updated on Facebook."
"People still use the older ones, and we let them."
We don't have a problem.
- Let them.
- That's enough.
You're boring me now.
"Get out, leave."
Mahadev!
- Mahadev!
- Only you can hear and see me.
"Yes, coming."
Coming.
Mahadev!
What happened?
"What happened, Kanji?"
See him.
"You are blind, your father is blind !"
What are you doing?
Why are you boxing?
Neelambar!
How come you are here?
I'm in trouble.
- Are you out of it?
How did you get rid of the trouble?
- I stuck it on someone else.
That's the rule.
Everyone transfers his trouble to someone else.
What's happening?
Why are horns blaring?
I think there is a queue for petrol.
- It's a traffic jam.
Tell him!
"Before the traffic gets jammed, let's go to our Neelambar Pitambar store."
Let's go to our store.
Understand in one attempt sometimes atleast.
Where are you going?
"Drive fast, sister."
- I am driving fast.
"This is not a plane, it is a rickshaw."
Where do you want to go?
Left or right?
- Take a right.
Take a left.
Stop.
In the garden.
Over there.
- Where?
I'll tackle him.
"Hey, why are you going away like that?"
What will you lose if you stay with me for some more time?
Oh God!
Did you get wet again?
Take this and dry yourself.
Pandarta?!
The train has no scheduled stop here.
Why did it stop?
- How should I know?
Then why are you sitting there?
Go and find out.
Oh!
My ring fell down.
This is a valuable ring.
You should not lose it.
Keep it.
This is the ring your father gave the first time.
Keep it.
Bananas!
Apples!
Salutations sir.
Why did the train stop?
The water is going over the tracks.
It may take about two hours to recede.
Please come and sit in my room until then.
Idiotic rain!
"Hey, ring up uncle and find out how father is."
At the same time ask him to send some vehicles.
We cannot stay here a long time.
Who is he?
"- He is Badri, son of Dasanna."
"He has so many people around him, is he such a big shot?"
Feels loyal to Klaus because Klaus' blood created him.
He released me from a curse that was ruining my life.
I owe him for that.
I need you to bite your girlfriend.
A hybrid bite would kill a vampire.
Consider this me putting your undying loyalty to the test.
Klaus can't control me.
Not when it comes to you.
Ahhh.
Oh!
"Oh, no."
Did you just...Bite me?!
Caroline!
Get away from me!
I figured out how to open it.
Can you?
Let me out!
Please!
"Oh, my God, oh, my God."
Hey!
I'm in here!
I'm in here!
I'm in here!
I've been having these dreams for days now.
It's like the witches are trying to send me a message.
I just can't believe you guys have kept this from me this whole time.
"Stefan thought if you knew where the coffins were,"
Klaus could threaten people to get the information out of you.
So these are the rest of his family?
"Yeah, Elijah and two others."
Now this one...
Is the one we can't open.
Is it okay living here?
"Since it is a guest room, it is kind of small."
But it's tolerable.
I'm only staying here for a little bit anyways.
We're staying here until the new house is built.
Will it be okay?
What?
I'm talking about Hae Ra.
She was the one you were meeting today. . .
How could you have parted that way.
"Well, since she was with Kyung Su Sunbae."
"Excuse me, Hae Ra."
I have something to tell you.
"It's really hard for me to say, so I hope you will listen."
I know.
I am not good enough.
Pardon?
Not good enough?
Then have mine too.
I didn't mean...
Foo... food is enough.
I'll continue.
"I have tried my best not to think about it,"
But I keep thinking of you. . .
Should I just leave?
I have a headache.
"You have a headache? then, you should take some medicine for it."
"Take your time, I will pay and leave now."
Hae Ra.
I know that I lack a lot of things.
That's why
I decided to try hard and not think of you
Yes!
"You're happy I got tickets for the game, huh?"
Yeah yeah
Huh?
"You're happy, huh?"
"Yeah yeah, it's great"
"That's a nice gift, isn't it?"
Yes!
"It really pleased you, huh"
"It wasn't easy to get tickets, huh"
"Well, it was easy for me, one my friends works in an office and was able to give me tickets"
"On top of that, we have good seats, I think"
"I'm not a soccer fan, but, really, I'm happy"
"Also, I must say it's a beautiful game"
"A nice game, no, really, I like it"
"I feel good seeing him happy, it pleases me, it's..."
Really...
Thank you!!!
"Oh, you're not gonna put make-up on, again?"
"Look, Loulou, my lipstick is all gone"
What?
Miss Universe!
Miss Universe...
"Careful, there, oh!"
"Stop it, Loulou, you're being silly"
"Oh, come on!"
"But, look, you're an idiot!"
Careful!
"Stop it, Loulou, it's really not funny!"
"I know it's not funny, can't do anyhting about it, it's the car that does that all the time"
"Stop it, I'm telling you!"
"Oh, come on, breathe!"
"Cind-who? fuck'n ""rella""?"
Jesus!
Who the hell's naming these kids?
Goddamn my head.
So it turned into a yearly ritual.
Is that a crime?
Yes.
"OK I have a huge family, and yes OK I may have snuck into their homes after dark - but only because I didn't want to wake them."
What?
I told you - I'm not one to skimp on the Gandja..
Ahhh... it's called MUNCHlEEEES.
Ya - all I did was eat a few cookies and maybe grab a glass of milk?
And are you forgetting I DlD leave them a few gifts?..
So what?
What's the difference if I do the Return or someone else does the return for me?
They still get to exchange it for something they want.
Oh come-on.
I'm sure a toddler can find something cool from Joe's Big-Boy Shop.
What?
No fuck'n way!
You can't pin that on me!

Just you wait...
Let's go to the hospital and visit my yenge then.
That's what we're doing right now.
- You're gonna talk to her today?
- Nope.
I won't... until she comes and apologizes to me.
You're the man!
- What are you doing here?
- Can we ask you a few questions?
"- No, you can't."
- Just a few.
"Look, we said it all at court."
You are helping them by doing this.
"But you took the money and  set up a business with it, didn't you?"
"No, no."

"The fight or flight response lets animals respond quickly to threats. This system is universal in vertebrates. That shows it is ancient in origin, and very important."
"Humans have some problems with the system, because though they share the physiology with other animals, they rarely face a clear-cut fight or flight choice. Humans can try to talk their way through various problems and semi-threats, but they may suffer stress when the issues are not easily solved."
Other responses.
Animals respond in many ways to situations which threaten them. The fight/flight choice is just one alternative. At one extreme is the way mother cats with kittens will defend them to the death if necessary. Another situation is the way many animals keep still when a predator is nearby.

Career.
"Shirov became the World Champion (under 16) in 1988, and achieved the title of grandmaster in 1990. He is the winner of numerous international tournaments."
"In 1998 Shirov's ranking rose to number four in the world. On the basis of his rating, he was invited to play a ten-game match against Vladimir Kramnik to select a challenger for World Champion Garry Kasparov. Shirov won the match with two wins, no losses and seven draws. However the plans for the Kasparov match fell through when funds could not be raised. When Kasparov played Kramnik for the world title in 2000, Shirov maintained that the match was invalid and he was the rightful challenger."
"In 2000, Shirov reached the final of the FIDE World Chess Championship, losing to Viswanathan Anand."
"In May/June 2007 he played in the Candidates Tournament of the FIDE World Chess Championship. He won his first round match against Michael Adams (+1-1=4, won in rapid playoff), but was eliminated when he lost his second round match to Levon Aronian (+0-1=5). In November/December 2007 Shirov played in the Chess World Cup. He lost in the final 2.5-1.5 to Gata Kamsky."
"In May 2009, Alexei Shirov achieved the greatest triumph of his career by placing 1st in the high Category 21 M-Tel Masters 2009 tournament, a double round tournament held in Sofia, Bulgaria. He was undefeated, and scored 6.5/10—seven draws and three victories, two against Vassily Ivanchuk and the other against Magnus Carlsen in the final round. By this success he was given entry to the Grand Slam Chess Final 2009 in Bilbao where he met Levon Aronian, Sergey Karjakin (winner of Corus 2009), and Alexander Grischuk (winner of Linares 2009)."

James Joyce
"James Augustine Aloysius Joyce () (2 February 1882 – 13 January 1941) was an Irish writer and poet of the modernist movement. He was from Dublin, Ireland. He wore an eyepatch, because of eye damage. He could not see well."
"His books are written in a special style. At first he wrote in a way which describes very accurately how life is, in the short story collection called ""Dubliners"". In his next book, called ""A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man"", he started a new style. It is called stream of consciousness, which is writing all the thoughts that a character has. His work influenced many other writers in the 20th century."
Some books that Joyce wrote are:
Early life.
James Joyce was the oldest of ten children. He went to a boarding school called Conglowes Wood College and later to Belvedere College. (College here refers to secondary school not to university as it can in the U.S.) Conglowes was run by Jesuit priests.
Legal case.

Because Aultmann could not pay for insurance and storage, she sold the painting to Ronald Lauder to put in the Neue Gallery in New York City."
Legacy.
"Bloch-Bauer had a large influence on modern art. Also, in 2016, the street Bloch-Bauer Promenade in Vienna was named after her and her husband."
In popular culture.

"and, uh, I decided it is not worth it."
Uh-huh.
"That,"
"I, I like to get tan in the Summer time because I think you look healthier."
"And, uh, we are just crazy"
"But you, you know, it is interesting because you get out in that sun an awful lot."
"Now my sister is a, a sun fiend."
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, she is five years younger than me,"
she is more wrinkled.
Is that right?
"Yeah,"
Take it easy.
Uh-huh.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye
All rightie.
Okay.
Do you have a budget that you go on?
Yeah.
I sure do.
"Uh, I have, it's pretty much a ledger sheet"
"and I just write down all my bills, how much I'm going to have to pay"
and I do it per paycheck for me which is every other week.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"Uh, I mean I include everything from groceries to insurance to car payments to credit card payments, you know, everything."
Uh-huh.
And it tends to work out pretty well that way.
"I can anticipate, you know, a little better."
I usually try to guesstimate
"and then when the bill actually comes in, I go ahead and fill in the actual amount."
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
That way I know how much pocket change I'm going to have left at the end of the month  or at the end of the paycheck anyway.
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
Uh-huh
So that works okay for me.
Uh-huh.
"Well, my bills I usually know approximately how much they're going to be."
Right.
"Each month they are more or less just about the same, you know."
"Uh-huh,"
Oh my goodness.
"And with our budget cuts, I'm sure  that's not going to not going to change anytime soon."
Yeah.
"Well that's the only way they're. Yeah, well, that's the only way they're going to be able to do it."
And parents who really want their kids to have any humanities are going to have to do that.
Oh my goodness.
"So, in some ways I think the, the day schools do serve those purposes."
Yeah.
That's true.
"Well even the preschools, you know they get so much of that in preschool"
"and then when they hit kindergarten, you know, it's like wham  Culture shock."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"It's just,"
Put the colors away
"Yeah,"
yeah.
Get the computers out
Which is too bad.
"and, you know."
Uh-huh.
hard.
Uh-huh.
It's so difficult for them.
"Um, did you have your children, did you say in home, in, in, private care,"
was that in your home or in someone else's home?
Until they were two.
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
both times they were at our house.
Uh-huh.
So you were able to have somebody come there.
"Are, are you a T I-er?"
"No,"
"no,"
I work there as a temporary.
"Oh, really."
"But, are you at T I?"
Oh yeah.
So you have to do the random drug testing.
"Oh, yeah,"
"yeah,"
yeah.
"In fact with me, this is, it's not much to talk about,"
I'm so much for it.
I don't really have much to comment about it.
There've been some interesting subject that they've called about.
"How many times have you called,"
or have you been participating in this?
"Oh, about ten or eleven calls."
"Oh, you got ten,"
"well you, you've passed me up."
Right.
This is about six times.
Oh.
"As contract person we have to do random drug testing, too."
Yeah.
It doesn't bother me.
I don't feel like it's really a violation of privacy or anything.
"No,"
I think it's good.
"In fact, I don't know what the statistics were,"
but I think that they were surprised to find it so low.
"I think they were expecting to find, uh, like the national average at T I."
"I, I started when I was in, uh, third grade,"
"and I've, I still play the piano as of today."
Do you?
"Yes,"
I do.
"I started,"
I think I was in the fifth grade
and I played it for maybe three months
"But, then, again, I was also in, uh, the marching band."
"I played the drums,"
"I played the clarinet,"
I played the trumpet.
Wow
"Uh, you know, whatever"
"and so I, I still sing,"
and I sing in the choir today
"so,"
All right
"I I enjoy the music,"
it gives me an out.
Yeah.
"It always sounds like,"
"for my playing the piano when I was depressed and didn't have anything else to do and there was no one to play with I could always go play with the piano, you know."
True
"So, how long did you play?"
Only for about three months.
Three months.
"Yeah,"
me and my brother both took the classes
and we got pretty bored quick
"I was going to say, you got as far as the, uh, chop sticks, huh."
"Um, well, I could play, uh, the wood chuck song."
"Yes,"
I am familiar with that.
"I, where I live is a house that's seventeen years old when I bought it."
"And we bought it from someone who was in it,"
"but before they had it, I found out after I had been in the house, it, it had sat empty for the better part of a year."
Uh-huh.
"And I'm not sure what happened,"
"but I do know the folks that we bought it from had done virtually no maintenance for, for about four years."
"Oh, no."
"I, I, I found a lot of things,"
"but,"
"I say Arlington, Texas now because I talked one night to somebody in Arlington, Virginia."
"Oh, my,"
yeah.
"Well, and Plano, Texas rather than Plano, Illinois."
"Oh, do they have one?"
"Yes,"
they do.
"Oh, I didn't know that."
"Well, I learned something already"
Yeah.
"Well, let's see,"
"the three questions are what, uh,"
How much time do you spend with your children?
Very little. Because they're grown.
Oh
What?
They're grown and gone.
"Oh, yeah,"
"well, mine is, uh, down at U T Austin at college"
and the other one is in high school.
Huh.
"But he's in a box, right?"
"No,"
"no,"
"no,"
"in fact, it's funny."
"He never did, does come in out of a box, I don't think."
"Yeah,"
he was just kind of walking around.
Didn't he used to?
Not really.
He was always in the box before.
Oh.
"Oh, that's, yeah, that's, okay."
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
that's what I was thinking.
"Well, do you do any recycling?"
"Uh, we do here."
"Uh, see, what do we recycle?"
"We, they recycle,"
they have bins
Yeah.
"and they also have centers where you can take aluminum cans and, uh, plastic bottles"
and I think that's all they have.
Oh.
What about you guys?
"Well, we, uh,"
"there is a lot of things that you can recycle down here, although the only thing I guess I wind up recycling religiously is, uh, aluminum cans."
Uh-huh.
"But, uh, we've got a, we've got a couple of different things, uh, places, uh,"
they're like unattended aluminum can smashers
"And you can go up there and, and, uh, redeem,"
"yeah,"
"I see what you're saying,"
"there's less character development, rather just the, the, the funniness of the gag,  rather than"
"Yeah,"
yeah.
Did you go with kids though?
"and how it fits with the character , right."
Did you go with kids?
Excuse me?
Did you take kids along?
"No,"
"we went, uh, without the kids,"
"it's was a night out, away from the children."
"Oh, I would have liked to have a kid with me, I think, preferably someone seven or eight just, just to get a sense for, you know, how, how it affected them. especially to come home"
Oh.
"and, you know, I would have gotten in trouble the next day,"
I'm sure.
"Uh-huh,"
"yeah,"
"that, that's true."
"I, I was thinking about that too,"
"I saw that, um,"
"that's why I watched another silly movie, um, um, with my cousin, was uh, uh, the one about the, um, the turtles,"
"Oh, TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES."
Right
Uh-huh.
"yeah,"
"I saw that with my cousin, just to see what, you know, what the kids are into"
"And your cousin's a kid,"
"and that is,"
"yeah,"
he's a little
"I, we're, we're new to Iowa"
"so that's something that I hadn't, you know, looked into before."
"But that's one way to sort of get money and still recycle, I guess."
"Yeah,"
"I know a lot of places, they, uh, uh,"
Okay.
"Okay,"
I guess we're ready to start.
"Well, I guess, what part of what part of the country do you live in?"
"I'm in Dallas, Texas."
"Oh, okay."
What about yourself?
"Well, I'm also in Dallas."
Okay.
"The reason that I ask is the two conversations I've had, have been out of state."
Uh-huh.
"But, uh, have you always lived here in Dallas"
"and,"
"No,"
I've lived here for almost five years now.
I see.
"And I'm a, uh,"
"before that I was at school in Rochester, New York"
and I'm originally from Boston.
"Oh, well, you are seeing quite a different climate and quite a different neighborhood."
"That's right,"
but I like it.
You probably have enjoyed getting away from the snow.
"Well, I missed it at first,"
but now I go back there
and I'm a real wimp about the cold
So I like it here.
right.
"But, uh, at, uh, Christmas time we just have a regular sit down dinner, you know. Which is kind of hard because you got so many people"
Uh-huh.
"and then by time you pass everything around,"
it seems like everything on your plate's cold.
I know.
I know
"So,"
"Well,"
"But anyhow, I,"
"Thank God for microwaves, you know."
"Yeah,"
"you can, always take your plate and just heat it up, you know."
Yeah.
"But, uh, other than that, I, I don't have too many parties."
"Uh, you know, I have, like, maybe just a another couple over for dinner."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"But, uh, other than, than, than that I don't have, you know a whole bunch of people like except, except at Christmas"
Yeah.
and I have my family.
"Right,"
well I don't anymore.
it's been a few years
"and, and, uh, I don't have, you know, over a couple either"
"and and, uh, I try to, uh, have everything all ready"
Uh-huh.
"and, and it, it just makes it a lot nicer where a don't spend all my time in the kitchen."
"Yeah,"
right.
"And, uh, Spaghetti"
Right.
"You know, if, if you really wanted a gun, you, you could make one. Uh,"
Uh-huh.
"And I think if they want one, they're going to get one."
"Oh, you know"
You know.
true.
That's true.
"The bad guys are, you know,"
"like I say, if they want a gun they're going to find out somehow to get one."
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
"it's,"
"yeah,"
"I mean,"
yeah
"there's, there's no way to stop, uh, stop anybody from getting a gun."
"Uh, I think there should be more control as, like, uh, like maybe waiting periods and things like that, you know, uh,"
"Well I agree with you on that because I know, uh,"
in fact I had bought my son a rifle like for a Christmas present one time.
Uh-huh.
And for a rifle there's no waiting.
There wasn't anyhow.
Now there might be now.
Yeah.
"But there wasn't anything for, you know, rifles and things like that."
Uh-huh.
"I guess  it was just handguns that there was a, some kind  of a waiting, you know, two weeks while they checked you out or something."
Sure.
Yeah.
Right.
"But, uh, most of these people that's got these guns that's going around, you know, robbing people and shooting people,"
And that was hard too.
"I, I lucked out with really good people both times"
but I know so many people that are never able to find that
"and I'd practically give my paycheck away to do it,"
so
Yeah.
Yeah.
Did you have a nanny
or did you have someone  that lived in with you?
Yeah.
"Well no,"
she didn't live with us.
"Uh, the first one was an, elderly lady who was putting a, a daughter through nursing school  just purely on baby-sitting money."
Oh.
Oh my goodness.
And she kept Cheryl during the day and then did more baby-sitting at night.
Uh-huh.
And she was neat because she was like the grandmother that my kids never had  because both our parents are dead.
Yeah.
Oh.
"So that, that was a plus from  that respect as well."
Oh gosh.
And then with Emily it was a neighborhood friend that kept her.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"So,"
"I have, uh,"
I just cannot fathom putting a little bitty baby in a commercial care center.
Uh-huh.
"I was just listening to a program this morning,"
"oh well, I guess it was on the HOME SHOW,"
"but they were talking about, uh, a new, uh,"
"They aren't testifying really in their own words,"
Right.
"Yeah,"
"I can remember, uh, friends of Daddy ..."
There we go.
Okay.
"Well, uh, what do you think about taxes,"
do you think we're paying too much?
Yes and no.
"Income tax, no."
"I, uh, I look at it this way, uh, you've got to pay for the privilege of living here."
Uh-huh.
"But, uh, being a, uh, a rec vehicle owner,"
"well, in fact, I live in a motor home."
I'm a what they call a full timer
"and, uh, it burns gas like crazy."
I only get seven miles to the gallon.
I really resent this fact that they keep adding on gasoline taxes
"and they call it, uh, uh,"
"what's the word they use,"
"anyway, a, a luxury tax."
Yeah.
"They add it on on to tires and gasoline, cigarettes, liquor."
It doesn't bother me any because I've quit drinking
and I quit smoking.
"So, that doesn't bother me"
but I don't think it's fair.
Yeah.
"It's too, um, um, it's attacking just certain people."
How true.
Even with the gasoline tax.
Yeah.
"Okay,"
what kind of dinner parties have you had?
"Well, I've had them, uh, where I've served up to twelve to sixteen people."
Uh-huh.
"Uh, and I had help with them."
"Uh, and part of them I did were like a buffet"
Uh-huh.
"and, uh, it,"
"I had, uh, just different, uh, side dishes and appetizers"
"and one of them that, that I'd remembered was, uh, some, uh, sausage hors d'oeuvres"
"and, uh, anyhow, uh, you take, uh, a couple of, uh, cups of Bisquick and, uh, sausage, oh, like a, a Owens mild,"
Uh-huh.
"you can, I guess you could use the hot if you wanted to."
"Whatever you like, huh?"
Yeah.
Yeah.
"And, uh, you put that in"
and then you get some real sharp cheddar cheese and put that in and a little bit of milk and make it all doughy
Uh-huh.
"and then, like, I just put them in little balls and bake them for about fifteen minutes"
Um.
and they are so good.
"Oh, that sounds delicious."
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's making me hungry for them right now.
Yeah.
"You know, I've made like little Swedish meatballs,"
"but they're just made out of the beef, you know. And, uh, with spices and things in them. But never anything mixed with Bisquick."
Have you?
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"I think that's,"
Which I think they have to do on rifles and things now too.
"I think there is some, something like that."
Uh-huh
"Anyhow, here, out here in California, I think there is now."
Yeah.
Yeah
"But,"
"I'm not sure,"
"I'm not really sure but, what uh, the gun laws in Pennsylvania are like."
Uh-huh.
Now we don't have guns because we don't go hunting or anything like that.
No.
Uh-huh.
"But like I say, my son, he's, he's always had a,"
"like, I think his first little rifle that we got him was like he twelve or thirteen years old."
Uh-huh.
"But he's always, he went to the, to the school to learn how to shoot it."
He goes to the pistol range
and and the rifle range to shoot them.
"He likes to go to that, uh, shotgun thing where you shoot at those, uh"
"Oh, yeah."
"The skeets, you mean?"
"yeah,"
right
He likes to do that you know
Uh-huh.
"But, uh  I don't know."
Yeah.
"I think they should try to control it and everything, you know."
"But as far as just banning it completely, there, that's not going to happen."
I worked for P I E
"and then, uh, they went bankrupt"
so I just went ahead and took my early pension.
Uh-huh.
"Oh, uh-huh."
But I only get that once a month.
"Oh, that's tough."
Yeah
My roommate only gets paid once a month
and that last week's pretty lean generally speaking
Yeah.
"So,"
so.
Yeah.
"So, you know, I really have to try to budget, that I don't go over that amount, you know, each month."
Right.
"I, for, for years got paid once a month"
"and, and in ways I liked it because I could go ahead and pay all my bills at once."
Uh-huh.
"There's always one or two stragglers that usually they were,"
for me it worked out that they were the smaller ones
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
but I would pay all of them at one sitting
"and I would know okay, you can go spend this much on groceries now and you get this much a week and that is it."
"Yeah,"
right.
"And, and it worked okay for me."
Uh-huh.
I don't know.
"And,"
"Right now I, I'm in the mode of trying to dig out of debt, I think as everybody is"
"and that, that's true, uh, uh, you know,"
"the, the water was murky,"
and I would hate to think about catching fish or anything there
Huh-uh.
"huh-uh,"
no
I wouldn't want to eat them.
"No,"
"So,"
"no,"
no.
Yeah.
You went to Galveston.
"Uh, I have a favorite hotel that extends out over the water"
Uh-huh.
"the, uh, what is it, the Flagship?"
Yes.
Uh-huh.
Is it still there?
It sure is.
I like that place.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"It most certainly is, so, uh, so that, it, it was, it was certain things that were enjoyable about it,"
"but, uh, I don't, I think it's lost a lot of it's appeal since then, because of all the oil spills that they have had,"
"and, uh, it always smelled the entire time we were there."
"It was,"
"I didn't realize that had happened, for some reason."
Yeah.
"We went swimming one time, in the whole week that, we were there,"
"and the rest of the time we stayed in the pool, because the water was so awful,"

Claes Corneliszoon Moeyaert or Nicolaes Moyaert or Mooyaert (1592–1655) was an authoritative Catholic Dutch painter. He followed Rembrandt in his use of red chalk.
Moeyart was born in Durgerdam. As a young man he is thought to have traveled to Italy to see and experience its art. At 25 he married Grietje Claes (in 1617). Possibly he was in business with Pieter Lastman in St. Antoniesbreestraat.
"Moeyaert painted many biblical and mythological scenes, and also designed Amsterdam's triumphal arch for the arrival of Maria de Medici. On 1 September 1638, he stood on the Spaarndammerdijk to watch the procession."
"Moeyaert was a very rich man and had three children, two mentally retarded and cared for in his own home. He had stakes in the business of Hendrick van Uylenburgh, a famous art dealer, related to Rembrandt's wife, Saskia van Uylenburgh."
"Moeyaert was for many years' commissioner of the Theatre of Van Campen, with Jan Vos. He lived until his death at a house on the Singel, not far from Torensluis. Nicolaes Berchem, Salomon Koninck, Jacob van der Does and Jan Baptist Weenix were his pupils."

"Kemp graduated from Centennial High School in Franklin, Tennessee. He attended Vanderbilt University, where he played college baseball for the Vanderbilt Commodores baseball team. In 2011, Kemp was named the Southeastern Conference's (SEC) Freshman of the Year and First Team All-SEC. He was a key contributor on the first Vanderbilt baseball team to make it to the College World Series. In 2012, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Cotuit Kettleers of the Cape Cod Baseball League. He was named an All-American and the SEC Baseball Player of the Year in 2013."
"The Astros selected Kemp in the fifth round of the 2013 MLB draft. In 2015, Kemp began the season with the Corpus Christi Hooks of the Class AA Texas League. He received a midseason promotion to the Fresno Grizzlies of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League, and appeared in the 2015 All-Star Futures Game."
"Kemp began the 2016 season with Fresno, and was promoted to the major leagues on May 16. He was optioned to Fresno on June 25, 2016, when A. J. Reed was called up for his debut. On August 7, 2016, Kemp was recalled to the Astros. After former Astros center fielder Carlos Gómez was designated for assignment, it was said that Kemp and Jake Marisnick would be splitting duties in centerfield."
"On March 19, 2017, he was optioned back to Fresno. On April 27, 2017 the Astros promoted Kemp to the major leagues to replace injured Teoscar Hernández. On May 1, 2017, the Astros optioned him back down as Marisnick was activated off of the disabled list."
"On September 2, 2017, he was called up to the Astros and played in their doubleheader against the Mets, their first home game after Hurricane Harvey. In 17 games with the Astros, Kemp had a .216 average and 4 RBI. The Astros finished the season with a 101-61 record and eventually won the 2017 World Series, their first ever championship title. Kemp did not participate in any playoff action, but was still on the 40-man roster at the time, and won his first championship title."
"In March 2018, the Astros optioned Kemp back to Fresno. He was called up on May 16 to replace Jake Marisnick. In the 2018 season, Kemp played in 97 games for the Astros, batting .263/.351/.392 with 6 HR and 30 RBI, playing primarily in left field. He was mocked by the Fenway Park crowd and organist during the second game of the 2018 American League Championship Series (ALCS) when he took an extended period of time to return to the batter's box after a foul ball. Following the third game of the 2018 ALCS, Kemp received wide sports media coverage for making a leaping catch against the left field wall on a ball hit by Steve Pearce. The Red Sox challenged the catch at the wall, since it sounded like the ball hit the wall first. After further review, they announced the catch as confirmed, meaning the MLB replay crew in New York saw conclusive evidence of the catch. In game four, Kemp hit a fourth inning solo home run off Rick Porcello after only hitting six homers during the regular season."
"On July 26, 2019, the Astros designated Kemp for assignment to activate Carlos Correa."
"His 2019 season with the Astros ended with a disappointing .227/.308/.417 line over 163 at-bats, while setting a career high with 7 homeruns in just 66 games, prior to being traded."
"On July 31, 2019, the Astros traded Kemp to the Chicago Cubs for Martín Maldonado."

On January 17, 1976, the Kalispell Regional Hospital was completed and ready to render patient care. The old hospital (Kalispell General Hospital) became ""Courthouse East"" and was used by the county for various offices until a new courthouse building could be constructed. In 1975, A.L.E.R.T., helicopter ambulance service, flew its first patient. In 1981, a medical/surgical Intensive Care Unit was added. In 1985, Brendan House, an extended care facility, was opened.

Denizen is an action computer game published by Players Software in 1988 for the ZX Spectrum.
"""Denizen"" is a science-fiction action flip-screen maze game, with a top-down perspective. The player controls a marine, with the aim of detonating twenty explosive bolts on each of three levels. The marine is armed with a rifle and is initially supplied with 99 bullets. The player can only move orthogonally, in half-tile steps. Each screen may contain one or more enemies, who move toward the marine in a straight line until they reach an obstacle. The enemies attack the player merely by contact, draining the character's health in a manner similar to ""Gauntlet"". Each enemy requires two bullets to destroy."
"Health is regenerated by returning to the marine's start point on each level. If he is out of ammunition, this also supplies him with a single bullet. Items that can be collected include single-use keycards to open locked doors, ammunition, and a torch which allows better vision in dark areas."
"""Denizen"" received poor reviews, with criticism being levelled at the slow character movement. The weapon firing mechanism was a particular complaint; ""The self-loading 'Quick Kill' rifle... is anything but quick"", ""[The rifle] acts in the manner of an aerosol gun, two slow puffs and off goes yer fly"".

The preface to the 1860 edition explains that the novel has been less popular than his other works of fiction due to the prejudice against literary works that are thought to owe their value, in part, to the illustrations."

Almamen attempts to guard his daughter's Jewish heritage by keeping her away from her Moorish lover, Muza.

NRLM will be implemented in a mission mode. This enables:
"(a) shift from the present allocation based strategy to a demand driven strategy, enabling the states to formulate their own livelihoods-based poverty reduction action plans."
"(b) focus on targets, outcomes and time bound delivery."
"(c) continuous capacity building, imparting requisite skills and creating linkages with livelihoods opportunities for the poor, including those emerging in the organized sector."
(d) monitoring against targets of poverty outcomes.
"As NRLM follows a demand driven strategy, the States have the flexibility to develop their own livelihoods-based perspective plans and annual action plans for poverty reduction. The overall plans would be within the allocation for the state based on inter-se poverty ratios."
"The second dimension of demand driven strategy implies that the ultimate objective is that the poor will drive the agenda, through participatory planning at grassroots level, implementation of their own plans, reviewing and generating further plans based on their experiences. The plans will not only be demand driven, they will also be dynamic."

"William G. ""Slicky Bill"" Greene, Jr. (1812–1894) was a friend of Abraham Lincoln and a businessman in Menard County, Illinois. Greene founded Tallula, Illinois in 1857, and Greenview, Illinois is named after him."
"Greene, along with his brother L.M. Greene, and William F. Berry, attended Illinois College in Jacksonville."
"By September 1831, Greene's parents lived 2 miles (3 km) southwest of New Salem; Greene, then age 19, was hired by recent arrival Abraham Lincoln to assist at Lincoln's mill and store. In early January 1833, Greene bought the inventory of Reuben Radford's store in New Salem for $400; Lincoln drew up and witnessed the mortgage. The same day, Greene sold the same inventory to Lincoln and Berry, now Lincoln's store partner, for over $600. When Lincoln had a debt judgement entered against him in 1834, requiring Lincoln to surrender his horse, Greene turned in his own horse instead; this horse was probably the one Lincoln had paid him with in 1833. Lincoln eventually paid Greene back after becoming an attorney."
"Greene was also an acquaintance of Richard Yates, and introduced Yates and Lincoln in New Salem; Yates became Governor of Illinois during the Civil War and Lincoln became President."
"Greene and Lincoln remained friends; though Greene was a Democrat, Lincoln, as president, appointed Greene as internal revenue collector for the Peoria district. In ""Lincoln's New Salem"", author Benjamin Thomas relates a story in which Lincoln introduced Greene to Secretary of State William H. Seward by saying that Greene had taught Lincoln grammar: When Greene later reminded Lincoln that all Greene had done was held the grammar book and checked the answers, and was not very good at grammar himself, Lincoln is said to have replied ""Well, that was all the teaching of grammar I ever had."""
"Greene had nine children. By March 1853, Greene and his wife, Louisa Green, lived on a farm near Havana, Illinois; their seventh child, Gaines Greene (1853–1918), was born there on March 3. Sons Carlin, McNult, Byrd, and Vance, and daughter Julia Greene, died before Gaines; sons Scott and Frank and daughter J. S. Noble outlived Gaines."
"Within months after the birth of Gaines Green, the family moved near Tallula, and William Greene spent most of his life in Tallula Precinct. Greene, along with Yates, J. G. Greene, T. Baker, and W. G. Spears, laid out the village of Tallula itself in late 1857. William Greene and physician J. F. Wilson established the local bank in May 1877."
"Greenview was laid out in October 1857. It was named after William Greene because he convinced the railroad to come through the town: located on the Chicago, Alton & St. Louis Railroad, Greenview was incorporated by a special act of the Illinois General Assembly in May 1869."

Veiss being appointed Chief of the Auxiliary Police. At the end of 1941, he became First Deputy Director General of the Director General of the Interior when the Latvian Self-Administration was reorganized."
"As early as autumn 1941 Latvian auxiliary police units, temporarily attached to the Wehrmacht, were first used in front line duties. This occasional employment continued until the 2nd Latvian Brigade was formed from six Latvian battalions, four of which had combat experience. At the end of April 1943 a three battalion formation fighting under name of Latvian Legion was withdrawn from the front line and renamed 1st Volunteer Regiment of the SS (Latvian), with a change of Wehrmacht ranks to those of Waffen-SS. Voldemārs Veiss was given command of this regiment, which was a part of the 2nd Latvian Brigade, and received a rank of Legion-Obersturmbannführer.

"""No Good Advice"" is a song by British girl group Girls Aloud, taken from their debut album ""Sound of the Underground"" (2003). The song was written by Aqua's Lene Nystrøm Rasted, Miranda Cooper, Brian Higgins and his production team Xenomania, and produced by Higgins and Xenomania. It has themes of rebellion, reflecting Higgins' general mood of failure after a business partnership fell through."
"Following the overwhelming success of Girls Aloud's debut single ""Sound of the Underground"", the group waited five months until May 2003 before releasing the follow-up. The song cemented their success when it peaked at number two in Ireland, Scotland and on the UK Singles Chart. ""No Good Advice"" performed moderately elsewhere, reaching the top forty in the Netherlands, the top fifty in Belgium and peaking at number 88 in Australia."
"The music video features Girls Aloud dressed in futuristic silver outfits and hologram effects. ""No Good Advice"" was promoted through various live performances and has since been performed on Girls Aloud's first three concert tours. Described as ""a disco track with guitar"", the song has heavy 1980s influences. The track was lauded by many contemporary music critics, who deemed it a worthy sequel to its predecessor and praised Higgins' production."
"Musically, the song was labelled ""a disco track with guitar - a cross between Blondie and The Bangles."" The song was written in the key of Bb minor. The song consists of a verse followed by a bridge and chorus. In place of a middle 8, there is a guitar solo instead. The song ends with a spoken outro."
"Originally written for Miranda Cooper under the pseudonym Moonbaby, ""No Good Advice"" seems to be about a rebellious girl who doesn't need ""no good advice"" and does things independently. However, according to an interview for ""The Guardian"" in July 2004, Brian Higgins said that the song reflected his general mood of failure after a special deal between Xenomania and London Records fell through in 2000, and about persisting in spite of what people told him to do or not to do. The song's chorus originally began with the phrase ""I don't like fried rice"". ""No Good Advice"" was sung over a rave backing track, until different Xenomania musicians were asked to contribute new backing tracks. Higgins was inspired by indie rock. He stated, ""pop music was on its backside and indie music was about to rise [...] The guitar riff on No Good Advice is very very similar to the riff on the track Michael by Franz Ferdinand."""
"Brian Higgins said that Girls Aloud initially didn't like the song - ""we played them some of it, and they said: 'That's not our sound.' I objected to the use of that phrase 'our sound'. I told them they had five minutes to talk about whether or not they wanted to continue with me. They went away and spoke about it and since then it's been fine. They come in expecting to work, and there's a trust there which, I think, dates back to that day."""

"Rao Kandhal was the ruler of Chachabad (in the present day Rajasthan state of India). He was known as Rawat Kandhal, or Rao Kandhal, after being bestowed with the hereditary title of Rao by his elder brother, Rao Jodha. He was instrumental in wresting back Marwar from Rana Kumbha along with his brother and establishing the separate kingdom of Bikaner for his nephew Rao Bika. Later, he established his own principality of Chachabad and was killed in an ambush while fighting the Delhi Sultanate forces at the age of 73."
"While camping at village Chattriyan, near Sirsa, Rao Kandhal was ambushed by the forces of Bahlol Lodi. He called on his sons Rajsi and Sura for help, who were with him; however they fled leaving their father cornered. With only fifteen men around him, they gave fight with Rao Kandhal slaying nine men and drawing swords with Bahlol Lodi himself. The battle resulted in the death of the 73-year-old Rathore chief."
"Rao Bagha at the time was at Chachabad along with his son Rao Banir. Along with the forces of Rao Bika of Bikaner and Rao Jodha of Jodhpur, Rao Bagha led his forces against Bahlol Lodi and exacted revenge for his father's death. He was killed in this battle."

The Easter Island butterflyfish is native to the waters around Easter Island and is found nowhere else. Its preferred habitat is on reefs and among volcanic boulders heavily clad in brown algae at depths down to about . Juvenile fish are sometimes found among corals in rock pools.
"Juvenile Easter Island butterflyfish have been observed to act as cleaner fish, picking parasites off the skin of larger fish. During the breeding season, male and female adult fish form pair bonds."
"The Easter Island butterflyfish is a bottom feeding fish. Examination of its stomach contents have shown that it feeds on polycheaete worms, shrimps, fish eggs and barnacles, and fragments of the black sponge ""Amphimedon"" sp. were also found. This was unexpected as butterfly fish are not known to feed on sponges, however the explanation may be that the sponge was ingested in error when the fish was feeding on the barnacles which had become entangled in the sponge."
"At one time this fish was listed as ""Vulnerable"" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature in their Red List of Threatened Species but in 2010, this was changed to being of ""Least Concern"".

= = = Masterpiece (Roy Lichtenstein) = = =
Masterpiece is a 1962 pop art painting by Roy Lichtenstein that uses his classic Ben-Day dots and narrative content contained within a speech balloon. In 2017 the painting sold for $165 million.
"According to the Lichtenstein Foundation website, ""Masterpiece"" was part of Lichtenstein's first exhibition at Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles from April 1 – April 27, 1963, featuring ""Drowning Girl"", ""Portrait of Madame Cézanne"" and other works from 1962 and 1963 When discussing another work (""I Know...Brad""), Lichtenstein stated that the name Brad sounded heroic to him and was used with the aim of cliched oversimplification. ""Drowning Girl"" is another notable work with Brad as the heroic subject."
"The source of this image was a comic book panel with the two subjects positioned similarly to their position here, but they were situated in an automobile. In the source image the narrative content of the speech balloon said ""But someday the bitterness will pass..."""
"""Masterpiece"" was part of the largest ever retrospective of Lichtenstein that visited The Art Institute of Chicago from May 16 to September 3, 2012, the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. from October 14, 2012 to January 13, 2013, the Tate Modern in London from February 21 to May 27, 2013 and The Centre Pompidou from July 3 to November 4, 2013. Several publications presented ""Masterpiece"" as part of their announcement of the retrospective."
"In January 2017, Agnes Gund sold the 1962 painting ""Masterpiece"", which for years hung over the mantle of her Upper East Side apartment, for $165 million. The proceeds of the sale will be used to start a fund for criminal justice reform called the Art for Justice fund. The painting is currently one of the 15 highest prices ever to be paid for a piece of artwork. The purchaser was Steven A. Cohen."
"""Masterpiece"" is regarded as a tongue in cheek joke that reflects upon Lichtenstein's own career. In retrospect, the joke is considered ""witty and yet eerily prescient"" because it portended some of the future turmoil that the artist would endure. In the painting, the blonde female's speech bubble, ""Why, Brad darling, This painting is a masterpiece! My, soon you'll have all of New York clamoring for your work!"" conveys her remark as she gazes at the painting, of which a corner of the back is shown. Silent Brad conveys his agreement by his facial expression. Adrian Searle of ""The Guardian"" says that the 1962 work, whose narrative and graphical content were both borrowed, was timely because Lichtenstein had his first exhibition in New York City at Leo Castelli Gallery that year, making the painting aspirational in an ironic way that comments on success and ""the socio-sexual status of the hot young artist"". The satirical commentary on Lichtenstein's career, followed the inside joke made the year before in ""Mr. Bellamy"". According to Roberta Smith of ""The New York Times"", ""Masterpiece"" was one of Lichtenstein's works created in a way that produced ""faint and uneven"" Ben Day dots."

Fraser Patrick (born 8 November 1985) is a Scottish professional snooker player from Glasgow.
"Patrick started his professional career in 2002 by playing Challenge Tour, where he spent three seasons without success. In 2007 Patrick earned the Scottish nomination to make his Main Tour debut. Aside from Grand Prix, where he won four matches at the round-robin qualifying stage and finished third in his group, he was to struggle for wins during his debut season and was relegated from the tour."
"With the introduction of Q School, Patrick came agonisingly close to regaining his tour place, twice losing his final match both in 2011 and 2012. Nevertheless thanks to his high Q School ranking Patrick was able to compete in all the major ranking tournaments of the 2012/13 season as an amateur. He enjoyed his best ever performance at the 2013 German Masters, where he beat Michael White and Martin Gould to qualify to the venue stages and was leading Ali Carter 3–1 before eventually losing 5–3. He also recorded an impressive 10–6 win against Luca Brecel at the World Championship qualifiers. Patrick was to end the season on a high note, as in the final round of Q School Event 3 he edged out Ashley Carty 4–3 to regain his place on the main tour."
"Patrick managed to win just three matches during the 2013/2014 season, all of them in the minor-ranking European Tour events, to end up ranked world number 119."
"His 2014/2015 season was much better as he started it by beating Jimmy White 5–2 to qualify for the 2014 Wuxi Classic. In Patrick's debut at a Chinese ranking event he lost 5–3 to Sam Baird. He whitewashed Stuart Bingham 4–0 at the minor-ranking Paul Hunter Classic and then defeated Matthew Stevens 4–3 and Jamie Jones 4–1 to reach the last 16, where Rod Lawler ended his run 4–0.<ref name=""2014/15""></ref> Patrick won his first ever match at the venue stage of a ranking event by seeing off Jamie Burnett 6–4 at the UK Championship. He then knocked out world number 22 Ryan Day 6–4, during which he made a 139 break which went on to be the third highest of the event. In his second last 32 appearance at a ranking event he lost 6–3 to Judd Trump. Patrick qualified for the Indian Open, but lost 4–2 to Jamie Cope in the first round. Patrick could not get into the top 64 in the world rankings (he was 77th), but by finishing 40th on the European Order of Merit he earned himself a new two-year tour place."
"Patrick began the 2015/2016 season by whitewashing Michael Williams 5–0 and beating Tom Ford 5–1 to reach the third qualifying round of the Australian Goldfields Open, but lost 5–3 to David Morris. He was knocked out in the first round of the UK Championship 6–4 by Michael Holt. Patrick lost in a deciding frame to world number three Neil Robertson in the first round of the Welsh Open."
"At the 2016 English Open, Patrick eliminated Zak Surety 4–1 and James Wattana 4–2 and then narrowly lost 4–3 to John Higgins in the third round. He reached the same stage of the Northern Ireland Open after only conceding one frame during wins over Marc Davis and Duane Jones, but he was thrashed 4–0 by Barry Hawkins. Patrick lost the final two frames both times in his 6–5 and 5–4 first round defeats to Michael White and Mark Joyce at the UK Championship and China Open respectively. He entered Q School to try and stay on the tour as he has finished the season outside of the top 64 in the rankings at world number 105, but failed to advance beyond the third round of either event."
"In May 2019, Patrick came through Q-School - Event 2 by winning six matches to earn a two-year card on the World Snooker Tour for the 2019/2020 and 2020/2021 seasons."

"Denmark used the Dansk Melodi Grand Prix 2002 contest to select their entrant to the Eurovision Song Contest 2002. The final was held at the Cirkusbygningen in Copenhagen on 9 February 2002 and was hosted by Michael Carøe and Signe Svendsen. The winning song was chosen by 4 televoting regions, SMS voting and an expert jury in two rounds of voting — firstly to select the best 5 songs, and then to select the winner. The expert jury included composer of several Danish ESC entries Keld Heick, singer Gry Johansen (Denmark 1983) and singer Sanne Gottlieb (Dansk Melodi Grand Prix 2000 and 2001). The winner was Malene Mortensen with the song ""Vis mig hvem du er"" which was translated into English as ""Tell Me Who You Are""."
"Mortensen performed 14th on the night of the Eurovision Song Contest 2002, following Finland and preceding Bosnia and Herzegovina. Despite being one of the favourites to win, it only managed to receive 7 points coming last of 24 countries, forcing Denmark to skip the 2003 contest."
= = = Mustang Aeronautics Midget Mustang = = =
The Mustang Aeronautics Midget Mustang MM-1 is a single-seat aerobatic sports airplane developed and marketed in the United States for homebuilding. It is also known as the Long Midget. It was the predecessor to the Mustang II which is also known as the Bushby Mustang. Rights to both the Midget Mustang and the Mustang II were sold to Mustang Aeronautics in 1992.
"It is a low-wing cantilever monoplane of metal construction, primarily of 2024-T3 aluminum and most are fitted with fixed tailwheel undercarriage. Developed by Piper engineer David Long in 1948, plans for production by Schweizer were underway at the time of Long's death two years later. All rights and tooling were purchased by Robert Bushby in 1959, who built a 90 hp Continental powered example and sold plans and kits until 1992 when the rights were sold to Mustang Aeronautics. The Midget Mustang design being marketed in 2016 is similar to the original, with the option of building it with a bubble canopy in place of the straight line of the upper tailcone and hinged canopy of Long's original design, making it an M-IA."
Construction requires about 1000 hours of builder time.
"The Midget Mustang was intended for air racing. David Long designed an aircraft for a friend to be used in the Cleveland Air Race in 1948. That aircraft was built by Long and was named ""Pea Shooter"". The Midget Mustang was only moderately successful as a race plane. However, its appearance and desirable flight characteristics made it an ideal sport plane. At the Cleveland Race, racers competed in aircraft with names like, ""Mammy"",""Miss Fort Worth"", and ""Slo Poke"". Over time, air racers modified the aircraft to reach 181 mph (291 km/h) speeds in competition. Nowadays, the Midget Mustang can cruise at 240 mph."

= = = Belmont railway station (Harrow) = = =
"Belmont was a station in Belmont, north-west London on the Stanmore branch line. It was opened on 12 September 1932 by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway as the only intermediate station on a short branch line (opened in 1890) running north from Harrow & Wealdstone to Stanmore, in anticipation of the Metropolitan Railway opening its own branch line to a new Stanmore station (now served by the Jubilee line) the same year."
Belmont station was rebuilt with a central island platform and a passing loop. The rebuilt station opened on 5 July 1937. The station was located on the north side of Kenton Lane to the west of Belmont Circle.
"From the perspective of the branch line, the connection to the main line was north-facing, i.e. away from central London. Hence the branch line could not take direct commuter services from the city, limiting its operation to a shuttle service."
"The direct service provided by the Metropolitan offered strong competition to the L&NWR station at Stanmore and passenger services beyond Belmont were ended on 15 September 1952, though a daily freight train served the goods yard at Stanmore. The passing loop was removed in 1955. The line to Stanmore was closed completely on 6 July 1964, as part of the railway cuts implemented under the Beeching Axe. Passenger services from Belmont to Harrow were withdrawn on 5 October 1964."
The track was lifted in 1966 and the station site is now occupied by a car park.

"He Zhen was from Wuyuan County, but spent much of his time in Nanjing. He had a wide-ranging influence, and founded the Huizhou (Xingyuang) or Wan (Anhui) school of seal-carving."
"He's work aspired to an antique, ancient appearance, and he was known to chip or otherwise artificially weather his seals to create the impression of age. He created this effect by exploiting natural fracture lines in the stone, or by emphasising the knife-marks made whilst incising the inscription. His calligraphy attempted to echo that of the Han Dynasty, and he used the simplicity of that script to ameliorate the elaborate stylistic flourishes of the popular Yuan-style calligraphy that had previously been used for Ming-era seals."
