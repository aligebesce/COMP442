`` Five . ''
How Slightly longed to say it .
"He wetted his lips to be ready , but Hook came staggering out , without his lantern ."
"`` Something blew out the light , '' he said a little unsteadily ."
`` Something ! ''
echoed Mullins .
`` What of Cecco ? ''
demanded Noodler .
"`` He 's as dead as Jukes , '' said Hook shortly ."
"His reluctance to return to the cabin impressed them all unfavourably , and the mutinous sounds again broke forth ."
"All pirates are superstitious , and Cookson cried , `` They do say the surest sign a ship 's accurst is when there 's one on board more than can be accounted for . ''"
"`` I 've heard , '' muttered Mullins , `` he always boards the pirate craft last ."
"Had he a tail , captain ? ''"
"`` They say , '' said another , looking viciously at Hook , `` that when he comes it 's in the likeness of the wickedest man aboard . ''"
"`` Had he a hook , captain ? ''"
"asked Cookson insolently ; and one after another took up the cry , `` The ship 's doomed ! ''"
At this the children could not resist raising a cheer .
"Hook had well-nigh forgotten his prisoners , but as he swung round on them now his face lit up again ."
"`` Lads , '' he cried to his crew , `` now here 's a notion ."
Open the cabin door and drive them in .
Let them fight the doodle-doo for their lives .
"If they kill him , we 're so much the better ; if he kills them , we 're none the worse . ''"
"For the last time his dogs admired Hook , and devotedly they did his bidding ."
"The boys , pretending to struggle , were pushed into the cabin and the door was closed on them ."
"`` Now , listen ! ''"
"cried Hook , and all listened ."
But not one dared to face the door .
"Yes , one , Wendy , who all this time had been bound to the mast ."
"It was for neither a scream nor a crow that she was watching , it was for the reappearance of Peter ."
She had not long to wait .
"In the cabin he had found the thing for which he had gone in search : the key that would free the children of their manacles , and now they all stole forth , armed with such weapons as they could find ."
"First signing them to hide , Peter cut Wendy 's bonds , and then nothing could have been easier than for them all to fly off together ; but one thing barred the way , an oath , `` Hook or me this time . ''"
Hook wetted his dry lips .
"` Ay , ' he said , ` that 's the fear that haunts me . '"
Since sitting down he had felt curiously warm .
"` Smee , ' he said , ` this seat is hot . '"
He jumped up .
"` Odds bobs , hammer and tongs I 'm burning . '"
"They examined the mushroom , which was of a size and solidity unknown on the mainland ; they tried to pull it up , and it came away at once in their hands , for it had no root ."
"Stranger still , smoke began at once to ascend ."
The pirates looked at each other . '
A chimney ! '
they both exclaimed .
They had indeed discovered the chimney of the home under the ground .
It was the custom of the boys to stop it with a mushroom when enemies were in the neighbourhood .
Not only smoke came out of it .
"There came also children 's voices , for so safe did the boys feel in their hiding-place that they were gaily chattering ."
"The pirates listened grimly , and then replaced the mushroom ."
They looked around them and noted the holes in the seven trees .
` Did you hear them say Peter Pan 's from home ? '
"Smee whispered , fidgeting with Johnny Corkscrew ."
Hook nodded .
"He stood for a long time lost in thought , and at last a curdling smile lit up his swarthy face ."
Smee had been waiting for it .
"` Unrip your plan , captain , ' he cried eagerly ."
"` To return to the ship , ' Hook replied slowly through his teeth , ` and cook a large rich cake of a jolly thickness with green sugar on it ."
"There can be but one room below , for there is but one chimney ."
The silly moles had not the sense to see that they did not need a door apiece .
That shows they have no mother .
We will leave the cake on the shore of the mermaids ' lagoon .
"These boys are always swimming about there , playing with the mermaids ."
"They will find the cake and they will gobble it up , because , having no mother , they do n't know how dangerous 't is to eat rich damp cake . '"
"He burst into laughter , not hollow laughter now , but honest laughter ."
"` Aha , they will die . '"
"But although they had made or planned several innovations in the dinner itself , they had made no change in the usual list of guests ."
"`` It must just be the time-honoured family affair , '' Frances had declared ."
"`` If we begin inviting other folks , there is no knowing when to draw the line ."
"We ca n't have more than fourteen , and some of our friends would be sure to feel slighted . ''"
So the same old list it was .
"But now Aunt Clara -- dear , jolly Aunt Clara , whom everybody in the connection loved and admired -- could not come , and her place must be filled ."
"`` We ca n't invite the new minister , because we would have to have his sister , too , '' said Frances ."
`` And there is no reason for asking any one of our girl chums more than another . ''
"`` Mother , you will have to help us out , '' said Alma ."
`` Ca n't you suggest a substitute guest ? ''
"Mrs. Allen looked down at the two bright , girlish faces turned up to her and said slowly , `` I think I can , but I am not sure my choice will please you ."
Why not ask Miss Price ? ''
Miss Price !
They had never thought of her !
"She was the pale , timid-looking little teacher in the primary department of the Hazelwood school ."
`` Miss Price ? ''
repeated Frances slowly .
"`` Why , Mother , we hardly know her ."
"She is dreadfully dull and quiet , I think . ''"
"`` And so shy , '' said Alma ."
"`` Why , at the Wards ' party the other night she looked startled to death if anyone spoke to her ."
I believe she would be frightened to come here for Thanksgiving . ''
"`` She is a very lonely little creature , '' said Mrs. Allen gently , `` and does n't seem to have anyone belonging to her ."
I think she would be very glad to get an invitation to spend Thanksgiving elsewhere than in that cheerless little boarding-house where she lives . ''
"`` Of course , if you would like to have her , Mother , we will ask her , '' said Frances ."
"`` No , girls , '' said Mrs. Allen seriously ."
"`` You must not ask Miss Price on my account , if you do not feel prepared to make her welcome for her own sake ."
"I had hoped that your own kind hearts might have prompted you to extend a little Thanksgiving cheer in a truly Thanksgiving spirit to a lonely , hard-working girl whose life I do not think is a happy one ."
"But there , I shall not preach ."
"This is your dinner , and you must please yourselves as to your guests . ''"
"Frances and Alma had both flushed , and they now remained silent for a few minutes ."
Then Frances sprang up and threw her arms around her mother .
"And how long is it before Marilla expects to be stone blind , Anne ? ''"
"`` The doctor thinks her eyes will not get any worse if she is very careful , '' faltered Anne ."
Eliza shook her head .
`` Doctors always talk like that just to keep people cheered up .
I would n't have much hope if I was her .
It 's best to be prepared for the worst . ''
`` But ought n't we be prepared for the best too ? ''
pleaded Anne .
`` It 's just as likely to happen as the worst . ''
"`` Not in my experience , and I 've fifty-seven years to set against your sixteen , '' retorted Eliza ."
"`` Going , are you ?"
"Well , I hope this new society of yours will be able to keep Avonlea from running any further down hill but I have n't much hope of it . ''"
"Anne and Diana got themselves thankfully out , and drove away as fast as the fat pony could go ."
"As they rounded the curve below the beech wood a plump figure came speeding over Mr. Andrews ' pasture , waving to them excitedly ."
"It was Catherine Andrews and she was so out of breath that she could hardly speak , but she thrust a couple of quarters into Anne 's hand ."
"`` That 's my contribution to painting the hall , '' she gasped ."
`` I 'd like to give you a dollar but I do n't dare take more from my egg money for Eliza would find it out if I did .
I 'm real interested in your society and I believe you 're going to do a lot of good .
I 'm an optimist .
"I HAVE to be , living with Eliza ."
I must hurry back before she misses me ... she thinks I 'm feeding the hens .
"I hope you 'll have good luck canvassing , and do n't be cast down over what Eliza said ."
The world IS getting better ... it certainly is . ''
The next house was Daniel Blair 's .
"`` Now , it all depends on whether his wife is home or not , '' said Diana , as they jolted along a deep-rutted lane ."
`` If she is we wo n't get a cent .
"Everybody says Dan Blair does n't dare have his hair cut without asking her permission ; and it 's certain she 's very close , to state it moderately ."
She says she has to be just before she 's generous .
But Mrs. Lynde says she 's so much ` before ' that generosity never catches up with her at all . ''
Anne related their experience at the Blair place to Marilla that evening .
`` We tied the horse and then rapped at the kitchen door .
"Nobody came but the door was open and we could hear somebody in the pantry , going on dreadfully ."
"At first Edith 's letters had been full of Ned , but in her last two or three she had said little about him ."
Katherine wrote and jokingly asked Edith if she and Ned had quarreled .
"Edith wrote back and said , `` What nonsense . ''"
"She and Ned were as good friends as ever , but he was getting acquainted in Riverton now and was n't so dependent on her society , etc. ."
Katherine sighed and went on a fern hunt with Professor Keith .
It was getting near the end of her vacation and she had only two weeks more .
They were sitting down to rest on the side of the road when she mentioned this fact inconsequently .
The professor prodded the harmless dust with his cane .
"Well , he supposed she would find a return to work pleasant and would doubtless be glad to see her Riverton friends again ."
"`` I 'm dying to see Edith , '' said Katherine ."
`` And Ned ? ''
suggested Professor Keith .
`` Oh yes .
"Ned , of course , '' assented Katherine without enthusiasm ."
There did n't seem to be anything more to say .
"One can not talk everlastingly about ferns , so they got up and went home ."
Katherine wrote a particularly affectionate letter to Ned that night .
Then she went to bed and cried .
"When Professor Keith came up to bid Miss Rangely good-bye on the eve of her departure from Harbour Hill , he looked like a man who was being led to execution without benefit of clergy ."
But he kept himself well in hand and talked calmly on impersonal subjects .
"After all , it was Katherine who made the first break when she got up to say good-bye ."
"She was in the middle of some conventional sentence when she suddenly stopped short , and her voice trailed off in a babyish quiver ."
The professor put out his arm and drew her close to him .
"His hat dropped under their feet and was trampled on , but I doubt if Professor Keith knows the difference to this day , for he was fully absorbed in kissing Katherine 's hair ."
"When she became cognizant of this fact , she drew herself away ."
"`` Oh , Sidney , do n't !"
-- think of Edith !
I feel like a traitor . ''
`` Do you think she would care very much if I -- if you -- if we -- '' hesitated the professor .
"`` Oh , it would break her heart , '' cried Katherine with convincing earnestness ."
`` I know it would -- and Ned 's too .
They must never know . ''
"Let 's hear it , '' said Carol ."
"`` Let 's write letters -- rainy-day letters -- to everyone in the house , '' said Cyrilla ."
"`` You may depend all the rest of the folks under Mrs. Plunkett 's hospitable roof are feeling more or less blue and lonely too , as well as ourselves ."
"Let 's write them the jolliest , nicest letters we can compose and get Nora Jane to take them to their rooms ."
"There 's that pale little sewing girl , I do n't believe she ever gets letters from anybody , and Miss Marshall , I 'm sure she does n't , and poor old Mrs. Johnson , whose only son died last month , and the new music teacher who came yesterday , a letter of welcome to her -- and old Mr. Grant , yes , and Mrs. Plunkett too , thanking her for all her kindness to us ."
You knew she has been awfully nice to us in spite of the oil stove ukase .
That 's six -- two apiece .
"Let 's do it , girls . ''"
Cyrilla 's sudden enthusiasm for her plan infected the others .
"`` It 's a nice idea , '' said Mary , brightening up ."
`` But who 's to write to whom ?
I 'm willing to take anybody but Miss Marshall .
I could n't write a line to her to save my life .
"She 'd be horrified at anything funny or jokey and our letters will have to be mainly nonsense -- nonsense of the best brand , to be sure , but still nonsense . ''"
"`` Better leave Miss Marshall out , '' suggested Carol ."
`` You know she disapproves of us anyhow .
"She 'd probably resent a letter of the sort , thinking we were trying to play some kind of joke on her . ''"
"`` It would never do to leave her out , '' said Cyrilla decisively ."
"`` Of course , she 's a bit queer and unamiable , but , girls , think of thirty years of boarding-house life , even with the best of Plunketts ."
Would n't that sour anybody ?
You know it would .
"You 'd be cranky and grumbly and disagreeable too , I dare say ."
I 'm really sorry for Miss Marshall .
She 's had a very hard life .
Mrs. Plunkett told me all about her one day .
I do n't think we should mind her biting little speeches and sharp looks .
"And anyway , even if she is really as disagreeable as she sometimes seems to be , why , it must make it all the harder for her , do n't you think ?"
So she needs a letter most of all .
"I 'll write to her , since it 's my suggestion ."
We 'll draw lots for the others . ''
"Besides Miss Marshall , the new music teacher fell to Cyrilla 's share ."
"Mary drew Mrs. Plunkett and the dressmaker , and Carol drew Mrs. Johnson and old Mr. Grant ."
"`` The dog is mine , and I shall do with him as I think fit ."
"He is sold , and that is all there is about it ."
Go on with your dinner . ''
But Ernest for the first time did not obey .
"He snatched his cap from the back of his chair , dashed it down over his eyes , and ran from the kitchen with a sob choking his breath ."
"Uncle Richard looked angry , but Aunt Kate hastened to soothe him ."
"`` Do n't be vexed with the boy , Richard , '' she said ."
`` You know he is very fond of Laddie .
"He 's had to do with him ever since he was a pup , and no doubt he feels badly at the thought of losing him ."
I 'm rather sorry myself that you have sold the dog . ''
"`` Well , he is sold and there 's an end of it ."
I do n't say but that the dog is a good dog .
"But he is of no use to us , and twenty dollars will come in mighty handy just now ."
"He 's worth that to Bob , for he is a good watch dog , so we 've both made a fair bargain . ''"
Nothing more was said about Ernest or Laddie .
"I had taken no part in the discussion , for I felt no great interest in the matter ."
"Laddie was a nice dog ; Ernest was a quiet , inoffensive little fellow , five years younger than myself ; that was all I thought about either of them ."
I was spending my vacation at Uncle Richard 's farm on the Nova Scotian Bay of Fundy shore .
"I was a great favourite with Uncle Richard , partly because he had been much attached to my mother , his only sister , partly because of my strong resemblance to his only son , who had died several years before ."
"Uncle Richard was a stern , undemonstrative man , but I knew that he entertained a deep and real affection for me , and I always enjoyed my vacation sojourns at his place ."
"`` What are you going to do this afternoon , Ned ? ''"
"he asked , after the disturbance caused by Ernest 's outbreak had quieted down ."
"`` I think I 'll row out to Island Rock , '' I replied ."
`` I want to take some views of the shore from it . ''
Uncle Richard nodded .
He was much interested in my new camera .
"`` If you 're on it about four o'clock , you 'll get a fine view of the ` Hole in the Wall ' when the sun begins to shine on the water through it , '' he said ."
`` I 've often thought it would make a handsome picture . ''
"`` After I 've finished taking the pictures , I think I 'll go down shore to Uncle Adam 's and stay all night , '' I said ."
"`` Jim 's dark room is more convenient than mine , and he has some pictures he is going to develop tonight , too . ''"
I started for the shore about two o'clock .
"Ernest was sitting on the woodpile as I passed through the yard , with his arms about Laddie 's neck and his face buried in Laddie 's curly hair ."
"`` First ship that ever I lost , '' said Captain Smollett ."
"I was dead tired , as you may fancy ; and when I got to sleep , which was not till after a great deal of tossing , I slept like a log of wood ."
The rest had long been up and had already breakfasted and increased the pile of firewood by about half as much again when I was wakened by a bustle and the sound of voices .
`` Flag of truce ! ''
"I heard someone say ; and then , immediately after , with a cry of surprise , `` Silver himself ! ''"
"And at that , up I jumped , and rubbing my eyes , ran to a loophole in the wall ."
"20 Silver 's Embassy SURE enough , there were two men just outside the stockade , one of them waving a white cloth , the other , no less a person than Silver himself , standing placidly by ."
"It was still quite early , and the coldest morning that I think I ever was abroad in -- a chill that pierced into the marrow ."
"The sky was bright and cloudless overhead , and the tops of the trees shone rosily in the sun ."
"But where Silver stood with his lieutenant , all was still in shadow , and they waded knee-deep in a low white vapour that had crawled during the night out of the morass ."
The chill and the vapour taken together told a poor tale of the island .
"It was plainly a damp , feverish , unhealthy spot ."
"`` Keep indoors , men , '' said the captain ."
`` Ten to one this is a trick . ''
Then he hailed the buccaneer .
`` Who goes ?
"Stand , or we fire . ''"
"`` Flag of truce , '' cried Silver ."
"The captain was in the porch , keeping himself carefully out of the way of a treacherous shot , should any be intended ."
"He turned and spoke to us , `` Doctor 's watch on the lookout ."
"Dr. Livesey take the north side , if you please ; Jim , the east ; Gray , west ."
"The watch below , all hands to load muskets ."
"Lively , men , and careful . ''"
And then he turned again to the mutineers .
`` And what do you want with your flag of truce ? ''
he cried .
This time it was the other man who replied .
"`` Cap'n Silver , sir , to come on board and make terms , '' he shouted ."
`` Cap'n Silver !
Do n't know him .
Who 's he ? ''
cried the captain .
There was some strange passion in her voice that Alan did not quite understand -- a bitterness and a revolt which he took to be against the circumstances that hedged her in .
`` Is not some other life possible for you if your present life does not content you ? ''
he said gently .
"`` But it does content me , '' said Lynde imperiously ."
"`` I want no other -- I wish this life to go on forever -- forever , do you understand ?"
"If I were sure that it would -- if I were sure that no change would ever come to me , I would be perfectly content ."
It is the fear that a change will come that makes me wretched .
Oh ! ''
She shuddered and put her hands over her eyes .
Alan thought she must mean that when her father died she would be alone in the world .
He wanted to comfort her -- reassure her -- but he did not know how .
"One evening when he went to Four Winds he found the door open and , seeing the Captain in the living room , he stepped in unannounced ."
"Captain Anthony was sitting by the table , his head in his hands ; at Alan 's entrance he turned upon him a haggard face , blackened by a furious scowl beneath which blazed eyes full of malevolence ."
`` What do you want here ? ''
"he said , following up the demand with a string of vile oaths ."
"Before Alan could summon his scattered wits , Lynde glided in with a white , appealing face ."
"Wordlessly she grasped Alan 's arm , drew him out , and shut the door ."
"`` Oh , I 've been watching for you , '' she said breathlessly ."
`` I was afraid you might come tonight -- but I missed you . ''
`` But your father ? ''
said Alan in amazement .
`` How have I angered him ? ''
`` Hush .
Come into the garden .
I will explain there . ''
He followed her into the little enclosure where the red and white roses were now in full blow .
"`` Father is n't angry with you , '' said Lynde in a low shamed voice ."
`` It 's just -- he takes strange moods sometimes .
Then he seems to hate us all -- even me -- and he is like that for days .
He seems to suspect and dread everybody as if they were plotting against him .
You -- perhaps you think he has been drinking ?
"No , that is not the trouble ."
"Slightly married a lady of title , and so he became a lord ."
You see that judge in a wig coming out at the iron door ?
That used to be Tootles .
The bearded man who does n't know any story to tell his children was once John .
Wendy was married in white with a pink sash .
It is strange to think that Peter did not alight in the church and forbid the banns -LSB- formal announcement of a marriage -RSB- .
"Years rolled on again , and Wendy had a daughter ."
This ought not to be written in ink but in a golden splash .
"She was called Jane , and always had an odd inquiring look , as if from the moment she arrived on the mainland she wanted to ask questions ."
When she was old enough to ask them they were mostly about Peter Pan .
"She loved to hear of Peter , and Wendy told her all she could remember in the very nursery from which the famous flight had taken place ."
"It was Jane 's nursery now , for her father had bought it at the three per cents -LSB- mortgage rate -RSB- from Wendy 's father , who was no longer fond of stairs ."
Mrs. Darling was now dead and forgotten .
"There were only two beds in the nursery now , Jane 's and her nurse 's ; and there was no kennel , for Nana also had passed away ."
"She died of old age , and at the end she had been rather difficult to get on with ; being very firmly convinced that no one knew how to look after children except herself ."
Once a week Jane 's nurse had her evening off ; and then it was Wendy 's part to put Jane to bed .
That was the time for stories .
"It was Jane 's invention to raise the sheet over her mother 's head and her own , thus making a tent , and in the awful darkness to whisper : `` What do we see now ? ''"
"`` I do n't think I see anything to-night , '' says Wendy , with a feeling that if Nana were here she would object to further conversation ."
"`` Yes , you do , '' says Jane , `` you see when you were a little girl . ''"
"`` That is a long time ago , sweetheart , '' says Wendy ."
"`` Ah me , how time flies ! ''"
"`` Does it fly , '' asks the artful child , `` the way you flew when you were a little girl ? ''"
`` The way I flew ?
"Do you know , Jane , I sometimes wonder whether I ever did really fly . ''"
"`` Yes , you did . ''"
`` The dear old days when I could fly ! ''
"`` Why ca n't you fly now , mother ? ''"
"`` Because I am grown up , dearest ."
When people grow up they forget the way . ''
`` Why do they forget the way ? ''
`` Because they are no longer gay and innocent and heartless .
An hour passed away .
`` Hang them ! ''
said the captain .
`` This is as dull as the doldrums .
"Gray , whistle for a wind . ''"
And just at that moment came the first news of the attack .
"`` If you please , sir , '' said Joyce , `` if I see anyone , am I to fire ? ''"
`` I told you so ! ''
cried the captain .
"`` Thank you , sir , '' returned Joyce with the same quiet civility ."
"Nothing followed for a time , but the remark had set us all on the alert , straining ears and eyes -- the musketeers with their pieces balanced in their hands , the captain out in the middle of the block house with his mouth very tight and a frown on his face ."
"So some seconds passed , till suddenly Joyce whipped up his musket and fired ."
"The report had scarcely died away ere it was repeated and repeated from without in a scattering volley , shot behind shot , like a string of geese , from every side of the enclosure ."
"Several bullets struck the log-house , but not one entered ; and as the smoke cleared away and vanished , the stockade and the woods around it looked as quiet and empty as before ."
"Not a bough waved , not the gleam of a musket-barrel betrayed the presence of our foes ."
`` Did you hit your man ? ''
asked the captain .
"`` No , sir , '' replied Joyce ."
"`` I believe not , sir . ''"
"`` Next best thing to tell the truth , '' muttered Captain Smollett ."
"`` Load his gun , Hawkins ."
"How many should say there were on your side , doctor ? ''"
"`` I know precisely , '' said Dr. Livesey ."
`` Three shots were fired on this side .
I saw the three flashes -- two close together -- one farther to the west . ''
`` Three ! ''
repeated the captain .
"`` And how many on yours , Mr. Trelawney ? ''"
But this was not so easily answered .
"There had come many from the north -- seven by the squire 's computation , eight or nine according to Gray ."
From the east and west only a single shot had been fired .
"It was plain , therefore , that the attack would be developed from the north and that on the other three sides we were only to be annoyed by a show of hostilities ."
Then he looked sharply at his ward .
"`` Dick , '' said he , `` Y ' have seen this penny rhyme ? ''"
The lad replied in the affirmative .
"`` It bears your father 's name , '' continued the knight ; `` and our poor shrew of a parson is , by some mad soul , accused of slaying him . ''"
"`` He did most eagerly deny it , '' answered Dick ."
`` He did ? ''
"cried the knight , very sharply ."
`` Heed him not .
He has a loose tongue ; he babbles like a jack-sparrow .
"Some day , when I may find the leisure , Dick , I will myself more fully inform you of these matters ."
"There was one Duckworth shrewdly blamed for it ; but the times were troubled , and there was no justice to be got . ''"
`` It befell at the Moat House ? ''
"Dick ventured , with a beating at his heart ."
"`` It befell between the Moat House and Holywood , '' replied Sir Daniel , calmly ; but he shot a covert glance , black with suspicion , at Dick 's face ."
"`` And now , '' added the knight , `` speed you with your meal ; ye shall return to Tunstall with a line from me . ''"
Dick 's face fell sorely .
"`` Prithee , Sir Daniel , '' he cried , `` send one of the villains !"
I beseech you let me to the battle .
"I can strike a stroke , I promise you . ''"
"`` I misdoubt it not , '' replied Sir Daniel , sitting down to write ."
"`` But here , Dick , is no honour to be won ."
"I lie in Kettley till I have sure tidings of the war , and then ride to join me with the conqueror ."
"Cry not on cowardice ; it is but wisdom , Dick ; for this poor realm so tosseth with rebellion , and the king 's name and custody so changeth hands , that no man may be certain of the morrow ."
"Toss-pot and Shuttle-wit run in , but my Lord Good-Counsel sits o ' one side , waiting . ''"
"With that , Sir Daniel , turning his back to Dick , and quite at the farther end of the long table , began to write his letter , with his mouth on one side , for this business of the Black Arrow stuck sorely in his throat ."
"Meanwhile , young Shelton was going on heartily enough with his breakfast , when he felt a touch upon his arm , and a very soft voice whispering in his ear ."
"`` Make not a sign , I do beseech you , '' said the voice , `` but of your charity tell me the straight way to Holywood ."
"Beseech you , now , good boy , comfort a poor soul in peril and extreme distress , and set me so far forth upon the way to my repose . ''"
"`` Take the path by the windmill , '' answered Dick , in the same tone ; `` it will bring you to Till Ferry ; there inquire again . ''"
"And without turning his head , he fell again to eating ."
But with the tail of his eye he caught a glimpse of the young lad called Master John stealthily creeping from the room .
"`` Why , '' thought Dick , `` he is a young as I. ` Good boy ' doth he call me ?"
"`` Gone , '' shouted Mrs. Palmer , `` gone ."
She left on the train Mollie come on .
"Gracious me , has the man gone crazy ?"
He has n't seemed like himself at all this afternoon . ''
Murray had bolted madly out of the house and was striding down the lane .
Blind fool -- unspeakable idiot that he had been !
"To take her for Mrs. Palmer 's niece -- that peerless creature with the calm acceptance of any situation , which marked the woman of the world , with the fine appreciation and quickness of repartee that spoke of generations of culture -- to imagine that she could be Mollie Booth !"
"He had been blind , besottedly blind ."
And now he had lost her !
She would never forgive him ; she had gone without a word or sign .
"As he reached the last curve of the lane where it looped about the apple trees , a plump figure came flying down the orchard slope ."
"`` Mr. Murray , Mr. Murray , '' Mollie Booth called breathlessly ."
`` Will you please come here just a minute ? ''
Murray crossed over to the paling rather grumpily .
He did not want to talk with Mollie Booth just then .
"Confound it , what did the girl want ?"
Why was she looking so mysterious ?
Mollie produced a little square grey envelope from some feminine hiding place and handed it over the paling .
"`` She give me this at the station -- Miss Mannering did , '' she gasped , `` and asked me to give it to you without letting Aunt Emily Jane see ."
"I could n't get a chanst when you was in , but as soon as you went I slipped out by the porch door and followed you ."
You went so fast I near died trying to head you off . ''
"`` You dear little soul , '' said Murray , suddenly radiant ."
`` It is too bad you have had to put yourself so out of breath on my account .
But I am immensely obliged to you .
The next time your young man wants a trusty private messenger just refer him to me . ''
"`` Git away with you , '' giggled Mollie ."
`` I must hurry back ` fore Aunt Emily Jane gits wind I 'm gone .
I hope there 's good news in your girl 's letter .
"My , but did n't you look flat when Aunt said she 'd went ! ''"
Murray beamed at her idiotically .
When she had vanished among the trees he opened his letter .
"`` Dear Mr. Murray , '' it ran , `` your unblushing audacity of the morning deserves some punishment ."
A pretty pass the world is coming to !
I 'll never consent to it . ''
"Perhaps if you had searched Greenwood and all the adjacent districts thoroughly you might have found a man who was more astonished and taken aback than old John Ellis was at that moment , but I doubt it ."
The wind was completely taken out of his sails and every bit of the Ellis contrariness was roused .
`` What have you got to say against my son ? ''
he fairly shouted in his rage .
"`` Is n't he good enough for your girl , Susan Oliver , I 'd like to know ? ''"
"`` No , he is n't , '' retorted Miss Susan deliberately and unflinchingly ."
"`` He 's well enough in his place , but you 'll please to remember , John Ellis , that my niece is an Oliver , and the Olivers do n't marry beneath them . ''"
Old John was furious .
`` Beneath them indeed !
"Why , woman , it is condescension in my son to so much as look at your niece -- condescension , that is what it is ."
You are as poor as church mice . ''
"`` We come of good family , though , '' retorted Miss Susan ."
`` You Ellises are nobodies .
Your grandfather was a hired man !
"And yet you have the presumption to think you 're fit to marry into an old , respectable family like the Olivers ."
But talking does n't signify .
I simply wo n't allow this nonsense to go on .
I came here today to tell you so plump and plain .
"It 's your duty to stop it ; if you do n't I will , that 's all . ''"
"`` Oh , will you ? ''"
John Ellis was at a white heat of rage and stubbornness now .
"`` We 'll see , Miss Susan , we 'll see ."
"My son shall marry whatever girl he pleases , and I 'll back him up in it -- do you hear that ?"
Come here and tell me my son is n't good enough for your niece indeed !
I 'll show you he can get her anyway . ''
"`` You 've heard what I 've said , '' was the answer , `` and you 'd better go by it , that 's all ."
"I sha n't stay to bandy words with you , John Ellis ."
"I 'm going home to talk to my niece and tell her her duty plain , and what I want her to do , and she 'll do it , I have n't a fear . ''"
"Miss Susan was halfway down the steps , but John Ellis ran to the railing of the verandah to get the last word ."
"`` I 'll send Burton down this evening to talk to her and tell her what he wants her to do , and we 'll see whether she 'll sooner listen to you than to him , '' he shouted ."
"`` Ay , they hate Sir Daniel , and they hate every man that serves with him , '' said Appleyard ; `` and in the first order of hating , they hate Bennet Hatch and old Nicholas the bowman ."
"See ye here : if there was a stout fellow yonder in the wood-edge , and you and I stood fair for him -- as , by Saint George , we stand !"
"-- which , think ye , would he choose ? ''"
"`` You , for a good wager , '' answered Hatch ."
"`` My surcoat to a leather belt , it would be you ! ''"
cried the old archer .
"`` Ye burned Grimstone , Bennet -- they 'll ne'er forgive you that , my master ."
"And as for me , I 'll soon be in a good place , God grant , and out of bow-shoot -- ay , and cannon-shoot -- of all their malices ."
"I am an old man , and draw fast to homeward , where the bed is ready ."
"But for you , Bennet , y ' are to remain behind here at your own peril , and if ye come to my years unhanged , the old true-blue English spirit will be dead . ''"
"`` Y ' are the shrewishest old dolt in Tunstall Forest , '' returned Hatch , visibly ruffled by these threats ."
"`` Get ye to your arms before Sir Oliver come , and leave prating for one good while ."
"An ye had talked so much with Harry the Fift , his ears would ha ' been richer than his pocket . ''"
"An arrow sang in the air , like a huge hornet ; it struck old Appleyard between the shoulder-blades , and pierced him clean through , and he fell forward on his face among the cabbages ."
"Hatch , with a broken cry , leapt into the air ; then , stooping double , he ran for the cover of the house ."
"And in the meanwhile Dick Shelton had dropped behind a lilac , and had his crossbow bent and shouldered , covering the point of the forest ."
Not a leaf stirred .
The sheep were patiently browsing ; the birds had settled .
"But there lay the old man , with a cloth-yard arrow standing in his back ; and there were Hatch holding to the gable , and Dick crouching and ready behind the lilac bush ."
`` D'ye see aught ? ''
cried Hatch .
"`` Not a twig stirs , '' said Dick ."
"`` I think shame to leave him lying , '' said Bennet , coming forward once more with hesitating steps and a very pale countenance ."
"`` Keep a good eye on the wood , Master Shelton -- keep a clear eye on the wood ."
The saints assoil us !
here was a good shoot ! ''
Bennet raised the old archer on his knee .
"He was not yet dead ; his face worked , and his eyes shut and opened like machinery , and he had a most horrible , ugly look of one in pain ."
"`` Can ye hear , old Nick ? ''"
asked Hatch .
"`` Have ye a last wish before ye wend , old brother ? ''"
"`` Pluck out the shaft , and let me pass , a ' Mary 's name ! ''"
There could n't be a better child and you 'd hardly know she was in the house . ''
"`` Dora is too good , '' said Anne ."
`` She 'd behave just as well if there was n't a soul to tell her what to do .
"She was born already brought up , so she does n't need us ; and I think , '' concluded Anne , hitting on a very vital truth , `` that we always love best the people who need us ."
Davy needs us badly . ''
"`` He certainly needs something , '' agreed Marilla ."
`` Rachel Lynde would say it was a good spanking . ''
"XI Facts and Fancies `` Teaching is really very interesting work , '' wrote Anne to a Queen 's Academy chum ."
`` Jane says she thinks it is monotonous but I do n't find it so .
"Something funny is almost sure to happen every day , and the children say such amusing things ."
"Jane says she punishes her pupils when they make funny speeches , which is probably why she finds teaching monotonous ."
This afternoon little Jimmy Andrews was trying to spell ` speckled ' and could n't manage it .
"` Well , ' he said finally , ' I ca n't spell it but I know what it means . ' ''"
` What ? '
I asked . ''
"` St. Clair Donnell 's face , miss . '"
"`` St. Clair is certainly very much freckled , although I try to prevent the others from commenting on it ... for I was freckled once and well do I remember it ."
But I do n't think St. Clair minds .
It was because Jimmy called him ` St. Clair ' that St. Clair pounded him on the way home from school .
"I heard of the pounding , but not officially , so I do n't think I 'll take any notice of it ."
`` Yesterday I was trying to teach Lottie Wright to do addition .
"I said , ` If you had three candies in one hand and two in the other , how many would you have altogether ? ' '"
"A mouthful , ' said Lottie ."
"And in the nature study class , when I asked them to give me a good reason why toads should n't be killed , Benjie Sloane gravely answered , ` Because it would rain the next day . '"
"`` It 's so hard not to laugh , Stella ."
"I have to save up all my amusement until I get home , and Marilla says it makes her nervous to hear wild shrieks of mirth proceeding from the east gable without any apparent cause ."
She says a man in Grafton went insane once and that was how it began .
`` Did you know that Thomas a Becket was canonized as a SNAKE ?
Rose Bell says he was ... also that William Tyndale WROTE the New Testament .
Claude White says a ` glacier ' is a man who puts in window frames !
"`` I think the most difficult thing in teaching , as well as the most interesting , is to get the children to tell you their real thoughts about things ."
One stormy day last week I gathered them around me at dinner hour and tried to get them to talk to me just as if I were one of themselves .
"Yes , they did , they went round Wendy and John and Michael , who had slipped out of bed and run to her ."
"`` George , George ! ''"
"she cried when she could speak ; and Mr. Darling woke to share her bliss , and Nana came rushing in ."
There could not have been a lovelier sight ; but there was none to see it except a little boy who was staring in at the window .
He had had ecstasies innumerable that other children can never know ; but he was looking through the window at the one joy from which he must be for ever barred .
Chapter 17 WHEN WENDY GREW UP I hope you want to know what became of the other boys .
They were waiting below to give Wendy time to explain about them ; and when they had counted five hundred they went up .
"They went up by the stair , because they thought this would make a better impression ."
"They stood in a row in front of Mrs. Darling , with their hats off , and wishing they were not wearing their pirate clothes ."
"They said nothing , but their eyes asked her to have them ."
"They ought to have looked at Mr. Darling also , but they forgot about him ."
"Of course Mrs. Darling said at once that she would have them ; but Mr. Darling was curiously depressed , and they saw that he considered six a rather large number ."
"`` I must say , '' he said to Wendy , `` that you do n't do things by halves , '' a grudging remark which the twins thought was pointed at them ."
"The first twin was the proud one , and he asked , flushing , `` Do you think we should be too much of a handful , sir ?"
"Because , if so , we can go away . ''"
`` Father ! ''
"Wendy cried , shocked ; but still the cloud was on him ."
"He knew he was behaving unworthily , but he could not help it ."
"`` We could lie doubled up , '' said Nibs ."
"`` I always cut their hair myself , '' said Wendy ."
`` George ! ''
"Mrs. Darling exclaimed , pained to see her dear one showing himself in such an unfavourable light ."
"Then he burst into tears , and the truth came out ."
"He was as glad to have them as she was , he said , but he thought they should have asked his consent as well as hers , instead of treating him as a cypher -LSB- zero -RSB- in his own house ."
"`` I do n't think he is a cypher , '' Tootles cried instantly ."
"`` Do you think he is a cypher , Curly ? ''"
"`` No , I do n't ."
"Do you think he is a cypher , Slightly ? ''"
`` Rather not .
"Twin , what do you think ? ''"
"It turned out that not one of them thought him a cypher ; and he was absurdly gratified , and said he would find space for them all in the drawing-room if they fitted in ."
"`` We 'll fit in , sir , '' they assured him ."
"`` Stand back , by ' r Lady ! ''"
"returned Dick , raising his bow ."
"`` Ah , y ' are a brave boy ! ''"
retorted Matcham .
`` Shoot ! ''
Dick lowered his weapon in some confusion .
"`` See here , '' he said ."
`` Y ' have done me ill enough .
"Go , then ."
"Go your way in fair wise ; or , whether I will or not , I must even drive you to it . ''"
"`` Well , '' said Matcham , doggedly , `` y ' are the stronger ."
Do your worst .
"I shall not leave to follow thee , Dick , unless thou makest me , '' he added ."
Dick was almost beside himself .
"It went against his heart to beat a creature so defenceless ; and , for the life of him , he knew no other way to rid himself of this unwelcome and , as he began to think , perhaps untrue companion ."
"`` Y ' are mad , I think , '' he cried ."
"`` Fool-fellow , I am hasting to your foes ; as fast as foot can carry me , go I thither . ''"
"`` I care not , Dick , '' replied the lad ."
"`` If y ' are bound to die , Dick , I 'll die too ."
I would liever go with you to prison than to go free without you . ''
"`` Well , '' returned the other , `` I may stand no longer prating ."
"Follow me , if ye must ; but if ye play me false , it shall but little advance you , mark ye that ."
"Shalt have a quarrel in thine inwards , boy . ''"
"So saying , Dick took once more to his heels , keeping in the margin of the thicket and looking briskly about him as he went ."
"At a good pace he rattled out of the dell , and came again into the more open quarters of the wood ."
"To the left a little eminence appeared , spotted with golden gorse , and crowned with a black tuft of firs ."
"`` I shall see from there , '' he thought , and struck for it across a heathy clearing ."
"He had gone but a few yards , when Matcham touched him on the arm , and pointed ."
"To the eastward of the summit there was a dip , and , as it were , a valley passing to the other side ; the heath was not yet out ; all the ground was rusty , like an unscoured buckler , and dotted sparingly with yews ; and there , one following another , Dick saw half a score green jerkins mounting the ascent , and marching at their head , conspicuous by his boar-spear , Ellis Duckworth in person ."
"One after another gained the top , showed for a moment against the sky , and then dipped upon the further side , until the last was gone ."
Dick looked at Matcham with a kindlier eye .
"`` So y ' are to be true to me , Jack ? ''"
"Sailors do n't always use the choicest language , and parrots are very imitative birds . ''"
"`` So I should think , '' said poor Anne , the remembrance of her errand quelling her resentment ."
"She could n't afford to snub Mr. Harrison under the circumstances , that was certain ."
"When you had just sold a man 's Jersey cow offhand , without his knowledge or consent you must not mind if his parrot repeated uncomplimentary things ."
"Nevertheless , the `` redheaded snippet '' was not quite so meek as she might otherwise have been ."
"`` I 've come to confess something to you , Mr. Harrison , '' she said resolutely ."
`` It 's ... it 's about ... that Jersey cow . ''
"`` Bless my soul , '' exclaimed Mr. Harrison nervously , `` has she gone and broken into my oats again ?"
"Well , never mind ... never mind if she has ."
"It 's no difference ... none at all , I ... I was too hasty yesterday , that 's a fact ."
Never mind if she has . ''
"`` Oh , if it were only that , '' sighed Anne ."
`` But it 's ten times worse .
"I do n't ... '' `` Bless my soul , do you mean to say she 's got into my wheat ? ''"
`` No ... no ... not the wheat .
But ... '' `` Then it 's the cabbages !
"She 's broken into my cabbages that I was raising for Exhibition , hey ? ''"
"`` It 's NOT the cabbages , Mr. Harrison ."
I 'll tell you everything ... that is what I came for -- but please do n't interrupt me .
It makes me so nervous .
"Just let me tell my story and do n't say anything till I get through -- and then no doubt you 'll say plenty , '' Anne concluded , but in thought only ."
"`` I wo n't say another word , '' said Mr. Harrison , and he did n't ."
"But Ginger was not bound by any contract of silence and kept ejaculating , `` Redheaded snippet '' at intervals until Anne felt quite wild ."
`` I shut my Jersey cow up in our pen yesterday .
This morning I went to Carmody and when I came back I saw a Jersey cow in your oats .
Diana and I chased her out and you ca n't imagine what a hard time we had .
I was so dreadfully wet and tired and vexed -- and Mr. Shearer came by that very minute and offered to buy the cow .
I sold her to him on the spot for twenty dollars .
It was wrong of me .
"I should have waited and consulted Marilla , of course ."
But I 'm dreadfully given to doing things without thinking -- everybody who knows me will tell you that .
Mr. Shearer took the cow right away to ship her on the afternoon train . ''
said Nat innocently .
"`` Well , I do n't know about that , '' began Mrs. Bhaer , rather startled by the coolness of the proposition ."
"`` Why , I thought you liked to have poor boys come and live with you , and be kind to 'em as you were to me , '' said Nat , looking surprised and alarmed ."
"`` So I do , but I like to know something about them first ."
"I have to choose them , because there are so many ."
I have not room for all .
I wish I had . ''
"`` I told him to come because I thought you 'd like it , but if there is n't room he can go away again , '' said Nat , sorrowfully ."
"The boy 's confidence in her hospitality touched Mrs. Bhaer , and she could not find the heart to disappoint his hope , and spoil his kind little plan , so she said , `` Tell me about this Dan . ''"
"`` I do n't know any thing , only he has n't got any folks , and he 's poor , and he was good to me , so I 'd like to be good to him if I could . ''"
"`` Excellent reasons every one ; but really , Nat , the house is full , and I do n't know where I could put him , '' said Mrs. Bhaer , more and more inclined to prove herself the haven of refuge he seemed to think her ."
"`` He could have my bed , and I could sleep in the barn ."
"It is n't cold now , and I do n't mind , I used to sleep anywhere with father , '' said Nat , eagerly ."
"Something in his speech and face made Mrs. Jo put her hand on his shoulder , and say in her kindest tone : `` Bring in your friend , Nat ; I think we must find room for him without giving him your place . ''"
"Nat joyfully ran off , and soon returned followed by a most unprepossessing boy , who slouched in and stood looking about him , with a half bold , half sullen look , which made Mrs. Bhaer say to herself , after one glance , `` A bad specimen , I am afraid . ''"
"`` This is Dan , '' said Nat , presenting him as if sure of his welcome ."
"`` Nat tells me you would like to come and stay with us , '' began Mrs. Jo , in a friendly tone ."
"`` Yes , '' was the gruff reply ."
`` Have you no friends to take care of you ? ''
`` No . ''
"`` Say , ` No , ma'am , ' '' whispered Nat ."
"`` Sha n't neither , '' muttered Dan ."
`` How old are you ? ''
`` About fourteen . ''
`` You look older .
What can you do ? '' ''
` Most anything . ''
"`` If you stay here we shall want you to do as the others do , work and study as well as play ."
Are you willing to agree to that ? ''
`` Do n't mind trying . ''
"`` Well , you can stay a few days , and we will see how we get on together ."
"Take him out , Nat , and amuse him till Mr. Bhaer comes home , when we will settle about the matter , '' said Mrs. Jo , finding it rather difficult to get on with this cool young person , who fixed his big black eyes on her with a hard , suspicious expression , sorrowfully unboyish ."
"It seems there was a ship lost in those parts ; and the next day a gentleman of my family was seeking wreck-wood for his fire along the sands , when he came upon a lad that was half drowned ."
"Well , he brought him to ; and he and some other gentleman took and clapped him in an auld , ruined castle , where from that day to this he has been a great expense to my friends ."
"My friends are a wee wild-like , and not so particular about the law as some that I could name ; and finding that the lad owned some decent folk , and was your born nephew , Mr. Balfour , they asked me to give ye a bit call and confer upon the matter ."
"And I may tell ye at the off-go , unless we can agree upon some terms , ye are little likely to set eyes upon him ."
"For my friends , '' added Alan , simply , `` are no very well off . ''"
My uncle cleared his throat .
"`` I 'm no very caring , '' says he ."
"`` He wasnae a good lad at the best of it , and I 've nae call to interfere . ''"
"`` Ay , ay , '' said Alan , `` I see what ye would be at : pretending ye do n't care , to make the ransom smaller . ''"
"`` Na , '' said my uncle , `` it 's the mere truth ."
"I take nae manner of interest in the lad , and I 'll pay nae ransome , and ye can make a kirk and a mill of him for what I care . ''"
"`` Hoot , sir , '' says Alan ."
"`` Blood 's thicker than water , in the deil 's name !"
"Ye cannae desert your brother 's son for the fair shame of it ; and if ye did , and it came to be kennt , ye wouldnae be very popular in your country-side , or I 'm the more deceived . ''"
"`` I 'm no just very popular the way it is , '' returned Ebenezer ; `` and I dinnae see how it would come to be kennt ."
"No by me , onyway ; nor yet by you or your friends ."
"So that 's idle talk , my buckie , '' says he ."
"`` Then it 'll have to be David that tells it , '' said Alan ."
`` How that ? ''
"says my uncle , sharply ."
"`` Ou , just this way , '' says Alan ."
"`` My friends would doubtless keep your nephew as long as there was any likelihood of siller to be made of it , but if there was nane , I am clearly of opinion they would let him gang where he pleased , and be damned to him ! ''"
"`` Ay , but I 'm no very caring about that either , '' said my uncle ."
`` I wouldnae be muckle made up with that . ''
"`` I was thinking that , '' said Alan ."
`` And what for why ? ''
asked Ebenezer .
"`` Why , Mr. Balfour , '' replied Alan , `` by all that I could hear , there were two ways of it : either ye liked David and would pay to get him back ; or else ye had very good reasons for not wanting him , and would pay for us to keep him ."
"It seems it 's not the first ; well then , it 's the second ; and blythe am I to ken it , for it should be a pretty penny in my pocket and the pockets of my friends . ''"
"`` I dinnae follow ye there , '' said my uncle ."
`` No ? ''
said Alan .
"He rushed to Anne , hurled himself into her lap , flung his arms around her neck , and burst into tears ."
"`` I did n't know it was wrong to tell whoppers , '' he sobbed ."
`` How did you expect me to know it was wrong ?
"All Mr. Sprott 's children told them REGULAR every day , and cross their hearts too ."
"I s ` pose Paul Irving never tells whoppers and here I 've been trying awful hard to be as good as him , but now I s ` pose you 'll never love me again ."
But I think you might have told me it was wrong .
"I 'm awful sorry I 've made you cry , Anne , and I 'll never tell a whopper again . ''"
Davy buried his face in Anne 's shoulder and cried stormily .
"Anne , in a sudden glad flash of understanding , held him tight and looked over his curly thatch at Marilla ."
"`` He did n't know it was wrong to tell falsehoods , Marilla ."
I think we must forgive him for that part of it this time if he will promise never to say what is n't true again . ''
"`` I never will , now that I know it 's bad , '' asseverated Davy between sobs ."
"`` If you ever catch me telling a whopper again you can ... '' Davy groped mentally for a suitable penance ... `` you can skin me alive , Anne . ''"
"`` Do n't say ` whopper , ' Davy ... say ` falsehood , ' '' said the schoolma'am ."
`` Why ? ''
"queried Davy , settling comfortably down and looking up with a tearstained , investigating face ."
`` Why ai n't whopper as good as falsehood ?
I want to know .
It 's just as big a word . ''
`` It 's slang ; and it 's wrong for little boys to use slang . ''
"`` There 's an awful lot of things it 's wrong to do , '' said Davy with a sigh ."
`` I never s ` posed there was so many .
"I 'm sorry it 's wrong to tell whop ... falsehoods , 'cause it 's awful handy , but since it is I 'm never going to tell any more ."
What are you going to do to me for telling them this time ?
I want to know . ''
Anne looked beseechingly at Marilla .
"`` I do n't want to be too hard on the child , '' said Marilla ."
"`` I daresay nobody ever did tell him it was wrong to tell lies , and those Sprott children were no fit companions for him ."
Poor Mary was too sick to train him properly and I presume you could n't expect a six-year-old child to know things like that by instinct .
I suppose we 'll just have to assume he does n't know ANYTHING right and begin at the beginning .
"But he 'll have to be punished for shutting Dora up , and I ca n't think of any way except to send him to bed without his supper and we 've done that so often ."
"Ca n't you suggest something else , Anne ?"
"`` It was a coward blow , '' returned Matcham ."
"`` Y ' are but a lout and bully , Master Dick ; ye but abuse advantages ; let there come a stronger , we will see you truckle at his boot !"
"Ye care not for vengeance , neither -- for your father 's death that goes unpaid , and his poor ghost that clamoureth for justice ."
"But if there come but a poor creature in your hands that lacketh skill and strength , and would befriend you , down she shall go ! ''"
Dick was too furious to observe that `` she . ''
`` Marry ! ''
"he cried , `` and here is news !"
Of any two the one will still be stronger .
"The better man throweth the worse , and the worse is well served ."
"Ye deserve a belting , Master Matcham , for your ill-guidance and unthankfulness to meward ; and what ye deserve ye shall have . ''"
"And Dick , who , even in his angriest temper , still preserved the appearance of composure , began to unbuckle his belt ."
"`` Here shall be your supper , '' he said , grimly ."
"Matcham had stopped his tears ; he was as white as a sheet , but he looked Dick steadily in the face , and never moved ."
"Dick took a step , swinging the belt ."
"Then he paused , embarrassed by the large eyes and the thin , weary face of his companion ."
His courage began to subside .
"`` Say ye were in the wrong , then , '' he said , lamely ."
"`` Nay , '' said Matcham , `` I was in the right ."
"Come , cruel !"
"I be lame ; I be weary ; I resist not ; I ne'er did thee hurt ; come , beat me -- coward ! ''"
"Dick raised the belt at this last provocation , but Matcham winced and drew himself together with so cruel an apprehension , that his heart failed him yet again ."
"The strap fell by his side , and he stood irresolute , feeling like a fool ."
"`` A plague upon thee , shrew ! ''"
he said .
"`` An ye be so feeble of hand , ye should keep the closer guard upon your tongue ."
But I 'll be hanged before I beat you ! ''
and he put on his belt again .
"`` Beat you I will not , '' he continued ; `` but forgive you ?"
-- never .
"I knew ye not ; ye were my master 's enemy ; I lent you my horse ; my dinner ye have eaten ; y ' ` ave called me a man o ' wood , a coward , and a bully ."
"Nay , by the mass !"
"the measure is filled , and runneth over ."
"Some of them quite costly , too ; that is , they will cost me something , but I know I 'll be better off and richer after I 've paid the price ."
"That is what Mr. Grierson would call a paradox , is n't it ?"
I 'll explain all about it to you on Christmas Day . ''
"On Christmas Day , Clorinda went over to Aunt Emmy 's ."
"It was a faded brown Christmas after all , for the snow had not come ."
But Clorinda did not mind ; there was such joy in her heart that she thought it the most delightful Christmas Day that ever dawned .
She put the queer cornery armful she carried down on the kitchen floor before she went into the sitting room .
"Aunt Emmy was lying on the sofa before the fire , and Clorinda sat down beside her ."
"`` I 've come to tell you all about it , '' she said ."
Aunt Emmy patted the hand that was in her own .
"`` From your face , dear girl , it will be pleasant hearing and telling , '' she said ."
Clorinda nodded .
"`` Aunt Emmy , I thought for days over your meaning ... thought until I was dizzy ."
"And then one evening it just came to me , without any thinking at all , and I knew that I could give some gifts after all ."
I thought of something new every day for a week .
"At first I did n't think I could give some of them , and then I thought how selfish I was ."
"I would have been willing to pay any amount of money for gifts if I had had it , but I was n't willing to pay what I had ."
"I got over that , though , Aunt Emmy ."
Now I 'm going to tell you what I did give .
"`` First , there was my teacher , Miss Mitchell ."
I gave her one of father 's books .
"I have so many of his , you know , so that I would n't miss one ; but still it was one I loved very much , and so I felt that that love made it worth while ."
"That is , I felt that on second thought ."
"At first , Aunt Emmy , I thought I would be ashamed to offer Miss Mitchell a shabby old book , worn with much reading and all marked over with father 's notes and pencillings ."
I was afraid she would think it queer of me to give her such a present .
And yet somehow it seemed to me that it was better than something brand new and unmellowed -- that old book which father had loved and which I loved .
"So I gave it to her , and she understood ."
"I think it pleased her so much , the real meaning in it ."
She said it was like being given something out of another 's heart and life .
"`` Then you know Mrs. Martin ... last year she was Miss Hope , my dear Sunday School teacher ."
"She married a home missionary , and they are in a lonely part of the west ."
"Well , I wrote her a letter ."
You were quite glad that the night-lights were in .
"You even liked Nana to say that this was just the mantelpiece over here , and that the Neverland was all make-believe ."
"Of course the Neverland had been make-believe in those days ; but it was real now , and there were no night-lights , and it was getting darker every moment , and where was Nana ?"
"They had been flying apart , but they huddled close to Peter now ."
"His careless manner had gone at last , his eyes were sparkling , and a tingle went through them every time they touched his body ."
"They were now over the fearsome island , flying so low that sometimes a tree grazed their feet ."
"Nothing horrid was visible in the air , yet their progress had become slow and laboured , exactly as if they were pushing their way through hostile forces ."
Sometimes they hung in the air until Peter had beaten on it with his fists .
"` They do n't want us to land , ' he explained ."
` Who are they ? '
"Wendy whispered , shuddering ."
But he could not or would not say .
"Tinker Bell had been asleep on his shoulder , but now he wakened her and sent her on in front ."
"Sometimes he poised himself in the air , listening intently with his hand to his ear , and again he would stare down with eyes so bright that they seemed to bore two holes to earth ."
"Having done these things , he went on again ."
His courage was almost appalling .
"` Do you want an adventure now , ' he said casually to John , ` or would you like to have your tea first ? '"
"Wendy said ` tea first ' quickly , and Michael pressed her hand in gratitude , but the braver John hesitated ."
` What kind of adventure ? '
he asked cautiously .
"` There 's a pirate asleep in the pampas just beneath us , ' Peter told him ."
"` If you like , we 'll go down and kill him . ' '"
"I do n't see him , ' John said after a long pause . '"
I do . '
"` Suppose , ' John said a little huskily , ` he were to wake up . '"
Peter spoke indignantly .
` You do n't think I would kill him while he was sleeping !
"I would wake him first , and then kill him ."
That 's the way I always do . ' '
I say !
Do you kill many ? '
` Tons . '
"`` I take care of myself and Boo , and she looks after you ."
The house goes any way . ''
`` I should think so !
I nearly broke my neck over the parlor sofa in the hall to-night .
What is it there for ? ''
Molly laughed .
"`` That 's the joke , sir , Miss Bat is cleaning house , and I 'm sure it needs cleaning , for it is years since it was properly done ."
I thought you might have told her to . ''
`` I 've said nothing .
Do n't like house-cleaning well enough to suggest it .
I did think the hall was rather dirty when I dropped my coat and took it up covered with lint .
Is she going to upset the whole place ? ''
"asked Mr. Bemis , looking alarmed at the prospect ."
"`` I hope so , for I really am ashamed when people come , to have them see the dust and cobwebs , and old carpets and dirty windows , '' said Molly , with a sigh , though she never had cared a bit till lately ."
"`` Why do n't you dust round a little , then ?"
No time to spare from the books and play ? ''
"`` I tried , father , but Miss Bat did n't like it , and it was too hard for me alone ."
"If things were once in nice order , I think I could keep them so ; for I do want to be neat , and I 'm learning as fast as I can . ''"
"`` It is high time someone took hold , if matters are left as you say ."
"I 've just been thinking what a clever woman Miss Bat was , to make such a tidy little girl out of what I used to hear called the greatest tomboy in town , and wondering what I could give the old lady ."
"Now I find you are the one to be thanked , and it is a very pleasant surprise to me . ''"
"`` Give her the present , please ; I 'm satisfied , if you like what I 've done ."
"It is n't much , and I did n't know as you would ever observe any difference ."
"But I did try , and now I guess I 'm really getting on , '' said Molly , sewing away with a bright color in her cheeks , for she , too , found it a pleasant surprise to be praised after many failures and few successes ."
"`` You certainly are , my dear ."
"I 'll wait till the house-cleaning is over , and then , if we are all alive , I 'll see about Miss Bat 's reward ."
"Meantime , you go with Mrs. Grant and get whatever you and the boy need , and send the bills to me ; '' and Mr. Bemis lighted a cigar , as if that matter was settled ."
"`` Oh , thank you , sir !"
That will be splendid .
"Merry always has pretty things , and I know you will like me when I get fixed , '' said Molly , smoothing down her apron , with a little air ."
`` Seems to me you look very well as you are .
Is n't that a pretty enough frock ? ''
"Do you think you can like me a little , Mary ? ''"
"It may be that Mrs. Hayden was not very much surprised , because Harrington 's face had been like an open book the day they chased the pig out of the garden together ."
"As for what she said , perhaps Bobbles , who was surreptitiously gorging himself on Harrington 's strawberries , may tell you , but I certainly shall not ."
The little brown house among the apple trees is shut up now and the boundary fence belongs to ancient history .
Sarah King has gone also and Mrs. John Harrington reigns royally in her place .
"Bobbles and Ted have a small , blue-eyed , much-spoiled sister , and there is a pig on the estate who may die of old age , but will never meet his doom otherwise ."
It is Bobbles ' pig and one of the famous fourteen .
Mordecai still shambles around and worships Mrs. Harrington .
"The garden is the same as of yore , but the house is a different place and Harrington is a different man ."
"And Mordecai will tell you with a chuckle , `` It was them notorious pigs as did it all . ''"
Why Not Ask Miss Price ?
"Frances Allen came in from the post office and laid an open letter on the table beside her mother , who was making mincemeat ."
"Alma Allen looked up from the cake she was frosting to ask , `` What is the matter ?"
"You look as if your letter contained unwelcome news , Fan . ''"
`` So it does .
"It is from Aunt Clara , to say she can not come ."
She has received a telegram that her sister-in-law is very ill and she must go to her at once . ''
"Mrs. Allen looked regretful , and Alma cast her spoon away with a tragic air ."
`` That is too bad .
I feel as if our celebration were spoiled .
But I suppose it ca n't be helped . ''
"`` No , '' agreed Frances , sitting down and beginning to peel apples ."
"`` So there is no use in lamenting , or I would certainly sit down and cry , I feel so disappointed . ''"
`` Is Uncle Frank coming ? ''
"`` Yes , Aunt Clara says he will come down from Stellarton if Mrs. King does not get worse ."
So that will leave just one vacant place .
We must invite someone to fill it up .
Who shall it be ? ''
Both girls looked rather puzzled .
Mrs. Allen smiled a quiet little smile all to herself and went on chopping suet .
She had handed the Thanksgiving dinner over to Frances and Alma this year .
They were to attend to all the preparations and invite all the guests .
"`` It is the ruin of this kind land , '' a woman said ."
"`` If the barons live at war , ploughfolk must eat roots . ''"
"`` Nay , '' said Dick , `` every man that follows shall have sixpence a day , and archers twelve . ''"
"`` If they live , '' returned the woman , `` that may very well be ; but how if they die , my master ? ''"
"`` They can not better die than for their natural lord , '' said Dick ."
"`` No natural lord of mine , '' said the man in the smock ."
"`` I followed the Walsinghams ; so we all did down Brierly way , till two years ago , come Candlemas ."
And now I must side with Brackley !
It was the law that did it ; call ye that natural ?
"But now , what with Sir Daniel and what with Sir Oliver -- that knows more of law than honesty -- I have no natural lord but poor King Harry the Sixt , God bless him !"
-- the poor innocent that can not tell his right hand from his left . ''
"`` Ye speak with an ill tongue , friend , '' answered Dick , `` to miscall your good master and my lord the king in the same libel ."
But King Harry -- praised be the saints !
"-- has come again into his right mind , and will have all things peaceably ordained ."
"And as for Sir Daniel , y ' are very brave behind his back ."
But I will be no tale-bearer ; and let that suffice . ''
"`` I say no harm of you , Master Richard , '' returned the peasant ."
"`` Y ' are a lad ; but when ye come to a man 's inches , ye will find ye have an empty pocket ."
"I say no more : the saints help Sir Daniel 's neighbours , and the Blessed Maid protect his wards ! ''"
"`` Clipsby , '' said Richard , `` you speak what I can not hear with honour ."
"Sir Daniel is my good master , and my guardian . ''"
"`` Come , now , will ye read me a riddle ? ''"
returned Clipsby .
`` On whose side is Sir Daniel ? ''
"`` I know not , '' said Dick , colouring a little ; for his guardian had changed sides continually in the troubles of that period , and every change had brought him some increase of fortune ."
"`` Ay , '' returned Clipsby , `` you , nor no man ."
"For , indeed , he is one that goes to bed Lancaster and gets up York . ''"
"Just then the bridge rang under horse-shoe iron , and the party turned and saw Bennet Hatch come galloping -- a brown-faced , grizzled fellow , heavy of hand and grim of mien , armed with sword and spear , a steel salet on his head , a leather jack upon his body ."
"He was a great man in these parts ; Sir Daniel 's right hand in peace and war , and at that time , by his master 's interest , bailiff of the hundred ."
"`` Clipsby , '' he shouted , `` off to the Moat House , and send all other laggards the same gate ."
Bowyer will give you jack and salet .
We must ride before curfew .
"I know I used to be a selfish , thoughtless creature -- how selfish and thoughtless I am ashamed to remember now , so I ca n't be quite so bad as I was ."
`` I wish I could help Miranda .
It would be very romantic to contrive a war-wedding and I should dearly love to get the better of Whiskers-on-the-moon .
But at present the oracle has not spoken . ''
"CHAPTER XVIII A WAR-WEDDING `` I can tell you this Dr. dear , '' said Susan , pale with wrath , `` that Germany is getting to be perfectly ridiculous . ''"
They were all in the big Ingleside kitchen .
Susan was mixing biscuits for supper .
"Mrs. Blythe was making shortbread for Jem , and Rilla was compounding candy for Ken and Walter -- it had once been `` Walter and Ken '' in her thoughts but somehow , quite unconsciously , this had changed until Ken 's name came naturally first ."
"Cousin Sophia was also there , knitting ."
"All the boys were going to be killed in the long run , so Cousin Sophia felt in her bones , but they might better die with warm feet than cold ones , so Cousin Sophia knitted faithfully and gloomily ."
"Into this peaceful scene erupted the doctor , wrathful and excited over the burning of the Parliament Buildings in Ottawa ."
And Susan became automatically quite as wrathful and excited .
`` What will those Huns do next ? ''
she demanded .
`` Coming over here and burning our Parliament building !
Did anyone ever hear of such an outrage ? ''
"`` We do n't know that the Germans are responsible for this , '' said the doctor -- much as if he felt quite sure they were ."
`` Fires do start without their agency sometimes .
And Uncle Mark MacAllister 's barn was burnt last week .
"You can hardly accuse the Germans of that , Susan . ''"
"`` Indeed , Dr. dear , I do not know . ''"
Susan nodded slowly and portentously .
`` Whiskers-on-the-moon was there that very day .
The fire broke out half an hour after he was gone .
So much is a fact -- but I shall not accuse a Presbyterian elder of burning anybody 's barn until I have proof .
"However , everybody knows , Dr. dear , that both Uncle Mark 's boys have enlisted , and that Uncle Mark himself makes speeches at all the recruiting meetings ."
So no doubt Germany is anxious to get square with him . ''
"`` I could never speak at a recruiting meeting , '' said Cousin Sophia solemnly ."
"`` I could never reconcile it to my conscience to ask another woman 's son to go , to murder and be murdered . ''"
`` Could you not ? ''
said Susan .
"`` Well , Sophia Crawford , I felt as if I could ask anyone to go when I read last night that there were no children under eight years of age left alive in Poland ."
He shall down .
Mum ! ''
And he bent over his oars .
"They pulled a long way up the river , turned the tail of an island , and came softly down a narrow channel next the opposite bank ."
Then Hugh held water in midstream .
"`` I must land you here among the willows , '' he said ."
"`` Here is no path but willow swamps and quagmires , '' answered Dick ."
"`` Master Shelton , '' replied Hugh , `` I dare not take ye nearer down , for your own sake now ."
"He watcheth me the ferry , lying on his bow ."
"All that go by and owe Sir Daniel goodwill , he shooteth down like rabbits ."
I heard him swear it by the rood .
"An I had not known you of old days -- ay , and from so high upward -- I would ` a ' let you go on ; but for old days ' remembrance , and because ye had this toy with you that 's not fit for wounds or warfare , I did risk my two poor ears to have you over whole ."
"Content you ; I can no more , on my salvation ! ''"
"Hugh was still speaking , lying on his oars , when there came a great shout from among the willows on the island , and sounds followed as of a strong man breasting roughly through the wood ."
`` A murrain ! ''
cried Hugh .
`` He was on the upper island all the while ! ''
He pulled straight for shore .
"`` Threat me with your bow , good Dick ; threat me with it plain , '' he added ."
"`` I have tried to save your skins , save you mine ! ''"
The boat ran into a tough thicket of willows with a crash .
"Matcham , pale , but steady and alert , at a sign from Dick , ran along the thwarts and leaped ashore ; Dick , taking the horse by the bridle , sought to follow , but what with the animal 's bulk , and what with the closeness of the thicket , both stuck fast ."
"The horse neighed and trampled ; and the boat , which was swinging in an eddy , came on and off and pitched with violence ."
"`` It may not be , Hugh ; here is no landing , '' cried Dick ; but he still struggled valiantly with the obstinate thicket and the startled animal ."
"A tall man appeared upon the shore of the island , a long-bow in his hand ."
"Dick saw him for an instant , with the corner of his eye , bending the bow with a great effort , his face crimson with hurry ."
`` Who goes ? ''
he shouted .
"`` Hugh , who goes ? '' ''"
"'T is Master Shelton , John , '' replied the ferryman ."
"`` Stand , Dick Shelton ! ''"
bawled the man upon the island .
"cried I. `` Rum , '' he repeated ."
`` I must get away from here .
Rum !
Rum ! ''
"I ran to fetch it , but I was quite unsteadied by all that had fallen out , and I broke one glass and fouled the tap , and while I was still getting in my own way , I heard a loud fall in the parlour , and running in , beheld the captain lying full length upon the floor ."
"At the same instant my mother , alarmed by the cries and fighting , came running downstairs to help me ."
Between us we raised his head .
"He was breathing very loud and hard , but his eyes were closed and his face a horrible colour ."
"`` Dear , deary me , '' cried my mother , `` what a disgrace upon the house !"
And your poor father sick ! ''
"In the meantime , we had no idea what to do to help the captain , nor any other thought but that he had got his death-hurt in the scuffle with the stranger ."
"I got the rum , to be sure , and tried to put it down his throat , but his teeth were tightly shut and his jaws as strong as iron ."
"It was a happy relief for us when the door opened and Doctor Livesey came in , on his visit to my father ."
"`` Oh , doctor , '' we cried , `` what shall we do ?"
Where is he wounded ? ''
`` Wounded ?
A fiddle-stick 's end ! ''
said the doctor .
`` No more wounded than you or I .
"The man has had a stroke , as I warned him ."
"Now , Mrs. Hawkins , just you run upstairs to your husband and tell him , if possible , nothing about it ."
"For my part , I must do my best to save this fellow 's trebly worthless life ; Jim , you get me a basin . ''"
"When I got back with the basin , the doctor had already ripped up the captain 's sleeve and exposed his great sinewy arm ."
It was tattooed in several places .
"`` Here 's luck , '' `` A fair wind , '' and `` Billy Bones his fancy , '' were very neatly and clearly executed on the forearm ; and up near the shoulder there was a sketch of a gallows and a man hanging from it -- done , as I thought , with great spirit ."
"`` Prophetic , '' said the doctor , touching this picture with his finger ."
"`` And now , Master Billy Bones , if that be your name , we 'll have a look at the colour of your blood ."
"Jim , '' he said , `` are you afraid of blood ? ''"
"`` No , sir , '' said I. `` Well , then , '' said he , `` you hold the basin '' ; and with that he took his lancet and opened a vein ."
A great deal of blood was taken before the captain opened his eyes and looked mistily about him .
"First he recognized the doctor with an unmistakable frown ; then his glance fell upon me , and he looked relieved ."
"But suddenly his colour changed , and he tried to raise himself , crying , `` Where 's Black Dog ? ''"
`` Never mind .
Please push up my table .
"I must write a letter , and I want you to post it for me to-night , and never say a word till I give you leave . ''"
"`` Oh , now you are going to have secrets and be mysterious , and get into a mess , are you ? ''"
"and Frank looked down at her with a suspicious air , though he was intensely curious to know what she was about ."
`` Go away till I 'm done .
"You will have to see the outside , but you ca n't know the inside till the answer comes ; '' and propping herself up , Jill wrote the following note , with some hesitation at the beginning and end , for she did not know the gentleman she was addressing , except by sight , and it was rather awkward : -- `` Robert Walker ."
"`` Dear Sir , I want to ask if Jack Minot came to see you last Friday afternoon ."
He got into trouble being seen with Jerry Shannon .
He paid him some money .
"Jack wo n't tell , and Mr. Acton talked to him about it before all the school ."
"We feel bad , because we think Jack did not do wrong ."
"I do n't know as you have anything to do with it , but I thought I 'd ask ."
Please answer quick .
"Respectfully yours , `` Jane Pecq '' To make sure that her despatch was not tampered with , Jill put a great splash of red sealing-wax on it , which gave it a very official look , and much impressed Bob when he received it ."
`` There !
"Go and post it , and do n't let any one see or know about it , '' she said , handing it over to Frank , who left his work with unusual alacrity to do her errand ."
"When his eye fell on the address , he laughed , and said in a teasing way , -- `` Are you and Bob such good friends that you correspond ?"
What will Jack say ? ''
"`` Do n't know , and do n't care !"
"Be good , now , and let 's have a little secret as well as other folks ."
"I 'll tell you all about it when he answers , '' said Jill in her most coaxing tone ."
`` Suppose he does n't ? ''
`` Then I shall send you up to see him .
"I must know something , and I want to do it myself , if I can . ''"
`` Look here ; what are you after ?
"I do believe you think -- '' Frank got no farther , for Jill gave a little scream , and stopped him by crying eagerly , `` Do n't say it out loud !"
"I really do believe it may be , and I 'm going to find out . ''"
`` What made you think of him ? ''
"and Frank looked thoughtfully at the letter , as if turning carefully over in his mind the idea that Jill 's quick wits had jumped at ."
`` Come here and I 'll tell you . ''
"Holding him by one button , she whispered something in his ear that made him exclaim , with a look at the rug , -- `` No !"
said Mrs. Danby .
"`` He lives down there at Four Winds , as they call it -- he and his daughter and an old cousin . ''"
"Isabel King bent forward , her brown eyes on Alan 's face ."
`` Did you see Lynde Oliver ? ''
she asked with suppressed eagerness .
Alan ignored the question -- perhaps he did not hear it .
`` Have they lived there long ? ''
he asked .
"`` For eighteen years , '' said Mrs. Danby placidly ."
`` It 's funny you have n't heard them mentioned .
"But people do n't talk much about the Captain now -- he 's an old story -- and of course they never go anywhere , not even to church ."
The Captain is a rank infidel and they say his daughter is just as bad .
"To be sure , nobody knows much about her , but it stands to reason that a girl who 's had her bringing up must be odd , to say no worse of her ."
"It 's not really her fault , I suppose -- her wicked old scalawag of a father is to blame for it ."
"She 's never darkened a church or school door in her life and they say she 's always been a regular tomboy -- running wild outdoors with dogs , and fishing and shooting like a man ."
Nobody ever goes there -- the Captain does n't want visitors .
"He must have done something dreadful in his time , if it was only known , when he 's so set on living like a hermit away down on that jumping-off place ."
Did you see any of them ? ''
"`` I saw Miss Oliver , I suppose , '' said Alan briefly ."
`` At least I met a young lady on the shore .
But where did these people come from ?
Surely more is known of them than this . ''
`` Precious little .
"The truth is , Mr. Douglas , folks do n't think the Olivers respectable and do n't want to have anything to do with them ."
"Eighteen years ago Captain Anthony came from goodness knows where , bought the Four Winds point , and built that house ."
He said he 'd been a sailor all his life and could n't live away from the water .
He brought his wife and child and an old cousin of his with him .
This Lynde was n't more than two years old then .
People went to call but they never saw any of the women and the Captain let them see they were n't wanted .
"Some of the men who 'd been working round the place saw his wife and said she was sickly but real handsome and like a lady , but she never seemed to want to see anyone or be seen herself ."
There was a story that the Captain had been a smuggler and that if he was caught he 'd be sent to prison .
"Oh , there were all sorts of yarns , mostly coming from the men who worked there , for nobody else ever got inside the house ."
It is no better than a sieve .
We are nearly drowned every time it rains .
But I do n't know where the money to do it is going to come from . ''
"`` Shingles for the roof , three , '' said Dorinda , as if she were carefully jotting down something in a mental memorandum ."
"`` And fourth -- now , Mother Page , I will have my say this time -- fourthly , biggest capital of all , a Nice , New Dress and a Warm Fur Coat for Mother Page this winter ."
"Yes , yes , you must have them , dearest ."
It 's absolutely necessary .
We can wait a year or so for college courses and music lessons to grow ; we can set basins under the leaks and borrow some more if we have n't enough .
"But a new dress and coat for you we must , shall , and will have , however it is to be brought about . ''"
"`` I would n't mind if I never got another new stitch , if I could only manage the other things , '' said Mrs. Page stoutly ."
"`` If your Uncle Eugene would only help us a little , until Leicester got through !"
He really ought to .
But of course he never will . ''
`` Have you ever asked him ? ''
said Dorinda .
"`` Oh , my dear , no ; of course not , '' said Mrs. Page in a horrified tone , as if Dorinda had asked if she had ever stolen a neighbour 's spoons ."
"`` I do n't see why you should n't , '' said Dorinda seriously ."
"`` Oh , Dorinda , Uncle Eugene hates us all ."
He is terribly bitter against us .
"He would never , never listen to any request for help , even if I could bring myself to make it . ''"
"`` Mother , what was the trouble between us and Uncle Eugene ?"
I have never known the rights of it .
I was too small to understand when I was home before .
"All I remember is that Uncle Eugene never came to see us or spoke to us when he met us anywhere , and we were all afraid of him somehow ."
I used to think of him as an ogre who would come creeping up the back stairs after dark and carry me off bodily if I was n't good .
What made him our enemy ?
And how did he come to get all of Grandfather Page 's property when Father got nothing ? ''
"`` Well , you know , Dorinda , that your Grandfather Page was married twice ."
"Eugene was his first wife 's son , and your father the second wife 's ."
Eugene was a great deal older than your father -- he was twenty-five when your father was born .
"He was always an odd man , even in his youth , and he had been much displeased at his father 's second marriage ."
"But he was very fond of your father -- whose mother , as you know , died at his birth -- and they were good friends and comrades until just before your father went to college ."
"`` And now , Livesey , '' said the squire in the same breath ."
"`` One at a time , one at a time , '' laughed Dr. Livesey ."
"`` You have heard of this Flint , I suppose ? ''"
`` Heard of him ! ''
cried the squire .
"`` Heard of him , you say !"
He was the bloodthirstiest buccaneer that sailed .
Blackbeard was a child to Flint .
"The Spaniards were so prodigiously afraid of him that , I tell you , sir , I was sometimes proud he was an Englishman ."
"I 've seen his top-sails with these eyes , off Trinidad , and the cowardly son of a rum-puncheon that I sailed with put back -- put back , sir , into Port of Spain . ''"
"`` Well , I 've heard of him myself , in England , '' said the doctor ."
"`` But the point is , had he money ? ''"
`` Money ! ''
cried the squire .
`` Have you heard the story ?
What were these villains after but money ?
What do they care for but money ?
For what would they risk their rascal carcasses but money ? ''
"`` That we shall soon know , '' replied the doctor ."
`` But you are so confoundedly hot-headed and exclamatory that I can not get a word in .
"What I want to know is this : Supposing that I have here in my pocket some clue to where Flint buried his treasure , will that treasure amount to much ? ''"
"`` Amount , sir ! ''"
cried the squire .
"`` It will amount to this : If we have the clue you talk about , I fit out a ship in Bristol dock , and take you and Hawkins here along , and I 'll have that treasure if I search a year . ''"
"`` Very well , '' said the doctor ."
"`` Now , then , if Jim is agreeable , we 'll open the packet '' ; and he laid it before him on the table ."
"The bundle was sewn together , and the doctor had to get out his instrument case and cut the stitches with his medical scissors ."
It contained two things -- a book and a sealed paper .
"`` First of all we 'll try the book , '' observed the doctor ."
"The squire and I were both peering over his shoulder as he opened it , for Dr. Livesey had kindly motioned me to come round from the side-table , where I had been eating , to enjoy the sport of the search ."
"On the first page there were only some scraps of writing , such as a man with a pen in his hand might make for idleness or practice ."
"One was the same as the tattoo mark , `` Billy Bones his fancy '' ; then there was `` Mr. W. Bones , mate , '' `` No more rum , '' `` Off Palm Key he got itt , '' and some other snatches , mostly single words and unintelligible ."
`` Lazy ? ''
`` Certainly .
"Laziness is a virtue in these strenuous days , I was not born with it , but I have painstakingly acquired it , and I am proud of my success ."
I have time to enjoy life . ''
"`` I think that I like you , '' said Mollie ."
"`` You have the merit of being able to enter into a situation , '' he assured her ."
When the last Jersey was milked they carried the pails down to the spring where the creamers were sunk and strained the milk into them .
Murray washed the pails and Mollie wiped them and set them in a gleaming row on the shelf under a big maple .
"`` Thank you , '' she said ."
"`` You are not going yet , '' said Murray resolutely ."
`` The time I saved you in milking three cows belongs to me .
We will spend it in a walk along the pond shore .
I will show you a path I have discovered under the beeches .
It is just wide enough for two .
Come . ''
"He took her hand and drew her through the copse into a green lane , where the ferns grew thickly on either side and the pond waters plashed dreamily below them ."
"He kept her hand in his as they went down the path , and she did not try to withdraw it ."
"About them was the great , pure silence of the morning , faintly threaded with caressing sounds -- croon of birds , gurgle of waters , sough of wind ."
The spirit of youth and love hovered over them and they spoke no word .
"When they finally came out on a little green nook swimming in early sunshine and arched over by maples , with the wide shimmer of the pond before it and the gold dust of blossoms over the grass , the girl drew a long breath of delight ."
"`` It is a morning left over from Eden , is n't it ? ''"
said Murray .
"`` Yes , '' said Mollie softly ."
Murray bent toward her .
"`` You are Eve , '' he said ."
`` You are the only woman in the world -- for me .
Adam must have told Eve just what he thought about her the first time he saw her .
There were no conventionalities in Eden -- and people could not have taken long to make up their minds .
We are in Eden just now .
One can say what he thinks in Eden without being ridiculous .
"You are divinely fair , Eve ."
Your eyes are stars of the morning -- your cheek has the flush it stole from the sunrise-your lips are redder than the roses of paradise .
"He said that he must really go back or he would be late for dinner , lifted his hat politely , and departed ."
"Katherine waited until he was out of sight , then sat down on the sand and put on her shoes and stockings ."
`` Who on earth can he be ? ''
she said to herself .
`` And where have I seen him before ?
There was certainly something familiar about his appearance .
"He is very nice , but he must have thought me crazy ."
I wonder if he belongs to Harbour Hill . ''
The mystery was solved when she got home and found a letter from Edith awaiting her .
"`` I see Ned quite often , '' wrote the latter , `` and I think he is perfectly splendid ."
"You are a lucky girl , Kate ."
"But oh , do you know that Sidney is actually at Harbour Hill , too , or at least quite near it ?"
I had a letter from him yesterday .
"He has gone down there to spend his vacation , because it is so quiet , and to finish up some horrid scientific book he is working at ."
He 's boarding at some little farmhouse up the shore .
I 've written to him today to hunt you up and consider himself introduced to you .
"I think you 'll like him , for he 's just your style . ''"
Katherine smiled when Sidney Keith 's card was brought up to her that evening and went down to meet him .
Her companion of the morning rose to meet her .
`` You ! ''
he said .
"`` Yes , me , '' said Miss Rangely cheerfully and ungrammatically ."
"`` You did n't expect it , did you ?"
I was sure I had seen you before -- only it was n't you but your photograph . ''
When Professor Keith went away it was with a cordial invitation to call again .
"He did not fail to avail himself of it -- in fact , he became a constant visitor at Sycamore Villa ."
Katherine wrote all about it to Edith and cultivated Professor Keith with a dear conscience .
They got on capitally together .
"They went on long expeditions up shore after seaweeds , and when seaweeds were exhausted they began to make a collection of the Harbour Hill flora ."
"This involved more long , companionable expeditions ."
"Katherine sometimes wondered when Professor Keith found time to work on his book , but as he made no reference to the subject , neither did she ."
"Once in a while , when she had time to think of them , she wondered how Ned and Edith were getting on ."
He passed down the lane and over the little rustic bridge that spanned the brook .
Just beyond was another home-made gate of poles .
"Lincoln opened it , or rather he had his hand on the hasp of twisted withes which secured it , when he was suddenly arrested by the apparition of a girl , who flashed around the curve of young birch beyond and stood before him with panting breath and quivering lips ."
"`` I beg your pardon , '' said John Lincoln courteously , dropping the gate and lifting his hat ."
`` I am looking for the house of Mr. James Conway -- ` The Evergreens . '
Can you direct me to it ? ''
"`` That is Mr. James Conway 's house , '' said the girl , with the tragic air and tone of one driven to desperation and an impatient gesture of her hand toward the yellow nightmare above them ."
"`` I do n't think he can be the one I mean , '' said Lincoln perplexedly ."
"`` The man I am thinking of has a niece , Miss Richmond . ''"
"`` There is no other James Conway in Plainfield , '' said the girl ."
`` This is his place -- nobody calls it ` The Evergreens ' but myself .
I am Sidney Richmond . ''
"For a moment they looked at each other across the gate , sheer amazement and bewilderment holding John Lincoln mute ."
"Sidney , burning with shame , saw that this stranger was exceedingly good to look upon -- tall , clean-limbed , broad-shouldered , with clear-cut bronzed features and a chin and eyes that would have done honour to any man ."
"John Lincoln , among all his confused sensations , was aware that this slim , agitated young creature before him was the loveliest thing he ever had seen , so lithe was her figure , so glossy and dark and silken her bare , wind-ruffled hair , so big and brown and appealing her eyes , so delicately oval her flushed cheeks ."
"He felt that she was frightened and in trouble , and he wanted to comfort and reassure her ."
But how could she be Sidney Richmond ?
"`` I do n't understand , '' he said perplexedly ."
`` Oh ! ''
Sidney threw out her hands in a burst of passionate protest .
"`` No , and you never will understand -- I ca n't make you understand . ''"
"`` I do n't understand , '' said John Lincoln again ."
`` Can you be Sidney Richmond -- the Sidney Richmond who has written to me for four years ? ''
`` I am . ''
"`` Then , those letters -- '' `` Were all lies , '' said Sidney bluntly and desperately ."
`` There was nothing true in them -- nothing at all .
This is my home .
We are poor .
Everything I told you about it and my life was just imagination . ''
`` Then why did you write them ? ''
he asked blankly .
`` Why did you deceive me ? ''
`` Let us run . ''
"`` Not so , '' returned Dick ."
`` See ye not ?
-- he is stone blind .
He guideth him with a staff .
"Let us lie still ; the wind bloweth towards the path , and he will go by and hurt us not ."
"Alas , poor soul , and we should rather pity him ! ''"
"`` I will pity him when he is by , '' replied Matcham ."
"The blind leper was now about halfway towards them , and just then the sun rose and shone full on his veiled face ."
"He had been a tall man before he was bowed by his disgusting sickness , and even now he walked with a vigorous step ."
"The dismal beating of his bell , the pattering of the stick , the eyeless screen before his countenance , and the knowledge that he was not only doomed to death and suffering , but shut out for ever from the touch of his fellow-men , filled the lads ' bosoms with dismay ; and at every step that brought him nearer , their courage and strength seemed to desert them ."
"As he came about level with the pit , he paused , and turned his face full upon the lads ."
`` Mary be my shield !
He sees us ! ''
"said Matcham , faintly ."
`` Hush ! ''
whispered Dick .
`` He doth but hearken .
"He is blind , fool ! ''"
"The leper looked or listened , whichever he was really doing , for some seconds ."
"Then he began to move on again , but presently paused once more , and again turned and seemed to gaze upon the lads ."
"Even Dick became dead-white and closed his eyes , as if by the mere sight he might become infected ."
"But soon the bell sounded , and this time , without any farther hesitation , the leper crossed the remainder of the little heath and disappeared into the covert of the woods ."
"`` He saw us , '' said Matcham ."
`` I could swear it ! ''
`` Tut ! ''
"returned Dick , recovering some sparks of courage ."
`` He but heard us .
"He was in fear , poor soul !"
"An ye were blind , and walked in a perpetual night , ye would start yourself , if ever a twig rustled or a bird cried ` Peep . ' ''"
"`` Dick , good Dick , he saw us , '' repeated Matcham ."
"`` When a man hearkeneth , he doth not as this man ; he doth otherwise , Dick ."
She dared not say it was impossible .
But Aunt Emma had no such scruples .
"With a great clatter and racket , that lady fell upon the dishes that held Patty 's almost untasted dinner and whisked them away while her tongue kept time to her jerky movements ."
"`` Goodness me , doctor , do you think you 're talking to millionaires ?"
Where do you suppose the money is to come from to send Patty to the country ?
"I ca n't afford it , that is certain ."
"I think I do pretty well to give Marcella and Patty their board free , and I have to work my fingers to the bone to do that ."
"It 's all nonsense about Patty , anyhow ."
What she ought to do is to make an effort to get better .
She does n't -- she just mopes and pines .
She wo n't eat a thing I cook for her .
How can anyone expect to get better if she does n't eat ? ''
Aunt Emma glared at the doctor as if she were triumphantly sure that she had propounded an unanswerable question .
A dull red flush rose to Marcella 's face .
"`` Oh , Aunt Emma , I ca n't eat ! ''"
said Patty wearily .
"`` It is n't because I wo n't -- indeed , I ca n't . ''"
`` Humph !
I suppose my cooking is n't fancy enough for you -- that 's the trouble .
"Well , I have n't the time to put any frills on it ."
I think I do pretty well to wait on you at all with all that work piling up before me .
But some people imagine that they were born to be waited on . ''
"Aunt Emma whirled the last dish from the table and left the room , slamming the door behind her ."
The doctor shrugged his shoulders .
He had become used to Miss Gibson 's tirades during Patty 's illness .
"But Marcella had never got used to them -- never , in all the three years she had lived with her aunt ."
They flicked on the raw as keenly as ever .
This morning it seemed unbearable .
It took every atom of Marcella 's self-control to keep her from voicing her resentful thoughts .
It was only for Patty 's sake that she was able to restrain herself .
"It was only for Patty 's sake , too , that she did not , as soon as the doctor had gone , give way to tears ."
"Instead , she smiled bravely into the little sister 's eyes ."
"""Very well,"" said the crow, ""open your mouth wide, and I'll fly down and see."" So the Rohu opened his jaws and the crow flew down, but he came up again very quickly. ""You have a Rakshas in your stomach,"" said the crow, and he flew away. This news did not comfort the poor Rohu, and he swam on and on till he came to Prince Majnun's country. There he stopped. And a jackal came down to the river to drink. ""Oh, jackal,"" said the Rohu, ""do tell me what I have inside me."""
"""How can I tell?"" said the jackal. ""I cannot see unless I go inside you."" So the Rohu opened his mouth wide, and the jackal jumped down his throat; but he came up very quickly, looking much frightened and saying, ""You have a Rakshas in your stomach, and if I don't run away quickly, I am afraid it will eat me."" So off he ran. After the jackal came an enormous snake. ""Oh,"" says the fish, ""do tell me what I have in my stomach, for it rattles about so, and keeps saying, 'Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun.'"""
"The snake said, ""Open your mouth wide, and I'll go down and see what it is."" The snake went down: when he returned he said, ""You have a Rakshas in your stomach, but if you will let me cut you open, it will come out of you."" ""If you do that, I shall die,"" said the Rohu. ""Oh, no,"" said the snake, ""you will not, for I will give you a medicine that will make you quite well again."" So the fish agreed, and the snake got a knife and cut him open, and out jumped Laili."
"She was now very old. Twelve years she had wandered about the jungle, and for twelve years she had lived inside her Rohu; and she was no longer beautiful, and had lost her teeth. The snake took her on his back and carried her into the country, and there he put her down, and she wandered on and on till she got to Majnun's court-house, where King Majnun was sitting. There some men heard her crying, ""Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun,"" and they asked her what she wanted. ""I want King Majnun,"" she said."
"So they went in and said to Prince Majnun, ""An old woman outside says she wants you."" ""I cannot leave this place,"" said he; ""send her in here."" They brought her in and the prince asked her what she wanted."
"""I want to marry you,"" she answered. ""Twenty-four years ago you came to my father the Phalana Raja's country, and I wanted to marry you then; but you went away without marrying me. Then I went mad, and I have wandered about all these years looking for you."" Prince Majnun said, ""Very good."""
"""Pray to Khuda,"" said Laili, ""to make us both young again, and then we shall be married."" So the prince prayed to Khuda, and Khuda said to him, ""Touch Laili's clothes and they will catch fire, and when they are on fire, she and you will become young again."" When he touched Laili's clothes they caught fire, and she and he became young again."
"And there were great feasts, and they were married, and travelled to the Phalana country to see her father and mother."
"Now Laili's father and mother had wept so much for their daughter that they had become quite blind, and her father kept always repeating, ""Laili, Laili, Laili."" When Laili saw their blindness, she prayed to Khuda to restore their sight to them, which he did. As soon as the father and mother saw Laili, they hugged her and kissed her, and then they had the wedding all over again amid great rejoicings. Prince Majnun and Laili stayed with Munsuk Raja and his wife for three years, and then they returned to King Dantal, and lived happily for some time with him."
"They used to go out hunting, and they often went from country to country to eat the air and amuse themselves."
"One day Prince Majnun said to Laili, ""Let us go through this jungle."""
"""No, no,"" said Laili; ""if we go through this jungle, some harm will happen to me."" But Prince Majnun laughed, and went into the jungle."
"And as they were going through it, Khuda thought, ""I should like to know how much Prince Majnun loves his wife. Would he be very sorry if she died? And would he marry another wife? I will see."" So he sent one of his angels in the form of a fakir into the jungle; and the angel went up to Laili, and threw some powder in her face, and instantly she fell to the ground a heap of ashes."
"Prince Majnun was in great sorrow and grief when he saw his dear Laili turned into a little heap of ashes; and he went straight home to his father, and for a long, long time he would not be comforted. After a great many years he grew more cheerful and happy, and began to go again into his father's beautiful garden with Husain Mahamat. King Dantal wished his son to marry again. ""I will only have Laili for my wife; I will not marry any other woman,"" said Prince Majnun."
"""How can you marry Laili? Laili is dead. She will never come back to you,"" said the father."
"""Then I'll not have any wife at all,"" said Prince Majnun."
"Meanwhile Laili was living in the jungle where her husband had left her a little heap of ashes. As soon as Majnun had gone, the fakir had taken her ashes and made them quite clean, and then he had mixed clay and water with the ashes, and made the figure of a woman with them, and so Laili regained her human form, and Khuda sent life into it. But Laili had become once more a hideous old woman, with a long, long nose, and teeth like tusks; just such an old woman, excepting her teeth, as she had been when she came out of the Rohu fish; and she lived in the jungle, and neither ate nor drank, and she kept on saying, ""Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun."""
"At last the angel who had come as a fakir and thrown the powder at her, said to Khuda, ""Of what use is it that this woman should sit in the jungle crying, crying for ever, 'Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun,'"
"and eating and drinking nothing? Let me take her to Prince Majnun."""
"""Well,"" said Khuda, ""you may do so; but tell her that she must not speak to Majnun if he is afraid of her when he sees her; and that if he is afraid when he sees her, she will become a little white dog the next day. Then she must go to the palace, and she will only regain her human shape when Prince Majnun loves her, feeds her with his own food, and lets her sleep in his bed."""
"So the angel came to Laili again as a fakir and carried her to King Dantal's garden. ""Now,"" he said, ""it is Khuda's command that you stay here till Prince Majnun comes to walk in the garden, and then you may show yourself to him. But you must not speak to him, if he is afraid of you; and should he be afraid of you, you will the next day become a little white dog."" He then told her what she must do as a little dog to regain her human form."
"Laili stayed in the garden, hidden in the tall grass, till Prince Majnun and Husain Mahamat came to walk in the garden. King Dantal was now a very old man, and Husain Mahamat, though he was really only as old as Prince Majnun, looked a great deal older than the prince, who had been made quite young again when he married Laili."
"As Prince Majnun and the Wazir's son walked in the garden, they gathered the fruit as they had done as little children, only they bit the fruit with their teeth; they did not cut it. While Majnun was busy eating a fruit in this way, and was talking to Husain Mahamat, he turned towards him and saw Laili walking behind the Wazir's son. ""Oh, look, look!"" he cried, ""see what is following you; it is a Rakshas or a demon, and I am sure it is going to eat us."" Laili looked at him beseechingly with all her eyes, and trembled with age and eagerness; but this only frightened Majnun the more. ""It is a Rakshas, a Rakshas!"" he cried, and he ran quickly to the palace with the Wazir's son; and as they ran away, Laili disappeared into the jungle. They ran to King Dantal, and Majnun told him there was a Rakshas or a demon in the garden that had come to eat them."
"""What nonsense,"" said his father. ""Fancy two grown men being so frightened by an old ayah or a fakir! And if it had been a Rakshas, it would not have eaten you."" Indeed King Dantal did not believe Majnun had seen anything at all, till Husain Mahamat said the prince was speaking the exact truth. They had the garden searched for the terrible old woman, but found nothing, and King Dantal told his son he was very silly to be so much frightened. However, Prince Majnun would not walk in the garden any more."
"The next day Laili turned into a pretty little dog; and in this shape she came into the palace, where Prince Majnun soon became very fond of her. She followed him everywhere, went with him when he was out hunting, and helped him to catch his game, and Prince Majnun fed her with milk, or bread, or anything else he was eating, and at night the little dog slept in his bed."
"But one night the little dog disappeared, and in its stead there lay the little old woman who had frightened him so much in the garden; and now Prince Majnun was quite sure she was a Rakshas, or a demon, or some such horrible thing come to eat him; and in his terror he cried out, ""What do you want? Oh, do not eat me; do not eat me!"" Poor Laili answered, ""Don't you know me? I am your wife Laili, and I want to marry you. Don't you remember how you would go through that jungle, though I begged and begged you not to go, for I told you that harm would happen to me, and then a fakir came and threw powder in my face, and I became a heap of ashes. But Khuda gave me my life again, and brought me here, after I had stayed a long, long while in the jungle crying for you, and now I am obliged to be a little dog; but if you will marry me, I shall not be a little dog any more."" Majnun, however, said ""How can I marry an old woman like you? how can you be Laili? I am sure you are a Rakshas or a demon come to eat me,"" and he was in great terror."
"In the morning the old woman had turned into the little dog, and the prince went to his father and told him all that had happened. ""An old woman! an old woman! always an old woman!"" said his father. ""You do nothing but think of old women. How can a strong man like you be so easily frightened?"" However, when he saw that his son was really in great terror, and that he really believed the old woman would came back at night, he advised him to say to her, ""I will marry you if you can make yourself a young girl again. How can I marry such an old woman as you are?"""
"That night as he lay trembling in bed the little old woman lay there in place of the dog, crying ""Majnun, Majnun, I want to marry you. I have loved you all these long, long years. When I was in my father's kingdom a young girl, I knew of you, though you knew nothing of me, and we should have been married then if you had not gone away so suddenly, and for long, long years I followed you."" ""Well,"" said Majnun, ""if you can make yourself a young girl again, I will marry you."""
"Laili said, ""Oh, that is quite easy. Khuda will make me a young girl again. In two days' time you must go into the garden, and there you will see a beautiful fruit. You must gather it and bring it into your room and cut it open yourself very gently, and you must not open it when your father or anybody else is with you, but when you are quite alone; for I shall be in the fruit quite naked, without any clothes at all on."" In the morning Laili took her little dog's form, and disappeared in the garden."
"Prince Majnun told all this to his father, who told him to do all the old woman had bidden him. In two days' time he and the Wazir's son walked in the garden, and there they saw a large, lovely red fruit."
"""Oh!"" said the Prince, ""I wonder shall I find my wife in that fruit."""
"The strange rabbit stopped dancing, and came quite close. He came so close this time that his long whiskers brushed the Velveteen Rabbit's ear, and then he wrinkled his nose suddenly and flattened his ears and jumped backwards."
"""He doesn't smell right!"" he exclaimed. ""He isn't a rabbit at all! He isn't real!"""
"""I am Real!"" said the little Rabbit. ""I am Real! The Boy said so!"" And he nearly began to cry."
"Just then there was a sound of footsteps, and the Boy ran past near them, and with a stamp of feet and a flash of white tails the two strange rabbits disappeared."
"""Come back and play with me!"" called the little Rabbit. ""Oh, do come back! I know I am Real!"""
"But there was no answer, only the little ants ran to and fro, and the bracken swayed gently where the two strangers had passed. The Velveteen Rabbit was all alone."
"""Oh, dear!"" he thought. ""Why did they run away like that? Why couldn't they stop and talk to me?"""
"For a long time he lay very still, watching the bracken, and hoping that they would come back. But they never returned, and presently the sun sank lower and the little white moths fluttered out, and the Boy came and carried him home."
"Weeks passed, and the little Rabbit grew very old and shabby, but the Boy loved him just as much. He loved him so hard that he loved all his whiskers off, and the pink lining to his ears turned grey, and his brown spots faded. He even began to lose his shape, and he scarcely looked like a rabbit any more, except to the Boy. To him he was always beautiful, and that was all that the little Rabbit cared about. He didn't mind how he looked to other people, because the nursery magic had made him Real, and when you are Real shabbiness doesn't matter."
"And then, one day, the Boy was ill."
"His face grew very flushed, and he talked in his sleep, and his little body was so hot that it burned the Rabbit when he held him close."
"Strange people came and went in the nursery, and a light burned all night and through it all the little Velveteen Rabbit lay there, hidden from sight under the bedclothes, and he never stirred, for he was afraid that if they found him some one might take him away, and he knew that the Boy needed him."
"It was a long weary time, for the Boy was too ill to play, and the little Rabbit found it rather dull with nothing to do all day long."
"But he snuggled down patiently, and looked forward to the time when the Boy should be well again, and they would go out in the garden amongst the flowers and the butterflies and play splendid games in the raspberry thicket like they used to. All sorts of delightful things he planned, and while the Boy lay half asleep he crept up close to the pillow and whispered them in his ear. And presently the fever turned, and the Boy got better. He was able to sit up in bed and look at picture-books, while the little Rabbit cuddled close at his side. And one day, they let him get up and dress."
"It was a bright, sunny morning, and the windows stood wide open. They had carried the Boy out on to the balcony, wrapped in a shawl, and the little Rabbit lay tangled up among the bedclothes, thinking."
"The Boy was going to the seaside to-morrow. Everything was arranged, and now it only remained to carry out the doctor's orders. They talked about it all, while the little Rabbit lay under the bedclothes, with just his head peeping out, and listened. The room was to be disinfected, and all the books and toys that the Boy had played with in bed must be burnt."
"""Hurrah!"" thought the little Rabbit. ""To-morrow we shall go to the seaside!"" For the boy had often talked of the seaside, and he wanted very much to see the big waves coming in, and the tiny crabs, and the sand castles."
Just then Nana caught sight of him.
"""How about his old Bunny?"" she asked."
"""That?"" said the doctor. ""Why, it's a mass of scarlet fever germs!-Burn it at once. What? Nonsense! Get him a new one. He mustn't have that any more!"""
Anxious Times
"And so the little Rabbit was put into a sack with the old picture-books and a lot of rubbish, and carried out to the end of the garden behind the fowl-house. That was a fine place to make a bonfire, only the gardener was too busy just then to attend to it. He had the potatoes to dig and the green peas to gather, but next morning he promised to come quite early and burn the whole lot."
"That night the Boy slept in a different bedroom, and he had a new bunny to sleep with him. It was a splendid bunny, all white plush with real glass eyes, but the Boy was too excited to care very much about it. For to-morrow he was going to the seaside, and that in itself was such a wonderful thing that he could think of nothing else."
"And while the Boy was asleep, dreaming of the seaside, the little Rabbit lay among the old picture-books in the corner behind the fowl-house, and he felt very lonely. The sack had been left untied, and so by wriggling a bit he was able to get his head through the opening and look out. He was shivering a little, for he had always been used to sleeping in a proper bed, and by this time his coat had worn so thin and threadbare from hugging that it was no longer any protection to him. Near by he could see the thicket of raspberry canes, growing tall and close like a tropical jungle, in whose shadow he had played with the Boy on bygone mornings. He thought of those long sunlit hours in the garden-how happy they were-and a great sadness came over him. He seemed to see them all pass before him, each more beautiful than the other, the fairy huts in the flower-bed, the quiet evenings in the wood when he lay in the bracken and the little ants ran over his paws; the wonderful day when he first knew that he was Real. He thought of the Skin Horse, so wise and gentle, and all that he had told him. Of what use was it to be loved and lose one's beauty and become Real if it all ended like this? And a tear, a real tear, trickled down his little shabby velvet nose and fell to the ground."
"And then a strange thing happened. For where the tear had fallen a flower grew out of the ground, a mysterious flower, not at all like any that grew in the garden. It had slender green leaves the colour of emeralds, and in the centre of the leaves a blossom like a golden cup."
"It was so beautiful that the little Rabbit forgot to cry, and just lay there watching it. And presently the blossom opened, and out of it there stepped a fairy."
"She was quite the loveliest fairy in the whole world. Her dress was of pearl and dew-drops, and there were flowers round her neck and in her hair, and her face was like the most perfect flower of all. And she came close to the little Rabbit and gathered him up in her arms and kissed him on his velveteen nose that was all damp from crying."
"""Little Rabbit,"" she said, ""don't you know who I am?"""
"The Rabbit looked up at her, and it seemed to him that he had seen her face before, but he couldn't think where."
"""I am the nursery magic Fairy,"" she said. ""I take care of all the playthings that the children have loved. When they are old and worn out and the children don't need them any more, then I come and take them away with me and turn them into Real."""
"""Wasn't I Real before?"" asked the little Rabbit."
"""You were Real to the Boy,"" the Fairy said, ""because he loved you. Now you shall be Real to every one."""
"Then Princess Mary Ann spoke up royally, and said, ""Don't be silly, because it's only in fairy stories and histories of England and things like that, that people are unkind and want to hurt each other. In Rotundia everyone is kind, and no one has anything to be afraid of, unless they're naughty; and then we know it's for our own good. Let's all go and see the dragon. We might take him some acid drops."" So they went. And all the titled children took it in turns to feed the dragon with acid drops, and he seemed pleased and flattered, and wagged as much of his purple tail as he could get at conveniently; for it was a very, very long tail indeed. But when it came to the Princess's turn to give an acid drop to the dragon, he smiled a very wide smile, and wagged his tail to the very last long inch of it, as much as to say, ""Oh, you nice, kind, pretty little Princess."" But deep down in his wicked purple heart he was saying, ""Oh, you nice, fat, pretty little Princess, I should like to eat you instead of these silly acid drops."" But of course nobody heard him except the Princess's uncle, and he was a magician, and accustomed to listening at doors. It was part of his trade."
"Now, you will remember that I told you there was one wicked person in Rotundia, and I cannot conceal from you any longer that this Complete Bad was the Princess's Uncle James. Magicians are always bad, as you know from your fairy books, and some uncles are bad, as you see by the Babes in the Wood, or the Norfolk Tragedy, and one James at least was bad, as you have learned from your English history. And when anyone is a magician, and is also an uncle, and is named James as well, you need not expect anything nice from him. He is a Threefold Complete Bad and he will come to no good."
"Uncle James had long wanted to get rid of the Princess and have the kingdom to himself. He did not like many things a nice kingdom was almost the only thing he cared for but he had never seen his way quite clearly, because everyone is so kind in Rotundia that wicked spells will not work there, but run off those blameless islanders like water off a duck's back. Now, however, Uncle James thought there might be a chance for him because he knew that now there were two wicked people on the island who could stand by each other himself and the dragon. He said nothing, but he exchanged a meaningful glance with the dragon, and everyone went home to tea. And no one had seen the meaningful glance except Tom."
"Tom went home, and told his elephant all about it. The intelligent little creature listened carefully, and then climbed from Tom's knee to the table, on which stood an ornamental calendar that the Princess had given Tom for a Christmas present. With its tiny trunk the elephant pointed out a date the fifteenth of August, the Princess's birthday, and looked anxiously at its master."
"""What is it, Fido good little elephant then?"" said Tom, and the sagacious animal repeated its former gesture. Then Tom understood."
"""Oh, something is to happen on her birthday? All right. I'll be on the lookout."" And he was."
"At first the people of Rotundia were quite pleased with the dragon, who lived by the pillar and fed himself from the bun trees, but by-and-by he began to wander. He would creep into the burrows made by the great rabbits; and excursionists, sporting on the downs, would see his long, tight, whiplike tail wriggling down a burrow and out of sight, and before they had time to say, ""There he goes,"" his ugly purple head would come poking out from another rabbit-hole perhaps just behind them or laugh softly to itself just in their ears. And the dragon's laugh was not a merry one. This sort of hide-and-seek amused people at first, but by-and-by it began to get on their nerves: and if you don't know what that means, ask Mother to tell you next time you are playing blind man's buff when she has a headache. Then the dragon got into the habit of cracking his tail, as people crack whips, and this also got on people's nerves. Then, too, little things began to be missed. And you know how unpleasant that is, even in a private school, and in a public kingdom it is, of course, much worse. The things that were missed were nothing much at first a few little elephants, a hippopotamus or two, and some giraffes, and things like that. It was nothing much, as I say, but it made people feel uncomfortable. Then one day a favorite rabbit of the Princess's, called Frederick, mysteriously disappeared, and then came a terrible morning when the Mexican lapdog was missing. He had barked ever since the dragon came to the island, and people had grown quite used to the noise. So when his barking suddenly ceased it woke everybody up and they all went out to see what was the matter. And the lapdog was gone!"
"A boy was sent to wake the army, so that it might look for him. But the army was gone too! And now the people began to be frightened. Then Uncle James came out onto the terrace of the palace, and he made the people a speech. He said: ""Friends fellow citizens I cannot disguise from myself or from you that this purple dragon is a poor penniless exile, a helpless alien in our midst, and, besides, he is a is no end of a dragon."""
"The people thought of the dragon's tail and said, ""Hear, hear."""
"Uncle James went on: ""Something has happened to a gentle and defenseless member of our community. We don't know what has happened."""
"Everyone thought of the rabbit named Frederick, and groaned."
"""The defenses of our country have been swallowed up,"" said Uncle James."
Everyone thought of the poor army.
"""There is only one thing to be done."" Uncle James was warming to his subject. ""Could we ever forgive ourselves if by neglecting a simple precaution we lost more rabbits or even, perhaps, our navy, our police, and our fire brigade? For I warn you that the purple dragon will respect nothing, however sacred."""
"Everyone thought of themselves and they said, ""What is the simple precaution?"""
"Then Uncle James said: ""Tomorrow is the dragon's birthday. He is accustomed to have a present on his birthday. If he gets a nice present he will be in a hurry to take it away and show it to his friends, and he will fly off and never come back."""
The crowd cheered wildly and the Princess from her balcony clapped her hands.
"""The present the dragon expects,"" said Uncle James, cheerfully, ""is rather an expensive one. But, when we give, it should not be in a grudging spirit, especially to visitors. What the dragon wants is a Princess. We have only one Princess, it is true; but far be it from us to display a miserly temper at such a moment. And the gift is worthless that costs the giver nothing. Your readiness to give up your Princess will only show how generous you are."""
"The crowd began to cry, for they loved their Princess, though they quite saw that their first duty was to be generous and give the poor dragon what it wanted."
"The Princess began to cry, for she did not want to be anybody's birthday present especially a purple dragon's. And Tom began to cry because he was so angry."
He went straight home and told his little elephant; and the elephant cheered him up so much that presently the two grew quite absorbed in a top that the elephant was spinning with his little trunk.
Early in the morning Tom went to the palace. He looked out across the downs there were hardly any rabbits playing there now and then he gathered white roses and threw them at the Princess's window till she woke up and looked out.
"""Come up and kiss me,"" she said."
"So Tom climbed up the white rosebush and kissed the Princess through the window, and said: ""Many happy returns of the day."""
"Then Mary Ann began to cry, and said: ""Oh, Tom how can you? When you know quite well """
"""Oh, don't,"" said Tom. ""Why, Mary Ann, my precious, my Princess what do you think I should be doing while the dragon was getting his birthday present? Don't cry, my own little Mary Ann! Fido and I have arranged everything. You've only got to do as you are told."""
"""Is that all?"" said the Princess. ""Oh that's easy I've often done that!"""
"Then Tom told her what she was to do. And she kissed him again and again. ""Oh, you dear, good, clever Tom,"" she said. ""How glad I am that I gave you Fido. You two have saved me. You dears!"""
"The next morning Uncle James put on his best coat and hat and the vest with the gold snakes on it he was a magician, and he had a bright taste in vests and he called with a cab to take the Princess out."
"""Come, little birthday present,"" he said tenderly. ""The dragon will be so pleased. And I'm glad to see you're not crying. You know, my child, we cannot begin too young to learn to think of the happiness of others rather than our own. I should not like my dear little niece to be selfish, or to wish to deny a trivial pleasure to a poor, sick dragon, far from his home and friends."""
The Princess said she would try not to be selfish.
"But the king would not listen. ""Take them away and cut off their heads,"""
he cried angrily. And when his nobles begged him to spare such brave enemies he would not listen to them.
"Then Queen Philippa, whose heart was filled with pity for the poor men, fell upon her knees."
"""My lord,"" she cried, ""if you love me, give me the lives of these men."""
"King Edward could not bear to see his beautiful queen in tears upon the ground, so he raised her, saying: ""Lady, I wish you had not been here, for I cannot say you nay. Take the men, they are yours."""
"Then Queen Philippa joyfully led the brave men away, and gave them food and clothes, and sent them back to their friends. So they, and all the people of Calais, were saved."
Wat Tyler
"In our days, all people in our land, except prisoners, are free to go where they will, and to do what work they please. In olden times it was not so. Then, the poorer people were treated like slaves by the nobles; they had to work hard for their masters, and they were not allowed to move from one place to another without asking leave."
"This was hard, and it made the people very angry. In the days of the boy-king Richard II, a great many workmen made up their minds to obey the nobles no longer. They banded themselves together in a large army, chose a man named Wat Tyler for their leader, and marched to London."
"The Mayor of London tried to stop them, by pulling up the drawbridge which crossed the river Thames, but they forced him by threats to let it down again. Then they rushed through the streets of London, frightening all the people they met by their wild looks and cries. They broke open the prisons, and set the prisoners free, and burned the palaces of the nobles, but they killed no man and robbed none."
"The nobles were much alarmed. With young King Richard at their head, they rode out to meet this army, and to ask the people what they wanted."
"""We want to be free, and we want our children to be free after us,"" said Wat Tyler."
"""I promise you that you shall have your wish, if you will return quietly to your homes,"" said the king."
"At this, the people shouted with joy, and all might have been well; but the mayor, seeing Wat Tyler raise his hand, and fearing that he was going to strike the king, drew his sword, and killed the leader of the people."
"Then the joyful shouts changed to cries and growls of anger. Arms were raised, and the crowd began to press forward. In a minute the little band of nobles would have been attacked, but the boy-king saw the danger. Boldly riding to meet the angry people, he put himself at their head. ""What need ye, my masters?"" cried he. ""I am your captain and your king. Follow me."""
"The crowd stopped, surprised by this bold act; the loud cries ceased, and swords and staves were lowered. These rough men did not wish to harm their young sovereign, but to free him from the nobles who gave him evil counsel. They were greatly pleased to find him upon their side, and, with perfect trust and loyalty, they followed where he led; and so for a time the danger was past."
Bruce and the Spider
"Robert Bruce, King of Scotland, sad and weary, lay upon the floor of a lonely cave among the hills. His mind was full of anxious thoughts, for he was hiding from the English soldiers, who sought to take him alive or dead to their king. The brave Scots had lost many battles, and Bruce began to fear that he would never make his dear country free."
"""I will give up trying,"" said he."
"Just then a spider, hanging from the roof of the cave, by a long thread, swung before the king's eyes, and he left his gloomy thoughts to see what the little creature would do."
"The spider began to climb its thread slowly, pulling itself up little by little; but it had gone only a short way, when it slipped and fell to the end once more."
"Again and again it started to climb, and again and again it slipped back, until it had fallen six times."
"""Surely the silly little creature will now give up trying to climb so fine a thread,"" thought Bruce. But the spider did no such thing. It started on its upward journey yet a seventh time, and this time it did not fall. Up it went, inch by inch, higher and higher, until at last it reached the roof, and was safely at home."
"""Bravo!"" cried the king. ""The spider has taught me a lesson. I too will try until I win."""
"Bruce kept his word. He led his brave men to battle, again and again, until at last the English were driven back to their own land, and Scotland was free."
Richard and Blondel
"""I think,"" remarked a Red-headed Woodpecker, ""that I have the best wing feathers now that I ever had. They seem to be a little longer, and they hook together so well. I almost wish I were going South to try them on a long journey."""
"""Mr. Woodpecker's wing feathers are certainly excellent,"" said his wife, who was always glad to see him well dressed. ""I am sure that the strongest wind will never part them. I don't see how the Owls can stand it to wear their feathers unhooked so that some of the air passes through their wings each time they flap them. It must make flying hard."""
"""Well, if you were an Owl you would understand,"" chuckled the Crow. ""If their great wings were like ours, the noise of their flying would scare every creature within hearing, and there would not be much fun in hunting."""
"And so they chatted on, while from the meadow came the sound of the happy insects piping in the sunshine. It was chilly now at night and in the early morning, and they could give concerts only at noonday. The next day the Wild Turkeys came and there was great excitement in the forest. The Squirrels were busier than ever storing up all the acorns that they could before the newcomers reached the oak trees; and the Blue Jays were so jealous of the Turkeys that they overate every day for fear there would not be enough to go around. As though there were any danger!"
"The Ground Hog was getting so sleepy now that he would doze off while people were talking to him, and then he would suddenly straighten up and say: ""Yes, yes, yes! Don't think that I was asleep, please. The colors of the trees are so bright that they tire my eyes and I sometimes close them."" The dear old fellow really never knew how he had been nodding."
"The Snakes, too, were growing dull and slow of motion, while the Bats talked freely of hanging themselves up for the winter. The Grouse and Quail made daily trips to the edges of the grain-fields, and found rich picking among the stubble. You could almost fancy that they came home each night fatter than when they went away in the morning."
"Life went on in this way for many days, and the birds had all stopped singing. There were no more happy concerts at sunrise and no more carols at evening; only chirrupings and twitterings as the feathered people hopped restlessly from one perch to another. All could see that they were busily thinking and had no time for music. The truth was that each bird who was not to spend the winter in the Forest felt as though something were drawing drawing drawing him southward. It was something they could not see or hear, and yet it was drawing drawing drawing all day and all night. They spoke of it often to each other, and the older birds told the young ones how, before long, they would all start South, and fly over land and water until they reached their winter home."
"""How do we know where to go?"" asked the children."
"""All that you have to do,"" the older ones said, ""is to follow us."""
"""And how do you know?"" they asked."
"""Why, we have been there before,"" they answered; ""and we can see the places over which we pass. But perhaps that is not the real reason, for sometimes we fly over such great stretches of water that we can see nothing else and it all looks alike. Then we cannot see which way to go, but still we feel that we are drawn South, and we only have to think about that and fly onward. The fathers and sons can fly the faster and will reach there first. The mothers and daughters come a few days later."
"We never make a mistake."""
"""It is wonderful, wonderful,"" thought a young Rabbit on the grass below."
"""I must watch them when they go."""
"The very next morning the Forest People awakened to find a silvery frost on the grass and feel the still air stirred by the soft dropping of damp red, brown, and yellow leaves from the trees. Over the river and all the lowland near it hung a heavy veil of white mist."
"""It is time!"" whispered the Robins to each other."
"""It is time!"" cooed the Mourning Doves."
"""It is time!"" cried the Cowbirds in their hoarse voices."
"All through the forest there was restlessness and quiet haste. The Juncoes had already come from the cold northland and were resting from their long flight. The Ground Hogs, the Rabbits, and the Squirrels were out to say good-by. The Owls peeped from their hollow trees, shading their eyes from the strong light of the sun. And then the travellers went. The Robins started in family parties. The Mourning Doves slipped quietly away. The Cowbirds went in a dashing crowd. And the Crows, after much talking and disputing on the tree-tops, took a noisy farewell of the few members of the flock who were to remain behind, and, joining other flocks from the North, flew off in a great company which darkened the sky and caused a shadow to pass over the stubble-field almost like that of a summer cloud."
"""They are gone!"" sighed the Ground Hog and his wife. ""We shall miss them sadly. Well, we can dream about them, and that will be a comfort."""
"""Jay! Jay!"" shrieked a handsome-crested fellow from the tree above."
"""What if they are gone? They will be back in the spring, and we have plenty to eat. What is the use of feeling sad? Jay! Jay!"""
"But all people are not so heartless as the hungry Blue Jays, and the song-birds had many loving friends who missed them and longed for their return."
THE RUFFED GROUSE'S STORY
"The Ruffed Grouse cocked his crested head on one side and looked up through the bare branches to the sky. It was a soft gray, and in the west were banks of bluish clouds. ""I think it will snow very soon,"" said he. ""Mrs. Grouse, are the children all ready for cold weather?"""
"""All ready,"" answered his cheerful little wife. ""They have had their thickest feathers on for quite a while. The Rabbits were saying the other day that they had never seen a plumper or better clothed flock than ours."" And her beautiful golden-brown eyes shone with pride as she spoke."
"Indeed, the young Ruffed Grouse were a family of whom she might well be proud. Twelve healthy and obedient children do not fall to the lot of every Forest mother, and she wished with a sad little sigh that her other two eggs had hatched. She often thought of them with longing. How lovely it would have been to have fourteen children! But at that moment her brood came crowding around her in fright."
"""Some cold white things,"" they said, ""came tumbling down upon us and scared us. The white things didn't say a word, but they came so fast that we think they must be alive. Tell us what to do. Must we hide?"""
"""Why, that is snow!"" exclaimed their mother. ""It drops from the clouds up yonder quite as the leaves drop from the trees in the fall. It will not hurt you, but we must find shelter."""
"""What did I tell you, Mrs Grouse?"" asked her husband. ""I was certain that it would snow before night. I felt it in my quills."" And Mr. Grouse strutted with importance. It always makes one feel so very knowing when he has told his wife exactly what will happen."
"""How did you feel it in your quills?"" asked one of his children. ""Shall I feel it in my quills when I am as old as you are?"""
"In a gloomy prison, in a foreign land, lay Richard I, King of England."
"He had been with some other kings to a great war in the Holy Land, where he had won battles, and taken cities, and gained much honour. Men called him Richard Lion-heart, because he was as brave as a lion in fighting, and his soldiers loved him and would follow him into any danger. One strong city, called Acre, held out for nearly two years against the armies of the other kings, but when Richard arrived it gave way almost at once."
"Because of his bravery, and his many victories, all men praised King Richard, and this made some of the other kings hate him, for they were jealous that he should have more honour than they. When he was on his way back to England, one of these envious men seized him secretly, and threw him into prison."
"And now poor Richard could fight no more, nor could he see the blue sky, and the green fields which he loved. One day, as he sat sad and lonely in his prison, he heard a voice singing, beneath the window. He started."
"""Surely,"" said he, ""that is the voice of my old friend Blondel, and that is the song we used to sing together."" When the song was ended, the king sang it again in a low voice. Then there was a joyful cry from the man outside, and Richard knew that it was indeed his friend."
"Blondel had journeyed many days seeking his lost master. Now he hastened to England, and told the people where to find their king, and very soon Richard was set free, and went back to his own land."
The White Ship
"The night was dark, and a stormy wind was blowing, when the White Ship set sail from the shore of France. Prince William of England and his sister and their young friends were going back to their own land, after a visit to the French king."
"The English king, Henry I, with his courtiers, had sailed earlier, and had now almost reached home. But the prince would not go with them, he wished to make merry before starting."
"There had been eating, and drinking, and dancing, and singing on board the White Ship, and everyone was merry."
"But the sailors had drunk so much wine that they could not see to steer aright. Soon there was a crash, and the ship trembled. It had struck a rock, and was sinking."
"Then the sounds of merriment were changed to cries of fear. ""Save us!"""
"shrieked the terrified people. ""Save the prince,"" cried the captain, ""the rest of us must die!"" There was only one small boat on the ship, and Prince William was put into this, and rowed away. But he had not gone far, when he heard his sister crying to him to save her."
"""Go back!"" shouted he. The boat was rowed back, but when it came near the ship, so many people jumped into it, that it was overturned and all in it were drowned."
"Soon the White Ship sank also, and of all the gay company upon it only one man was saved."
"When King Henry heard that his only son was dead, he was very sorrowful, and it is said that no man ever again saw a smile upon his face."
Joan of Arc
"In a village in the green country of France, there once lived a girl named Joan. She spent her days in sewing and spinning, and in minding her father's sheep."
"At that time there was a sad war in France, and the English had won many battles. Joan was grieved to hear of the trouble of her country. She thought of it night and day, and one night she dreamt that an angel came, and told her to go and help the French prince."
"When Joan told her friends of this dream, they laughed at her."
"""How can a poor girl help the prince?"" asked they."
"""I do not know,"" replied Joan; ""but I must go, for God has sent me."" So she went to the prince, and said: ""Sir, my name is Joan. God has sent me to help you to win the crown of France."""
"They gave Joan a suit of white armour, and a white horse, and set her at the head of the army. She led the soldiers to fight, and the rough men thought she was an angel, and fought so bravely that they won many battles."
Then the prince was crowned King of France.
"When this was done, Joan felt that her work was over. ""I would that I might go and keep sheep once more with my sisters and my brothers; they would be so glad to see me,"" pleaded she. But the king would not let her go. So Joan stayed; but her time of victory was past. Soon, she was taken prisoner by the English, and cruelly burned to death. She died as bravely as she had lived, and her name will never be forgotten."
AFLOAT WITH A TIGER.
"A traveler in faraway India relates the following thrilling adventure with a tiger: From the heavy rain which falls upon Indian mountains the low-lying country is liable to such sudden floods that every year many beasts, and even human beings, are drowned ere they can make their escape to the higher grounds. On one occasion a terrible flood came up so suddenly that I had to spend a day and night in an open canoe in consequence, during which time I had good opportunities of seeing the good and bad effects produced by them. I lived at the time in a mat house, situated upon a hill which I supposed was quite above high-water mark, but an old Mahometan gentleman having told me that, when he was a little boy, he recollected the water once rising higher than the hill, I took the precaution of keeping a canoe in a small ditch close at hand."
"The rainy season began, and daily the river rose higher. One morning we noticed that the mountain tops were covered with heavy banks of dark clouds, though no rain fell out on the plain where we were; but we noticed many animals, a leopard among others, sneak out of the high grass and make for hilly ground. The most curious thing, however, was the smart manner in which rats and even grasshoppers came scampering away from the threatening danger. These latter came in such crowds toward my bungalow that not only the fowls about the premises had a good feed on them, but kites and crows began to swoop down in such numbers that the air was filled with their cries and the noise of their rushing wings."
"He found the way both dark and unpleasant, but he thought he would go on as long as it became no worse. But all at once he felt ice cold water spouting about his ears; he became frightened to death and began tugging at the rope."
"The lieutenant was the next to try, but it fared no better with him."
"No sooner had he got through the flood of water than he saw a blazing fire yawning beneath him, which so frightened him that he also turned back."
"The soldier then got into the bucket, and down he went through fire and water, right on till he came to the bottom, where it was so pitch dark that he could not see his hand before him. He dared not let go the basket, but went round in a circle, feeling and fumbling about him. At last he discovered a gleam of light far, far away like the dawn of day, and he went on in that direction."
"When he had gone a bit it began to grow light around him, and before long he saw a golden sun rising in the sky and everything around him became as bright and beautiful as if in a fairy world."
"First he came to some cattle, which were so fat that their hides glistened a long way off, and when he had got past them he came to a fine, big palace. He walked through many rooms without meeting anybody. At last he heard the hum of a spinning wheel, and when he entered the room he found the eldest Princess sitting there spinning copper yarn; the room and everything in it was of brightly polished copper."
"""Oh, dear; oh, dear! what are Christian people doing here?"" said the Princess. ""Heaven preserve you! what do you want?"""
"""I want to set you free and get you out of the mountain,"" said the soldier."
"""Pray do not stay. If the troll comes home he will put an end to you at once; he has three heads,"" said she."
"""I do not care if he has four,"" said the soldier. ""I am here, and here I shall remain."""
"""Well, if you will be so headstrong, I must see if I can help you,"""
said the Princess.
She then told him to creep behind the big brewing vat which stood in the front hall; meanwhile she would receive the troll and scratch his heads till he went to sleep.
"""And when I go out and call the hens you must make haste and come in,"""
"she said. ""But you must first try if you can swing the sword which is lying on the table."" No, it was too heavy, he could not even move it."
"He had then to take a strengthening draught from the horn, which hung behind the door; after that he was just able to stir it, so he took another draught, and then he could lift it. At last he took a right, big draught, and he could swing the sword as easily as anything."
All at once the troll came home; he walked so heavily that the palace shook.
"""Ugh, ugh! I smell Christian flesh and blood in my house,"" said he."
"""Yes,"" answered the Princess, ""a raven flew past here just now, and in his beak he had a human bone, which he dropped down the chimney; I threw it out and swept and cleaned up after it, but I suppose it still smells."""
"""So it does,"" said the troll."
"""But come and lie down and I'll scratch your heads,"" said the Princess; ""the smell will be gone by the time you wake."""
"The troll was quite willing, and before long he fell asleep and began snoring. When she saw he was sleeping soundly, she placed some stools and cushions under his heads and went to call the hens. The soldier then stole into the room with the sword, and with one blow cut all the three heads off the troll."
"The Princess was as pleased as a fiddler, and went with the soldier to her sisters, so that he could also set them free. First of all they went across a courtyard and then through many long rooms till they came to a big door."
"""Here you must enter: here she is,"" said the Princess. When he opened the door he found himself in a large hall, where everything was of pure silver; there sat the second sister at a silver spinning-wheel."
"""Oh, dear; oh, dear!"" she said. ""What do you want here?"""
"""I want to set you free from the troll,"" said the soldier."
"""Pray do not stay, but go,"" said the Princess. ""If he finds you here he will take your life on the spot."""
"""That would be awkward that is if I don't take his first,"" said the soldier."
"""Well, since you will stay,"" she said, ""you will have to creep behind the big brewing-vat in the front hall. But you must make haste and come as soon as you hear me calling the hens."""
"First of all he had to try if he was able to swing the troll's sword, which lay on the table; it was much larger and heavier than the first one; he was hardly able to move it. He then took three draughts from the horn and he could then lift it, and when he had taken three more he could handle it as if it were a rolling pin."
"Shortly afterwards he heard a heavy, rumbling noise that was quite terrible, and directly afterwards a troll with six heads came in."
"""No,"" answered the Queen-Mother, ""I don't. You see, I have so much to think about, and happy thoughts make tasks light. And then, you know, it is not always the same kind of egg, and that makes a pleasant change for me. I will give you a motto to remember: 'As long as a Bee is well, work is pleasant when done faithfully.'"""
"""Perhaps that is the matter with me,"" said the Worker, raising her drooping head. ""I have been careless lately when I thought nobody was looking. I will try your way."""
"When she had gone, the Queen-Mother smiled to herself and said: ""Poor child! When work is no longer a pleasure, life is indeed sad. But any Larva should know better than to work carelessly when she is not watched."""
THE HAUGHTY GROUND HOG
"Not far from the home of the Rabbits was another burrow where the Ground Hog lived, and there was a very kindly feeling between the neighbors."
"They liked the same food, and as there was plenty for all, they often nibbled together near the edge of the forest. The little Rabbits were fond of him and liked to listen to his stories. Once the biggest little Rabbit had run into the Ground Hog's burrow by mistake when he was frightened, and that was the beginning of a great friendship between them."
"They were a queer-looking couple, for the Rabbit was small and quick and dainty, while the Ground Hog, with his stout body covered with thick, reddish fur, his broad, flat head, and his short legs, was a clumsy fellow. To be sure, he could get out of sight quickly if he had to, but he never scampered around and kicked up his heels for the fun of it, as the Rabbits did. He was too dignified to do that. He came of an old family and he could remember who his grandfather was. There were but few people in the forest who could do that; so, of course, he could not frisk like his neighbors."
"Perhaps if the Ground Hog had not belonged to so old a family, he might have had a better time. Yet the thought that he could remember his grandfather was a great pleasure to him, and when he was talking he would often remark in the most careless way, ""as my grandfather used to say""; or, ""That reminds me of something my grandfather once did."" Some people said that he did this to show off; but it may be that they were envious."
"However that may have been, the Ground Hog was certainly a haughty fellow, and if he had not been so gentle and kind a neighbor people would not have liked him. Only once had he been known to get angry, and that was when a saucy young Chipmunk had spoken of him as a Woodchuck."
"""Woodchuck! Woodchuck!"" he had grunted. ""You young Bushy-tail, I am a Ground Hog, and the Ground Hog family lived in this forest long before you ever opened your eyes. People with good manners do not call us 'Woodchucks.' We do not like the name. My grandfather could not endure it."""
"It was not very long after this that he told the wondering young Rabbits about his grandfather. When talking, the Ground Hog rested by the edge of his burrow, sitting on his haunches, and waving his queer little forepaws whenever he told anything especially important. And this was the story:"
"""Perhaps you may have heard me speak of my grandfather. Ah, he was a Ground Hog worth seeing! He was large, and, although when I knew him the black fur on his back was streaked with gray, he was still handsome. He was clever, too. I have often heard my father say that he could dig the deepest and best burrow in the forest. And then he had such fine manners! There was not another Ground Hog in the country around who could eat as noisily as he, and it is said that when he was courting my grandmother she chose him because of the elegant way in which he sat up on his haunches. I have been told, children, that I am very much like him."""
"Just here, a Red-headed Woodpecker gave a loud ""Rat-a-tat-tat"" on the tree above the Ground Hog's head, and there was a look around her bill as though she wanted to laugh. The Ground Hog slowly turned his head to look at her as she flew away. ""Quite a good-looking young person,"" he said, ""but badly brought up. She should know better than to disturb those who are talking. What was I saying, children?"""
"""You were telling how well your grandfather sat up on his haunches,"""
said the smallest little Rabbit.
"""So I was! So I was! I must tell you how my grandfather came to know the world so well. When he was only a young fellow, he made his home for a time by a Hen house, and so heard the talk of the barn-yard people."
"Once he heard them tell how the farmer watched on a certain winter day to see my grandfather come out of his burrow. Of course, you children all know how we Ground Hogs do; in the fall we are very fat, and when the cold weather comes we go to sleep in our burrows to wait for spring."
"Sometimes we awaken and stretch, but we go to sleep again very soon."
"Then, when spring comes we are slender and have healthy appetites."
"""The Hens treated my grandfather with great politeness, and the Black Brahma Cock showed plainly how honored they felt to have him there. They said that they were so glad my grandfather stayed out of his burrow awhile on this winter day when the farmer was watching, because they were in a hurry for warm weather. My grandfather did not know what they meant by that, but he was too wise to say so, and he found out by asking questions, that if a Ground Hog leaves his burrow on this certain day in winter, and sees his shadow, and goes back again, it will be cold for a long time after that. If he does not see his shadow, and stays out, it will soon be warm."
"""You see now, children, how important our family is; and yet we are so modest that we had not even known that we made the weather until the Hens told my grandfather. But that is the way! Really great people often think the least of themselves."""
"""And do you make the weather?"" asked the smallest little Rabbit."
"""I suppose we do,"" said the Ground Hog, with a smile. ""It is a great care. I often say to myself: 'Shall I have it warm, or shall I have it cold?' It worries me so that sometimes I can hardly eat."""
"""And how do you know when the day comes for you to make the weather?"""
said the smallest little rabbit.
"""Ahem! Well-er! I am sorry to say that my grandfather did not find out exactly what day it is that they watch for us, so I have to guess at that. But to think that we Ground Hogs make the weather for all the other people! It is worth a great deal to belong to such a family. I suppose I might have been a Weasel, a Fox, an Owl, or an Oriole. And it is a great thing to have known one's grandfather."""
"The little Rabbits sat very still, wishing that they had known their grandfather, when suddenly the biggest one said: ""If you should stay out of your burrow when that day comes, and another Ground Hog should go back into his burrow, how would the weather know what to do?"""
"""Children,"" said the old Ground Hog, ""I think your mother is calling to you. You might better go to see. Good-by."" And he waved his paw politely."
"The seven little Rabbits scampered away, but their mother was not calling them. She wasn't even there, and when they went back they couldn't find the Ground Hog. They wondered how he happened to make such a mistake. The Red-headed Woodpecker who came along at about that time, twisted her head on one side and said: ""Made-a-mistake! Rat-a-tat-tat!"
"Not he!"""
"""YES, I KNOW WELL ENOUGH WHERE IT IS,"" said the North Wind; ""once in my life I blew an aspen-leaf thither, but, I was so tired I couldn't blow a puff for ever so many days, after. But if you really wish to go thither, and aren't afraid to come along with me, I'll take you on my back and see if I can blow you thither."""
"Yes! with all her heart; she must and would get thither if it were possible in any way; and as for fear, however madly he went, she wouldn't be at all afraid."
"""Very well, then,"" said the North Wind, ""but you must sleep here to-night, for we must have the whole day before us, if we're to get thither at all."""
"Early next morning the North Wind woke her, and puffed himself up, and blew himself out, and made himself so stout and big, 'twas gruesome to look at him; and so off they went high up through the air, as if they would never stop till they got to the world's end."
"Down here below there was such a storm; it threw down long tracts of wood and many houses, and when it swept over the great sea, ships foundered by hundreds."
"So they tore on and on no one can believe how far they went and all the while they still went over the sea, and the North Wind got more and more weary, and so out of breath he could scarce bring out a puff, and his wings drooped and drooped, till at last he sunk so low that the crests of the waves dashed over his heels."
"""Are you afraid?"" said the North Wind."
"""No!"" she wasn't."
"But they weren't very far from land; and the North Wind had still so much strength left in him that he managed to throw her up on the shore under the windows of the castle which lay East of the Sun and West of the Moon; but then he was so weak and worn out, he had to stay there and rest many days before he could get home again."
"Next morning the lassie sat down under the castle window, and began to play with the gold apple; and the first person she saw was the Long-nose who was to have the Prince."
"""What do you want for your gold apple, you lassie?"" said the Long-nose, and threw up the window."
"""It's not for sale, for gold or money,"" said the lassie."
"""If it's not for sale for gold or money, what is it that you will sell it for? You may name your own price,"" said the Princess."
"""Well! if I may get to the Prince, who lives here, and be with him to-night, you shall have it,"" said the lassie whom the North Wind had brought."
"Yes! she might; that could be done. So the Princess got the gold apple; but when the lassie came up to the Prince's bed-room at night he was fast asleep; she called him and shook him, and between whiles she wept sore; but all she could do she couldn't wake him up. Next morning, as soon as day broke, came the Princess with the long nose, and drove her out again."
"So in the daytime she sat down under the castle windows and began to card with her carding-comb, and the same thing happened. The Princess asked what she wanted for it; and she said it wasn't for sale for gold or money, but if she might get leave to go up to the Prince and be with him that night, the Princess should have it."
"But when she went up she found him fast asleep again, and all she called, and all she shook, and wept, and prayed, she couldn't get life into him; and as soon as the first gray peep of day came, then came the Princess with the long nose, and chased her out again."
"So, in the daytime, the lassie sat down outside under the castle window, and began to spin with her golden spinning-wheel, and that, too, the Princess with the long nose wanted to have. So she threw up the window and asked what she wanted for it. The lassie said, as she had said twice before, it wasn't for sale for gold or money; but if she might go up to the Prince who was there, and be with him alone that night, she might have it."
"Yes! she might do that and welcome. But now you must know there were some Christian folk who had been carried off thither, and as they sat in their room, which was next the Prince, they had heard how a woman had been in there, and wept and prayed, and called to him two nights running, and they told that to the Prince."
"That evening, when the Princess came with her sleepy drink, the Prince made as if he drank, but threw it over his shoulder, for he could guess it was a sleepy drink. So, when the lassie came in, she found the Prince wide awake; and then she told him the whole story how she had come thither."
"""Ah,"" said the Prince, ""you've just come in the very nick of time, for to-morrow is to be our wedding-day; but now I won't have the Long-nose, and you are the only woman in the world who can set me free. I'll say I want to see what my wife is fit for, and beg her to wash the shirt which has the three spots of tallow on it; she'll say yes, for she doesn't know 'tis you who put them there; but that's a work only for Christian folk, and not for such a pack of Trolls, and so I'll say that I won't have any other for my bride than the woman who can wash them out, and ask you to do it."""
"So there was great joy and love between them all that night. But next day, when the wedding was to be, the Prince said:"
"""First of all, I'd like to see what my bride is fit for."""
"""Yes!"" said the step-mother, with all her heart."
"""Well,"" said the Prince, ""I've got a fine shirt which I'd like for my wedding shirt, but somehow or other it has got three spots of tallow on it, which I must have washed out; and I have sworn never to take any other bride than the woman who's able to do that. If she can't, she's not worth having."""
"Well, that was no great thing they said, so they agreed, and she with the long-nose began to wash away as hard as she could, but the more she rubbed and scrubbed, the bigger the spots grew."
"""Ah!"" said the old hag, her mother, ""you can't wash; let me try."""
"But she hadn't long taken the shirt in hand before it got far worse than ever, and with all her rubbing, and wringing, and scrubbing, the spots grew bigger and blacker, and the darker and uglier was the shirt."
"Then all the other Trolls began to wash, but the longer it lasted, the blacker and uglier the shirt grew, till at last it was as black all over as if it had been up the chimney."
"""Ah!"" said the Prince, ""you're none of you worth a straw; you can't wash. Why there, outside, sits a beggar lassie, I'll be bound she knows how to wash better than the whole lot of you. COME IN, LASSIE!"""
he shouted.
"""A man always says, 'who was the first one?' but the girl says, 'who'll"
"be the next one?'"" she returned, as she carefully laid the roses in her"
bureau drawer.
"""But the time comes when there never will be a next one."""
"""No?"""
"""No."""
"""I'd hate to stake my pile on that,"" observed the Girl, drily. She blew"
up each glove as it came off and likewise carefully laid them away in
the bureau drawer.
"By this time Wowkle's soft tread had ceased, her duties for the night"
"were over, and she stood at the table waiting to be dismissed."
"""Wowkle, git to your wigwam!"" suddenly ordered her mistress, watching"
her until she disappeared into the cupboard; but she did not see the
Indian woman's lips draw back in a half-grin as she closed the door
behind her.
"""Oh, you're sending her away! Must I go, too?"" asked Johnson, dismally."
"""No--not jest yet; you can stay a--a hour or two longer,"" the Girl"
informed him with a smile; and turning once more to the bureau she
busied herself there for a few minutes longer.

And watched the splendid death of day

A golden cloud of languid scent;

As though to veil some vision seen
CHAPTER I
_The Red Spot_
"[Sidenote: What is the mystery centered in Jupiter's famous ""Red"
"Spot""? Two fighting Earthmen, caught by the ""Pipe-men"" like their"
"vanished comrades, soon find out.]"
"Commander Stone, grizzled chief of the Planetary Exploration Forces,"
acknowledged Captain Brand Bowen's salute and beckoned him to take a
seat.
"Brand, youngest officer of the division to wear the triple-V for"
"distinguished service, sat down and stared curiously at his superior."
He hadn't the remotest idea why he had been recalled from leave: but
that it was on a matter of some importance he was sure. He hunched his
big shoulders and awaited orders.
"""Captain Bowen,"" said Stone. ""I want you to go to Jupiter as soon as"
"you can arrange to do so, fly low over the red area in the southern"
"hemisphere, and come back here with some sort of report as to what's"
"wrong with that infernal death spot."""
He tapped his radio stylus thoughtfully against the edge of his desk.
"""As you perhaps know, I detailed a ship to explore the red spot about"
"a year ago. It never came back. I sent another ship, with two good men"
spring. The illumination showed a moldy chamber with water dripping from
the walls in places.
At some distant day the chamber had evidently been occupied by human
"beings, for a great fire-place was cut in the rock at one end, and there"
were niches in the wall which had doubtless been used for storage. The
"floor was smooth, showing the work of human hands."
“Get onto the fire-place!” whispered Jimmie. “Where do you suppose the
smoke goes? There’s no chimney on the mountain.”
"“Probably it escapes through some opening in the rock,” Ned answered."
"“Do you suppose,” Jimmie asked, “that the smoke vent is large enough for"
us to hide in?”
"Before the words were out of the boy’s mouth, Ned was making toward the"
"fireplace. The light was out now, but Jimmie had no difficulty in"
following the boy in the darkness.
“Ned!” he called softly in a moment.
“Come on up!” whispered Ned.
"“Turn on the light, then,” Jimmie advised."
"Ned switched on the electric, but kept it inside the chimney into which"
he had climbed. Only a faint radiance reached the opening below.
"“Give me your hand,” whispered Ned, “and I’ll give you a lift.”"
The sound of voices and footsteps now echoed loudly through the cavern.
mind.  Vaviloff also liked Petunikoff's straightforward manner of
"addressing him without any pretensions, as if he were his own brother,"
"though Vaviloff understood well enough that he was his superior, he"
"being only a soldier.  Looking at him, he grew fonder and fonder of"
"him, and, forgetting for a moment the matter in hand, respectfully"
asked Petunikoff:
"""Where did you study?"""
"""In the technological institute.  Why?"" answered the other, smiling:"
"""Nothing.  Only ... excuse me!""  The soldier lowered his head, and then"
"suddenly exclaimed, ""What a splendid thing education is!"
"Science--light.  My brother, I am as stupid as an owl before the sun"
"...  Your honour, let us finish this job."""
With an air of decision he stretched out his hand to Petunikoff and
said:
"""Well, five hundred?"""
"""Not more than one hundred roubles, Egor Terentievitch."" Petunikoff"
"shrugged his shoulders as if sorry at being unable to give more, and"
touched the soldier's hairy hand with his long white fingers.  They
"soon ended the matter, for the soldier gave in quickly and met"
Petunikoff's wishes.  And when Vaviloff had received the hundred
"roubles and signed the paper, he threw the pen down on the table and"
"said, bitterly:"
"""Now I will have a nice time!  They will laugh at me, they will cry"
"shame on me, the devils!"""
King Merriwig of Euralia sat at breakfast on his castle walls.  He
"lifted the gold cover from the gold dish in front of him, selected a"
trout and conveyed it carefully to his gold plate.  He was a man of
"simple tastes, but when you have an aunt with the newly acquired gift"
"of turning anything she touches to gold, you must let her practise"
sometimes.  In another age it might have been fretwork.
"""Ah,"" said the King, ""here you are, my dear.""  He searched for his"
"napkin, but the Princess had already kissed him lightly on the top of"
"the head, and was sitting in her place opposite to him."
"""Good morning, Father,"" she said; ""I'm a little late, aren't I?  I've"
"been riding in the forest."""
"""Any adventures?"" asked the King casually."
"""Nothing, except it's a beautiful morning."""
"""Ah, well, perhaps the country isn't what it was.  Now when I was a"
"young man, you simply couldn't go into the forest without an adventure"
"of some sort.  The extraordinary things one encountered!  Witches,"
"giants, dwarfs----.  It was there that I first met your mother,"" he"
added thoughtfully.
"""I wish I remembered my mother,"" said Hyacinth."
The King coughed and looked at her a little nervously.
"""Seventeen years ago she died, Hyacinth, when you were only six months"
old.  I have been wondering lately whether I haven't been a little

3. Hymns of the Eastern Church: Greek and Syriac.
"The ancient Eastern Church developed a rich hymnody, rising steadily in"
the fourth century until it reached its culmination in the eighth and
"ninth centuries. Since it employed the Greek and Syriac languages, its"
hymnic treasures remained almost completely hidden and unknown to the
English speaking churches for many centuries. It is only in recent
"years, through the efforts of scholars like John Mason Neale and Edward"
Caswall that some of the Eastern hymns have been translated and made
available for modern use. Eastern hymns are characterized by an
"objective, dignified, contemplation of God. Except when confessing sin"
"and unworthiness, they contain nothing of the subjective feelings of the"
worshipper such as is found in many modern hymns. Though there is very
"little in the _Hymnary_ from the Eastern Church, our collection is"
enriched by the inclusion of a small number of hymns from this source.

8. Psalm Versions.
"The use of the psalms in singing, first on the Continent, then in"
"England and Scotland, and later in America, brought forth many metrical"
"versions of the psalter, the principal ones being the following:"
"a. _The Genevan Psalter_, begun 1539, published complete in 1562. It was"
"made at the request of John Calvin by Clément Marot, court poet of"
"France, and Theodore Beza, a French scholar. It became the psalm book"
"for the Reformation churches on the continent, and is spoken of as the"
most famous book of praise the Christian Church ever produced. It was
issued in at least one thousand editions and translated into a number of
"tongues. Some of the original tunes are still in use, e.g., “Old"
Hundredth.”
"b. _The Anglo-Genevan Psalter_, Geneva, 1556. This was used by John"
"Knox, the Scottish reformer, and his followers who fled the persecutions"
"of “Bloody Mary,” and formed a congregation at Geneva. The book"
incorporated some of the Sternhold and Hopkins versions which were in
"use in England, and added others."
"c. _The Old Version_, Sternhold and Hopkins, completed in 1562. Used in"
"England for 134 years. It is entitled, _The Whole Booke of Psalmes_, but"

"she was happier with me, in spite of it."""
"A movement of impatience escaped from Alicia. Seeing it he added,"
"""I beg your pardon. I didn't want you to think hardly of her."""
"""I don't want to think of her at all. Was she--was she like Daisy?"""
"""Yes; but prettier."""
"""I don't know what you expect me to say,"" she exclaimed. ""I know--I"
suppose some men don't think much of--of a thing like that. To me it is
"horrible. You simply followed your-- Ah, I can't speak of it!"" and she"
seemed to put him from her with a gesture of disgust.
"He walked beside her in silence, his face set in the bitter smile it"
always wore when fate dealt hardly with him.
"""I think I'll go straight home,"" she said, stopping suddenly. ""You can"
"join the others."""
"""Yes, that will be best. I'm not due at the Council just yet."""
"""I suppose I ought to thank you for telling me the truth. I--"" Her false"
composure suddenly gave way. With a sob she stretched out her hands
"towards him, crying, ""Why didn't you tell me sooner?"" and before he"
"could answer her she turned and walked swiftly away, leaving him"
standing still on the pathway.
She was hardly inside the gates of Government House when she saw Eleanor
"Scaife, who hurried to meet her."
her completely naked.
"Dennis went clumsily to his knees, his arms around her, and he pulled"
"her to the floor. She sobbed, but the tears were gone now and they were"
"dry, wracking sobs."
"""Undress me."""
She fumbled with his jacket and pulled it off while he knelt there in
"anticipation of he knew not what; wondering, wanting, knowing only an"
urge he could not understand but which had become a compulsion.
She took off his necktie and unbuttoned his shirt. Frank Corson stirred
"but did not regain consciousness. ""Please,"" Rhoda said, ""let me help"
"him."""
"In answer, Dennis put his arms around her and drew her to him. ""We will"
"make love."""
"""Yes--yes, we will make love--"""
"The ring of the doorbell was like thunder in the room. Dennis tensed,"
"his eyes widened, and he got to his feet and stood swaying. Looking up"
"at him, Rhoda saw a trapped animal, but the excitement was still there"
and she wanted to take him in her arms and hold him and protect him from
the world.
But he had forgotten her. A cunning sneer took the place of the
slavering animal look and he ran to the kitchen to reappear moments
later with a butcher knife in his hand.
"The bell rang again. Dennis snarled at the door and, in some kind of"
The orator finished his speech and looked upon his hearers with his
"dark, pathetic eyes, seeming to apologise to them for some unknown"
crime.
The public understands it.  They understand the morale of the creature
"who was once a man, the morale of the public-house and much misfortune."
"""Well, brother Yashka, did you understand?  See how true it is!"""
Yakov understood that to beat her incautiously might be injurious to
"his wife.  He is silent, replying to his companions' jokes with"
confused smiles.
"""Then again, what is a wife?"" philosophises the baker, Mokei Anisimoff."
"""A wife ... is a friend ... if we look at the matter in that way.  She"
"is like a chain, chained to you for life ... and you are both just like"
"galley slaves.  And if you try to get away from her, you cannot, you"
"feel the chain ..."""
"""Wait,"" says Yakovleff; ""but you beat your wife too."""
"""Did I say that I did not?  I beat her...  There is nothing else"
handy...  Do you expect me to beat the wall with my fist when my
"patience is exhausted?"""
"""I feel just like that too..."" says Yakov."
"""How hard and difficult our life is, my brothers!  There is no real"
"rest for us anywhere!"""
"""And even you beat your wife by mistake,"" some one remarks humorously."
"Whereupon Rollo addressed himself to the others, setting clearly before"
them the gravity of the situation.
John Mortimer shook his head gravely. He could not approve.
"""How often has my father told me that the first loss is the least! This"
all comes of trying to make up my disappointment about the Abbot's
"Priorato!"""
Etienne shrugged his shoulders and philosophically quoted a Gascon
proverb to the effect that who buys the flock must take the black sheep
also.
El Sarria simply recollected that his gun and pistols were in good
"order, and waited for orders."
The conference therefore resolved itself into a trio of
"consultants--Rollo because he was the leader, Sergeant Cardono because"
"he knew the country, and Concha--because she was Concha!"
They were within an hour or two's rapid march of La Granja over a pass
in the Guadarrama. The sergeant volunteered to lead them down into the
gardens in that time. He knew a path often travelled by smugglers on
their way to Segovia.
"""It is clear that if we are to carry away the Queen-Regent and her"
"daughter, we must forestall the gipsies,"" said Rollo."
Concha clasped her hands pitifully.
"""Ah, the poor young Queen!"" she cried. ""Praise to the saints that I was"
"The horseman leaned against his horse, his arm hooked over its neck."
He pointed to the valley.
"""Yonder lies Narni. Beyond the Campanile of St. Juvenal is a"
sanctuary. You can see it yonder by the ford. Two holy women dwell
"therein. To them, my lord, I commend you!"""
"""You know more!"""
The voice that spoke was terrible.
"""Spare me, my lord! The words are for women's lips, not for mine!"""
"""So be it!"""
"The three rode in silence, Francesco and the duke together, looking"
mutely into each other's face. Francesco's head was bowed to his
breast. The reins lay loose on his horse's neck.
A gray cell of roughly hewn stone showed amidst the green boughs
beyond the water. At its door stood a woman in a black mantle. A cross
hung from her neck and a white kerchief bound her hair. She stood
"motionless, half in the shadow, watching the horsemen as they rode"
down to the rippling fords.
"Autumn had touched the sanctuary garden, and Francesco's eyes beheld"
"ruin as he climbed the slope. The woman had come from the cell, and"
now stood at the wicket-gate with her hands folded as if in prayer.
The horseman took Francesco's bridle. The latter went on foot alone to
speak with the anchoress.
"""But what was the cause of it all?""  I demanded.  ""You surely know the"
"reason?"""
"""No, we cannot yet tell,"" he answered.  ""The marks puzzle us.  That mark"
on her lower lip is the most peculiar and unaccountable.  At present we
"can say nothing."""
"""Then why did you call me out?"""
"""Because I want to consult you,"" he replied.  ""The fact is, that in this"
affair there is a strong element of mystery which I don't like at all.
"And, moreover, the few seconds during which I've seen the Countess have"
plainly impressed upon me the belief that either she has had something
"to do with it, or else that she knows the truth."""
"I nodded.  This was exactly my own theory.  ""Do you think Yolande has"
"been the victim of foul play?""  I inquired a moment later."
"""That's my suspicion,"" he responded.  ""But only she herself can tell us"
"the truth."""
"""You really think, then, that a dastardly attempt has been made upon her"
"life?""  I cried incredulously."
"""Personally, I think there can be no doubt."""
"""But by whom?  No one called here after my departure."""
"""It is that mystery which we must elucidate,"" he said.  ""All I fear is,"
"however, that she may render us no assistance."""

It is very pleasant here at harvest time. Scythes are being sharpened in
"the field, men and women are at work; they go thinly clad and bareheaded,"
and call to one another and laugh; sometimes they drink from a bucket of
"whey, then set to work again. There is the familiar fragrance of hay,"
"which penetrates my senses like a song of home, drawing me home, home,"
“But if it will kill you?”
"“Bah. What do I care? When one lives, one amuses oneself. And I have"
"well amused myself, eh, Yvonne? For the rest, _je m’en fiche!_”"
He went on talking with airy cynicism. To Yvonne it seemed some horrible
"dream. The husband she had looked upon as dead was before her, gay,"
"mocking, just as she had known him of old. And he greeted her after all"
these years with the-same lightness as he had bidden her farewell.
"“_Et toi, Yvonne?_” said he at length. “_Ça roule toujours?_ You"
look as if you were brewing money. Ravishing costume. _Crépon_--not
twenty-five centimes a yard! A hat that looks like the Rue de la Paix!
_Gants de reine et petites bottines de duchesse!_ You must be doing
"golden business. But speak, _petite_, since I assure you I am not a"
ghost!”
"Yvonne forced a faint smile. She tried to answer him, but her heart was"
thumping violently and a lump rose in her throat.
"“I am doing very well, Amédée,” she said. The dreadfulness of her"
position came over her. She felt sick and faint. What was going to
happen? For some moments she did not hear him as he spoke. At last
perception returned.
"“And you are pretty,” Amédée Bazouge was saying. “_Mais jolie à"
croquer_--prettier than you ever were. And I--I am going down the hill
"at the gallop. _Tiens_, Yvonne. Let us celebrate this meeting. Come and"
see me safe to the bottom. It won’t be long. I have money. I am always
_bon enfant._ Let us remarry. From to-day. _Ce serait rigolo!_ And I
will love you--_mais énormément!_”

"when she broke off, and the scissors that had been snipping their way"
steadily through the rough linen jagged and dropped on the table. She

Lois put down her knife.

"collected, just as though you believed your sandwiches would ever be"
"eaten!"""
"""I am not braver than you are. Look how steady your hand is--much"
"steadier than mine."""
Beatrice held out her white hand and studied it thoughtfully.
"""I am not afraid,"" she said, ""but not because I am brave. There is no"
"room for fear, that is all."" She paused an instant, and then suddenly"
"the hand fell on Lois'. The two women looked at each other. ""Lois, I"

"""Oh?"" Viggon Sarri looked at them in surprise. ""Then maybe I have the"
"wrong idea. Let me hear your suggestions."""
"Twill and Naylo looked at one another, fencing with their eyes. Finally"
"Twill nodded and said, ""You say it, Regin."""
"""It's already been said."" Regin Naylo looked pointedly at Linus Brein."
"""A day or so ago you claimed that you'd picked up some primitive"
infrawave emission that looked as though someone might be trying to
"develop a detecting and ranging device."""
"""Yes."""
"""Then it is my contention that any moves we make against this race"
should be made before anybody down there gets such a detector and
"ranger working."""
"""Why?"" demanded Viggon Sarri."
"Regin Naylo looked at his commander. ""We're losing a technical"
advantage. Whether we go in with a benign and peaceful-looking air and
"show them how big and fast we are, or whether we plunge in and hit 'em"
"with every battery we've got and reduce 'em to submission, we've got to"
do it before anybody succeeds in making an infrawave space detector.
"""What is your name, Girl--your real name?"""
"""Min--Minnie; my father's name was Smith,"" she told him, her eyes cast"
down under delicately tremulous lids.
"""Oh, Minnie Sm--"""
"""But 'twa'n't his right name,"" quickly corrected the Girl, and"
"unconsciously both rose to their feet. ""His right name was Falconer."""
"""Minnie Falconer--well, that is a pretty name,"" commented Johnson; and"
raising her hand to his lips he pressed them against it.
"""I ain't sure that's what he said it was--I ain't sure o' anythin' only"
"jest you,"" she said coyly, burying her face in his neck."
"""You may well be sure of me since I've loved--"" Johnson's sentence was"
"cut short, a wave of remorse sweeping over him. ""Turn your head away,"
"Girl, and don't listen to me,"" he went on, gently putting her away from"
"him. ""I'm not worthy of you. Don't listen but just say no, no, no, no."""
"The Girl, puzzled, was even more so when Johnson began to pace the"
floor.
"""Oh, I know--I ain't good enough for you !"" she cried with a little"
"tremour in her voice. ""But I'll try hard, hard . . . If you see"
"anythin' better in me, why don't you bring it out, 'cause I've loved you"
"ever since I saw you first, 'cause I knowed that you--that you were the"
"right man."""
"""The right man,"" repeated Johnson, dismally, for his conscience was"
"Ilaria stirred in her sleep. Her mouth quivered, her hair stirred"
"sudden under the heather, like tendrils of gold shivering in the sun."
"Even as the light increased, Francesco knelt and looked down upon her."
"Hope and life, glorious, sudden, seemed to fall out of the east, a"
radiant faith begotten of spirit-power. Banners of gold were streaming
"in the sky. The gloom fled. A vast expectancy hung solemn, breathless,"
upon the red lips of the day.
"A sigh, and the long, silken lashes quivered. The lips moved, the eyes"
opened.
"""Ilaria! Ilaria!"""
"Sudden silence followed, a vast hush as of undreamed hope. The woman's"
eyes were silently searching the man's face. He bent and cowered over
"her as one who weeps. His hands touched her body, yet she did not"
stir.
"""Ilaria! Ilaria!"""
"It was a hoarse, passionate outcry that broke the golden stupor of the"
"dawn. A sudden light leaped lustrous into the woman's eyes, her face"
shone radiant in its etherealized beauty.
"""Francesco!"""
"""Ah! At last!"""
A great shudder passed through her body. Her eyes grew big with fear.
"“Edith was looking at it when Mr. Trent came in, and forgot to return"
it.”
"“Ah! Boswell, I am sure you are sitting on Mrs. Pendleton’s foot. By the"
"way, how is your aunt?”"
“Dead—better.”
"“I wonder you could tear yourself away so soon,” said Trent, viciously."
“You’d better be careful. She might make a new will.”
“Don’t worry. I spent the happiest fifteen minutes of my life with her
this afternoon. She promised me all.” He turned to Severance. “You have
"been breaking hearts on the beach, I suppose.”"
"“Which is better, at all events, than breaking one’s head against a"
stone wall.”
"“Politics brought you here, I suppose, Mr. Trent,” interrupted Miss"
Decker. “I hear you made a stirring speech the other night.”
“I did. It was on the question of Radicalism in the Press _versus_ Civil
Service Reform. Something must be done to revolutionise this hotbed of
"iniquity, American politics. Such principles need courage, but when the"
hour comes the man must not be wanting—”
"“That was all in the paper next morning,” drawled Boswell. “Mrs."
"Pendleton, did you receive the copy of my new book I sent a fortnight"
"ago? Unlike many of my others, I had no difficulty in disposing of it."

"understood it, therefore they were kind. They even said—”"
"noticed it when I was over."""
"""Is it meant to imply independent means?"""
"""I dare say that idea may be dormant under it somewhere. My wife says"
"the girls like it."""
"""Then your wife, Perry, is a traitor to her sex to make such"
"confessions. Besides, they didn't in my time."""
"""Come, you know, you're a forlorn bachelor. What can you know about it?"""
"""Bachelors, Perry, are the men who know. Which gathers most knowledge"

FOSSILS AND WHAT THEY TEACH
"""I have shown it you before.""  Vaviloff looked up suspiciously and"
closely scanned the Captain's face.
"""Show it me!"" shouted the Captain, striking the bar with his fist and"
sitting down on a stool close by.
"""But why?"" asked Vaviloff, knowing that it was better to keep his wits"
about him when Kuvalda got excited.
"""You fool!  Bring it at once."""
"Vaviloff rubbed his forehead, and turned his eyes to the ceiling in a"
tired way.
"""Where are those papers of yours?"""
"There was no answer to this on the ceiling, so the old sergeant looked"
"down at the floor, and began drumming with his fingers on the bar in a"
worried and thoughtful manner.
"""It's no good your making wry faces!"" shouted the Captain, for he had"
"no great affection for him, thinking that a former soldier should"
rather have become a thief than an eating-house keeper.
"""Oh!  Yes!  Aristid Fomich, I remember now.  They were left at the High"
"Court of Justice at the time when I came into possession."""
"""Get along, Egorka!  It is to your own interest to show me the plan,"
"the title-deeds, and everything you have immediately.  You will"
"probably clear at least a hundred roubles over this, do you understand?"""
Vaviloff did not understand at all; but the Captain spoke in such a
"fine--it made me ashamed of my silly standards, my fears."""
"""And Lavender is best of all--"""
Now quick tears shone like stars in Trude Romley's eyes. She reached
out her hands and caught Sidney's.
"""Oh, Lavender--when I think what _he_ did I--I--"" She could not finish,"
but Sidney understood the gratitude that was in her heart. She leaned
her face against Trude's shoulder with a long sigh.
"""I'm cured of lots of things, Trude. I wanted something different but I"
didn't want all _this_ to happen! You see I _made_ Lavender and Mart
believe it was diamonds Jed Starrow was hiding when it was probably
"only a case of rum--"""
"Suddenly Trude straightened. ""I almost forgot. A boy came here and said"
a Captain Davies wanted you to come down to Rockman's wharf as soon as
you could. That was two hours ago. You see it is nearly noon now. You'd
"better dress quickly and I'll go out and fix you some breakfast."""
Sidney obeyed reluctantly. In her mingled remorse and humiliation she
shrank from facing the world. She was not even curious as to why Cap'n
Phin wanted to see her.
By the time she had dressed Trude had a poached egg and a glass of milk
ready for her. Miss Letty was with Lavender and Aunt Achsa had gone to
bed.
Sidney begged so hard that Trude accompany her to Rockman's that Trude
put on her hat and went with her. And poor Sidney needed Trude's
support for Sunset Lane was thronged with curious men and women; as
to his shoulders.
I hadn't seen hair like that on a man except maybe in history books;
every man I'd ever known had his hair cropped in the fashionable
"soup-bowl style. I was staring at his hair, almost forgetting about the"
"blaster which I knew it was against the law for him to have at all,"
when I suddenly got scared right through.
His eyes.
They didn't blink and there seemed to be no expression around them.
Just coldness. Maybe it was the kind of clothes he was wearing that did
"it, but all of a sudden I was reminded of a crocodile I'd seen in a"
surface zoo that had stared quietly at me for twenty minutes until it
opened two long tooth-studded jaws.
"""Green shatas!"" he said suddenly. ""Only a tadpole. I must be getting"
"jumpy enough to splash."""
Then he shoved the blaster away in a holster made of the same scaly
"leather, crossed his arms on his chest and began to study me. I grunted"
"to my feet, feeling a lot better. The coldness had gone out of his eyes."
"I held out my hand the way Sis had taught me. ""My name is Ferdinand"
"Sparling. I'm very pleased to meet you, Mr.--Mr.--"""
"""Hope for your sake,"" he said to me, ""that you aren't what you"
"seem--tadpole brother to one of them husbandless anura."""
"""_What?_"""
"""A 'nuran is a female looking to nest. Anura is a herd of same. Come"
"“Gracious, father! What a fright you gave me! Have you just come home?"
Why isn’t Charles here to help you off with your coat?”
"Her cheeks were crimson from playing, her eyes glittered, the hair fell"
over her forehead. And she breathed as though she had come running
through the dark and was frightened. Old Mr. Neave stared at his
youngest daughter; he felt he had never seen her before. So that was
"Lola, was it? But she seemed to have forgotten her father; it was not"
for him that she was waiting there. Now she put the tip of her crumpled
handkerchief between her teeth and tugged at it angrily. The telephone
rang. A-ah! Lola gave a cry like a sob and dashed past him. The door of
"the telephone-room slammed, and at the same moment Charlotte called,"
"“Is that you, father?”"
"“You’re tired again,” said Charlotte reproachfully, and she stopped the"
rocker and offered her warm plum-like cheek. Bright-haired Ethel pecked
"his beard, Marion’s lips brushed his ear."
"“Did you walk back, father?” asked Charlotte."
"“Yes, I walked home,” said old Mr. Neave, and he sank into one of the"
immense drawing-room chairs.
“But why didn’t you take a cab?” said Ethel. “There are hundreds of
cabs about at that time.”
"“My dear Ethel,” cried Marion, “if father prefers to tire himself out,"
I really don’t see what business of ours it is to interfere.”
"“Children, children?” coaxed Charlotte."
Two or three days later Cæsar met the Spaniard Cortés in the Piazza
"Colonna. They bowed. The thin, sour-looking painter was walking with a"
"beardless young German, red and snub-nosed. This young man was a painter"
"too, Cortés said; he wore a green hat with a cock’s feather, a blue"
"cape, thick eyeglasses, big boots, and had a certain air of being a"
blond Chinaman.
“Would you like to come to the Doria gallery with us?” asked Cortés.
“What is there to see there?”
“A stupendous portrait by Velázquez.”
“I warn you that I know nothing about pictures.”
"“Nobody does,” Cortés declared roundly. “Everybody says what he thinks.”"
“Is the gallery near here?”
"“Yes, just a step.”"
In company with Cortés and the German with the green hat with the cock’s
"feather, Cæsar went to the Piazza del Collegio Romano, where the Doria"
palace is. They saw a lot of pictures which didn’t seem any better to
"Cæsar than those in the antique shops and the pawnbrokers’, but which"
drew learned commentaries from the German. Then Cortés took them to a
cabinet hung in green and lighted by a skylight. There was nothing to
be seen in the cabinet except the portrait of the Pope. In order that
"people might look at it comfortably, a sofa had been installed facing"
it.
"""Have you ever heard the like of it? She told me to get out! I shall leave"
"tomorrow."""
"""Have you found the galoshes?"" I asked."
"""Of course,"" he replied. ""They were right in the passage. 'Here they are,'"
"I said to her. 'Yes, yes,' she said. 'Right under your nose,' I said."
"'Yes, yes, go away,' she said, and began to cry. So I went away."""
"""She'll get over it."""
"""Do you think so? Yes, I expect she will. Oh, well, it's my opinion nobody"
"can understand women, anyhow. But they're a mighty sex, the women, a"
"mighty sex. They certainly are."""
"He sat on a while, but he had no peace of mind, and soon went out again."

That evening the lady was in the dining room before us; she was there when
"we came in, and we all nodded slightly in greeting. To the actor she was"
"very kind, quite making up for her petulance of the afternoon."
When he sat down he found a letter in his table napkin: a written note
folded into the napkin. He was so surprised that he dropped everything he
"was doing to unfold and read it. With an exclamation and a smile, his"
"blue, delighted eyes splashed over her; but she was looking down into her"
"lap with her forehead wrinkled, so he put the note away in his vest"
pocket.
"Then it probably dawned on him that he had betrayed her, and he tried to"
cover it up somehow.
"Frances was the last girl in the world, save, perhaps Sarah, who I should"
"have supposed capable of languishing and dying of love, but the former"
"she did before my eyes, and the latter I almost began to fear if news did"
not reach us soon from George.
"Betty came up to see Frances nearly every day, and the kissing and"
embracing that ensued disgusted Sarah.
"""Now, if Frances were a man, I could understand it,"" said Sarah. ""The"
"little barmaid must be tempting to a man, being pretty and--"""
"""Beautiful, Sarah!"" I interrupted."
"""Yes, beautiful, if you will."""
"""Her eyes--"" I began, again interrupting Sarah."
"""Oh, yes!"" cried Sarah, impatiently. ""Her eyes are fine enough, but their"
"expression comes from their color, their size, and their preposterously"
long eyelashes. Black long lashes often give a radiance to the eyes which
"passes for expressiveness, and I doubt not--"""
"""Nonsense, Sarah!"" I cried, half angrily. ""Bettina's eyes are expressive"
"in themselves. As you say, their soft dark brown is the perfection of"
"color, and they certainly are large. But aside from all that, their"
"expression is--"""
"""There is no intellect in them!"" cried Sarah."
"""There is tenderness, gentleness, love, and truth in them,"" I answered,"
with as careless an air as I could assume.
"""You've been very good to me--yes, very good."""
He turned to her with a gesture of disclaimer. She thought he was going
"to speak, but he did not."
"""Whatever happens, I shall always remember that with--with deep"
"gratitude."""
"""What is going to happen?"" he asked, with an uneasy smile."
"""Oh, how can I?"" she burst out. ""How can I say it? How can I ask you?"""
"As she spoke she stopped, and he followed her example. They stood facing"
"one another now, as he replied gravely,"
"""Whatever you ask--let it be what it will--I will answer, truthfully."" A"
pause before the last word perhaps betrayed a momentary struggle.
"""What right have I? Why should you?"""
"""The right my--my desire to have your regard gives you. How can I ask"
"for that, unless I am ready to tell you all you can wish to know?"""
"""I have heard,"" she began falteringly, ""I have been told by--by people"
"who, I suppose, were right to tell me----"""
In a moment he understood her. A slight twitch of his mouth betrayed his
"trouble, but he came to her rescue."
"""I don't know how it reached you,"" he said. ""Perhaps I think you might"
have been--you need not have known it. But there is only one thing you
"""Yes--the diamonds. That's why we went out on the _Arabella_--"" In"
broken sentences Sidney told the story; she wanted Mr. Dugald to know
that they had cared most for the honor of Cape Cod!
"""And we found them--a big box--at least we _think_ it's the diamonds!"
"Cap'n Phin Davies says it's _something_ queer!"""
Dugald Allan's exclamation had much the character of an explosion.
"""_Diamonds!_ What nonsense! You've risked bereaving three homes for"
what is probably nothing more than a case of rum. If ever a girl needed
"a big brother to keep her in check, you do!"""
CHAPTER XXIII
DIAMONDS
During the early morning hours of that summer day that Sidney was
"destined never to forget, the girl passed through every emotion that a"
fifteen-year-old heart can suffer.
"First, to her dismay no one at the cottage had seemed to rejoice, as"
"the crowd on the wharf had rejoiced, at her rescue. When Mr. Dugald led"
her in Miss Vine was making coffee at the stove and all she said was:
"""Well, you're all right! Better go to bed now as quick as you can and"
"keep out from under foot."" Then Mr. Dugald had taken Pola back to the"
hotel. Aunt Achsa was with Doctor Blackwell and Lavender. Sidney had
tried to summon sufficient courage to ask Miss Vine's forbidding back
"between the eyes. As he pitched backward, arms flailing, he tumbled"
"against the others, giving Novosty time to fire again. With deadly"
accuracy he caught another in the chest.
"Kenji Nogami had already thrown himself on the thick hallway carpet,"
"safely avoiding the fusillade. The Russian bankers, too, had all hit"
"the floor, along with the MNB guards and the two couriers."
Then came a shot with a different sound--the dull thunk of a silencer.
"Novosty jerked in surprise, pain spreading through his eyes. The"
"silencer thunked again, and again."
"It was Vera Karanova. She was holding a small .22 caliber Walther PP,"
with a specially equipped silencer. And her aim was flawless. Novosty
had three slugs arranged neatly down the side of his head before he
"even realized what was happening. He collapsed forward, never knowing"
whose hand had been on the gun.
"She's probably wanted to get rid of him for years, Vance thought"
"fleetingly. She finally got her golden opportunity, the double-crossing"
bitch.
He briefly considered grabbing back one of the .38's and avenging Alex
"then and there, but he knew it would be suicidal."
"""Alex, no!"" Eva's voice sobbed."
"""Both of you, hands on the wall."" Comrade Karanova was definitely in"
charge.
"""Michael,"" Eva said, turning to comply, ""what happened to our well-laid"
"plans?"""
“There is my husband.”
"“_Nom de Dieu!_” cried Bazouge, stifling a guffaw before the austere"
"decorum of the English churchman. “_Ça?_ Oh, my poor Yvonne!” She shook"
"hands rapidly with him and turned away. He bowed gracefully, including"
the new-comers in his salute. The Canon responded severely. Mrs.
Winstanley stared at him through her tortoise-shell lorgnette.
"“We have been looking all over the place for you,” said the Canon,"
"as they passed through the window into the _salle des jeux_, leaving"
Bazouge in the corner of the verandah.
"“I’m sorry,” said Yvonne penitently."
“And who was that rakish-looking little Frenchman you were talking to?”
"“An old friend--I used to know him,” said Yvonne, struggling with her"
agitation. “A friend of my first husband--I had to speak to him--we went
"there to be quiet. I could n’t help it, Everard, really I could n’t.”"
"“My dear child,” said the Canon, kindly, “I was not scolding you--though"
he did look rather undesirable.”
“I suppose you had to mix with all kinds of odd Bohemian people in your
professional days?” said Mrs. Winstanley.
"“Of course,” faltered Yvonne."
They went through the great hall. At the door they parted with Mrs.
"Winstanley, who was waiting for the Wilmingtons. “We will call for you"
"on our way to the concert this afternoon,” said the Canon."
"“Oh, dear! I wish they would not fight at your school, Tom. Didn't it"
hurt you?”
"“Hurt me? No,” said Tom, putting up the hooks again, taking out a large"
"pocket-knife, and slowly opening the largest blade, which he looked at"
meditatively as he rubbed his finger along it. Then he added:
“I gave Spooner a black eye--that's what he got for wanting to leather
me. I wasn't going to go halves because anybody leathered me.”
"“Oh! how brave you are, Tom. I think you are like Samson. If there came"
"a lion roaring at me, I think you'd fight him, wouldn't you, Tom?”"
"“How can a lion come roaring at you, you silly thing? There's no lions"
only in the shows.”
"“No, but if we were in the lion countries--I mean in Africa where it's"
"very hot, the lions eat people there. I can show it you in the book"
where I read it.”
"“Well, I should get a gun and shoot him.”"
"“But if you hadn't got a gun?--we might have gone out, you know, not"
"thinking, just as we go out fishing, and then a great lion might come"
"towards us roaring, and we could not get away from him. What should you"
"do, Tom?”"
"Tom paused, and at last turned away contemptuously, saying: “But the"
lion _isn't_ coming. What's the use of talking?”
This passage illustrates also the difference between the
right under the window of his sitting-room. An Indian voice greeted
"him, ""Don' shoot; me killi him."""
"""Who in h---- are you?"" swore Searles, at a present."
"""Don' shoot, me Ahhæta--all same Sharp-Nose--don' shoot--me killi him."""
"""Killi who? Who have you killed? Talk up quick!"""
"""Me killi him. You come--you see."""
By this time the crowd drew in with questions and eager to help. A
"sergeant arrived with a lantern, and the guard laid rude hands on the"
"Crow scout, Sharp-Nose, who was well known. He was standing over the"
"prostrate figure, and continued to reiterate, ""Me killi him."""
"The lantern quickly disclosed the man on the ground to be John Ermine,"
"late scout and fugitive from justice, shot through the heart and dead,"
with his blanket and rifle on the ground beside him. As he looked
"through the window, he had been stalked and killed by the fool whom he"
"would not allow to shake hands with Katherine Searles, and a few moments"
"later, when Sharp-Nose was brought into her presence, between two"
"soldiers, she recognized him when he said, ""Mabeso, now you shake"
"hands."""
"""Yes, I will shake hands with you, Sharp-Nose,"" and half to herself, as"
"she eyed her malevolent friend, she muttered, ""and he kept you to"
"remember me by."""
sharpest wits going to get my pile. A man gets in a groove in New York.
It takes the West to put a razor-edge on him.”
The policeman twirled his club and took a step or two.
“I’ll be on my way. Hope your friend comes around all right. Going to
call time on him sharp?”
“I should say not!” said the other. “I’ll give him half an hour at
"least. If Jimmy is alive on earth he’ll be here by that time. So long,"
officer.”
"“Good-night, sir,” said the policeman, passing on along his beat,"
trying doors as he went.
"There was now a fine, cold drizzle falling, and the wind had risen from"
its uncertain puffs into a steady blow. The few foot passengers astir
in that quarter hurried dismally and silently along with coat collars
turned high and pocketed hands. And in the door of the hardware store
"the man who had come a thousand miles to fill an appointment, uncertain"
"almost to absurdity, with the friend of his youth, smoked his cigar and"
waited.
"About twenty minutes he waited, and then a tall man in a long overcoat,"
"with collar turned up to his ears, hurried across from the opposite"
side of the street. He went directly to the waiting man.
"“Is that you, Bob?” he asked, doubtfully."
"“Is that you, Jimmy Wells?” cried the man in the door."
"“Bless my heart!” exclaimed the new arrival, grasping both the other’s"
"""I can say no more,"" Monsieur added. ""Accept my thanks and gratitude for"
"the help you have given me. And now--_bon soir_."""
"He bowed, backing himself toward the stairs as though leaving a royal"
"presence, doing it so easily, so naturally, that we did not even smile."
When he had quite disappeared we turned and faced each other.
"""What do you think now?"" I asked."
"""I think he's a treasure,"" Tommy cried. His face had lighted with a new"
"excitement. ""If we want any fun on this trip, don't let him get out of"
"our sight! Stick to him! I won't deny he has a screw loose, but----"""
"""That makes it all the better,"" I laughed, adding: ""Looks like the"
"Mater's toast might come true, after all, doesn't it!""--for I had"
described our New Year's Eve to Tommy.
"""Sonny, I've a hunch we won't even have to tiptoe over the hill to find"
"adventures with him around! He's their regular hanging-out place!"""
"Gates came up, and seemed vastly amused when we told him of our hopes."
"""He doesn't look like much of an adventurer, sir, but he's certainly a"
"change from the great run of people I've met. Still, I carn't see how"
"we're going to keep him against his will!"""
"""Neither can I, Tommy."""
"""Use a little persuasion."""
"""But suppose he won't persuade?"""
"“Oh, don't you?” cried Sir Oliver, in sinister exultation. “Then your"
whole historical fabric of the Crucifixion must fall to the ground.”
"“I don't see why you need be irreverent and blasphemous,” said Lady"
Blount.
"Herold laid his hand on Lady Blount's and looked at her, with his head"
on one side.
"“But do you believe in Stellamaris, Julia.”"
"His smile was so winning, with its touch of mockery, that she grew"
mollified.
"“I believe she has bewitched all of us,” she said."
Which shows how any woman may be made to eat her words just by a little

"So the talk went back to Stella and her ways and her oddities, and the"
question of faith in Pontius Pilate being necessary for salvation was
"forgotten. A maid, Stella's own maid, came in with a message. Miss"
"Stella's compliments, and were Mr. Risca and Mr. Herold having a good"
"supper? She herself was about to drink her egg beaten up in sherry, and"
would be glad if the gentlemen would take a glass of wine with her.
"The young men, accordingly, raised their glasses toward the ceiling and"
"drank to Stella, in the presence of the maid, and gave her appropriate"
messages to take back to her mistress.

Then Dugald Allan spied Pola shivering forlornly behind Mart and
"Sidney. ""_You_--"" he cried, pushing Sidney aside. ""I thought you were"
"at Chatham!"" His mouth tightened in a straight, stern line. ""What is"
"all this? But wait, I must get Sidney back to Aunt Achsa. You shall"
"explain things as we go along."""
"He hurried the girls through the crowd which parted, smilingly, to let"
"them pass. On Commercial Street he hailed old Hiram Moss, who with an"
"eye to business in the midst of tragedy, had harnessed his horses to"
his ancient cab and had them ready for an emergency.
After he had bundled his charges in Dugald Allan turned to Sidney.
"""Now give me some inkling of what started this crazy adventure. Thank"
God it has not ended as it might have ended though Lavender is still
"fighting for his life! Answer me, Sidney."""
But before Sidney could begin her tale she had to know what had
happened to Lavender.
"""Fighting for his life? But--he _got here_, didn't he?"""
"""Yes--he reached shore, by an effort so great as to completely"
"prostrate him. They took him home. I left Doctor Blackwell with him."""
Dugald Allan spoke shortly and his crisp sentences had the effect of
"stunning poor Sidney. She shivered and leaned close to him. Her voice,"
"when she spoke, came with a childish tremor."
"""Oh, Lavender _can't_ die. If he does--it will be all my fault! I"
"started everything. I--I told him about the diamonds--"""

The clang of an ambulance bell outside told that the aid summoned by

We left the body in charge of the surgeon and of a policeman who

Muller lived in a cheap boarding house in a shabbily respectable street
"downtown, and without announcing ourselves we climbed the stairs to his"
room. He looked up surprised but not disconcerted as we entered.
“What’s the matter?” he asked.
"“Muller,” shot out Winters, “we have just found Mr. Schloss dead!”"
“D-dead!” he stammered.
The man seemed speechless with horror.
"“Yes, and with his grips packed as if to run away.”"

"“My wife has a deadly hatred for all of them,” said Giovanni Battista,"
laughing.
“And why so?” asked Cæsar.
“Because we talk politics and sometimes they ask me for a few
pennies....”
"“Your wife must have a lively temper,...” said Cæsar."
"“Yes, an unhappy disposition; good, awfully good; but very"
superstitious. Christianity has produced nothing but superstitions.”
"“Giovanni Battista is a pagan, as his wife well says,” asserted Kennedy."
“What superstitions has your wife?” asked Cæsar.
“All of them. Romans are very superstitious and my wife is a Roman. If
"you see a hunchback, it is good luck; if you see three, then your luck"
is magnificent and you have to swallow your saliva three times; on the
"other hand, if you see a humpbacked woman it is a bad omen and you must"
spit on the ground to keep away the _jettatura_. Three priests together
"is a very good sign. We ought all to get along very well in Rome,"
because we see three and up to thirty priests together.”
"“A spider is also very significant,” said Kennedy; “in the morning it is"
"of bad augury, and in the evening good.”"
“And at noon?” asked Cæsar.
"“At noon,” answered Lanza, laughing, “it means nothing to speak of. But"
"“What very stupid and false ideas,” exclaimed Laura. “Really I"
appreciate having a brother who talks in such a vulgar way.”
“You are an aristocrat and the truth doesn’t please you. But such are
the facts. I can see the chief of the bureau of Papal titles. What fun
he must have thinking up the most appropriate title for a magnate of
Yankee tinned beef or for an illustrious Andean general! How magnificent
it would be to gather all the Bishops _in partibus infidelium_ and all
the people with Papal titles in one drawing-room! The Bishop of Nicaea

“You are a clown!” said Laura.
"“He is a finished satirist,” added Kennedy."
_CÆSAR’S PLAN_
"After lunch, Laura, Kennedy, and Cæsar went into the salon, and Laura"
introduced the Englishman to the San Martino girls and the Countess
"Brenda. They stayed there chatting until four o’clock, at which time the"
"San Martinos got ready to go out in a motor car, and Laura, with the"

Cæsar and Kennedy went into the street together.

The duke regarded his host out of half-shut watery eyes.
"""My own choice is Chianti!"""
"""A difference of five years in purgatory!"""
Thereupon the duke blew the froth of his wine in the Abbot's face.
"""Purgatory!--A mere figure of speech!"""
The Abbot emptied his tankard.
"""The figures of speech are the pillars of the Church!"""
He beckoned to the custodian.

The lean friar came and disappeared noiselessly.

"sneezed, which caused Beelzebub, the Abbot's black he-goat, who had"
"been browsing outside, to peer through the crescent-shaped aperture in"
the casement and regard him quizzically.
"The duke, who chanced to look up at that precise moment, saw the red"
"inflamed eyes of the Abbot's tutelar genius, and, mistaking the goat"
"for another presence, turned to his host."

"Type sizes in the present day are determined by the point system, the"
fundamental unit of which is the point. This is obtained by dividing
"a length of 13⅘ inches into 996 equal parts, each one being called a"
point. One point is therefore .0138 of an inch or 72.46 points are
equal to 1 inch.
"For purposes of convenience, a point is expressed as being 1/72 of an"

"12/72 and so on. This does not mean, however, that the actual printed"
"face occupies six points on the paper, but that it is six points from"
the base to the top of the body carrying the face.
"In other words, one may say that it is 12 points from the bottom of"

Mrs. White was all concern. She summoned Pepper and instructed him to
find out the first train; she sent her maid to Trude's room to pack her
clothes. And last she wrote a generous check.
"""You may need it, my dear. It is nothing. Don't thank me. I wish I"
could do more. Somehow your shoulders seem too young to carry so much
"responsibility!"""
So on the selfsame day that Sidney and the others set out upon their
adventure Trude was journeying to Cape Cod. She missed connections at
"Boston and hired an automobile to take her to Provincetown, in her"
heart thanking Mrs. White for the check that made this possible. Two
blow-outs delayed her journey so that it was midnight when she reached
her destination. She could scarcely hunt out the Greens and Sidney at
that hour. She took a room at the hotel for the night and sat for a
while at its window straining her eyes out into the darkness. The
howling of the wind intensified her apprehension; somewhere out in that
strange blackness that enwrapped her was her little sister. Perhaps
Sidney needed her that very moment!
Finally she crept into bed and fell into a troubled sleep. She did not
hear the running steps that passed under her window or the muffled
voices of excited men.

The great eurypterids--some of which were five or six feet in
length--and the cephalopods were still masters of the seas. Fishes
were as yet few and small; trilobites and graptolites had now
passed their prime and had diminished greatly in numbers.
Scorpions are found in this period both in Europe and in America.
"The limestone-making seas of the Silurian swarmed with corals,"
"crinoids, and brachiopods."
With the end of the Silurian period the AGE OF INVERTEBRATES comes
"to a close, giving place to the Devonian, the AGE OF FISHES."
CHAPTER XVIII
THE DEVONIAN
In America the Silurian is not separated from the Devonian by any
mountain-making deformation or continental uplift. The one period
passed quietly into the other. Their conformable systems are so
"closely related, and the change in their faunas is so gradual,"
that geologists are not agreed as to the precise horizon which
divides them.

in New York and southward by the following five series. We add the

building a new life. He didn't care if all hell was about to break

"He was feeling nervous, which was unusual and he didn't like it."
"Whenever he got that way, things always started going off the track."
"They were now in the paneled elevator, heading up to the sixth floor of"
the Moscow Narodny Bank. The hundred million had been held overnight in
"the vault of Victoria Courier Service Limited, which was scheduled to"
deliver the satchels this morning at ten-thirty sharp. The location for
"the delivery, however, was known only to him and to Michael Vance. He"
wanted to be sure and arrive there ahead of the money. He also would
have much preferred being without the company of Vera Karanova.
One thing you had to say for Michael: He'd arranged the deal with great
finesse. He didn't trust anybody. Until he notified Victoria Courier

"""They have come to question you,"" Greca lamented to Brand. ""And they"
"want to do it through me. But I will not! I will not!"""
Brand smiled at her though his lips were pale.
"""You are powerless to struggle,"" he said. ""Do as they ask. You cannot"
"help us by refusing, and, in any case, I can promise that they won't"
"learn anything from us."""

"to play, was Greca."
At length the Rogan leader spoke. He addressed his sibilant words to
"Greca, though his stony eyes were kept intently on the Earthmen."
"""He says,"" exclaimed Greca telepathically, ""to inform you first that"
"he is head of all the Rogan race on this globe, and that all on this"
"globe must do as he commands."""
Brand nodded to show he understood the message.
"""He says he is going to ask you a few questions, and that you are to"
"answer truthfully if you value your lives:"""
"""First, he wants to know what the people of your world are like. Are"
"they all the same as you?"""

"The Canon came later to her room, kindly solicitous. Was she ill? Would"
she like to see a medical man? Should he sit with her? She clasped his
hand impulsively and kissed it.
“You are too good to me. I am not worth it. I am not ill. It was the
"sun, I think. Let me lie down this afternoon by myself and I shall be"
better.”
"Surprised and touched by her action, he bent down and kissed her."
“My poor little wife.”
He stepped to the window and pulled the curtain to shield her eyes from
"the glare, and promising to order some tea to be brought up later, he"
went out.
"The kiss, the term, and the little act of thoughtfulness comforted her,"
gave her a sense of protection. She had been so bruised and frightened.
Now she could think a little. Should she tell Everard? Then she broke
down again and began to cry silently in a great soothing pity for
herself.
"“It would only make him unhappy,” she moaned. “Why should I tell him?”"
She grew calmer. If Amédée would only keep his promise and leave her
"free, there was really nothing to fret about. She reassured herself with"
his words. Through all his failings toward her he had ever been “_bon
enfant_.” There was no danger.
Suddenly a thought came that made her spring from her bed in dismay. The
"After a moment of sober reflection, I nodded. ""You're right. I've also"
"become a male outside the law. We're in this together."""
He guffawed. Then he sat up and began cleaning his blaster. I found
myself drawn to the bright killer-tube with exactly the fascination Sis
insists such things have always had for men.
"""Ferdinand your label? That's not right for a sprouting tadpole. I'll"
"call you Ford. My name's Butt. Butt Lee Brown."""
"I liked the sound of Ford. ""Is Butt a nickname, too?"""
"""Yeah. Short for Alberta, but I haven't found a man who can draw a"
"blaster fast enough to call me that. You see, Pop came over in the"
eighties--the big wave of immigrants when they evacuated Ontario. Named
"all us boys after Canadian provinces. I was the youngest, so I got the"
"name they were saving for a girl."""
"""You had a lot of brothers, Mr. Butt?"""
"He grinned with a mighty set of teeth. ""Oh, a nestful. Of course, they"
were all killed in the Blue Chicago Rising by the MacGregor boys--all
except me and Saskatchewan. Then Sas and me hunted the MacGregors down.
Took a heap of time; we didn't float Jock MacGregor's ugly face down
"the Tuscany till both of us were pretty near grown up."""
I walked up close to where I could see the tiny bright copper coils of
"the blaster above the firing button. ""Have you killed a lot of men with"
"that, Mr. Butt?"""
"""Butt. Just plain Butt to you, Ford."" He frowned and sighted at"
over tomorrow. We can stay there for a few days. I shall welcome the
"change for this place has been very stupid for me, my dear."""
"""Poor mamma! I've been selfish. It'll be a lark seeing Cora Truxton"
"again!"" Pola had explained to Sidney: ""We met the Truxtons at Nice."
"Cora and Millicent are both older, but they're the _cutest_ girls. Will"
"we go in the morning, mamma?"""
Pola's manner had indicated that the coming of the Truxtons into their
plans raised a barrier that now excluded Sidney. Throughout the dinner
she had talked exclusively of the trip on the morrow and the renewing
of that acquaintance that had begun in Nice. But Sidney felt nothing
but a sense of escape.
She found Aunt Achsa alone in the cottage on Sunset Lane. She was
"sitting on the doorstep, ""coolin' off."" Sidney sat down beside her."
"""Where's Lavender?"" she asked, wishing Lavender was at home that she"
"might begin her ""making up"" at once."
"""Don't know. And I wish I did. Don't know what's gotten into that boy."
"I'm as worried as can be."""
"""About Lav? Oh, what's the matter?"" For Aunt Achsa was close to tears."
Something must have happened to break her habitual optimism.
"""He's acted so queer like lately. Cal'late you'd of noticed it if you"
hadn't been off so much with Mr. Dugald's folks. I thought it might a'
"been his stomach and I put a powder into his coffee, but he ain't been"
"a mite different--"""
"""But what does he do, Aunt Achsa? He looks all right--"""
the door yawned open.
Noll turned at the sound of its unlatching.
The mother of Netherby Gomme stood in the dark hollow of the doorway;
and a grim triumph lurked in her eyes.
"Noll saluted her, hat in hand; and she returned his greeting with a"
grave smile of surprise.
"“Is Netherby at home, Mrs. Gomme?” he asked."
"The grim triumph slipped back to her eyes, and came lurking into the"
corners of the old mouth again:
"“He came home from his honeymoon to-day, Noll,” she said--“will you go"
up and see him?”
"Noll walked into the house, and the door was shut behind him with"
a triumphant slam. He followed the grim old lady into the little
"sitting-room, and as he went the memory of the queenly figure of the"
little child Betty as she walked into the dingy room and kissed the
"jealousy out of this old woman’s heart, came back to him like the"
"fragrance of her sweetness, so that for a while he could not speak what"
he would have said.
"“It was only the other day,” she said, “that you were boys together...."
To me it is only yesterday that he was a--little one--in my--arms.”
Her eyes filled with tears. “But it is all gone.... This passing of
youth is as strange as death....” And she added after awhile: “I think
he--was glad--to come back.”
"was disloyal and had come there with hostile intent, but because she"
felt that she must be absolutely sure of her ground before she revealed
the fact that Johnson was in the cabin. She let some moments pass before
she replied:
"""I don't know nothin' about your master. Who is he?"""
An indulgent smile crossed the Mexican's face.
"""That ver' good to tella other peoples; but I know 'im here too much."
"You trusta me--me quita safe."""
All this was said with many gestures and an air that convinced the Girl
that he was speaking the truth. But since she deemed it best that the
"invalid should be kept from any excitement, she resolved to make the"
Mexican divulge to her the nature of his important errand.
"""How do you know he's here?"" she began warily. ""What do you want 'im"
"for?"""
The Mexican's shifty eyes wandered all over the room as if to make
certain that no inimical ears were listening; then he whispered:
"""I tella you something--you lika the _Maestro_?"""
"Unconsciously the Girl nodded, which evidently satisfied the Mexican,"
for he went on:
"""You thinka well of him--yees. Now I tella you something. The man Pedro"
'e no good. 'E wisha the reward--the money for Ramerrez. 'E and the
"woman--woman no good--tell Meester Ashby they thinka 'im 'ere."""
"""But the diamonds!"" she cried."
"""_Diamonds_--"" Cap'n Davies stared at her, his mouth open."
"""Why, yes, they're on this boat. They _must_ be! We were in the forward"
cabin watching and Jed Starrow came on board and they talked right
where we could hear. They were going to take them off and then they
decided it wasn't safe and they'd wait and they went away. And then
they must have cut the boat adrift. But we're _sure_ they're on this
"boat."""
"""So that was it! Of all the low-down dastardly tricks! Well, never mind"
"your diamonds, now. We got to get back to shore and let a few folks"
"know--"""
"""But I won't _go_ until we've looked!"" Sidney protested, almost in"
"tears. ""Why, that was why we risked everything! And Lav wants to save"
"the name of the Cape--the--the way--you do! Oh, please look!"""
"The old Captain dropped his hold of the girl's arm. ""Well, I'll be"
"ding-blasted!"" he stormed. But he motioned to Saunders. ""Climb aboard"
and give us a hand. 'Taint likely they'd hide their stuff above deck.
You look round the stern and the girls and me'll give a hunt forward.
"Of all the stubborn, crazy-headed female pieces you'll beat 'em all!"""
While Saunders searched the stern of the schooner the Captain and
"Sidney and Mart searched the fo'castle cabin. Sidney, tugging away the"
"heavy tarpaulins, disclosed a small wooden box."
"""I'm _sure_ it wasn't there before--"" she cried. ""Why--why, I was"
"_sitting_ on it--"""
He looked down the scuttle at the clock.
"""Why, you owe me twenty."""
Simcox flew out with pretended politeness.
"""Oh, make it half an hour!  Don't let's haggle about such a trifle."
What's it matter if I stand here waiting?  Can't I keep the whole
"bloomin' watch for you?"""
"""Go to hell,"" said Lampert sulkily."
And Simcox went below.
"""To be a sailor is to be a natural born fool,"" said Lampert,"
"addressing the bitter and unkindly elements at large, ""and to be on"
"board a ship with such a windy gassing crowd, from the old man down"
"to the cook, is very trying.  It's very trying."""
"The wind took off a little later, but the weather was still thickish."
"""It's like lookin' through a haystack,"" grunted Lampert, ""but there,"
bar an island or so there's nothing to speak of in our way.  And if
"the skipper will crack on, and it a week since we saw the sun, it's"
"the owners' look out, not mine."""
"He spoke with a certain bitterness, as though he would really enjoy"
"being wrecked, in the trust that the _Potluck_ was not insured, and"
"that old Jones would get his certificate cancelled, or at least"
suspended.

"TURNLEY, CAPTAIN RICHARD."
A New Providence pirate who received the general pardon from Captain
"Woodes Rogers in 1718. When, a little later, the scandal of Captain"
Rackam's infatuation for Anne Bonny was causing such gossip among the two
"thousand ex-pirates who formed the population of the settlement, it was"
Turnley who brought news of the affair to the notice of the Governor. In
"revenge for this action, Rackam and his lady, one day hearing that Turnley"
"had sailed to a neighbouring island to catch turtles, followed him. It"
"happened that Turnley was on shore hunting wild pigs and so escaped, but"
Rackam sank his sloop and took his crew away with him as prisoners.

A Dutchman from New York.
A successful pirate in the days of the Madagascan sea-rovers. For some

Van Tyle had a plantation at Madagascar and used to put his prisoners to
"work there as slaves, one in particular being the notorious Welsh pirate,"
"David Williams, who toiled with Van Tyles's other slaves for six months"
before making his escape to a friendly tribe in the neighbourhood.
"UPTON, BOATSWAIN JOHN."
Born in 1679 of honest parents at Deptford.
"Apprenticed to a waterman, he afterwards went to sea, serving on different"
"ship, the _Santa Maria Desaie_, from Tenby to Bastabill Haven. Off the"
Welsh coast the ship was attacked by a pirate vessel called the
"_Furtuskewys_, with a crew of thirty-five pirates. Alves was put ashore on"
"the Welsh coast, and the two ships then sailed to Cork, where the ship and"
"her cargo were sold to the mayor for 1,524 crowns."
"Alves complained to the King of England, and orders were sent to the Mayor"
"of Cork, Richard Gowllys, to give up the ship, which he refused to do, but"
by way of excusing his actions he explained that he thought the ship was a
Scotch one and not a Portuguese.
"PHILLIPS, CAPTAIN."
"In 1723 this noted pirate took a sloop, the _Dolphin_, of Cape Ann, on the"
Banks of Newfoundland. The crew of the _Dolphin_ were compelled by
"Phillips to join the pirates. Amongst the prisoners was a fisherman, John"
"Fillmore. Finding no opportunity to escape, Fillmore with another sailor,"
"Edward Cheesman, and an Indian, suddenly seized and killed Phillips and"
"the two other chief pirates. The rest of the crew agreeing, the ship was"
taken to Boston.
"PHILIPS, JAMES."
Of the Island of Antigua.
"Formerly of the _Revenge_, and afterwards in the _Royal Fortune_ (Captain"
Roberts). When the _Royal Fortune_ surrendered in 1722 to H.M.S.
"_Swallow_, Philips seized a lighted match and attempted to blow up the"
"ship, swearing he would ""send them all to Hell together,"" but was"
"prevented by the master, Glasby. Hanged at the age of 35."
no wish but to spend some pleasant hours with the Torsen type.
He strolled about the garden waiting for her to get ready. Once she was
"visible through the doorway, and he called to her:"
"""Aren't you coming soon? Don't forget we've got to cross the mountain!"""
"""Well, I can't go bareheaded,"" she replied."
He was impatient.
"""No, you've got to put your hat on, and what a lot of time that takes!"
"Ugh!"""
She measured him coldly and said:
"""You're very--familiar."""
If he had paid her back in the same coin there would have been weeping and
"gnashing of teeth and cries of ""Go away! Go alone!"" and an hour's delay,"
"and reconciliation and embraces. But the actor's manner changed at once,"
"and he replied docilely, as his nature was,"
"""Familiar? Well--perhaps. Sorry!"""
"Then he strolled about the garden again, humming occasionally and swinging"
"his stick. I took note of the oddly feminine shape of his knees, and the"
unusual plumpness of his thighs; there was something unnatural about this
"plumpness, as though it did not belong to his sex."
"His shoes were down at the heel, and his collar was open. His raincoat"
"hung regally from his shoulders and flapped in the wind, though it was not"
confronted by Sonora when about to return to the others.
"""Well, I tho't I seen him,"" evaded Nick with considerable uneasiness. ""I"
"couldn't swear to it. You see it was dark, an'--Moses but the Sidney"
"Duck's a liar!"""
"At length, Ashby decided that the man had in all probability been snowed"
"under, ending confidently with:"
"""Something scared him off and he lit out without his horse."" Which"
"remark brought temporary relief to the Girl, for Nick, watching her, saw"
the colour return to her face.
"Unconsciously, during this discussion, the Girl had risen to her feet,"
"but only to fall back in her chair again almost as suddenly, a sign of"
nervousness which did not escape the sharp eye of the Sheriff.
"""How do you know the man's a road agent?"" A shade almost of contempt was"
in the Girl's question.
Sonora breathed on his badly nipped fingers before answering:
"""Well, two greasers jest now were pretty positive before they quit."""
Instantly the Girl's head went up in the air.
"""Greasers!"" she ejaculated scornfully, while her eyes unfalteringly met"
Rance's steady gaze.
"""But the woman knew him,"" was the Sheriff's vindictive thrust."
The Girl started; her face went white.
"""Vera, my love,"" Eva said, cutting her off, ""if you try and double-"
"cross us, you're making a very big mistake. You seem to forget we've"
got that protocol. What we didn't get around to telling you is that
"we've deciphered it."""
"""You--?"""
"""That's right. As it happens, I don't think you're going to like what"
"it's got to say, but you might at least want to know the story before"
"you read about it in The Times day after tomorrow."""
"Alex Novosty's face had turned ashen. ""Michael, Tanzan Mino's people"
are probably headed here by now. Unless they go to the main office on
"King William Street first."" He was nervously glancing out the window."
"""We're running out of time."""
"The game's about to get rough, Vance thought. Better take charge."
"But before he could move, Novosty was gripping a Ruger P-85, a"
"lightweight 9mm automatic, pulled from a holster under the back of his"
jacket. He'd worn it where the MNB guards would miss it.
The two Victoria couriers were caught flat-footed. Bankers weren't
supposed to start drawing weapons. They stared in astonishment as he
gestured for them to turn and face the wall.
"""Michael,"" he said as he glanced over, ""would you kindly give me a hand"
"and take those two .38's? We really must get this party moving."""
"Vera Karanova was smiling a thin smile. ""I don't know how far you think"
"you will get with this."""

"Besides the windows, the till and the shelves had been cleared, and"
empty drawers and boxes had been thrown on to the floor. We went down
into the cellar. All the cases had been opened and the stone floor was
littered with empty and broken bottles. The girl began to sob again when
she saw the ruin that had been inflicted:
"""All gone, all gone--ve poor now."""
"""Why don't you complain to the Town Major?"" one of us suggested."
"""Complain?--vat's de use complain?--de Town Major, he nice man, he kind"
"to us, but he no find de soldiers dat come, and if he find zem he punish"

"We ascended the cellar stairs. The mother was in the main room, wiping"
"her eyes. We said good-bye to her and her daughter, feeling ashamed of"
"our uniforms, and walked out into the street."
A mass of French cavalry were galloping past. It was growing dark. The
cannonade had become deafening. Over the town a few miles off there was
a crimson glare in the sky.
"Kilshaw's got a gadfly that does instead, and of course, Coxon, I add"
"you to the list."""
"""Much obliged for your testimonial,"" said Coxon sourly."
"""I add any man I'm talking to, to the list,"" continued the Chief"
"Justice. ""I expect him to do the same by me. But, honestly, I add you"
even in your absence. You're not a man who puts party ties above
"everything."""
"Mr. Coxon darted a suspicious glance at the head of his profession, but"
the Chief Justice's air was blandly innocent.
"""My party's my party,"" he remarked, ""just so long as it carries out my"
"principles. I don't say either party does it perfectly."""
"""I dare say not; but of course you're right to act with the one that"
"does most for you."""
Again the Chief Justice had hit on a somewhat ambiguous expression.
"Coxon detected a grin on the face of Captain Heseltine, who was sitting"
"near, but he could not hold Sir John's grave face guilty of the"
Captain's grin.
"""I see,"" remarked the Captain, perhaps in order to cover the retreat of"
"his grin, ""that they've discharged the woman who was arrested last night"
"for the murder."""
"""Really no evidence against her,"" said the Chief Justice. ""But,"
"Heseltine, wasn't this man Benham the fellow Medland had a sort of"
"shindy with at that flower-show?"""
"to tea and was very----'  I can't quite make this word out."""
"""Let _me_ look,"" said the King, his rubicund face becoming yet more"
"rubicund.  ""It looks like 'charming,'"" he said casually."
"""Fancy!"" said Belvane.  ""Fancy my writing that!  I put down just what"
"comes into my head at the time, you know.""  She made a gesture with"
her hand indicative of some one who puts down just what comes into her
"head at the time, and returned to her diary.  ""'Remained to tea, and"
"was very charming.  Mused afterwards on the mutability of life!'"" She"
"looked up at him with wide-open eyes.  ""I often muse when I'm alone,"""
she said.
The King still hovered over the diary.
"""Have you any more entries like--like that last one?  May I look?"""
"""Oh, your Majesty!  I'm afraid it's _quite_ private.""  She closed the"
book quickly.
"""I just thought I saw some poetry,"" said the King."
"""Just a little ode to a favourite linnet.  It wouldn't interest your"
"Majesty."""
"""I adore poetry,"" said the King, who had himself written a rhymed"
"couplet which could be said either forwards or backwards, and in the"
latter position was useful for removing enchantments.  According to
"the eminent historian, Roger Scurvilegs, it had some vogue in Euralia"
and went like this:
"""_Bo, boll, bill, bole._"
clever enough? Then the situation stimulated her. She held out her hand
to Boswell.
“You have come to see me?” she cried delightedly. “Mr. Trent has just
"been telling us that you came down with him, and I hoped you would call"
soon.”
"“Yes, to be sure—to be sure. You might have known I would call soon.”"
"He bowed stiffly to Trent, and, seating himself close beside Jessica,"
murmured in her ear: “Cannot you get rid of that fellow? How did he find
you out so soon?”
"“Why, he came to see Edith, of course. Do you not remember how devoted"
he always was to her?”
“I do not—”
"“May I ask what you are whispering about, Mr. Boswell?” demanded Trent,"
breaking from Miss Decker. “Is he confiding to you the astounding
"success of his last novel, Mrs. Pendleton? Or was it a history of the"
United States? I really forget.”
"“Not the last, certainly. I leave it to you to make history—an abridged"
edition. My ambition is a more humble one.”
"“Oh, you will both need biographers,” said Mrs. Pendleton, who was"
beginning to enjoy herself. “I will give you an idea. Join the
Theosophists. Arrange for reincarnation. Come back in the next
generation and write your own biographies. Then your friends and
families cannot complain you have not had justice done you.”
“Ha! ha!” said Trent.
"It relieves me to know she is alive, revives me, and makes me"
"superlatively brave: if he has dared to kill her, I will report it at"
once. I shall not spare him. I shall accuse him of both her death and the
lawyer's. I shall go further: I shall accuse others--the thief of last
"winter, the man that stole the sides of bacon from a tradesman and sold me"
"rolls of tobacco out of his bag. No, I shall not keep silence about"
anything then....

"When it grew light, Solem went to the kitchen, had his breakfast, settled"
"his business with Paul and the women, and returned to his room. He was in"
"no hurry; though it was no longer early in the day, he took his time about"
"tying his bundles, preparatory to leaving. Lingeringly he looked into the"
windows of the south wing as he passed.
Then Solem was gone.
A little later Miss Torsen came in to breakfast. She asked at once about
Solem. And why might she be so interested in Solem? She had certainly
stopped in her room intentionally so as to give him time to leave; if she
wanted to see him she could have been here long ago. But was it not safest
"to seem a little angry? Supposing, night owl that I was, that I had seen"
something!
"""Where is Solem?"" she asked indignantly."
"My lady came swiftly to me, and it grieved me to see the pain and woe"
in her face.
'Is he mad?' she muttered.
I shook my head.
'Do you think he has really seen him?' she whispered. We both stood
with our eyes on him.
"'I fear so, my lady,' I said with reluctance."
"'But it would cost _him_ his life,' she muttered eagerly, 'if he were"
found here!'
"'He is a bold man,' I answered."
"'Ah! so was he--once,' she replied in a peculiar tone, and she pointed"
stealthily to the unconscious man in the window. 'A month ago he would
have taken him by the throat anywhere. What has come to him?'
"'God knows,' I answered reverently. 'Grant only he may do us no harm!'"
"He turned round at that, humming gaily, and went out, seeming almost"
unconscious of our presence; and I made as light of the matter to my
"lady as I could. But Tzerclas in the city, the Waldgrave mad, or at"
"any rate not sane, and last, but not least, the strange light in which"
"the latter chose to regard the former, were circumstances I could not"
easily digest. They filled me with uneasy fears and surmises. I began
"to perambulate the crowd, seeking furtively for a face; and was"
"entirely determined what I would do if I found it. The town was full,"
"""Thank you, sir."""
"After Frank Corson left, Superintendent Maynard sorted a memo out of the"
pile on his desk. The memo concerned Frank Corson. Superintendent
Maynard reread it and thought how well things usually worked out. Now it
wouldn't be necessary to have that talk with Corson about sloppy work.
Obviously there had been something on the young intern's mind for weeks
"now. Too bad. But let the Minnesota hospital, wherever it was, worry"
about the trouble and perhaps put Corson on the right track again.
He was their baby now.
Maynard took Corson's card from the files and wrote across it: _Transfer

Brent Taber stood in the shelter of a doorway on the Lower East Side of
Manhattan and watched an entrance across the street. He had been there
for over an hour.
Another hour passed and Taber shifted from one aching foot to the other
as a man in a blue suit emerged from the entrance and moved off down the
street.
"When the man had turned a corner, Taber crossed over and looked up at"
the brownstone. It was a perfect place to hide--one of the many rooming
"houses in the city where, if you paid your rent and kept your peace, no"
one cared who you were or where you came from.

Plexi-glass and then pierced his pressurized suit.
"Blood on the pilot's seat indicated that he had been injured, but there"
was no wound. The loss of pressure in the cockpit and in his suit should
"have killed him instantly--yet here he was, alive and unharmed, but"
definitely a changed man.
"Always a mild, considerate person he had, in a matter of minutes, become"

his evil purpose.

*CHAPTER VIII.*
*A STARTLING DISCOVERY.*
As Grey Dumaresq drifted downstream with the tide that sunny July
"morning, he felt as though something new and wonderful had come into his"
"life, as though some great and marvellous change had fallen upon him,"
"which, for good or ill, must leave its mark upon his life."
"While I was reading the poems to her, the actor returned."
"""I couldn't find any galoshes there,"" he said."
"""No?"" she replied absently."
"""No, I really looked everywhere, but...."""
She got up and left the room.
"He looked after her in some surprise, and sat still for a moment. Then it"
occurred to him.
"""I believe her galoshes are in the passage outside her door,"" he said, and"
hurried after her.
"I sat back, thinking it over. There had been a sweetness in her face as"
"she said, ""Yes, you're very silent."" Had she seen through me and my"
pretext for reading to her? Of course she had. She was no fool. I was the
"fool, nobody else. I should have driven a sportsman to despair. Some"
"practice the sport of making conquests and the sport of making love,"
because they find it so agreeable; I have never practiced sport of any
kind. I have loved and raged and suffered and stormed according to my
nature--that is all; I am an old-fashioned man. And here I sit in the
"shadow of evening, the shadow of the half-century. Let me have done!"
The actor returned to the living room confused and dejected. She had
turned him out; she had wept.
"I was not surprised, for it was the mode of expression of her type."
CHAPTER XVIII
THE BURGLAR’S MICROPHONE
"That night I was sitting, brooding over the case, while Craig was"
studying a photograph which he made of the smudge on the glass door
down at Schloss’. He paused in his scrutiny of the print to answer the
telephone.
"“Something has happened to Schloss,” he exclaimed seizing his hat and"
coat. “Winters has been watching him. He didn’t go to the Recherche.
Winters wants me to meet him at a place several blocks below it Come
on. He wouldn’t say over the wire what it was. Hurry.”
"We met Winters in less than ten minutes at the address he had given, a"
bachelor apartment in the neighborhood of the Recherche.
"“Schloss kept rooms here,” explained Winters, hurrying us quickly"
upstairs. “I wanted you to see before anyone else.”
As we entered the large and luxuriously furnished living room of the
"jeweler’s suite, a gruesome sight greeted us."
"There lay Schloss on the floor, face down, in a horribly contorted"
"position. In one hand, clenched under him partly, the torn sleeve of a"
woman’s dress was grasped convulsively. The room bore unmistakable
"traces of a violent struggle, but except for the hideous object on the"
floor was vacant.
"Kennedy bent down over him. Schloss was dead. In a corner, by the door,"
"“Ah, it’s a pity. You had such an exquisite little voice. I regretted"
it after we parted. Two or three times it nearly brought me back to
you--_foi d’artiste!_”
"“I think I must go,” said Yvonne after a little. “I am leaving Ostend"
to-morrow and I shall not see you again. You don’t think I am treating
"you unkindly, Amédée?”"
He laughed in his bantering way and lit a cigarette.
"“On the contrary, _cher ange_. It is very good of you to talk to a poor"
"ghost. And you look so pathetic, like a poor little saint with its harp"
out of tune.”
"She rose, anxious to leave him and escape into solitude, where she could"
"think. She still trembled with agitation. In the little cool park, on"
"the other side of the square below, she could be by herself. She dreaded"
meeting the Canon yet awhile.
"“Do give up that vile absinthe,” she said, as a parting softness."
“It is the only consoler that remains to me--sad widower.”
"“Well, good-bye, Amédée.”"
"“Ah--not yet. Since you are the wife of somebody else, I am dying to"
make love to you.”
"He held her by the wrist, laughing at her. But at that moment Yvonne"
"caught sight of the Canon and Mrs. Winstanley, entering upon the"
terrace. She wrenched her arm away.
"“Well, crowd along!” advised Ned."
“Crowd along?” repeated Jimmie. “What for?”
"“Use your nose,” advised Ned."
Jimmie sniffed elaborately and hit Ned a resounding whack on the back.
Then he sat down on the bottom of the passage.
"“Say, Ned, look here!” he said. “When we got into this scrape, we didn’t"
"look for any old Franciscan monks to help us out, did we? Two or three"
"hundred years ago, when they dug this passage through the rock, they"
"hadn’t any idea they were digging it for us, had they?”"
"“This is a mysterious world,” Ned answered. “It seems to be unnecessary"
for us to plan any mode of escape. The wise old chap who formed the
"Franciscan order in Europe, hundreds of years ago, prepared the way of"
escape for us!”
“That’s what he did!” answered Jimmie. “And I wish he had gone a little
farther and prepared a good fat meat pie for us.”
"“Jimmie,” Ned chuckled, “some day you’ll get into a corner where you"
won’t get anything to eat for a week. I never knew a boy who thought so
much of his stomach as you do!”
“May the day be long delayed!” laughed Jimmie.
"“Well, crawl along!” Ned advised, “and I’ll see if I can get this slab"
of stone you pushed out back in its place.”
“Then it was sent up by this crooked messenger boy with the intention of
"getting us out to look for you. He believed, of course, that we would"
regard the call for help as coming from you and rush away from camp.”
"“Don’t be too sure of that,” warned Ned. “There’s something about that"
"boy I rather like. Besides, he really is a member of the Wolf Patrol,"
New York.”
“My own patrol?” exclaimed Jimmie. “I never saw him at the club room. He
"told me that he belonged to the Wolf Patrol, but I didn’t believe it. I"
think he’s a fake.”
"“Time alone will tell,” answered Ned. “I’m going to believe in the boy"
until I get some positive proof that he really is crooked.”
Jimmie was about to continue the argument when a succession of shrieks
and calls for help came from the forest on the slope below.
"“Now, what’s that?” demanded Jimmie. “That isn’t any of our boys!”"
“Help! Help! Help!” cried the voice.
"“No,” Ned agreed, “our boys don’t make a racket like that.”"
"“Say!” Jimmie shouted, springing to his feet. “I bet you the next dollar"
"I don’t find that that’s the fat clerk, Gilroy!”"
"“The voice sounds like that of a fat man,” Ned laughed."
“Gilroy’s fat all right!” Jimmie exclaimed. “He’s got one of those pink
baby faces that make you hungry to look at. He makes me think of a roast
and then tell me how much probable space volume that so-called response
"represents."""
"The tech thought a minute. ""We've never run this gear anywhere"
"but at Radiation, right at Mojave labs, on Earth. Our spacial"
"coordinates--well, I'm afraid we--"" His voice trailed away unhappily."
Wilson picked up the interphone and barked a call.
"""Weston? Look, Hugh, can you get over here quick with a couple of your"
top astrogators? We've got a bunch of longhairs with a fancy infrawave
"detector and ranger, but the damned coordinates are set axially with"
"the ship."""
He listened to Hugh Weston's reply.
"""Yeah,"" he said then. ""We know where the target is with respect to the"
"ship, but we don't know the spacial attitude of the ship with respect"
"to the galactic check points. Right over? Good."""

"As Wilson hung up the dome flickered, then went into a regular"

feel as blue as a newly-clipped hearse-horse.”
"Blotte roused, and moved towards the door; halted; turned to them all:"
“I say I sup with the gods to-night--and mix the hats--and set the
table in a roar.... I must hasten away.... I hear them call.... God
"bless you, dear boys! we shall meet in sunshine----”"
Rippley stepped to the door:
"“Quick!” said he in a hushed whisper, “make a line, quick there,"
"you Fluffy, Doome, Blotte, to my left here at the door. Here comes"
Pangbutt.... He blows his nose like the old nobility.... Come along.
Blotte--don’t look like a broken-down anarchist in an advanced stage
"of pip. You must affect the smiling, friendly, neapolitan manner,"
expectant of a fee.”
"As Blotte’s pale face took on a deathly smile, Rippley bowed, and there"
stepped into the open doorway the well-groomed figure of their host.
"Pangbutt halted, perplexed."
He gazed in vague consternation at the Vandyke travesty in white silks
before him--turned to the solemn countenances of the four waiters:
"“May I ask what, in the name of Beelzebub, is happening in this house?”"
he asked.
"""But how'll we get ashore?"""
"""The tide'll be out towards morning."""
"""You mean _swim_?"" cried Pola. ""But I _can't_ swim! I--I--"""
"True, Pola's complex! Sidney hastened to reassure her."
"""When the tide's out it won't be over your head. And I'll help you."""
Lavender had already let the line of the dory slip out of his hand.
They saw the old boat become a shadowy outline as the tide carried it
"slowly away, then--nothing. Pola caught Sidney's hand and held it."
"""I'm not frightened--but it's so--_spooky_!"""
It had been decided that they should conceal themselves in the
"fo'castle cabin. They groped their way forward, Sidney guiding Pola in"
"the dark, for Lavender dared not light any of his matches. Stumbling,"
"scarcely breathing, they slipped down the companion ladder and crawled"
"into the small, ill-ventilated cabin. Sidney sat down upon some"
tarpaulins. Pola crouched close to Sidney's side. Lav and Mart stowed
themselves upon one of the bunks.
"""There--now we'll wait!"""
"""I--I wish I knew what _for_!"" whispered Pola. The smell of rank bilge"
"water, the lift and drop of the boat sickened her. The wind was whining"
and that and the swish of the water against the sides of the boat
terrified the girl.
In a few short words Lav vouchsafed Pola a little information. Like
tries to draw her with him; but she resists.
Then he grows angry.
"""What the devil did you send for me for?"" he asks roughly."
And she begins to weep and says:
"""So that's all you've come for! Oh, oh! But I'm not like that at all. Why"
"can't you leave me alone? I'm not hurting you."""
Am I one who understands women? Self-deception. Vain boasting. I made my
presence known then because her weeping sounded so wretched; I moved a
chair and cleared my throat.
"The sound caught his attention at once, and he hushed her, trying to"
listen; but she said:
"""No, it was nothing...."""
But she knew very well this was not true; she knew what the sound was. It
was not the first time Miss Torsen used this trick with me; she had often
"pretended that she thought I was not within hearing, and then created some"
such delicate situation. Each time I had promised myself not to intervene;
but she had not wept before; now she wept.
"Why did she use these wiles? To clear herself in my eyes--mine, the eyes"
"of a settled man--to make me believe how good she was, how well-behaved!"
"But, dear child, I knew that before; I could see it from your hands! You"
"are so unnatural that in your seven and twentieth year, you walk"
"unmarried, barren and unopen!"
"me--I imagine you are in diplomacy, as I noticed you went through"
"with a Red passport.--I am Vivien Warren, just out of prison, and an"
"outlaw, more or less."""
"""'The outlaws of to-day are the in-laws of to-morrow,' as the"
English barrister said when he married the Boer general's daughter.
I have thought I recognized you. I have heard you speak at Lady
Maud's and also at Lady Feenix's Suffrage parties. My name is Hawk.
I suppose you've been in prison for some Suffrage offence? So has my
"aunt, for the matter of that."""
"_Vivie_: ""Yes, but in her case they only sentenced her to the First"
"Division; whereas _I_ have been doing nine months' hard."""
"_Hawk_: ""What was your crime?"""
"_Vivie_: ""I admit nothing, it is always wisest. But I was accused of"
"burning down Mr. ----'s racing stables--and other things..."""
"_Hawk_: ""_That_ beast. Well, I suppose it was very wrong. Can't"
"quite make up my mind about militancy, one way or the other. But"
"here we are up against the biggest war in history, and such"
"peccadilloes as yours sink into insignificance. By the bye, my aunt"
"was amnestied and so I suppose were you?"""
"_Vivie_: ""Yes, but not so handsomely. I was requested to go away"
"from England for a time, so here I am, about to join my mother in"
"Brussels--or in a little country place near Brussels."""
"_Hawk_: ""Well, I've been Secretary of Legation there. I'm just going"
"back to--to--well I'm just going back."""

The pair drifted away.
And there is something else I cannot finish doing: withdrawing into

last pleasure.
"One needs solitude and darkness, not because one flees the company of"

Shall I leave the forest behind me?
It was my home but yesterday;
now toward the city I wend my way;
to the darkness of night I've resigned me.
"The world round me sleeps as I tarry, alone,"
soothing my ear with its quiet.
How large and gray is the city of stone
in which the many all hopes enthrone!
"Shall I, too, accept their fiat?"
Hark! Do the bells ring on the hillside?
Back to the peace of the forest I turn
in the nightly hour that's hoarest.
There's a sweet-smelling hedgerow to which I yearn;
"I shall rest my head on heather and fern,"
and sleep in the depths of the forest.

"I must go, Dad."""
Winton nodded.
"""Well, I'll come too,"" he said.  ""The girl can go back in the cab and say"
"we're on the way."""
"Taking a parting look at her baby, Gyp thought bitterly: 'My fate? THIS"
"is my fate, and no getting out of it!'  On the journey, she and Winton"
were quite silent--but she held his hand tight.  While the cook was
"taking up to Rosek the news of their arrival, Gyp stood looking out at"
her garden.  Two days and six hours only since she had stood there above
"her pansies; since, at this very spot, Rosek had kissed her throat!"
"Slipping her hand through Winton's arm, she said:"
"""Dad, please don't make anything of that kiss.  He couldn't help himself,"
"I suppose.  What does it matter, too?"""
"A moment later Rosek entered.  Before she could speak, Winton was saying:"
"""Thank you for letting us know, sir.  But now that my daughter is here,"
"there will be no further need for your kind services.  Good-day!"""
"At the cruel curtness of those words, Gyp gave the tiniest start forward."
She had seen them go through Rosek's armour as a sword through brown
"paper.  He recovered himself with a sickly smile, bowed, and went out."
Winton followed--precisely as if he did not trust him with the hats in
"the hall.  When the outer door was shut, he said:"
"""I don't think he'll trouble you again."""
"Gyp's gratitude was qualified by a queer compassion.  After all, his"
"and peered in, shielding her candle with a trembling hand. For a long"
while she sat in the window straining her eyes into the darkness. The
cats came and rubbed her bare ankles and Nip meowed plaintively. She
picked him up and cuddled him to her.
Suddenly a moving object in the lane caught her attention. It separated
"itself into the forms of men, men moving slowly as though they bore a"
burden. They turned into the garden patch.
"""Lavender!"" Aunt Achsa cried, jumping up quickly, shaking. ""Oh--my boy!"""
But that was the only sound she made. She opened the door as though she
had been waiting for these men with their limp burden. She directed
them to carry the boy to his own room. She moved aside for Doctor
"Blackwell who had come with the others, an old pair of flannel trousers"
drawn over his night shirt. She felt Mr. Dugald put a restraining arm
"over her shoulders and nodded as though to say: ""I'm all right--just"
"look out for Lavender."""
One of the men coming back from Lavender's room offered an explanation.
"""Those young 'uns were on the _Arabella_ and it broke from its"
"moorin's. The boy swum ashore to give an alarm. Plucky, I say--don't"
"know how he did it."""
"""Those young ones--_who_?"" cried Dugald Allan."
"""Why, I cal'late that gal Sidney and I don't know who else--"""
"""Sidney went with Miss Vine!"" protested Achsa."
"But at that moment Miss Letty appeared in the door, as scantily clad as"
the doctor had been. From her window which faced Doctor Blackwell's

_A Terrifying Tale Of Horror In The Skies_
THE FLYING EYES
By J. Hunter Holly
Author of ENCOUNTER and THE GREEN PLANET
Linc Hosler was sitting in a packed football stadium when the Flying
Eyes appeared and cast their hypnotic power over half the crowd.
Thousands of people suddenly began marching zombie-like into the woods
where they vanished into a black pit.
Linc used every resource of the Space Research Lab and the National
"Guard to destroy the Eyes. But nothing could stop them, for they proved"
immune to bullets and bombs.
"In desperation, Linc captured an Eye and found a way to communicate with"
it through his mind. He learned that radiation was fuel for the
creatures' lives. And then they issued their terrible ultimatum: Explode
a series of atom bombs to supply them with radiation or they would turn
the world's population into mindless robots.
It gave the world two harrowing choices--self-destruction via fallout
from the bombs or annihilation via the sinister Flying Eyes....

"At the corner stood a drug store, brilliant with electric lights. When"

And when he had sealed this letter he wrote another:

I hear that you arrived in Paris with Horace yesterday. By the time
you get this letter I shall have left my house in the clouds. Last

"without means, except the sweating pay of mean industries on which"

dancing with life--not with a desire to cower in sweating-dens.
"She was drifting. I gave her all these things that I might, last"
night--and she is now asleep here.
"Come to her as soon as you get this, and let her feel that she is not"
alone. She will babble all her news to you--it will be better for her
than babbling it to me.

am not so sure. Is it an exception?

ALL LIFE IS ONE
"'I heard a voice that cried,"
"""Balder the Beautiful"
"Is dead, is dead,"""
And through the misty air
Passed like the mournful cry
Of sunward-sailing cranes.'
TEGNER'S _Drapa_.
"All romance has died out of our woods and hills in England, all our"
fairies are dead long ago. Knowledge so far has brought us only death.
Later on it will bring us a new life. It is even now showing us how this
"may be, and is bringing us face to face again with Nature, and teaching"
us to know and understand the life that there is about us. Science is
"telling us again what we knew long ago and forgot, that our life is not"
"apart from the life about us, but of it. Everything is akin to us, and"
"when we are more accustomed to this knowledge, when we have ceased to"
"Gratefully yours,"
Robert Ashburton.
"The young lady refolded the letter, and handed it to the boy."
"“De gent wants an answer,” said the messenger. “Wot’s de word?”"
"The lady’s eyes suddenly flashed on him, bright, smiling and wet."
"“Tell that guy on the other bench,” she said, with a happy, tremulous"
"laugh, “that his girl wants him.”"
THE FURNISHED ROOM
"Restless, shifting, fugacious as time itself is a certain vast bulk of"
the population of the red brick district of the lower West Side.
"Homeless, they have a hundred homes. They flit from furnished room to"
"furnished room, transients forever—transients in abode, transients in"
"heart and mind. They sing “Home, Sweet Home” in ragtime; they carry"
their _lares et penates_ in a bandbox; their vine is entwined about a
picture hat; a rubber plant is their fig tree.
"Hence the houses of this district, having had a thousand dwellers,"
"should have a thousand tales to tell, mostly dull ones, no doubt; but"
it would be strange if there could not be found a ghost or two in the
wake of all these vagrant guests.
Then he gave a great cry.
"""Ever, ever night!"" he said, stretching out his hands despairingly as"
to an eternal void.
The duke's eyes seemed to look leagues away over moor and valley and
"hill, where the blackened ruins of Astura rose beneath a dun smoke"
against the calm of the morning sky.
"A strange tenderness played upon his lips, as if with the extinction"
of the Frangipani brood peace had entered his soul.
"""A man is a mystery to himself,"" he said."
"""But to God?"""
"""I know no God, save the God, my own soul! Let me live and"
"die,--nothing more! Why curse one's life with a 'to be?'"""
Francesco sighed heavily.
"""It is a kind of Fate to me!"" he said, ""inevitable as the setting of"
"the sun, natural as sleep. Not for myself do I fear it alone,--but I"
"should not like to think that I should never see her again."""
"The duke's eyes had caught life on the distant hillside, life surging"
"from the valleys, life and the glory of it. Harness, helm and shield"
"shone in the sun. Gold, azure, silver, scarlet were creeping from the"
bronzed green of the wilds. Silent and solemn the host rolled slowly
into the full splendor of the day.
The duke's face had kindled.
"HE stands, a patient figure, where the crowd"
Heaves to and fro beside him. In his ears
"All day the Fair goes thundering, and he hears"
"In darkness, as a dead man in his shroud."
"Patient he stands, with age and sorrow bowed,"
And holds a piteous hat of ancient yean;
And in his face and gesture there appears
The desperate humbleness of poor men proud.
"What thoughts are his, as, with the inward sight,"
He sees those mirthful faces pass him by?
Is the long darkness darker for that light.
The misery deeper when that joy is nigh?
"Patient, alone, he stands from morn to night,"
Pleading in his reproachful misery.
THE OLD LABOURER.
"HIS fourscore years have bent a back of oak,"
His earth-brown cheeks are full of hollow pits;
His gnarled hands wander idly as he sits
Bending above the hearthstone’s feeble smoke.
Threescore and ten slow years he tilled the land;
He wrung his bread from out the stubborn soil;
He saw his masters flourish through his toil;
He held their substance in his horny hand.
“He’s after us now all right!” whispered Jimmie.
"“Keep still, you little dunce!” Ned said."
"“If he sticks his head up here, soak him!” advised Jimmie."
"“Don’t you think I won’t,” Ned returned."
But Huga did not enter the huge old fireplace at all. When he flashed
"his light into the chimney he saw only straight up, and the vertical"
passage from the fire-flue was too small for even a small cat to
negotiate.
The chamber into which the boys had found their way was directly at the
"back of the flue, and might have been seen by a more careful man. The"
boys chuckled as the half-breed turned away.
In a few minutes the sounds of pursuit ceased entirely. Lights no longer
"flashed about the room, creating a faint mist in the fireplace below."
Still the boys were not certain that the outlaws had abandoned the hunt.
"“Say, Ned,” Jimmie whispered, directly, poking Ned in the ribs, “you"
"didn’t bring one of those bear steaks with you, did you?”"
"“Why, Jimmie,” Ned said in pretended amazement, “you’re not getting"
"hungry, are you? I’m astonished at that!”"
“Hungry!” repeated the boy. “I feel as if I could eat my way through
this rock like a mouse eats through cheese! And I could drink a barrel
of water. There never was such a thirst.”
"""When do you propose to make the start, Colonel?"" Nicholson asked."
"""Within an hour. The night favors us. The women must be kept in the"
center as much as possible. I have given Geoffries special charge over
them. They will be told at the last moment. There is no use in
"spoiling what little rest they have had."" He drew out a pencil and"
"began to scribble a despatch on the back of an old letter. ""I advise"
"you gentlemen to do likewise,"" he said. ""Very often a piece of paper"
"gets through where a man can not, and it is our bounden duty to supply"
"the morning periodicals with as much news as possible."""
For some minutes there was no sound save that of the pencils scrawling
the last messages of men with the seal of death already stamped upon
"their foreheads. All three had forgotten Travers, and yet from the"
moment they had begun to speak he had been awake and listening. He sat
"up now, leaning upon his elbow."
"""Nicholson!"" he said faintly."
Nicholson turned and came to his side.
"""Hullo!"" he said. ""Awake, are you? How are you?"""
Travers made no immediate answer; he took Nicholson's hand in a
feverish clasp and drew him nearer.
"""I am in great pain,"" he said. ""You don't need to pretend. I know. The"
fear of death has been on me all day. Just now I am not afraid. Is
"there no hope?"""
"""You mean--for us? None."""
world.
Before the flotilla regained Dover Harbour the remaining seaplanes
came in sight. Unfortunately their efforts at pursuit were futile.
The Zeppelin developing a turn of speed far in excess of which she
"had been credited by her detractors, had shaken off the British"
"aircraft, and when last seen she was high over the Belgian coast."
"Nevertheless, her wings had been clipped, although she survived to"
tell the tale that the hated English were still able vigorously and
successfully to dispute the mastery of the air.
CHAPTER XXIX.
"""LIEUTENANT AUBYN, R.N., D.S.O."""
"ON the evening following the return of the ""Sunderland"" to Dover,"
Terence obtained leave to go ashore in order to visit a
"brother-officer who, owing to his ship being under repairs, was"
temporarily installed in the Lord Warden Hotel.
Aubyn was proceeding along the Admiralty Pier when his progress was
"barred by a tall, bronzed young fellow in the uniform of a"
flight-lieutenant of the Naval Air Service.
"""Hullo, Aubyn, old man!"" exclaimed the latter cordially, as he"
"extended his hand. ""Forgotten me already?"""
For an instant Brand was dumbfounded. For here was language he could
understand--which was incredible on this far-flung globe. Then he
suddenly comprehended why her sentences were so intelligible.
She was versed in mental telepathy. And versed to a high degree! He'd
had some experience with telepathy on Venus; but theirs was a crude
thought-speech compared to the fluency possessed by the beautiful girl
before him.
"""Who are you?"" he asked wonderingly."
"""I am Greca""--it was very hard to grasp names or abstract terms--""of"
"the fourth satellite."""
"""Then you are not of these monsters of Jupiter?"""
"""Oh, no! I am their captive, as are all my people. We are but slaves"
"of the tall ones."""
"Brand glanced at Dex. ""Here's a chance to get some information,"
"perhaps,"" he murmured."
Dex nodded; but meanwhile the girl had caught his thought. She
"smiled--a tragic, wistful smile."
"""I shall be happy to tell you anything in my power to tell,"" she"
"informed him. ""But you must be quick. I can only remain with you a"
"little while."""
She sat down on the floor with them--the few bench-like things
obviously used by the tall creatures as chairs were too high for
"""What's the use of crossing bridges,"" Tommy grinned. ""If he won't"
"persuade, then sit on his head--anything, I don't care! The main thing"
"is--keep him!"""
CHAPTER III
THE GIRL IN THE CAFÉ
"Next morning began the conversion, or rather the persuasion, of Monsieur"
Dragot to remain a while longer with the _Whim_. Pete started off with
another triumphant breakfast and before our guest had gone far with it
his face was agleam with pleasure. Tommy and I put ourselves out to be
"agreeable, telling him jokes that sometimes registered but frequently"
"did not. Yet we were on most affable terms when, stuffed to repletion,"
we leaned back and lighted cigarettes.
"""Professor,"" Tommy suggested, ""I think if you stay with us you'll have a"
"better chance to find that child!"""
"Our guest beamed agreeably at the appelative, then looked toward me."
"""I'm sure of it,"" I said. ""We've nowhere to go but anywhere, and that"
"ought to fall in with your plans."""
"""_Pardieu_, you overwhelm me! You mean I may sail about with you,"
"searching?"""
"""Nothing simpler,"" I assured him. ""We've rather taken a fancy to you,"
"what's the use of jaw?  I say get up stores, eh, Mackenzie?"""
"""Don't ask me,"" said old Mac.  ""I was thinkin' that mighty soon we'd"
"be able to settle that question about the buildin' of the _Potluck_."""
And as by this time Jones was calming down and was rather inclined to
"cry, Lampert came up to the restive crowd."
"""You dry up, Hart,"" he said roughly.  ""Until the ship's broken up,"
"you're on the articles.  Say another word and I'll break your jaw."""
"""Yes, sir,"" said Hart respectfully."
"Until dawn they loafed about the deck and in the cabin and foc'sle,"
"discussing whether they were on one of the Crozets or what, and"
"whether they would stay long there, and if so what, and so on."
And just as the dawn broke over the island they got an awful
surprise.  They saw a man standing on the low cliff on about a level
with the jagged splinters of the fore-topmast where it had gone short
in the cap.
"""The bloomin' hisland's in'abited,"" cried a foremast hand, and every"
one rushed forward to interview the gesticulating stranger.
"""Wod's the bloke say?"" asked the crowd.  ""Oh, say it again!""  And the"
stranger said it again.
But the crowd shook a unanimous head.

"where's Dutchy?"""
"instant death to the Spanish guards if they cried out, then cut the cables"
and sailed out of the bay. As soon as it was light the Spanish ship
"commenced a furious bombardment of Rackam's empty vessel, thinking he was"
still aboard her.
"In the summer of 1720 he took numbers of small vessels and fishing boats,"
"but nothing very rich, and was not above stealing the fishermen's nets and"
landing and taking cattle. In October Rackam was chased near Nigril Bay by
a Government sloop commanded by a Captain Barret. After a short fight
"Rackam surrendered, and was carried a prisoner to Port Royal."
"On November 16th Rackam and his crew were tried at St. Jago de la Vega,"
convicted and sentenced to death. Amongst the crew were two women dressed
"as men, Anne Bonny and Mary Read. The former was married, in pirate"
"fashion, to Rackam."
"On the morning of his execution Rackam was allowed, as a special favour,"
"to visit his Anne, but all the comfort he got from her was ""that she was"
"sorry to see him there, but if he had fought like a man, he need not have"
"been hanged like a Dog."""

Richards and his companions scandalized the towns-folk of Charleston by
their outrageous and swaggering conduct.
"RICHARDSON, JOHN."
"His father was a goldsmith at New York. John, tiring of the trade of"
"cooper, to which he was apprenticed, ran away to sea. For many years he"
served both in men-of-war and in merchant ships. Although an unmitigated
"blackguard, he did not commit piracy nor murder until some years later,"
"when, being at Ancona, he met a Captain Benjamin Hartley, who had come"
there with a loading of pilchards. Richardson was taken on board to serve
"as ship's carpenter, and sailed for Leghorn. With another sailor called"
"Coyle, Richardson concocted a mutiny, murdered the captain in the most"
"brutal manner, and was appointed mate in the pirate ship. As a pirate"
Richardson was beneath contempt. His life ended on the gallows at
"Execution Dock on January 25th, 1738."

The front matter is often put into type after the composition of
"the body has been completed, so that the number of pages is rarely"
"definitely determined at the beginning of the work. For this reason,"
publishers have favored the expedient of numbering the preliminary
"pages with roman folios, using the arabic folios for the text itself."
The front matter and the chapter pages running through the book
offer opportunities for embellishment and distinctive typographical
"treatment, and therefore should be kept in exact accord, whether"
elaborate decorations are used or the severest form of typographical
simplicity.

"'Then now go! Go out, do you hear?' she cried, stamping her foot with"
passion. 'I want nothing. Go!'
I turned and crept towards the door like a beaten hound. But I was not
"to go; when my hand was on the latch, her mood changed."
"'No, stay,' she said in a different tone. 'You may come back. After"
"all, Martin, I had rather it was you than any one else.'"
"She dried her tears as she spoke, standing up very straight and proud,"
and hiding nothing. I felt a pang as I looked at her. I had neglected
her of late. I had been thinking more of others.
"'It is nothing, Martin,' she said after a pause, and when she had"
quite composed her face. 'You need not be frightened. All women cry a
"little sometimes, as men swear,' she added, smiling."
"'You have been looking at that thing outside,' I said, grumbling."
"'Perhaps it did upset me,' she replied. 'But I think it was that I"
felt--a little lonely.'
"That sounded so strange a complaint on her lips, seeing that the echo"
"of the young sparks' laughter was barely dead in the room, that I"
"stared. But I took it, on second thoughts, to refer to Fraulein Max,"
"whom she had kept at a distance since our escape, never sitting down"
"with her, or speaking to her except on formal occasions; and I said"
bluntly--
"'You need a woman friend, my lady.'"
"Perhaps half an hour we waited, still puzzling over the scraps of"
paper. Suddenly I felt a nudge from Kennedy. Antoinette Moulton was
standing in the doorway across the street. Evidently she preferred not
"to ride in her own car, for a moment later she entered a taxicab."
"“Follow that black cab,” said Kennedy to our driver."
"Sure enough, it stopped in front of the Recherche Apartments and Mrs."
Moulton stepped out and almost ran in.
"We waited a moment, then Kennedy followed. The elevator that had taken"
her up had just returned to the ground floor.
"“The same floor again,” remarked Kennedy, jauntily stepping in and"
nodding familiarly to the elevator boy.
"Then he paused suddenly, looked at his watch, fixed his gaze"
"thoughtfully on me an instant, and exclaimed. “By George—no. I can’t go"
"up yet. I clean forgot that engagement at the hotel. One moment, son."
Let us out. We’ll be back again.”
"Considerably mystified, I followed him to the sidewalk."
"“You’re entitled to an explanation,” he laughed catching my bewildered"
look as he opened the cab door. “I didn’t want to go up now while she
"is there, but I wanted to get on good terms with that boy. We’ll wait"
"until she comes down, then go up.”"
“Where?” I asked.
“That’s what I am going through all this elaborate preparation to find
"""What silly talk is this, young know-it-all! We have no wives?"" said the"
"captain. ""Or do you happen to have done away with them?"" asked the"
quartermasters.
"""No, all of us together did away with them,"" answered the boy, and told"
them what he had heard and seen that Sunday afternoon when he was on
"watch on the ship; while the crew was ashore, and the captain was buying"
his deckload of wood.
And when they sailed home they learned that their wives had disappeared
"the day of the storm, and that since that time no one had seen or heard"
anything more of them.
NOTE
"A weird tale of the sea and of witches is that of ""Storm Magic"""
"(Asbjörnsen, _Huldreeventyr_, I, p. 248. From the vicinity of"
"Christiania, told by a sailor, Rasmus Olsen). In the ""Fritjof"
"Legend"" the hero has a similar adventure at sea with two witches,"
who call up a tremendous storm. It would be interesting to know
"the inner context of the cabin-boy's counter magic, and why it is"
"that the birch-wood, cast into the sea billet by billet, had the"
power to destroy the witches.

THE FOUR-SHILLING PIECE

"Later in the forenoon Eilert returned home. He was alone, but he came up"
the path carrying one of the knapsacks--the larger one. He was in a
"furious temper, and kept saying they'd better not try it on him--no,"
they'd just better not.
Of course it was the bill again.
"""She'll probably have a good deal of this sort of trouble,"" I thought to"
"myself, ""but no doubt she'll get used to it, and take it as nonchalantly"
"as it should be taken. There are worse things."""
"But the fact remains that it was I that upset them, I that had driven them"
away without their clothes; perhaps they had really expected some money to
be sent here--who knows?
"I got hold of Eilert. How big was the bill? What, was that all? ""Good"
"heavens! Here you are, here's your money; now row across to them at once"
"with their clothes!"""
"But it all proved in vain, for the strangers had gone; they had arrived"
"just in time for the boat, and were aboard it at that very moment."
"Well, there was no help for it."
"""Here's their address,"" says Eilert. ""We can send the clothes next"
"Thursday; that's the next trip the boat goes south again."""
In the wind.
"""A passable enough rendering, if I may say, though I don't necessarily"
"accept your analogy."" He reached down and lifted a bottle of warmed"
"sake from beside the brazier. ""By the way, I know you prefer tequila,"
"one of your odd quirks, but there was no time to acquire any. Perhaps"
"this will suffice."""
"He set down two black _raku_ saucers and began to pour. ""Now, alas, we"
"must proceed."""
"Post time, Vance thought."
"""Dr. Michael Vance."" He lifted his saucer in a toast. ""A scholar of the"
"lost Aegean civilizations, a former operative of the Central"
"Intelligence Agency, and finally a private consultant affiliated with a"
group of mercenaries. I had your file updated when I first heard you
were involved. I see you have not been entirely idle since our last
"encounter."""
"""You haven't done too bad yourself."" Vance toasted him back. ""This new"
"project is a big step up from the old days. Has a lot of style."""
"""It does indeed,"" he nodded. ""I'm quite proud of our achievement here."""
"""You always thought big."" Vance sipped again at his sake, warm and"
soothing.
"""It's kind of you to have remembered."" Mino drank once more, then"
for himself.
"""Congratulations."""
"""Thank you."""
"""That ought to grease the way in the Diet for your deal. And the"
protocol's financial grab ought to sail through the Supreme Soviet. You
prove this marvel can work and the rest is merely laundering your
"profits."""
"""So I would like to think,"" he nodded. ""Of course, one never knows how"
"these things will eventually turn out."""
"""So when do I get a look at it?"""
"""Why, that all depends on certain agreements we need to make."""
"""Then I guess it's time I heard the bottom line."""
"""Most assuredly."" He leaned back. ""Dr. Vance, you have just caused me"
considerable hardship. Nor is this the first occasion you have done so.
"Yet, I have not achieved what I have to date without becoming something"
of a judge of men. The financial arrangements you put together in
"London demonstrated, I thought, remarkable ingenuity. There could be a"
"place for you in my organization, despite all that has happened between"
"us."""

"""Don't be foolhardy. Those days are well behind me,"" he went on calmly,"
"despite the flicker of anger in his eyes. ""The completion of this"
"“Father never talks his business over with any one,” Jack broke in."
"“If we had only known about the outlaws being here in the hills,” Harry"
"suggested, “we might have kept out of sight of them for a long time."
"But, you see, they found us first.”"
"“And they used a nice, crooked little spy to do it with!” Frank"
exclaimed. “This little alleged Boy Scout who stole our provisions last
"night, and crept into the woods to tell Jimmie and I to beat it, and"
"then brought a note to Ned to get him away from the camp, must be"
playing a leading part for the sneaks.”
“He’s doing all of that!” Jack agreed. “I don’t believe he’s a Boy Scout
at all. He’s just picked up a word or two and a sign.”
"“Perhaps we’ll run across him again,” Frank said. “If we do, I’ll find"
out whether he’s a Boy Scout or not!”
"“Well,” Jack exclaimed, springing to his feet, “are we going to sit here"
all day and let Jimmie do all the hunting? We ought to get out in the
mountains and help find Ned.”
"“Look here, boys!” Harry cried, “do you see anything to the east there"
that looks at all familiar?”
“Do you mean the smoke coming up over the tops of the trees?” asked
Frank. “I noticed that several minutes ago.”
"“Well, just keep your eye on it,” Harry advised, “and see if it brings"
anything to your mind.”
"“Sure it does!” shouted Frank, all excitement now. “There are two"
"adopt her now,” said Miss Lindon, with an illuminating flash of logic."
"“Quite so,” replied John."
There was a span of silence. John mechanically drew his pipe from his
"pocket, eyed it with longing, and replaced it. Miss Lindon took the aged"
black-and-tan terrier in her arms and whispered to it in baby language.
She was a million leagues from divining the object of her nephew's
visit. John looked at her despairingly. Had she not a single grain of
"common sense? At last he strode across the room, a Gulliver in a new"
"Lilliput, and sat down again by her side."
"“Look here, 'Aunt Gladys,” he said desperately, “if I adopt a young"
"woman of sixteen, I must have another woman in the house--a lady, one"
of my own family. I could n't have people saying horrid things about her
and me.”
Miss Lindon assented to the proposition. John was far too young and
"good-looking (“Oh, Lord!” cried John)--yes, he was--to pose as the"
"father of a pretty, grown-up young woman."
"“The poor child is n't pretty,” said he."
"“It does n't matter,” replied Miss Lindon. “Beauty is only skin deep,"
and I 've known plain people who are quite fascinating. There was
Captain Brownlow's wife--do you remember the Brownlows? Your poor mother
was so fond of them--”
"“Yes, yes,” said John, impatiently. “He had wet hands, and used to mess"
"my face about when I was a kid. I hated it. The question is, however,"
whom am I going to get to help me with Unity Blake?”

"at Brand something that looked rather like an elongated, old-fashioned"
flashlight. Brand involuntarily ducked. The clear glass panel between
them and the mob outside gave him a queasy feeling of being exposed to
whatever missile might lurk in the thing's tube.
"""What do we do now?"" demanded Dex with a shaky laugh. ""You're chief of"
"this expedition. I'm waiting for orders."""
"""We wait right here,"" replied Brand. ""We're safe in the shell till"
"we're starved out. At least they can't get in to attack us."""
"But it developed that, while the slimy looking things might not be"
"able to get in, they had ways of reaching the Earthmen just the same!"
*       *       *       *       *
The creature with the gun-like tube extended it somewhat further
toward Brand.
"Brand felt a sharp, unpleasant tingle shoot through his body, as"
"though he had received an electric shock. He winced, and cried out at"
the sudden pain of it.
"""What's the matter--"" Dex began. But hardly had the words left his"
"mouth when he, too, felt the shock. A couple of good, hearty Earth"
oaths exploded from his lips.
The character of his relations towards them was confirmed by the
"appearance of his clothes, which, as a rule, were tidy, and cleaner"
"than those of his companions.  And now, sitting at the door of the"
"dosshouse, he boastingly related that for a long time past Redka had"
"been asking him to go and live with her, but he had not gone because he"
did not want to part with the company.  They heard this with jealous
"interest.  They all knew Redka.  She lived very near the town, almost"
"below the mountain.  Not long ago, she had been in prison for theft."
"She was a retired nurse; a tall, stout peasant woman, with a face"
"marked by smallpox, but with very pretty, though always drunken, eyes."
"""Just look at the old devil!"" swore Abyedok, looking at Simtsoff, who"
was smiling in a self-satisfied way.
"""And do you know why they love me?  Because I know how to cheer up"
"their souls."""
"""Do you?"" inquired Kuvalda."
"""And I can make them pity me....  And a woman, when she pities!  Go and"
"weep to her, and ask her to kill you ... she will pity you--and she"
"will kill you."""
"""I feel inclined to commit a murder,"" declared Martyanoff, laughing his"
dull laugh.
"""Upon whom?"" asked Abyedok, edging away from him."
"""It's all the same to me ... Petunikoff ... Egorka ... or even you!"""
"""And why?"" inquired Kuvalda."
"and Lady Eynesford, and all the rest, but what do I care if I have you"
"and him?"""
"""Me and him, Daisy?"""
"""Yes,"" she answered, smiling boldly. ""He's asked me to marry him--just"
"to show he didn't mind--and I think I will, father. We three against the"
"world! What need we care? Father, we'll beat Sir Robert!"" and she seized"
his two hands and laughed.
In vain Medland tried to tell her what he had come to say. Mighty as his
"relief and joy were, he still felt a burden lay on him. She would not"
hear.
"""Don't you see I'm happy?"" she cried. ""It can't be your duty to make me"
"unhappy. Jack doesn't mind, I don't mind!"" Her voice sank a little and"
"she added, ""It can't hurt mother now. Oh, don't be unhappy about it,"
"dear--don't, don't!"""
"They were standing now, and his arm was about her. Looking up at him,"
"she went on,"
"""They shan't beat us! They shan't say they beat us. We three, father!"""
He stooped and kissed her. There is love that lies beyond the realm of
"giving or taking, of harm or good, of wrong, or even of forgiveness."
"With all his faults, this love he had won from his daughter, and it"
"stood him in stead that night. He drew himself up to his height, and the"
air of despondency fell from him. The girl's brave love braced him to
meet the world again.
"""No, by Jove, we're not beat yet, Daisy!"" he said, and she kissed him"
"""But there's jest one thing you've overlooked explainin', Mr. Johnson."
It shows exactly what you are. It wasn't so much your bein' a road agent
"I got against you. It's this:"" And here she stamped her foot excitedly."
"""You kissed me--you got my first kiss."""
Johnson hung his head.
"""You said,"" kept on the Girl, hotly, ""you'd ben thinkin' o' me ever"
"since you saw me at Monterey, an' all the time you walked straight off"
"an' ben kissin' that other woman."" She shrugged her shoulder and laughed"
"grimly. ""You've got a girl,"" she continued, growing more and more"
"indignant. ""It's that I've got against you. It's my first kiss I've got"
against you. It's that Nina Micheltoreña that I can't forgive. So now
"you can git--git!"" And with these words she unbolted the door and"
concluded tensely:
"""If they kill you I don't care. Do you hear, I don't care . . ."""
At those bitter words spoken by lips which failed so utterly to hide
"their misery, the Girl's face became colourless."
"With the instinct of a brave man to sell his life as dearly as possible,"
"Johnson took a couple of guns from his pocket; but the next moment, as"
if coming to the conclusion that death without the Girl would be
"preferable, he put them back, saying:"
"""You're right, Girl."""
The next instant he had passed out of the door which she held wide open
for him.
"“No, French.”"
"“Ah, then, you needn’t be surprised. A Frenchman has no obligation to"
understand anything that’s not French.”
“Nevertheless he was an intelligent man.”
“Did he perhaps have a good deal of veneration?”
"“No, he boasted of not having any.”"
“Doubtless he did have without suspecting it. With a man who had no
"veneration, what difference would it make whether there was one bad"
thing among a lot of good ones?”
"The German with the green hat, who understood something of the"
"conversation, was indignant at Cæsar’s irreverent ideas. He asked him"
"if he understood Latin, and Cæsar told him no, and then, in a strange"
"gibberish, half Latin and half Italian, he let loose a series of facts,"
"dates, and numbers. Then he asserted that all artistic things of great"
"merit were German: Greece. Rome, Gothic architecture, the Italian"
"Renaissance, Leonardo da Vinci, Velázquez, all German."
"The snub-nosed young person, with his cape and his green hat with its"
"cock-feather, did not let a mouse escape from his German mouse-trap."
"The data of the befeathered German were too much for Cæsar, and he took"
his leave of the painters.
"""I well remember it,"" he went on.  ""I quite recollect how, on one"
"occasion, you came over to London, and while dining together at Jimmy's"
"you told me of your infatuation, and showed me her photograph.  Do you"
"remember the night when you told me of your engagement to her?"""
"""Perfectly."""
"""And as time went on you suddenly dropped her--for what reason I know"
"not.  We are pals, but I have never attempted to pry into your affairs."
"If she really loved you, it must have been a hard blow for her when she"
"heard that you had forsaken her for Edith Austin."""
"""You reproach me,"" I said.  ""But you do not know the whole truth, my"
"dear fellow.  I discovered that Yolande possessed a second lover."""
"He nodded slowly, with pursed lips."
"""And that was the reason of your parting?"""
"""Yes."""
"""The sole reason?"""
"""The sole reason."""
"""And you have no suspicion that she may have committed suicide because"
"of her love for you?  Such things are not uncommon, remember, with girls"
"of a certain temperament."""
"""If she has committed suicide, it is not on my account,"" I responded in"
a hard voice.
"""I do not interfere in the councils of the Gitano,"" she cried; ""I am"
"old, but not old enough to desire death!"""
"But more grim and lack-lustre than ever, the face of Sergeant Cardono"
"was turned upon her, and more starrily twinkled the sloe-like eyes"
"(diamonds set in Cordovan leather) as he replied:--""The councils of the"
"Rom are as an open book to me. If they are life, they are life because I"
"will it; if death, then I will the death!"""
The old gipsy stared incredulously.
"""Long have I lived,"" she said, staring hard at the sergeant, ""much have"
"I seen, both of gipsy and Gorgio; but never have I seen or heard of the"
"man who could both make that boast, and make it good!"""
She appeared to consider a moment.
"""Save one,"" she added, ""and he is dead!"""
"""How did he die?"" said the Sergeant, his tanned visage like a mask, but"
never removing his eyes from her face.
"""By the _garrote_"" she answered, in a hushed whisper. ""I saw him die."""
"""Where?"""
"""In the great _plaza_ of Salamanca,"" she said, her eyes fixed in a stare"
"of regretful remembrance. ""It was filled from side to side, and the"
"balconies were peopled as for a bull-fight. Ah, he was a man!"""

"She rushed from the room and down the stairs, in terrible anxiety lest"
"he should have already left the hotel. To her intense relief, she saw"
him sitting in one of the cane chairs in the vestibule smoking his
after-lunch cigar. He threw it away as he caught sight of her at the
"head of the stairs, breathless, and holding the balusters, and went up"
to meet her.
"“My poor child,” said he in an anxious tone. “What is the matter?”"
"“Oh, Everard--I don’t want any more to be left alone. Don’t think me"

“And Madrid?”

“And in Rome what do you find?”
"“Here one finds a mixture of pornography, romanticism, and politics."
"A heart pierced by an arrow and poetic phrases, alternate with some"

“Well done!” said Kennedy; “I can see that the branch of epigraphy you
practise amounts to something. It should be systematized and given a
name.”
“What do you think we should name it? Wallography?”
“Very good.”
“And one of these fine days we can systematize it. Now we might go and

Acquitted                                 74
Executed                                  52

"A number of the prisoners signed a ""humble petition"" begging that, as"
"they, being ""unhappily and unwisely drawn into that wretched and"
"detestable Crime of Piracy,"" they might be permitted to serve in the Royal"
"African Company in the country for seven years, in remission of their"
"crimes. This clemency was granted to twenty of the prisoners, of which"
Scot was one.
“Do you go in for modern epigraphy?” asked Kennedy.
"“Yes. It is one of the things I take pleasure in reading, in the towns"
I go to; the advertisements in the newspapers and the writings on the
wall.”
“It’s a good kind of curiosity.”
"“Yes, I believe one learns more about the real life in a town from such"
inscriptions than from the guide- and text-books.”
“That’s possible. And what conclusions have you drawn from your
observations?”
“They are not of much value. I haven’t constructed a science of
"wall-inscriptions, as that fake Lambroso would have done.”"
"“But you will construct it surely, when you have lighted on the"
underlying system.”
“You think my epigraphical science is on the same level as my financial
science. What a mistake!”
“All right. But tell me what you have discovered about different towns.”
"“London, for instance, I have found, is childish in its inscriptions and"
somewhat clownish. When some sentimental foolishness doesn’t occur to a
"Londoner of the people, some brutality or rough joke occurs to him.”"
"“You are very kind,” said Kennedy, laughing."
"“Paris has a vulgar, cruel taste; in the Frenchman of the people you"
Pangbutt’s handsome studio had been cleared for a reception; and the
"deliberate old butler, throwing open the great folding-doors, walked"
stiffly into the room and glanced an orderly eye round the brilliantly
lighted details in a last complacent survey before the near arrival of
the guests.
"He started at a loud peal of the door-bell, and pulled out his watch:"
“I hope they are arriving early enough!” said he. “It comes of arsking
these here artists to the house.... They’re always hungry and they’re
"always noisy, and they’re always thirsty. Even if I suffered from these"
here afflictions I’d have the manners not to show it.” He shrugged his
shoulders. “I call it letting ourselves down. They don’t even know how
to put on their clothes like Christians.”
"He straddled stiffly out of the room, grumbling and mumbling."
"“Leastwise not like Christians of the Established Church,” he"
growled....
He returned after awhile through the great hollow of the handsome
"doorway, ushering in four guests."
"When they had entered, he said stiffly:"
"“Mr. Pangbutt, I fear, will not be down for several minutes, gentlemen;"
he has only just come in to dress.”
"He drew out his watch from his pocket, and glanced at it aggressively."
"“How long since you left the camp?” Ned asked, after Jimmie had"
introduced the two.
"“Perhaps half an hour ago,” was the answer. “When I went to sleep, the"
"boys were sitting by the fire, but when I woke there was no one in"
sight. I came out to look for them.”
“I understand you came on a mission for Jack Bosworth’s father?” asked
Ned after a pause.
"“Yes,” was the reply, “at the request of my employer I came on this most"
dangerous mission. I shall be glad to see New York again.”
Ned hesitated a moment and then asked:
“Did Mr. Bosworth ever say anything to you about a set of documents he
wished us to bring to light?”
"“He did not,” was the answer."
"“His purpose in sending you, then, was to secure, by means of our help,"
proof connecting a corporation he is fighting with unlawful acts which
have been or may be committed in this section?”
“That is exactly the idea!” answered Gilroy.
"“Come on,” Jimmie shouted, “let’s get back to camp. I begin to feel"
hungry already. Perhaps the boys have returned.”
Before Gilroy would move out of the forest he insisted on pinning up
certain rents in his clothing and combing out his mussed up hair with
"his fingers. There were also numerous scratches on his face, caused by"
"""Yolande--Yolande!""  I called, touching her cheek in an effort to awaken"
"her, for I could not believe that she was actually dead."
But there was no response.  Those blanched lips and the coldness of
those cheeks told their own tale.  She had passed to that land which
lies beyond the range of human vision.
How long I stood there I cannot tell.  My thoughts were inexpressibly
"sad ones, and the discovery had utterly upset me, so that I scarcely"
knew what I said or did.  The blow of thus finding her lifeless crushed
"me.  The affair was mysterious, to say the least of it.  Of a sudden,"
"however, the sobs of the grief-stricken Countess aroused me to a sense"
"of my responsibility, and taking her hand I led her from the bedside"
into an adjoining room.
"""How has this terrible catastrophe occurred?""  I demanded of her"
"breathlessly.  ""Only two hours ago she was well and happy."""
"""You mean when you saw her?"" she said.  ""What was the object of your"
"call?"""
"""To see her,"" I responded."
"""And yet you parted ill friends in Brussels?"" she observed in a tone of"
"distinct suspicion.  ""You had some motive in calling.  What was it?"""
I hesitated.  I could not tell her that I suspected her daughter to be a
spy.
"""In order to assure her of my continued good friendship."""
"While walking from the Bridge to the Old Swan, I remarked to Frances, ""My"
"engagement with Mary Hamilton is likely to be broken by her family."""
"""Why, Baron Ned?"" she asked in surprise."
"""Count Hamilton has challenged me to a duel, to be fought when he"
"returns, and you see, if I kill him or if he kills me, well--"" I"
"answered, shrugging my shoulders."
"She was much alarmed at my disclosure, but was reassured when I made"
"light of the affair, probably because there was no danger in it to George"
"Hamilton, and, perhaps, because if I should kill Count Hamilton, George"
would inherit the title and estates.
"""But poor Mary! She will grieve,"" said Frances."
"""I think you need waste no tears for her sake,"" I answered. ""She is a"
"fine, pretty little creature, who will take what comes her way without"
excess of pain or joy. She is incapable of feeling keenly. God has been
"good to her in giving her numbness."""
"""No, no, cousin Ned, you are wrong!"" she returned. ""Life without pain"
"is not worth living. I have heard that the Arabs have a saying, 'All"
sunshine makes the desert.' God is good to us when he darkens the sun
"now and then and gives us the sunshine afterwards."""
"""Perhaps you are right, Frances,"" I returned. ""But you and I are in the"
"cloud now, and a little sunshine would be most welcome."""
"""Not enough sunshine to make a desert,"" she answered."

"""Say, Girl, was your answer final to-night about marrying me?"""
Without turning round the Girl answered coyly:
"""I might think it over, Jack."""
"Instantly the man's passion was aroused. He strode over to her, put his"
arms around her and kissed her forcibly.
"""I love you, I love you, Minnie!"" he cried passionately."
"In the struggle that followed, the Girl's eyes fell on the bottle on the"
mantel. With a cry she seized it and raised it threateningly over her
"head. Another second, however, she sank down upon a chair and began to"
"sob, her face buried in her hands."
"Rance regarded her coldly; at last he gave vent to a mirthless laugh,"
the nasty laugh of a man whose vanity is hurt.
"""So, it's as bad as that,"" he sneered. ""I didn't quite realise it. I'm"
"much obliged to you. Good-night."" He snatched up his coat, hesitated,"
"then repeated a little less angrily than before: ""Good-night!"""
"But the Girl, with her face still hidden, made no answer. For a moment"
"he watched the crouching form, the quivering shoulders, then asked, with"
sudden and unwonted gentleness:
"""Can't you say good-night to me, Girl!"""
"Slowly the Girl rose to her feet and faced him, aversion and pity"
"struggling for mastery. Then, as she noted the spot where he was now"
"""I suppose so."""
"""And the way I phrased it. I actually said I'd bought the lower right"
"hand drawer and hadn't used it--take me with you, Frank."""
"""Rhoda, I was so wrong in--"""
"""_I_ was wrong, Frank. I was trying to mold you into my way of life. I"
"wanted you, but only as a part of my own eager little world. I had money"
"so I furnished my apartment. I put this here and that there, and hung a"
"toothbrush over the sink as necessarily functional, and then I decided I"
needed a man in the same way and so I picked you.
"""But I found out that the man in the bed was the most important part of"
it and without him there wasn't anything. Without him I didn't want any
of the other. Now ... I want to be a wife. A wife is a person who goes
where her husband goes and lives where he lives and shares what he has.
You don't barter and trade--this for that--give up this part to get
that. You give up everything and yet it isn't like that at all because
"you're really getting everything."""
He took out another cigarette.
"""Oh, Frank, it's all mixed up and I'm going to cry, I think."""
"""It's not mixed up at all,"" he said quietly. He turned to look at her,"
"half frowning, half smiling. ""Now why in the hell couldn't you have"
given me a little notice? Twenty minutes to plane time and I've got to
"get another reservation."""
"""I'm sorry, Frank."""
he speaks with La Giralda in a tongue which neither I nor Don Rollo
"understand."""
"""But I thought,"" said El Sarria, astonished for the first time, ""that"
both you and Don Rollo understood the crabbed gipsy tongue! Have I not
"heard you speak it together?"""
"""As it is commonly spoken--yes,"" she replied, ""we have talked many a"
time for sport. But this which is spoken by the Sergeant and La Giralda
"is deep Romany, the like of which not half a dozen in Spain understand."
"It is the old-world speech of the Rom, before it became contaminated by"
"the jargon of fairs and the slang of the travelling horse-clipper."""
"""Then,"" said El Sarria, slowly, ""it comes to this--'tis you and not I"
"who mistrust these two?"""
"""No, that I do not,"" cried Concha, emphatically; ""I have tried La"
"Giralda for many years and at all times found her faithful, so that her"
bread be well buttered and a draught of good wine placed alongside it.
"But the Sergeant is a strong man and a secret man----"""
"""Well worth the watching, then?"" said El Sarria, looking her full in the"
face.
Concha nodded.
"""Carlist or no, he works for his own hand,"" she said simply."
"""Shall ye mention the matter to Don Rollo?"" asked El Sarria."
"""Nay--what good?"" said Concha, quickly; ""Don Rollo is brave as a bull of"
"Jaen, but as rash. You and I will keep our eyes open and say nothing."
He has taken his staff for the Pilgrim's way.
"His sandals are girt on his tender feet,"
And he carries his scrip for what gifts he may.
"What will you give to him, Fate Divine?"
What for his scrip on the winding road?
"A crown for his head, or a laurel wreath?"
"A sword to wield, or is gold his load?"
What will you give him for weal or woe?
What for the journey through day and night?
"Give or withhold from him power and fame,"
But give to him love of the earth's delight.
Let him be lover of wind and sun
And of falling rain; and the friend of trees;
"With a singing heart for the pride of noon,"
And a tender heart for what twilight sees.
Let him be lover of you and yours--
"The Child and Mary; but also Pan,"
"And the sylvan gods of the woods and hills,"
And the god that is hid in his fellow-man.
"Love and a song and the joy of earth,"
These be the gifts for his scrip to keep
"Till, the journey ended, he stands at last"
"In the gathering dark, at the gate of sleep."
_Ethel Clifford._
And so our stories should contain all the essentials for the child's
"scrip on the road of life, providing the essentials and holding or"
take pleasure in restoring your rings.”
"She took from her handkerchief a beautiful little casket of blue onyx,"
"upon which reposed the Pendleton crest in diamonds, touched a spring,"
and revealed four rings sparkling about as many velvet cushions. The
four men stood speechless; not one dared protest his sincerity and see
ridicule in the eyes of his neighbour.
"Mrs. Pendleton dropped her judicial air, and taking the ruby between her"
"fingers, smiled like a teacher bestowing a prize."
"“Mr. Boswell,” she said, “I believe this belongs to you;” and she handed"
the ring to the stupefied author. He put it in his pocket with never a
word.
"She raised the emerald. “Mr. Trent, this is yours?—or is it the"
sapphire?”
"[Illustration: “‘WELL, WHY DON’T YOU GO?’”]"
"“The emerald,” snorted Trent."
"She dropped it in his nerveless palm with a gracious bend of the head,"
and turned to Teddy.
"“You gave me a solitaire, I remember,” she said sweetly. “A most"
"appropriate gift, for it is the ideal life.”"
"Teddy looked as if about to burst into tears, gave her one beseeching"
"glance, then took his ring and strode feebly over the cliffs. Trent and"
"Boswell hesitated a moment, then hurried after."
"has the time. Then one evening someone finds him reading under a lamppost,"
"stops suddenly and stares, takes a few steps toward him, and bends"
forward searchingly.
"""Isn't it--? Oh, no, excuse me, I thought--"""
"""Yes, it is. Good evening, Miss Torsen."""
"""Why, good evening. I thought it looked like you. Good evening. Yes, thank"
"you, very well. And thanks for the knapsack; I understood all at once--I"
"quite understand--"""
"""Do you live here? What a strange coincidence!"""
"""Yes, I live here; those are my windows. You wouldn't like to come up,"
"would you? No, perhaps you wouldn't."""
"""But I know where there are some benches down by the shore. Unless you're"
"cold?"" I suggested."
"""No, I'm not cold. Yes, thank you, I'd like to."""
"We went down to a bench, looking like a father and daughter out walking."
"There was nothing striking about us, and we sat the whole evening"
undisturbed. Later we sat undisturbed on other evenings all through a cold
autumn month.
"Then she told me first the short chapter of her journey home, some of it"
"only hinted, suggested, and some of it in full; sometimes with her head"
"deeply bowed, sometimes, when I asked a question, replying by a brief word"
or a shake of the head. I write it down from memory; it was important to
"her, and it became important for others as well."
"""Waynsford, by Jove!"" ejaculated Terence. ""Bless you, Dick, I never"
"expected to see you here and in this rig. What has happened?"""
"""Oh, I chucked the Motor Boat Reserve,"" declared Waynsford. ""It was a"
"bit too dull. They sent me to Southampton, and that was the limit. A"
"superannuated postman could have done my job, which was delivering"
letters to transports. So I applied for the Naval Air Service. It's
"more in my line."""
"""Been across yet?"" asked Terence, indicating the twenty odd mile"
strip of water that separated Great Britain from the scene of land
hostilities.
"""Dunkirk twice,"" replied Waynsford. ""Was there when the Germans"
started shelling the place. But we're off again early to-morrow
"morning."""
"""Yes, I heard,"" said Aubyn. ""Big operations. We are to engage the"
Zeebrugge and Ostend batteries while the Allied airmen play with the
"German lines of communication. So I may see something of you."""
"""I hope so--after the fun is over,"" replied the young airman. ""Well,"
I must be moving. Early hours and a good night's rest are essential
"to this sort of work."""
"The two friends parted, Terence making for the hotel, while Waynsford"
"walked off in the direction of the castle, in which the airmen"
detailed for the great raid were temporarily quartered.
Precisely at one hour before sunrise the first British waterplane
rose from the surface of Dover Harbour. Almost simultaneously an Army
"aeroplane ""kicked off"" from the sloping ground beyond the chalk"
"3° Edith CAVELL, directrice d'un institut médical à"
Bruxelles;
"4° Louis SEVERIN, pharmacien à Bruxelles;"
"5° Comtesse JEANNE DE BELLEVILLE, à Montignies."
À LA PEINE DE MORT
*       *       *       *       *
Vivie then went on to read with eyes that could hardly take in the
words a list of other names of men and women condemned to long terms
of hard labour for the same offence--assisting young Belgians to
"leave the Belgium that was under German occupation. And further,"
"the information that of the five condemned to death, _Philip Bauck_"
and _Edith Cavell_ had already been _executed_.
*       *       *       *       *
The monsters! Oh that von Bissing. How gladly she would die if she
might first have the pleasure of killing him! That pompous old man
"of seventy-one with the blotched face, who had issued orders that"
wherever he passed in his magnificent motor he was to be saluted
"with Eastern servility, who boasted of his ""tender heart,"" so that"
he issued placards about this time punishing severely all who split
the tongues of finches to make them sing better. Edith Cavell--she
did not pause to consider the fate of patriotic Belgian women--but
"Edith Cavell, directress of a nursing home in Brussels, known far"
"and wide for her goodness of heart. She had held aloof from Vivie,"
but was that to be wondered at when there was so much to make her
"suspect--living, seemingly, under the protection of a German"
"week...!"""
"""Das macht nichts. The rooms are wanted and I won't have you on the"
"premises. Off you go, or these soldiers shall take you both round to"
"the Kommandantur."""
"""But our luggage? _Surely_ you will let me go up to our room and"
"pack it--and take it away? We..."""
"""Your luggage has been packed and is in the corridor. If you send"
"round for it, it shall be delivered to your messenger. But you are"
"not to stop on the premises another minute. You understand?"" he"
almost shrieked.
"""But--"""
"For answer, the soldiers took them by the shoulders and whirled"
"them through the revolving door on to the pavement, where a crowd"
"began to collect, as it does in peace or war if you cough twice or"
"sneeze three times in Brussels. ""Englische Hure! Englische"
"Küpplerin,"" shouted the soldiers as they retreated and locked the"
revolving door. Mrs. Warren turned purple and swayed. Vivie caught
her round the waist with her strong arm.... Thus was Mrs. Warren
ejected from the once homely inn which she had converted by her
"energy, management and capital into the second most magnificent"
hostelry of Brussels; thus was Vivie expelled from the place of her
birth....
Hearing the shouting and seeing the crowd a Belgian gendarme came
"up. To him Vivie said, ""Si vous êtes Chrétien et pas Allemand--"""
"""Prenez garde, Madame,"" he said warningly--""Vous m'aiderez à porter"
"ma mère à quelqu' endroit ou elle peut se remettre..."""
"""It ain't,"" said the crew suspiciously."
"""And even if it's all right, we bein' strangers might be led into"
makin' a treaty without knowin' all there is to know.  I vote waitin'
"till the officers comes up."""
They squatted down on rocks and on the lumps of tussac grass till the
captain and the two mates came along with the rest of the Frenchmen.
"Hart communicated his suspicions to the skipper, who was decidedly"
under the influence of alcohol.
"""That's all right,"" said the Guffin thickly.  ""_We_ can manage"
Frenchmen.  They ain't goin' to make no French Shore question on no
more of our islands.  One Newfoundland's enough for me.  I'll show
"you n'gotiations--'gotiashuns is my forte!""  And he led the way over"
the hill.  Below them they saw the wreck of a French barquantine.
"""Blimy,"" said the crowd, with a frown, ""if they 'aven't got the best"
"part of our hisland!"""
"It was not to be endured by any lot of Englishmen under the sun, that"
"the best part of this rock should be occupied by their natural foes,"
and soon there was evidence that in any attempt to turn the Frenchmen
out the British leader would have a united nation at his back.
"The Guffin and the two mates argued it, and Lampert was the"
Opposition.
"""W'y, wot's this you're sayin'?"" asked the disgusted skipper; ""did I"
think to 'ave shipped a Verning 'Arcourt among my lot?  You're a
"Little Englander, and nothin' but it, Lampert."""
"trumpet brayed, though a host had scattered in search of a woman's"
face.
"On the seventh day, the trees drew back before Francesco where the"
shimmering waters of the Nera streaked the meads. Peace dwelled there
"and calm eternal, as of the Spirit that heals the throes of men. Rare"
and golden lay the dawn-light on the valleys. The songs of the birds
came glad and multitudinous as in the burgeoning dawn of a glorious
day.
Francesco had halted under a great oak. His head was bare in the
"sun-steeped shadows, his face was the face of one weary with long"
watching under the voiceless stars. Great dread possessed him. He
dared not question his own soul.
"A horn sounded in the woods, wild, clamorous and exultant. It was as"
"the voice of a prophet, clearing the despair of a godless world. Even"
"the trees stood listening. Far below, in the green shadows of the"
"valley, a horseman spurred his steed."
"Francesco's eyes were upon him. Yet he dared not hope, gripped by a"
great fear.
"""I am even as a child,"" he said."
The duke's lips quivered.
"""The dawn breaks,--the night is past. Tidings come to us. Let us ride"
"out!"""
Francesco seemed lost in thought. He bowed his head and looked long
into the valley.
"The Frenchmen ""jabbered"" a bit among themselves."
"""Quoi donc?  Marcher?"" asked their skipper."
"""We, old son,"" said Hart; ""marshay if you like.  Just pack up and"
quit.  We gives you an hour to gather up your dunnage.  Now do you
"understand?"""
Whether the Frenchmen understood or not it was tolerably obvious they
"did not like the tone with which Hart spoke, or the looks of evident"
disfavour he cast at them.  The captain turned away.
"""Stop!"" said Hart, and he went in for a dumb pantomime, in which he"
vaguely suggested that over yonder hill was an army of Englishmen.
"""And we mean 'avin' our rights,"" he ended with.  And just then old"
Jones appeared in sight.
"""Are they jossers goin' to evacuate or not?"" he bellowed.  ""What's"
their captain say to the _statues quo_?  Don't they know the first
thing about diplomatics?  Tell 'em that to prepare for peace we makes
"war."""
"""War it is,"" said Hart, and he launched himself at a crowd of"
"Frenchmen, as his mates came tumbling down the hill."
"The fight was short, sharp, and pretty decisive, for the _Potluck's_"
"crowd numbered ten able seamen, one ordinary seaman, and two boys, or"
"with the captain and the two mates, sixteen in all.  Against this"
"array there were twenty-one Frenchmen, and though Hart, in his first"
"onslaught, knocked down two, he was himself stretched out by a third"
armed with a broken hand-spike.  And Simcox fled with the infuriated
"Dawson came back after a few minutes, picked up another cigar from"
"Cary's box, and sat down. ""You see, I have a letter from him. I found"
"it in his quarters where I went straight from the _Malplaquet_."""
"""May we read it?"" I asked gently. ""I was greatly taken with Trehayne"
"myself. He was a clean, beautiful boy. He was an enemy officer on"
"Secret Service; there is no dishonour in that. If he were alive, I"
could shake his hand as the officer of the firing party shook the hand
"of Lody before he gave the last order."""
"Dawson took a paper from his pocket, and handed it to me. ""Read it"
"out,"" said he; ""I can't."""
CHAPTER VIII
TREHAYNE'S LETTER
I took the letter from Dawson and glanced through it. The first sheet
and the last had been written very recently--just before the boy had
left his quarters for the last time to go on board the _Malplaquet_;
the remainder had been set down at various times; and the whole had
"been connected up, put together, and paged after the completion of the"
"last sheet. Trehayne wrote a pretty hand, firm and clear, the writing"
of an artist who was also a trained engineer. There was no trace in
the script of nervousness or of hesitation. He had carried out his
"Orders, he saw clearly that the path which he had trod was leading him"
"to the end of his journey, but he made no complaint. He was a Latin,"
He opened a drawer of his desk and reached for the Scotch bottle.
*       *       *       *       *
At the Newark Airport he would not trust his suitcase to a porter
because the leather loop holding one side of the handle was very thin
and he was afraid it would break.
Once he had been ashamed of the shabbiness of the bag and had planned to
"buy a new one, but now there was an affinity between them, a kind of"
warmth.
Were they companions in misery?
He asked the question with a quick smile and then realized he was not
"miserable. A little bleak of mind, perhaps, with Minnesota and what lay"
ahead affording no glow of anticipation in his mind. But that would
"pass. No, he had relegated the hurt to a mental pigeonhole; maybe he"
"would bring it out and look at it once in a while, after enough time had"
passed.
But he was not miserable.
"He went to the counter, checked in, and they told him his plane would"
take off on time. He glanced at his watch. Thirty-two minutes.
He went back to the bench and found Rhoda Kane sitting beside his
suitcase.
"She wore a plain, black suit with a ridiculous little black hat and she"
was so beautiful he was angry with her. He hated her. This good-bye
wasn't necessary. Why had she come?
"""You need not assure me of that,"" I answered, taking Betty's hand. ""I"
"already know it. I am glad you--"""
"But here I was interrupted by a soft cry from Bettina, and by a"
"half-smothered scream from Frances, both of whom deserted me suddenly"
"and ran toward the door I had just entered. Turning, I saw Frances with"
"her arms about the Abbé's neck, and Bettina clasping one of his hands."
"I thought the two had gone mad, but when Bettina saw my look of surprise"
"and inquiry, she dropped his hand, came to me, and asked:--"
"""Did you want us to pretend that we did not know him? If so, you should"
"have told us."""
"""But you don't know him,"" I declared."
"""Perhaps I don't,"" she returned, laughing softly and shrugging her"
"shoulders, ""but evidently your cousin does. If not, she should take her"
"arms from around his neck."""
"""But she is mistaken,"" I insisted."
"""She seems to be convinced,"" answered Bettina, with a curious little"
"glance up to me, half laughing, half inquiring. Evidently she was"
doubtful whether I spoke in jest or in earnest.
"Frances still clung to the Abbé, her head resting on his shoulder, so I"
"started toward her, intending to correct her mistake. Bettina, seeing my"
"purpose, caught me by the arm, saying:--"
"""Don't you really know?"""
"The Abbé turned his face toward me, and when I caught a glimpse of his"
"hand to Craig, she added, “Mr. Kennedy, if there is anything I can do"
"to help you, I beg that you will call on me.”"
"“I shall not forget,” he answered, relinquishing the hand reluctantly."
"Then, as she thanked him, and turned again to her guest, he added in a"
"low tone to me, “A remarkable girl, Walter, a girl that can be depended"
on.”
We followed Miss Sears down the hall.
"“Who was that young man in the music room?” asked Kennedy, when we were"
out of earshot.
"“Duncan Baldwin,” she answered. “A friend and bosom companion of"
Reginald.”
"“He seems to think more of Betty than of her brother,” Craig remarked"
dryly.
"Miss Sears smiled. “Sometimes, we think they are secretly engaged,” she"
"returned. We had almost reached the door. “By the way,” she asked"
"anxiously, “do you think there are any precautions that I should take"
for Mrs. Blake—and the rest?”
"“Hardly,” answered Kennedy, after a moment’s consideration, “as long as"
"you have taken none in particular already. Still, I suppose it will do"
no harm to be as antiseptic as possible.”
"“I shall try,” she promised, her face showing that she considered the"
affair now in a much more serious light than she had before our visit.
"“And keep me informed of anything that turns up,” added Kennedy handing"
"carefully kept his eyes to this side and to that, as if examining the"
"flowers, but noted all the same that Fiorsen had receded from the window."
Rapid thought told him that the fellow would come back there to see if he
"were gone, and he placed himself before a rose-bush, where, at that"
"reappearance, he could make a sign of recognition.  Sure enough, he came;"
and Winton quietly raising his hand to the salute passed on through the
"drawing-room window.  He went quickly into the hall, listened a second,"
"and opened the dining-room door.  Fiorsen was pacing up and down, pale"
"and restless.  He came to a standstill and stared haggardly at Winton,"
who said:
"""How are you?  Gyp not in?"""
"""No."""
"Something in the sound of that ""No"" touched Winton with a vague--a very"
vague--compunction.  To be left by Gyp!  Then his heart hardened again.
"The fellow was a rotter--he was sure of it, had always been sure."
"""Baby looks well,"" he said."
Fiorsen turned and began to pace up and down again.
"""Where is Gyp?  I want her to come in.  I want her."""
Winton took out his watch.
"""It's not late.""  And suddenly he felt a great aversion for the part he"
"was playing.  To get the baby; to make Gyp safe--yes!  But, somehow, not"
this pretence that he knew nothing about it.  He turned on his heel and
walked out.  It imperilled everything; but he couldn't help it.  He could
not stay and go on prevaricating like this.  Had that woman got clear?
"girl's getting on. She's dependent upon her own labor."" As she spoke"
she spread out the sheet. A sketch dropped to the table.
Trude drew a long breath. She had not known how worried she was. She
wanted to laugh aloud now from sheer relief. Because she had to do
"something she took up the sketch with a murmured: ""May I?"""
"""Laura writes it's a little sketch she made in class. 'This will show"
you I am improving. It's from life. It will give you an idea of the
"delightful types we find around here, types that you will not find"
anywhere else. These are two little vagabonds whom you see almost
anytime on the beach or around the wharves--as wild and free and
"beautiful as the seagulls--'"""
Mrs. White looked up from the letter to take the sketch and exclaimed
aloud at Trude's face. It had gone deathly white.
"""My _dear_, what is it?"""
For a moment Trude could not answer. She was staring at the sketch as
though she could not take her eyes from it.
"""Read that again! These are types--you find these girls any time on the"
"wharves--wild--vagabonds! Oh, Aunt Edith that's--_that's_--_Sidney_!"""
"""Why, it _can't_ be, Trude. You said--"""
"Trude shook her head. ""I can't help what I said. It's Sidney. I--know."
The likeness is true--there can't be anyone else who looks like Sidney!
But she's barefooted--and--and so--_slovenly_--and--_her hair_! She's
"cut her beautiful hair!"""
"in it, to check up on the disappearance of the first. That ship, too,"
never came back. Almost with the second of its arrival at the edge of
the red area all radio communication with it was cut off. It was never
heard from again. Two weeks ago I sent Journeyman there. Now _he_ has
"been swallowed up in a mysterious silence."""
An exclamation burst from Brand's lips. Sub-Commander Journeyman!
"Senior officer under Stone, ablest man in the expeditionary forces,"
and Brand's oldest friend!
"Stone nodded comprehension of the stricken look on Brand's face. ""I"
"know how friendly you two were,"" he said soberly. ""That's why I chose"
"you to go and find out, if you can, what happened to him and the other"
"two ships."""
Brand's chin sank to rest on the stiff high collar of his uniform.
"""Journeyman!"" he mused. ""Why, he was like an older brother to me. And"
"now ... he's gone."""
*       *       *       *       *
There was silence in Commander Stone's sanctum for a time. Then Brand
raised his head.
"""Did you have any radio reports at all from any of the three ships"
"concerning the nature of the red spot?"" he inquired."
"""None that gave definite information,"" replied Stone. ""From each of"
the three ships we received reports right up to the instant when the
red area was approached. From each of the three came a vague
description of the peculiarity of the ground ahead of them: it seems
"Yes, they were all satisfied. The Lieutenant pronounced it ""blendend"""
(dazzling). They had not eaten so much and such good food for months and
"months. Oh it was good to be out of the fighting. Yes, their treatment"
was perfect--except for the thieving. Why were British soldiers allowed
"to steal the buttons, caps, rings, and watches belonging to their"
prisoners?
"A German private, a tall thin man with bushy eyebrows, who had not"
"spoken hitherto, said he didn't mind losing a few buttons--but to rob a"
"man of his marriage ring, that was very mean--eine Gemeinheit--his"
marriage ring had been taken from him: he would have lost anything
"rather than that, for it always reminded him of home."
The boy from East Prussia said he didn't care what they took from him as
long as they didn't take his life. He was safe now and nothing else
mattered. He spoke with a Polish accent.
I asked him what town he came from.
"""Allenstein."""
"""Did you see anything of the Russians in 1914?"""
"""Jawohl""--he had seen plenty of Russian troops. They behaved very well."
"""Die sind besser als die Deutschen--They're better than the Germans...."""
"But the theatre orderly interrupted us and asked us to ""send two or"
"three across."""
I went to the Prep. to see if there were any new arrivals. It was full
once again and the wounded were streaming into the station.
"I nodded ‘That will do’ to the twain, and dismissed them; and, they"
"being dismissed, I whistled long."
Naughty old gentleman!...
The next morning Pa did not return. Mid-day passed. Evening stole
on.... The dusk saw me descend at the doors of the address in St.
John’s Wood from mine hansom cab.
"I must preach the decencies; thus I, strengthening the intention as I"
rang.
"‘Sir Pompey Malahide is here,’ said I sternly to the smart maid that"
opened the door.
"‘Yes, sir,’ said she."
"‘I desire to see my father,’ said I, and marched boldly towards the"
furious racket that filled the room near at hand--the paternal roar
"distinctly discernible, bassoonlike as though he cried small coal."
I flung open the door--burst upon the riot----
On the floor lay the Byronic Bartholomew Doome with three children
"rolling over him--three, no less!--another in his arms--Sir Pompey"
"Malahide, my father, on all fours, pretending to be a she-bear, his"
"coat-tails over his head, shaking a footstool in his teeth, and"
growling like an ass in pain--and seated on the immaculate waistcoat of
the dark mysterious Bartholomew the most beautiful young woman I have
ever seen. The din infernal--and Pa the worst part of the din.
was lying.  As we entered she lifted her hand slowly to me in sign of
"recognition, and in an instant I was at her side."
"""Yolande!""  I cried, taking her hand, so different now that death had"
"been defeated by life.  ""Yolande! my darling,"" I burst forth"
"involuntarily, ""you have come back to me!"""
"A sweet, glad smile spread over her beautiful face, leaving an"
"expression of calm and perfect contentment, as in a low, uncertain"
"voice, as though of one speaking afar off, she asked:"
"""Gerald, is it actually you?"""
"""Yes,"" I said, ""of course it is.  These two gentlemen are doctors,"" I"
"added.  ""This is my old friend Deane; and the other is Doctor Trepard,"
"of whom I daresay you have heard."""
She nodded to them both in acknowledgment of their kind expressions;
then in a few low words inquired what had happened to her.  She seemed
in utter ignorance of it all.
"""You were found lying on the floor of the little salon soon after I"
"left, and they thought you were dead,"" I explained.  ""Cannot you tell us"
"how it occurred?"""
"A puzzled expression settled upon her face, as though she were trying to"
remember.
"""I recollect nothing,"" she declared."
"""But you surely remember how you were attacked?""  I urged."
"“Phoebe,” she said, when the angular and jilted maid appeared, “we are"
"going to keep house for my nephew, Mr. Risca, and a young lady whom"
he has adopted. Will you tell me one thing? Is the lady of the house
supposed to clean the gentlemen's pipes?”
"“My father is a non-smoker, as well as a teetotaler, miss,” replied"
Phoebe.
“Dear me!” murmured Miss Lindon. “It's going to be a great puzzle.”
CHAPTER VII
"IT was a puzzle to John as much as to the palpitating lady, and in the"

"their interview lost its way. Walter Herold's eyes, however, twinkled"
maliciously when he heard John's account at once rueful and pig-headed.
Then he grew serious.
“It will be comic opera all the time. It can't be done.”
"“It 's going to be done,” said John, obstinately. “There's nothing else"
"to do. If I were a rich man, I could work wonders with a scratch in my"
cheque-book. I could hire an unexceptionable colonel's or clergyman's
widow to do the business. But I'm not. How I'm going to get the house
"together, as it is, I don't know. Besides,” he added, turning with some"

searchlights of the forts that guard the Straits. They saw him stop
"suddenly, and raise his night-glasses; Boyd laid his hand on Cherry's"
arm. Presently the Captain crossed to them and said:
"""Yonder seems to be a launch making out. See? I wonder what's up."""
"Almost in their path a tiny light was violently agitated. ""By Jove!"
"They're signalling."""
"""You won't stop, will you?"" questioned Emerson."
"""I don't know, I am sure. I may have to."""
"The two boats were drawing together rapidly, and soon those on the"
bridge heard the faint but increasing patter of a gasoline exhaust.
"Carrying the same speed as _The Bedford Castle_, the launch shortly"
came within hailing distance. The cyclopean eye of the ship's
"searchlight blazed up, and the next instant, out from the gloom leaped"
"a little craft, on the deck of which a man stood waving a lantern. She"
"held steadfastly to her course, and a voice floated up to them:"
"""Ahoy! What ship?"""
"""_The Bedford Castle_, cannery-tender for Bristol Bay,"" Peasley shouted"
back.
"The man on the launch relinquished his lantern, and using both palms"
"for a funnel, cried, more clearly now: ""Heave to! We want to come"
"aboard."""

"lowest excepted, were three long, low windows of the common Nuremberg"
"type, and the whole had a substantial and reputable air."
"The window at which I had seen Marie was farthest from the door, on"
"the first floor. To go to the door I had to lose sight of it, and"
perhaps for that reason I stood the longer. At last I went and
"knocked, and waited in a fever for some one to come. The street was a"
thoroughfare. There were a number of people passing. I thought that
all the town would go by before a dragging foot at last sounded
"inside, and the great nail-studded door was opened on the chain. A"
"stout, red-faced woman showed herself in the aperture."
'What is it?' she asked.
"'You have a girl in this house, named Marie Wort,' I answered"
"breathlessly. 'I saw her a moment ago at the window. I know her, and I"
wish to speak to her.'
The woman's little eyes dwelt on me stolidly for a space. Then she
made as if she would shut the door. 'For shame!' she said spitefully.
'We have no girls here. Begone with you!'
But I put my foot against the door. 'Whose house is this?' I said.
"'Herr Krapp's,' she answered crustily."
'Is he at home?'
"'No, he is not,' she retorted; 'and if he were, we have no baggages"
of pure knowledge and Christian meekness in a near future speaks from
the preface of Erasmus's edition of the New Testament.
How clear did the future look in those years! In this period Erasmus
"repeatedly reverts to the glad motif of a golden age, which is on the"
point of dawning. Perennial peace is before the door. The highest
"princes of the world, Francis I of France, Charles, King of Spain, Henry"
"VIII of England, and the emperor Maximilian have ensured peace by the"
strongest ties. Uprightness and Christian piety will flourish together
with the revival of letters and the sciences. As at a given signal the
mightiest minds conspire to restore a high standard of culture. We may
"congratulate the age, it will be a golden one."
But Erasmus does not sound this note long. It is heard for the last time
in 1519; after which the dream of universal happiness about to dawn
gives place to the usual complaint about the badness of the times
everywhere.

CHAPTER XII
ERASMUS'S MIND
Thursday 2:34 P.M.
Vance recognized the sound immediately. It was the harp-like plucking
"of a Japanese _koto_, punctuated by the tinkling of a wind chime."
"Without opening his eyes, he reached out and touched a hard, textured"
"surface. It was, he realized, a straw mat, and from the firmness of the"
weave he knew it was _tatami_. Then he felt the soft cotton of the
padded mat beneath him and guessed he was lying on a futon. The air in
the room was faintly spiced with Mahayana Buddhist temple incense.
"I'm in Japan, he told himself. Or somebody wants me to think I am."
He opened his eyes and found himself looking at a rice-paper lamp on
"the floor next to his futon. Directly behind it, on the left, was a"
"_tokonoma _art alcove, built next to a set of sliding doors. A small,"
round _shoji_ window in the _tokonoma  _shed a mysterious glow on its
"hanging scroll, the painting an ink sketch of a Zen monk fording a"
shallow stream.
Then he noticed an insignia that had been painted on the sliding doors
"with a giant brush. He struggled to focus, and finally grasped that it"
"was the Minoan double ax, logo of the Daedalus Corporation."
Jesus!
"He lay a minute, nursing the ache in his head and trying to remember"
"what had happened. All he could recall was London, money, Eva . . ."
"the flagship and ask instructions. I'm feeling deucedly queer."""
"""Why, you're wounded!"" exclaimed the sub-lieutenant, noticing a dark"
and increasing patch upon Aubyn's coat.
"""Am I?"" asked Terence incredulously."
"Turning his head to ascertain the nature of his injury, of which"
"hitherto he was unconscious, his shoulder slipped along the curved"
steel wall. Garboard was only just in time to save him from
collapsing inertly upon the deck of the ship he had brought safely
out of action.
"""Congratulations, old man. You'll have to get your tailor to make"
"some alteration in your uniform."""
"""What do you mean?"" asked Terence."
Two months had elapsed since the day on which Lieutenant Aubyn had
received a dangerous wound in his right side in the fight off Ostend.
"He was sitting in the grounds of the Royal Naval Hospital at Chatham,"
having made a fairly rapid recovery.
"The officer who offered his congratulations was Oswestry, the"
"torpedo-lieutenant of the ""Sunderland,"" who was also a convalescent,"
having managed to intercept a flying fragment of metal during the
momentous engagement.
"""Torps"" flourished a newspaper with his left hand, for his right arm"

John Dennis showed human surprise as Frank Corson lunged at him. He had
"either been lax in using the controlling power he'd been given, or else"
Frank Corson had an exceptional resistance.
"Dennis released Rhoda, swayed drunkenly under Frank Corson's clumsy"
"football-type tackle, and swung his arm like a pivoting beam. The blow"
"was a lucky one. His fist smashed low on Corson's jaw, numbing the"
nerves of his neck on the left side.
"Corson went down and, as he lay helpless, Dennis kicked him twice--once"
"in the side and once, viciously effectively, in the head. Corson rolled"
over and lay still.
"Dennis looked down at him in a drunken daze. ""They will make an army and"
"bring it here."""
"Rhoda, standing in the center of an emotional maelstrom, watched the"
struggle from the prison of her own horror. At that moment she was
"physically, mentally and spiritually ill; a human being caught in the"
midst of forces beyond her knowledge and control.
"Dennis laid a heavy hand on her shoulder. ""I want to make love."""
"""No--no. Please--"""
The drunkenness ebbed slightly and his eyes emptied. They looked into
Rhoda's. She shivered. He took the neck of her brunch coat in his fist
and jerked downward. She had just come from the shower when she'd first
"opened the door for Frank Corson, and the vicious denuding gesture left"

"""Ours was a foolish infatuation,"" she answered with an effort.  ""It is"
"best that we should both of us forget."""
"""Forget!""  I cried.  ""But I can never forget you, Yolande.  You are my"
"love.  You are all the world to me."""
"Her eyes were grave, and I saw that tears stood in them."
"""No,"" she protested quietly; ""do not say that.  I cannot be any more to"
"you than other women whom you meet daily.  Besides, I know well that in"

"declared in a low, intense voice.  ""It is not just either to yourself or"

"""Why do you taunt me with that, Yolande?""  I asked reproachfully.  ""I do"
not love her.  I have never truly loved her.  I was lonely after you had
"gone out of my life, and she was amusing,--that was all."""
"""And now you find me equally amusing--eh?"" she remarked, with just a"
touch of bitter sarcasm.
"""Why should you be jealous of her?""  I asked.  ""You might just as well"
"be jealous of Sibyl, Lord Barmouth's daughter."""

"No,I did."

Someone has made a huge mistake.
James isn't dead.
He's been writing me letters from iraq.
It's a common name.
"The news said he was born in jackson,pennsylvania."
It's a small town.
That james finn has been dead three months.
He left for iraq three nths ago.
I saw him the morning he went away.
And I just got a letter from him last week.
He says he misses me and he's working a lot.
We'll need those.
"Okay,but I want them back."
It's his handwriting.
I recognize it.
They've been coming for months.
Now I want to know who that other woman is.
We're not here to talk about that.
"Is she saying that she's engad to jimmy,too?"
"'Cause if tt's true, he better hope he's dead,or else I'll kill him."
"James and I connecte on a deep,spiritual level."
Honey!
Where you going?
I have to help them.
"No, no no."
"The cops are gonna be here any second, and you're two strikes."
"Okay, you're right, you're right."
"They're gonna be here, I'm gonna buy them some time."
"Well, what about us?"
"Take the van, go down the street, wait for me there."
"No, that's not the plan."
"Fuck the plan, Blair, okay."
He's gonna kill them.
How could you?
I loved you!
Hey.
Hey you.
This is the police.
"All right, freeze."
Fuck face.
"We know you're up there, all right?"
"We want you to come out, and reach for the sky, or..."
I will shoot you in the face.
Oh shit.
Shit.
"Shit, shit."
Hey!
Police!
"Freeze, fuck face!"
Hands in the air.
Stop.
Reach for the sky or I will shoot you in the face.
"What do you know about me, boy?"
- Shut up!
"So, I'm killing all these girls..."
He's riding next to me wondering who's doing it.
We're investigating the crimes.
Me and my partner.
"You've been a very bad boy, fucking your new partner."
"Did you get fucked, honey?"
"Well, Tommy has made a career out of fucking his partners."
- Let the girl go.
- Shut up or I'll kill you.
"- Bye-bye, Tommy."
- Jimmy!
I like this game.
"Everybody dies, and they all die with Tommy's gun."
Now we've got us a game.
"- Say goodbye to her, Tommy."
"- Jimmy, don't do it!"
"- Jimmy, no!"
- Say goodbye to her.
Jimmy!
"Put the gun down, son."
Please.
Listen to Daddy.
- Put the gun down.
"- What fun would that be, Dad?"
"It's all over, son."
Put the gun down.
- It's just starting.
- Please!
I think Tommy has some questions for you.
Tommy?
Comments?
"Right, let's rest and consolidate."
That's what I want to hear all day.
Call you when I wake up.
Bye.
What are you up to?
Where are you going?
Dinner with Lisa.
What?
I'm a bit hungry too.
I can sleep after dinner.
"You won't go, we're eating at street stalls."
Bullshit!
Who says so?
"I go there often, let's go."
Really?
More beer!
Coming!
"No big deal, I eat this often."
Isn't it better at my home?
Why do this comrade like our HK street stalls?
Cos Lisa likes it.
Why didn't you tell me so?
Why you never ask?
Why do you always talk to me like this?
Bad temper.
Yes...
"I'm bad-tempered, lots of faults."
"But my plus point, likes the famous jockey, Silent Witness,"
I never give up.
Lisa...
Marry me?
He's said it.
"- Come on, open your eyes!"
- Snap out of it!
Get your morning paper!
Read all about it!
Paper!
Get your morning paper!

- Holy Toledo!
"- I took him, Gus!"
I'll say he took him!
That last right hurt me!
On the table!
"You missed a great bout, Gus!"
"Oh, you should've seen it, Gus!"
Stoker hit him with everything but the bucket!
- He was landing as often as the Marines!
- Boy!
- I'll take care of that!
- Stoker was sharper than eight razor blades!
- He got careless!
- After the third heat!
!
"I know the kid is a gone gosling, an amateur!"
"Somebody yelled, ""Yoo-hoo, Nelson, you dropped your glove!"""
"He sure did, and his duke was in it!"
- There!
- How's that eye?
It's a beaut!
I can't wait to see Nelson's hand!
- Where's Tiny and Red?
- They ain't been in here!
Huh ?
"Oh, yeah, whatever."
"I mean, sure, if you want to."
We could start with everyone you've ever punched in the face since moving to Newport.
First would be...
Luke at Holly's beach house.
"Yeah, and number two would be Luke."
Right.
At the diner.
"Yeah, and again at the mall."
What about Holly's dad at Cotillion ?
That was more of a tackle.
Which takes us back to Luke.
"Yeah, in T.J."
"Summer, do you really think Pancakes is in the attic ?"
"Like he pulled down the ladder, hopped up and-and then put it away ?"
Hmm.
"Well, we have checked everywhere else."
Light.
Be careful.
Oh... gross.
It's okay.
What is that ?
That's Uncle Alistair.
That's your uncle ?
Yeah.
No.
"It's, uh, my dad's skeleton from med school."
He called him Uncle Alistair.
I don't know why.
"God, well, I don't want to meet any of your other relatives, so let's just find Pancakes and go."
Okay.
- The driver probably ran out of coal.
- Probably forgot his ration book.
"Now remember, Billy, you've just to point him out to me."
"Don't you worry, sir."
I could recognise Faber in a stocking mask.
Blackout.
Pull your blinds down.
Thank you.
Blackout.
Pull your blinds down.
Blackout.
"Come on, give us a bit of room, pal."
Someone take him away.
Come on.
Blimey.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Be still or I'll kill you.
Why are you looking for me?
- I'm not.
- Don't lie.
"Has the army changed its uniforms, Billy?"
What's the plan?
Where's the trap?
Glasgow.
They're waiting for you at Glasgow.
"So they finally let you in the army, did they, Billy?"
Congratulations.
"Oh, my God!"
Thank you.
You've been terribly kind.
You won't change your mind and have a spot of lunch?
You might have split the bottom.
"We'll be back, my friends."
"For the time being, good-bye... and good-bye."
Look out!
"Well, they wanted gold."
Now they got it.
"Hey, Claire, get the medicine kit and some hot water."
Is he badly hurt?
Yeah.
He's got a nasty crack on the skull.
"Some prospector, I guess."
"Go away, Buck."
Get out of the way.
John!
John!
"Oh, John."
"John, darling.!"
"Claire, dearest..."
I'd like to talk to Mr. Thornton.
"All right, dear."
I thought I'd... lost you.
"Try to rest, please."
He's feeling much better this morning.
"He remembers everything, thank heaven."
It wasn't so serious as we thought.
"He wants to see you, Jack."
What are you going to say to him?
I wanted you... and I took you with us.
"Well, I'm keeping you."
Jack.
"You know I love you, don't you?"
"You couldn't doubt that, could you?"
Get over agin that wall!
And you're the guy that's been riding me to the nut house!
Stop him!
"Somebody, stop him!"
He's crazy!
Get him away!

We were supposed to meet up but Alex told me the wrong day.
"Bill, so you do exist."
I do.
And I'd love to buy you dinner sometime if you're still game.
Yes.
"Sure, why not?"
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
Hey.
"Coming, I'm coming, I'm coming."
Hi.
- Life changed.
It got...
- Boring?
It doesn't need to be.
Come on.
"Oh, my God..."
"You know Candace, in catering?"
- My first wife.
- I didn't know that.
Yeah.
Candy Kanaskie.
No wonder she left me.
Omelettes.
"Sure, a bachelor's standby."
"Oh, I'm married."
"Oh yeah, you said first wife."
I assumed that meant there was a second.
And third.
I was talking about me.
Omelettes are my standby.
Sausage?
Kielbasa!
"So what, after the lawyer who went gay, you figure, what, one then done?"
"Well, the job, the kids, it got hard to find a serious..."
- No cheese?
- No.
"No, no, no."
"So it's not a classic, then."
Kanaskie classic.
"Yeah, my exes, they blamed the job too."
"No kids, though, unless you count the ones I supervise here."
"It's a lot, but they just didn't understand what it takes."
Bye.
Hello?
I'm Max.
"Excuse me, I thought you were Cristina."
I got the wrong number.
Sorry.
Fermín?
I'm Max.
"Hey, don't you remember Cristina's number by any chance?"
What do you mean Cristina who?
"Well, some years went by but... you know Cristina."
"Yes, of course, that Cristina!"
All of a sudden I thought I could remember her number.
Yes that's right.
It's possible that she doesn't live there anymore.
"But, I don't know."
Nothing in particular.
I just... wanted to know how she was.
"Well, I'll find her anyways."
Thanks a lot Fermín.
Bye.
Can you put Father Urlieta on the phone please?
Thank you.
Father Urlieta?
I'm an old student from high school.
My name is Máximo Gascón.
They called me Max.
Yes...
I think you should remember.
You taught me religion for 4 years!
Of course it was a lot time ago... 30...
More than 30 years ago I think.
That was a long-ass leg.
Ain't know where the hell I was going with that.
"That's just a long-ass, Wendy Williams-sized leg."
Damn!
It was big--
You ain't been here the whole show?
"You talking about some, ""Damn."""
I've said some fucked-up shit.
"My God, man."
Jump on it.
That shit remind me of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air... when Will Smith and Carlton got in that--all right.
I love Fresh Prince.
That's my show.
"But y'all, I'll be honest with you."
Will Smith does not think I sound like him.
Nope.
"First time I met him, it was weird."
He was like...
"""Yo, Jay, I don't think you can sound like me."""
And I was like...
"""Yo, Will, stop playing."""
"He was like, ""Yeah, that's good."
"""Check it out."
Whoo!
"Miami."""
"He made some good music, man, you know?"
"No, but I was raised mostly on, like,"
Biggie Smalls and Tupac.
That's what I like listening to.
Biggie Smalls is just cool.
Just cool.
¶ First of all I Poppa.

"Hey, Sheriff."

- Sono sempre stati qui.
- They were better before.

"- Red, can you move over?"
I want to get a look at that sexy hot rod.
"You know, I used to be a purty good whistler."
"I can't do it now, of course, on account of sometimes"
"I get fluid built up in my engine block, but Doc said he's gonna fix it."
He can fix about anything.
That's why we made him the judge.
"Boy, you shoulda heard me on Giddy-up, Oom Papa Mow Mow."
"Now, I'm not one to brag but people come purty far to see me get low on the ""Mow-Mow""."
Oh!
"- Aw, man, that's just great!"
"- Hey, what's wrong?"
My lucky sticker's all dirty.
"Ah, that ain't nothin'."
I'll clean it for ya.
"No, no, no!"
That won't be necessary.
Hey!
"Hey, big fella!"
"Yeah, you in the red!"
I could use a little hose down.
Help me wash this off.
Where's he goin'?
Boss.
- What's her name?
The one in green.
- Macarena.
Give her this and another round.
- It's strange.
- What is?
"He's good-looking, he could have any girl."
Why does he do it?
You look tired.
You should go to bed.
"Take the car, I don't mind."
I'll walk back.
Wednesday morning 200 workers with pickets blocked the national highway at four different spots...
- Evening.
- Evening.
I'm coming!
I'm alone.
- Can I come in'?
"- Yeah, sure."
Just a moment.
What can you tell me about this?
- That she has nice tits.
"- It's Carmen, she's dead."
She had nice tits.
- What can I tell you?
- Whatever you know.
- Where did you get it?
- That's not your concern.
- I'm a journalist.
- Don't make me laugh.
- Send it to Madrid.
Uh!
- Ow!
"- Oh, sorry, babe."
What were you aiming for?
"Hey, got you a bag of Blue Rad-berry slushie for the swelling."
"I would've just gotten ice, but a possum died in the ice machine."
- Cool.
- Yeah.
Why do we keep hurting each other?
I don't know.
Maybe I'm overthinking it.
It just feels like we're not...
- On the same page.
- Clicking.
That was basically the same thing.
- I count that.
Are we OK?
"Yeah, sure."
"I mean, we had the talk, right?"
"It's just that every time you look at me, it's like you want to run away."
"Nah, no, no way!"
"Or if I do, it's just 'cause I'm busy."
"You know, I got places to be, stuff to do, you know, just like you."
"OK, well, as long as we're cool."
Cool as a...
Cool thing.
Look at them all.
They think I killed her.
Nobody thinks that.
Do they Fiona?
'Course not.
Terrible news.
So you better leave at once!
Down there!
Surround them!
Don't move!
"Daddy, I got the Formula!"
You think my daughter would help you?
Fools!
You'll die in a woman's hands some day.
You didn't kiss me.
"Yoyo, you've tricked me all along."
"Daddy, I want him dead!"
See!
I told you!
Your bad breath gave it away.
"Supermac 1, Yoyo, Robin."
You're done.
Say your prayers!
Ready...!
"Have no fear, there are women about."
More women?
Ha!
There are only men here.
Where are the women?
Sisters!
It's time to get rid of the traitor.
"And prove your loyalty to the country, show yourselves!"
Have you forgotten I'm woman too?
What?
She's a woman?
And I'm 100 percent woman!
"You're really dumb, I'm in front of you for so long."
And you still don't know I am woman!
(STOMACH GURGLING)
Just hold that thought and stay right there.
Oh-oh.

DEAN:
Little lower.
Little bit lower...
Hey.
I thought you were in trouble.
DEAN:
That sucks.
Let me just...
Up a little.
I had to ditch this weird guy who's staying at our house.
It took me hours to shake him!
I kill myself to get out here!
And you have him doing...
Arts and crafts!
"You got a problem with arts and crafts, little man?"
"He's a giant robot, Dean."
It's a little undignified.
Yeah?
"Well, smart guy, what would you have him do?"
(MAKES ENGINE SOUNDS) Main systems on.
Main engines.
"One, two and three."
All systems go.
"Five, four, three two, one!"
Blast off!
(SCREAMING)
We're landing.
We're landing!
"I feel your anger, yes!"
"Yes, I got your blood pumping, yes?"
No?
Now use it!
Harness it!
Hmm.
Boom!
Everybody into the children's pose!
Heads down.
Okay.
Close your eyes.
Yes?
"Yes, good."
Let's breathe.
"Excuse me, Salvadore?"
I feel like my sacrum is really tight.
Could you just help me stretch it out a little?
"Yes, of course, I will play the role of your husband."
Great.
"Boom, boom."
-.
Boom.
The rain room has fire.
I did not see that coming.
I was getting centered.
I was enjoying the island.
What if Joey had seen?
"Lucy, it was really inappropriate."
"Well, I didn't know that you were so concerned about how Joey felt."
What's that supposed to mean?
Let's drop it.
All I'm saying is that it was pretty uncomfortable.
-Don't.
How's the court?
We're digging our own graves here.
"Keep it, Superman."
"Coffee, please."
It's on the house.
-Thanks.
Where's Hakkarainen?
-I told him to get a job.
Said that to the King!
He'd rather kill himself than get a job.
-Let's drink to that!
Hakkarainen is going to jump from the crane!
Buy me a beer when you get down!
What's this?
You're off-duty.
I know him from way back.
Who am I to stop anyone?
"You want to exercise, fine."
Hakkarainen!
"Show us a somersault, faggot!"
You're a mountain lion!
You'll always land on your feet!
A career leap!
Where did the tomato go?
Show us a fucking triple lutz!
Get back or I'll jump!
-No you won't.
"Don't you know your old friends anymore, King?"
Garbage Jesse!
Dammit...
It's been a while.
"I'm gonna set your nephew straight, get him singing like a canary... all's right with the world."
"$10,000."
"10,000."
Cash to you.
I'm not saying to throw the case.
Just... no talking to the DEA.
Are you saying what I think you're saying?
Yes.
What's it going to be?
What?
That dude wouldn't take a bribe?
That dude in there?
Saul Goodman we're talking about?
"""Morally outraged"", he said."
Threatened to call the police.
And Badger's gonna spill?
Like the Exxon Valdez.
So what do we do about it?
"Francesca, how about I follow you home?"
- No!
- For safety!
What?
"God, you are killing me with that booty."
"Talk to me, guys!"
Come on.
Just tell me what you want!
Jesus!
"No, no, no."
No.
It wasn't me!
It was Ignacio!
He's the one!
I haven't been a very good parent.
I know that.
I fucked up.
But I've always loved you.
"You're my baby, man."
Hello?
Yeah.
May I say who's calling?
"You've got a lovely accent, Sara."
Very compelling.
Where are you from?
What a coincidence.
I'm eating a bagel right now.
Hang on.
It's Sara from Israel for you.
-Hey.
-Hi.
I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
Yeah.
"Yeah, I'm just taking a mental health day."
How is your mental health?
Haven't quite gotten to mine yet.
I'm still dealing with everyone else's.
"It's not true, that thing you said last night."
What thing I said last night?
The thing about my heart.
It's not true at all.
I can't control my heart.
I mean I wouldn't want to even if I could.
-Sara?
-Yeah.
Can I call you right back?
(lock rattles)
George?
"George, please let me in."
Are you from the printers?
We've been waiting...
Madame Sand.
Pardon.
please excuse... (murmuring)
Madame Sand is on her way up.
Don't do that!
(whistles) It is rather far.
"- I'II have to face her, that's all."
- alfred!
I'II be perfectly behaved.
Even a little scornful.
"No, you won't."
You'II be impossible.
I don't want a scene.
Now get in there.
And hurry up!
"hello, George!"
I wasn't expecting you till next month.
"- How are the children, the country?"
- Fine.
Listen.
"I need another 3,000 francs."
What happened to the advance you got?
You know my expenses.
"The children, the estate, my mother's nursing home..."
The divorce took half of everything.
AII right.
But let me have one more instalment first.
Then her shoes disappear in the light of the lamp.
"It blinds me, so I close my eyes"
and her face is gone.
Thanks for the flowers.
Did you bring me some licorice?
I forgot.
"Daddy, I'm sorry."
Get up and do your exercises.
Yes.
The mice have a picnic on a mountain.
"They lay down a tablecloth, a tray."
Can I have some?
- No.
"It's not for you, it's for the mice."
"Everyone gets some cake, except for the baby, because it's too hard for her."
She only drinks.
Gonki.
"My Gonki, my Gonki."
"It went by fast, huh?"
What am I talking about?
It's over.
I have to put it behind me.
"It's easy for us to say, but for you?"
It's over.
Where's Ora?
Having some tests done.
She couldn't cancel them.
She didn't tell me about any tests.
She said the swelling went down a few weeks ago.
Hello.
"Hello, Daddy."
- Hello.
"Just leave her alone, you bastard!"
Two containers.
One's tap water.
One's battery acid.
You have to choose.
That's the dare.
"No, I'm not going to."
Tell me who sent the postcard.
"- I don't fucking know, all right?"
"- Chris, I'm going to pick a tap."
"If you choose, Gemma's got a 50-50 chance of surviving."
If I choose... she's got absolutely none at all.
Now left... or right?
- You're a sick man.
You're psychotic.
"- Oh, come on, tough guy."
You can do it.
Pick one.
- You're a fucking psychopath.
- Who sent the postcard?
"If I knew, you really think I wouldn't tell you."
I don't know.
"Five seconds, Chris."
Five...
Four...
"Please, don't hurt her."
"Please, she hasn't done anything wro..."
Three.
I'll give you a hint.
I'm left-handed.
"Left-handed, left-handed."
Two...

I'll file for a dna search warrant.
What's the name?

I'll e-mail you the info.
Listen... yomiss working with us?
I think the legal department is more my speed.
"Why,do you miss me?"
"Uh,sure."
Boss... agent lee is getting us our cheek swab.
Rebecca paranoid or guilty?
Might just be angry.
"At finn,us,t world."
"Go back with her to h apartment,get finn's stuff."
"And,no,I don'want to wait for a search warrant."
I'll grab my coat.
Wait at the elevator.
Okay.
"Hey,you."
Where's my money?
"Yeah,you."
Did you and jimmy spend it?
Please get away from me.
I don't know you.
I am jimmy's fiancee.
James loved me.
- He used you.
- You liar!
Chick fight!
He loved me!

Did you see my ear?
Out of my way!
Here I come!

"Hey, look, its lasers light up."
"Take that, Zurg!"
"Quick, make a space."
This is where the spaceship lands.
And he does it like that.
And he does a karate chop action!
"Come on down, guys!"
It's time for games!
We've got prizes!
-What is it?
-Can you see it?
-What the heck is up there?
"-Woody, who's up there with ya?"
Woody?
-What are you doing under the bed?
-Nothin'.
Nothin'.
"I'm sure Andy was just a little excited, that's all."
"Too much cake and ice cream, I suppose."
It's just a mistake!
"Well, that mistake is sitting in your spot, Woody."
-Have you been replaced?
-What did I tell you earlier?
No one is getting replaced.
"Now, let's all be polite and give whatever it is up there a nice, big Andy's-room welcome."
Buzz Lightyear to Star Command.
"Come in, Star Command."
"Star Command, come in."
-Oh my God.
Mom says we should pull ourselves.
It can also ye are not.
It's crisis.
"Lars, you must talk to her."
"I've tried, but she is furious because we conducted the tour."
But you must have the agreement.
Lars.
"I have not seen him in 20 years, since the trial."
So he stands here.
Totally sick.
You just do not let her run over you.
Not this time.
-No.
She takes well to mind.
"Yeah, talk to her."
-Hey it's me.
-I do not know if I want to talk.
-How did it go with Tim?
-It goes well good with him.
He spoke to me twice without screaming.
"Angie, I'm sorry."
I'm sorry I went.
-Are you all right?
You were right.
It was a bad idea to come here.
-Has Something happened?
No.
I'm going home soon.
We can do as you said.
I might take me a little time off from work.
Maybe we can go somewhere.
(LAUGHING)
"Never mind him, he's mad."
Come along.

Stayne!

I suppose this makes us even now.
Um forced herself on me.
"I told her my heart belongs to you, but she's obsessed with me."
Off with her head!
"Stand back, Mallymkun."
How's this for muchness?
"No, no!"
It mustn't be used for anything...
Arrest that girl for unlawful seduction!
Hatter!
-Take it to the White Queen.
-I'm not leaving without you.
Go!
"Run, Alice!"
Alice?
Run!
Seize her.
Alice.
Of course.
Why didn't I see it?
"Well, it has been a long time, and you were such a little tyke then."
-Give me the sword.
-Stay back.
The Queen will be so pleased.
She will take great pleasure in taking off your head.
No one is there.
Hey why are you peeking and scaring my girlfriend?
I'm not scaring her.
Look at my back.
Hey why me?
Brother for god sake look at my back.
Hey I'm not like that.
Neither am I.
I've been shot!
Look at my back.
Stop the car.
I'll count to 3.
You can't die.
Shall I shoot.
This diamond is gone.
And the other diamond...
Fake diamond.
Papa will be shocked once he sees it.
This is the 20 crores diamond.
Do you know?
Why do I've myself called Papa?
Why Papa?
Because Demelo only knows about having.
Pa Pa...
Papa.
And you came back and left the diamond.
You know that electricity only comes for 2 hours a day.
And you let it go to waste.
Tell me...
Where is the diamond?
Like every time electricity went this time too.
Now it'll be back Tommorow.
You're a performing bear!
Are the countess and Monsieur Liszt at home?
"I will see, madame."
Is that the new baby?
She's adorable.
Can I hold her?
Darling.
- Countess!
"- Hello, George."
I just saw the new baby.
She's adorable.
Was it a difficult labour?
Very.
What brings you to Paris?
- My mother's ill.
- Oh.
I've been so depressed.
Seeing friends again will do me good.
How's Franz?
He's very well.
Have you seen the charming Chopin?
No.
- Why do you ask?
- Marie...
I've tried so hard to put him out of my mind.
You want him very badly.
"For a few heavenly minutes I thought I had him, too."
"In Angers, remember, I wore that dress."
Our eyes met...
You won't get him with a dress.
"On the contrary, my dear."
I know the man.
I want revenge!
He said.
But before anyone could do anything...
Ba-bam!
"It was awful and it was terrible, and it was really, really scary."
What?
No!
Go back!
"Although the charming was fast,"
I was swift enough to repel the attack and leap to safety.
Which is exactly what he wanted you to do.
Oh!
"Charming laughed, just like a crazed maniac."
Ha ha ha ha ha.
Whoa-oa-oa!
"No, no, no, no, no."
"I'm sorry, but I would never let that happen to me."
"Instead, I..."
I...
I woke up.
Yeah.
That's right!
It was all a dream.
You mean a nightmare.
"You know you're on the ceiling, right?"
I will get you for this.
Oh!
And then the lights went out.
It was horrible and sad how Puss pleaded for mercy!
Mercy?
Please!
Said Puss with his last dying breath.
Hello.
- Who is it?
"- Yeah, this is Sal."
Howare you?
- Sounds like a foreigner.
"- You meetme Wednesdayat the hotel, OK?"
- Sounds French.

Yeah.
Yes.
Strictly small potatoes.
"You sure can pick 'em, Doyle."
Still wearing your gun on your ankle?
"Someone told me the reason why you do that is... ..when you meet a chick and you rub up against her,... ..she can't tell you're a cop."
I said it's bullshit.
It's gotta be a fast-draw gimmick or somethin'.
"Bill, why don't you knock it off, huh?"
He's gettin' too far ahead.
You're gonna lose him.
"For Christ's sake, move the car!"
What the hell is goin' on here?
"Klein, this is Cloudy."
Do you read me?
"Klein, this is Cloudy."
Do you read me?
!
"Come in, for Christ's sakes!"
This is Cloudy.
Got any dough?
Something better.
You're not leaving me?
Whas wrong?
You don't like me?
"Endo, endocrinology, whas it mean?"
How should I know?
"Hurry up, is hurting worse!"
"And ""oto-rhino-laryngology?"""
I'm not a dictionary.
Any doctor's OK.
All I know is I'm pissing blood.
He's hurt!
You fix him up or I'll smash your head in.
Get it?
Abrasion of the left testicle.
It took 3 stitches.
The bullet missed the artery...
He sure was lucky.
We're always lucky.
Incredibly lucky.
The golden touch.
Glad to hear it.
I was worried about you.
"Don't worry, just hand over your dough."
I don't have any on me I have to go to the bank.
No kidding?
I just used my last check.
You're not putting me on?
Just a thought...
You can take a look.
"No, thanks."
Talked to your husband about going overseas?
"Yes, I've been talking to him."
"Yes, I know."
"You've been a perfect angel about it, but I've changed my mind."
You have?
I think that Robert should go.
Are you sure Bob wants to?
"All right, Gretchen,"
I'll tell my husband that Bob's changed his mind.
"Oh, thank you, Karen."
You're such a darling!
I'll tell him he should have his orders in the next 24 hours.
"Goodbye, Gretchen."

"Listen, if I leave my suitcase, will you send it to me?"
I guess so.
You're just gonna sneak out of here without saying goodbye to anyone?
"Well, I have to."
"You say goodbye to Nancy for me, huh?"
What do you want me to tell her?
"Tell her, uh..."
"Just tell her goodbye, huh?"
You!

Doctor?
Doctor who?
That's the way to do it!
"Oi, Ow!"
Where did she go?
Will she come back?
"No, don't worry."
She's currently draining through your carpet.
"New setting, anti-freeze, and you're very welcome, by the way."
I'm very grateful.
I knew you'd come.
"No, you didn't, because I don't."
Because this isn't the sort of thing
I do any more.
"Next time you're in trouble, don't expect me to..."
Yours?
I won it.
You won it?
On the horse Mr. Fawlty got a tip on.
"I hope you don't mind, I..."
"No, no, not at all."
"I didn't know you bet on the horses, Polly."
"Oh, I don't."
"Only I was in the town, and I passed the betting shop, and I thought, well, why not?"
"Well, why not indeed?"
"Jolly good question, eh, dear?"
"Pity you didn't let me put something on, really."
You realize how much we would've won?
£75 for a £5 stake.
"Still, you know best."
"Those were the odds, were they, Basil?"
"Yes, that's right, dear."
14-1.
I listened in on the wireless just to make sure it had triumphed.
"Enjoy your winnings, Polly."
Thank you.
Polly.
"Yes, Mrs. Fawlty?"
What was the name of the horse?
The name?
Uh...
I've gone blank.
Birdbrain!
Birdbrain?

Uh...
Fishwife!
Is it still beauty?
Thank you for letting me know.

"I wish one day,"
I can use my own design to build my own garden!
A place as nice as paradise!
"In that paradise,"

- Of course!
"Because of you, it becomes my paradise!"
Oh!
Wait...
"When I'm graduate, let's get married, how is it?"
- Hello!
"- Xiamu,"
Xiaotian is leaving tomorrow...
Come to have dinner with us!
Xiamu?
Are you still there?
"Someone stands beside you, would it be me?"
Pretend?
What?
"I've wanted to tell you for a long time... your serum doesn't work, father."
It never has.
That's impossible.
It's been two years since you... since the last time.
That wasn't your fault.
It was my idea.
I needed time to perfect the formula.
But it wasn't working.
The hunger just... got worse.
What did you do?
"I'm sorry, father."
No.
"No, that was the other one."
It was both of us.
I sensed him out there.
"I knew when he was feeding, and I would go out at the same time."
No.
"No, it can't be."

Stay away!
What is it?
What's happening?
Let me help you.

The hotel said he checked out.
Can't you do anything right?
Call again!
- I tried three times.
- Did you ask for the right name?
It's.
"De la Paix, I'm sure you got it wrong."
De La Paix It's not that hard.
I'm certain that I said it right.
The hotel specifically said that Mr. And Mrs. De la Paix... checked out.

Are you crazy?
What if the boss sees that?
Do you like me at all?
-I'm not allowed to talk to you.
Do you?
-Do you know what'll happen - if my vegan friends find out I'm chopping lamb all night?
I'm coming.
No problem.
I'll never sleep with you if you go now.
I hate you and your barometer.
I'd rather marry Peku than you.
"I hate you, Peku!"
"Kaitsu, I mean!"
Any explosives?
-Come on!
No way.
How about the fireworks stuff that got banned?
You're a genius!
I'll get them.
Two rolls of wide duck tape.

-You're very calm about all this.
-It's all part of the act.
"No, this isn't in the script."
"Wait, wait, he's moving."
"I told you, it's a sure thing."
The only way I can lose is if he left the ring.
He's leaving the ring.
"Bull, what are you doing?"
I could have burned the money.
It would have been quicker.
It's that kind of performance that gives this game a bad name.

"And then i saw the father, and he was flying a kite with his son."
They were having fun.
And there was a couple...
A couple about my age...
And they were

And i thought about the fact
That i have never been on a blanket...

I...
I haven't been a good mother.

Not one stinking dink body.
But that smell.
That gasoline smell.
The whole hill.
It smelled like... victory.

I'm going to look around it.
"Here I go, Ricky."
I'm looking.
Please don't just run in circles.
"Marnie, what's that?"
It's a picture of their fat son.
"No, no, no."
Stand perfectly still.
Oh boy.
Look at the remotes.
The remotes?
"I'm looking at the remotes, Ricky."
Zoom in on the remotes.
"Zooming in, Ricky."
I've been studying the crime scene.
Usually there's 13 remotes.
Now there's only 12.
"Marnie,"
I think we just figured out what the murder weapon was.
- He's awake.
I'll go get him.
- That's okay.
I have to talk to you.
Is something wrong?
- Are you okay?
- Yes.
Did we get the money?
- Jacob?
"- Yes, I think so."
Then what's the problem?
"I'm not coming back, Mrs. Shaw."
"Hi, sweetheart."
- Are you managing?
- I'm okay.
He's been calling all morning.
- I don't ever want to talk to him.
- No.
- Would you like some breakfast?
- No thanks.
- I need some breakfast.
"- Yes, you do."
- Want anything?
- A glass of juice maybe.
What a little asshole.
What a stupid little boy.
- Thank you for coming.
- Of course I came.
I'll get a room though so I don't have to commute.
"I brought my teddy bear pajamas, some cookies and a glass of water   sloshing about in my bag."
I haven't been in Copenhagen this often since university.
I delivered papers.
"Rose, I'm his only chance."
Let's go.
- You workin' with the feds?
- No.
- IA?
- No.
You're alone.
Let's go.
"- Oh, shit."
- All right.
Get down.
Get down.
"- Oh, shit."
- And stay down.
Shit.
"Bill, where are you?"
"Bill, if you read, we're going back to the station."
You gonna keep me in here?
You gonna keep me in here with cuffs?
"- You don't know what you're doing, do you?"
- Shut up.
"You don't have a clue as to what the fuck is going on, do you, Sheriff?"
"Bill, do you copy?"
"Bill, do you read?"
"- It's just club soda, Freddy."
- Finish it.
"- Hey, Ray."
"- Hey, Freddy."
I came to tell you I found Superboy... and I'm bringing him in tomorrow morning... and I'd like you to come with me.
I owe you that much.
"He's a fugitive, Ray, and he's convinced you're tryin' to kill him."
"Just tell me where he is, Freddy."
"Oh, yes..."
I am.
"- Hey, douche bag, get out of there!"
- What does this mean?
"- Come on, fuckface!"
"- Alright, pig... get out here!"
Come on!
"- Come on, come on!"
- Get out here.
"Don't hurt me, I'm just a poor college student!"
"Poor, poor?"
Then we'll find someone who'll pay for you.
"No, not my mother!"
"Please, not my mother."
"- Guys, what should we do?"
- Let's knock him off!
"No, no."
Please!
I'll give you everything I have!
- Like what?
"- Everything, everything."
Candies?
"No, I don't like breath mints."
This linen handkerchief.
My mother gave it to me for my birthday.
- It's not worth anything.
- Come on.
Come on!
I have 16.600 liras to last me to the end of the month.
- I'll take that.
- What about me?
You get nothing!
"No, ma'am."
"My guys, they don't smoke on the job site."
They're good guys.
Are you sure your guys haven't been sneaking around here?
And smoking?
And lying to me?
And smoking?
I'm pretty sure.
"I need you to be honest with me, Javier."
Because I can't have someone lying to me.
"To my face, under my roof, on my time."
That's a lot of prepositions.
"I mean, there's no reason for that kind of dishonesty, is there?"
"I mean, we made promises to each other."
"I mean, we have a contract."
That's like making promises.
Isn't it?
Maybe I should get back to work.
"Oh, yeah."
"Right, yeah."
"That's great, yeah."
- Javier?
- Yeah.
We're good.
Right?
You and me.
"- Oh, yeah, yeah."
We're good.
"- Oh, good."
"Okay, that's great."
"Yeah, he did great work."
Hey.
You made it.
"How about that, kiddo?"
Excuse me.
Are you the parents of the little boy in the tunnel?
How does it feel to know that Mercy was three minutes--?
Excuse me.
I think you'd better leave.
"Sorry, I'm talking with these people."
"No, you're not."
"Hey, how are you feeling?"
- You made it.
- Just like you promised.
- Thank you.
- It's all right.
You remember Wrigley Field.
We got a date.
Sit down.
Let me finish.
- That one was crooked.
- Yeah?
Next time you can do it yourself.
"- Hey, Mark, thanks."
- For what?
You did all the hard work.
I don't think I could've gone up in that helicopter.
I just got lucky.
No.
You know about kids.
As good as new.
- Where are you going?
- Check for reporters.
All clear.
"With you in a minute, Granville."
What is it?
Is me slip showing?
I bet there's a hole in me tights!
"No, no."
"Calm down, Julie."
Everything's fine.
"Well, almost f--f--fine."
Have you ever thought about m--modelling?
Have you ever thought of g--getting me out?
-
"- Modelling, Mr Arkwright?"
-
- Yes.
-
- I don't think I'd be any good.
-
- Under my supervision and guidance.
-
- I were never any good before.
-
- You've done it before?
Oh.
L--l--I think I should s--say s--straightaway that I could only offer you a f--fraction of the g--going rate.
I didn't realise you had m--m--m--modelled before.
I'm still here!
-
- It's been quite a while.
-
- My feelings exactly!
I think it were in Standard Four.
I made a gnome out of Plasticine.
I feel proud of you.
"I might be your father, but you were born for the people!"
Previously on Kyle XY...
Kyle?
"Be careful, even in our backyard."
We have bigger problems than Mrs. Bloom.
Jessi starts back at school today.
I sort of levitated.
Show me how.
I will.
She's the one who attacked me.
I know Lori will never forgive me.
You have to earn forgiveness.
"""She Could Be You. "" What?"
The two of you used to play that song all the time.
D4.
It's not there.
It's a Latnok ring.
All the members received rings.
It was a way of identifying one another.
And you're Latnok?
Yes.
I got accepted into a music program in New York.
I leave in two days.
Two days?
I miss this.
I miss you.
I didn't want to go back to how I was before.
How were you before?
Invisible.
I'll call...
I'm... very hungry.
- This is Storm Island?
- That's right.
- And what do you do here?
- Sheep farmer.
- Really?
- I'm going to bed.
My back's playing up.
You're a fool.
Lucky to be alive.
Why were you out in the storm in the first place?
Because I had no idea it was going to be so severe.
Give me two.
I want to sleep.
I can do that.
Good night.
- Would you like some more soup?
"- No, thank you."
It was delicious.
There's some brandy next door.
Would you like some?
Do sit down.
"Where do you live, Mr Baker?"
I used to live on that boat.
I suppose I am a damn fool.
I moved from London about a month ago.
- Really?
I haven't been there for years.
- When were you last there?
Four years ago.
And that was to have a baby.
- You've been here four years?
There you go.
Thanks.
This looks good on me.
You think?
I look completely different from yesterday.
But don't you think this is hard on Takao and Shinako?
I have to think about them later.
Why don't you come to rehearsals?
"The performance is coming up, you know."
I think I'm going to quit dancing.
Why?
"This place might close, too."
Really?
I just came from your place.
I found Kayama-sensei.
Where is he?
He's in Okutama.
It looks like he's pretty sick.
He might not know who you are.
"Brother, brother."
Sensei.
"It's me, Shinako."
Do you remember who I am?
"Shinako, dance."
Dance!
"As long as you have legs, dance"
Ballerinas dance until they die.
Can you hear that?
It's a festival.
A gypsy dance.
People with legs should dance.
Ballerinas...ballerinas dance.
Uh...
"Thanks, big man."
It really looks beautiful.
I'm sorry about earlier.
Please don't smoke in the house.
Roman.
You want one?
No.
You know I promised Ryan.
What's that?
Paper?
It's cute.
# No I can't save you
# You're on your own
# You're on your own
#NoIjustcan'thelp...
Things get too busy on the couch to call?
I was doing something for my brother.
Oh yeah?
Am I gonna meet this brother of yours?
It's not likely.

My Mom would have loved you.
"Well, of course."
You said she had good taste.
"You know, you can't ever leave me."
No matter how bad a wife I am.
You're a perfect wife.
Liar.
- Let go of my wife's arm!
Let go of her.
This is a shoot.
Let her sit on the pillion
I'll miss out on my tv programme.
Don't you watch Mtv?
"Drop me, please"
Where have you brought me?
Why here... in a haunted house?
Haunted house!
Come in
"I told you, it's a tv programme."
It's all a sham!
I'm faking

Who Cyrus... what Cyrus?
"What happened, Ma...?"
He knows me!
My brother's bride.
Bride...?
Do you like her?

But why have you eloped?
Did your parents object?
Only Om objected
Who are these guys?

You are the scapegoat
I want you to meet Agesha my sister-in-law to-be
BUT ME AND MY LADY FRIEND HAD A FALLING OUT.
"AND,WELL,LIKE,MIKE THOUGHT MAYBE IT WOULD BE OKAY"
IF I CRASHED HERE FOR THE NIGHT.
"SAM,I'M NOT AN IDIOT."
YOU WANT TO TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON?
"WELL,SEE, THERE WAS THIS LADY,"
AND SHE WAS MAKING SOME THREATS.
AGAINST ME?
NOT SPECIFICALLY -
"- I MEAN, YOUR NAME CAME UP,"
"BUT IT WAS MORE LIKE A HYPOTHETICAL-TYPE THING,"
SO IT'S NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.
BUT MIKE WANTED ME TO STAY HERE
AND GIVE YOU SOME SELF-DEFENSE POINTERS
IN CASE I HAD TO LEAVE.
YOU GONNA LEAVE THIS HERE WHEN YOU GO?
"OKAY,BE CAREFUL,OKAY, BECAUSE THAT'S LOADED."

MICHAEL'S FATHER HAD A WINCHESTER SINGLE-SHOT.
I THINK I MAY STILL HAVE IT.
"SO,YOU WANT A BEER?"
YOU KIDDING?
DOUG IS SLEEPING PEACEFULLY.
YOU GAVE HIM SOMETHING.
MAYBE.
"WELL,HALF OF SOMETHING."
SAM GOT IN TOUCH
WITH HIS BUDDY AT THE U.S. ATTORNEY'S.
WE'RE BRINGING DOUG IN TOMORROW MORNING.
GREAT.
"WE CAN TALK,FINALLY."
THERE'S NOTHING TO TALK ABOUT.
He likes prison.
"You did bring the cash, didn't you?"
"Look, if this option is too expensive, you can still always..."
Badger in the chow line.
"Conscience gets expensive, doesn't it?"
All right.
There's our boy.
Right on time.
- Go back.
- What?
All right.
So... what do you think?
Did they see us?
"No, man."
I think we're good.
Badger looks like he's gonna throw up.
Give me those back.
Just give them to me!
No.
Where the hell is Jimmy?
He should have been here ten minutes ago.
You think Jimmy's actually for real?
A guy who wants to be in prison?
There's more than one kind of prison.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
There he is.
Wait a minute.
"No, no."
What?
What?
Let me see.
- Who the hell is that?
- What?
What is that?
"My God, I think... that's a telephone line."
"Look, you just stay here and I'll be back as soon as I can."
All right?
I'll go see.
Hey!
"Hey, mister, can I use your phone?"
"Hey, who are you?"
- What are you doing?
- I'm a pilot that crashed.
Airplanes ain't safe.
Airplanes ain't dependable.
Look what happened to you.
Put that down.
That's railroad property.
"- Mister, I gotta eat something."
- Put that down!
You roach.
"It's been a home for me, man and boy, for 50 years."
They still got a place for me on the railroad.
"Mister, I got a kid who's hurt bad."
I gotta take her something to eat.
- Leave it be!
- I'll pay for 'em.
You drop 'em.
Now you get outta here.
Take it easy.
Just take it easy.
You know you ain't gonna make it.
Damn!
Edgar!
- I just got a daughter.
- Congratulations.
- Do you have a wife?
- No.
- You haven't married?
- No.
A girlfriend?
No.
- Is it rude of me to ask?
"- No, no."
- Why don't I get that wine?
- Good idea.
"When I went home, I thought you would follow me."
I thought so too.
I thought you would come back.
You did?
But we didn't.
We should go to India.
- Why?
- It's warm.
They've got good hotels.
Stop it.
Why?
Look at this apartment.
We're lying on a mattress.
There's lots to do.
- It doesn't matter.
- It does.
- And we're going to Val d'lsere.
"- We can go there, but not India?"
Give me a break.
"Ever since you met your real, holy father   you've been really irritating to be with."
- You be easy now.
"Yeah, man, take it easy."
"My God, Miller."
I don't know where to begin.
"Nah, don't sweat it, kid."
There is nothing to say.
I wish there was some way I could repay you.
"Well, for starters, you can give me your left arm."
"In fact, that is why I came by here today."
"Isn't it, Tucker?"
Fair is fair.
"We are just razzing you, kid."
"You keep your left arm, I will keep my settlement."
Hell!
I've heard these guys who'd give his arm and a leg to get a deal like this.
"So, I guess you can call me lucky."
"Well, Miller, if there is anything I can do..."
"Nah, forget it."
No hard feelings.
"I'll see you around, pal."
Hey!
Help!
Hey!
Hey!
It's got my arm!
Somebody help me!
Someone help me!

They've killed young Paolo!
They've killed your son Paolo!
Murderers!
Murderers!
My son...
"All my respect, Don Ciccio."
You killed my husband because he wouldn't give in to you.
And his oldest son Paolo because he swore revenge.
But Vito is only nine.
And dumb-witted.
He never speaks.
It's not his words I'm afraid of.
He's weak.
He couldn't hurt anyone.
"But when he grows, he'll grow strong."
Don't worry.
This little boy can't do a thing to you.
"When he's a man, he'll come for revenge."
"I beg you, Don Ciccio, spare my only son."
He's all I have left.
I swear to God he'll never do you any harm.
Spare him!

Looks so ordinary for an oracle.
on the Frabjous Day.
I'd know that tangled messNof hair anywhere.

I believe it is.
What's she doingNwith my darling Jabberwocky?
She appears to be slaying it.
She killed my Jabber-baby-wocky?

"Look, we were just dancing."
"And what, her ass just happened to fall into your hands ?"
"No, it was-"
"- You were dancing with Snookie, I was dancing with Nikki."
The music was going and-- l thought we were having a good time.
Look.
There's nothing between me and Nikki anymore.
Can people be evil?

From your mother...?
-All her religious crap...?
- No.

"Owen, listen put your mother on the phone, I wanna talk to her... she's not here..."
"All right. please have her call me when she gets back, alright...?"
Well.

He's been waiting a half hour.
Is something wrong?
I wish you would have let me know you were coming.
-I could have prepared something.
-I didn't want you to know.
-You heard what happened?
-I almost died.
We were so relieved...
In my home!
In my bedroom where my wife sleeps!
Where my children come to play.
In my home.
I want you to help me take my revenge.

Exactly.

I apologize for the unorthodox introduction.
I'm Dr. cairn.
Oh.
I wanted to make sure that all your needs are being seen to.
"Oh, yes."
The institute is lovely.
I'm happy that you're pleased.
You may be feeling stress.
So this tonic may calm your nerves.
How are you responding to the tonic?
I feel better already.
Dude was bite-size.
That's funny?
"- Whatever, bitch."
"- Hey, watch your mouth."
"Are you almost done, man?"
Why?
You in a hurry to go to jail?
We can check on Alma.
She's probably in Recovery by now.
"- That means she's okay, then?"
- No.
She could wind up paralyzed.
"- Like, all over or just her legs?"
- They' re not sure yet.
"Well, better if they just killed her, you know?"
An hour ago you were ready for revenge.
"Yeah, that was personal."
"It was about my name, honor."
- But paralyzed?
That blows.
- Just dress the wound with Adaptic.
"Hey, Luka."
"- Piece of work, huh?"
- Yeah.
And she's pregnant.
- Who?
- The girl.
Says it's his baby.
You want to tell him?
No.
Do you?
Not really.
"You know, I can honestly say that you are the only grandfather"
I have ever wanted to be with.
- Oh!
Hello.
- Daddy's girl.
I'm going to bring Ritchie his pancakes.
Okay.
I'm going to get us some coffee.
I'll be right over there.
"- Hi, Christine."
- Hi.
You having a nice Grandparents' Day?
"Yeah, as a matter of fact, I am."
You seem to have a very close family.
"Yes, you certainly seem to be daddy's best girl."
W hat?
Oh.
Ew!
"Oh, no."
That's not my father.
"No, no, no."
That's New Christine's father.
Why were you kissing him?
"Um, because I'm, um..."
I'm sort of dating him.
You're dating your ex-husband's girlfriend's father?
Yeah.
That's right.
"Well, you know, Christine, if we don't tell you enough, we are so happy you're at this school."
That's nice.
Ugh!
"I got so distracted by those meanie moms,"
"Look, you got to trust me, okay?"
Everything's going to be just fine.
"Hi, there."
I'm Judy.
Who are you?
Becca.
You're the lady on TV.
"Stay here, Becca."
We'll be right back.
I brought your phone back.
You haven't played the message on TV yet.
I will.
I made a copy.
"Mrs. Jerome, I have to ask you one more time."
Where did your daughter go when she disappeared 12 years ago?
I already told you.
I don't know.
This may be important.
I'll tell you what's important.
Everyone believes Jeffrey's a victim in this.
I need them to hear my daughter.
"Look, I've called the hotline, like, five times."
Why the hell hasn't anyone called me back?
!
You know what?
Forget it.
Don't bother.
"Hey, you seen Nicky?"
She'll show up.
Don't worry.
"Come on, Peter, we gotta go."
Are you in or are you out?
Wait.
Hold up.
Coach.
"Sorry, I was in the shower."
No problem.
I'll let you out over there.
"Hey, thanks for working with me today."
"Oh, you're welcome."
You're just getting started.
"I feel like I'm not normally that bad, though."
- It's those fucking nerves.
- Everybody gets them.
Is there anything to do around here?
- Do?
Like what?
- I don't know.
Go grab a drink or something.
I don't feel like staying home.
You want to grab a drink with me?
We could do that.
We could do that.
Let's not.
You're a talented fighter.
You have my attention.
"- No, I didn't mean that."
"- Oh, I know."
See you tomorrow.
Good work.
[Both moaning]
"Oh, my gosh."
That was so good.
You are fucking insane.
Hello?
Yes I'm fine.
Normal.
Hear about what?
Of course I've read the newspapers.
"Yes, I'll wait."
Luisa.
I prefer to meet Laura by myself.
As you want.
Yes.
Yesterday.
Almost at eight.
Sometimes I heard him saying at dusk time.
When I walked in the terrace door was opened.
"When I saw it, I knew what happened."
Soon people screamed.
Windows opened.
Everybody showed up.
They said someone fell out.
As I was going up in the elevator he was falling down.
Did he try it before?
Never.
I was scared of him doing it before.
But he was fine now.
You know they had to confine him.
He told me the day we met.
He was very good now.
But I have an idea that comes to my mind.
Julian wanted to win.
To win?
Why don't we leave?
I'm afraid of people coming here.
"I don't know, professor."
This scratch looks pretty old.
The Ark's magnetic.
"Yeah, let's check it out later, come on."
There's no engine!
That'll keep 'em out for a while.
And us in.
"Shh, quiet!"
Sound the alarm.
"Come on, MacGyver, they know we've escaped."
We haven't yet.
Give me a hand here.
No one left through the gate.
Search every inch of this place.
Find them and kill them.
"Load it up, professor."
What?
You sure this will work?
Nope.
Good.
That's the MacGyver I know.
Open this up.
Looks like they're gonna open the door for us.
Get some men over here!
"Yes, sir."
Now what are you doing?
Trying to stop some ethnic cleansing.
Buckle up.
It worked!
It worked!
Ha-ha-ha!
I knew it would.
"Yes, I'm fine."
"Well, I'll just visit the powder room."
Of course.
You sure Mrs McCarthy's in danger?
George may well have poisoned Henry to stop him revealing that he killed Vera Blanchett.
And if George did that to Henry...
Exactly.
"Oh, that looks lovely."
I've taken the liberty of pouring you some wine.
Oh!
Why not?
"Here's to you, Bridget, and to Henry."
Of course.
To poor Henry.
"Oh, It's quite sharp."
Maybe even a little bitter.
Try the fish.
Yes.
Mrs McCarthy.
What are you...
George.
What on earth is going on?
!
I'm afraid there has been a fire at St Mary's.
A fire!
"Now, the Fire Brigade have it under control, Mrs McCarthy, but I need you to go back with Sid and sort out a few things."
But I haven't even started my dinner.
I'm so sorry.
"But all things considered, I think we've had a lucky escape."
Right.
Shall we?
"The Rolls, Mrs M?"
"Eddie, don't..."
Can you...
I got to go.
"[click, dial tone]"
Fuck.
Fuck.
[spit] [flush]
"You were in there a while, Eddie."
I was just...
I don't know how many times I got to tell you guys.
"If it's a big one, take it upstairs."
"Christ, did you even spray?"
- No.
There was...
- Look at you.
You look like shit.
- Yeah.
- What's going on?
- I feel...
"- What is it, first night back jitters or something?"
- Maybe.
Maybe.
- All right.
"Well, just relax, okay?"
This is probably inevitable.
"Look, I'm gonna put Tate on the big table."
You can deal razz to those English pricks.
- No.
No.
- I'm gonna ease you back in.
"Yeah, that's what we're going to do."
- You sure?
Please don't make a scene.
Where's the restroom?
"Yes, I called him."
When?
Why?
Because.
Want something to eat?
The cafeteria's closed.
He's sleeping.
"It went well, but took a long time."
"We will wake him up soon, to see he's all right."
"Good thing he came in, it was almost too late."
There's a problem with his papers.
- If you don't mind...
- I'll take care of it.
"We almost killed him, and for what?"
My battery's run out.
I need to make a call.
I need to talk to Raziya.
This whole costume is for her sake.
All because I love her.
What's the sense in hiding all this from her?
You know what she calls Him?
Daddy.
"She calls God ""Daddy"" and me she calls ""Honey""."
Do you need help?
No.
What's your name?
Dorona.
- And your brothers?
"- Natanel, and the little one is Shai."
- There's another one.
"But you'll be there, right?"
Tuesday night?
Of course.
"Take the 11:40 bus, okay?"
Anything later on a weekday will get you in too late.
Especially with traffic.

"[Edgar] Oh, that's hilarious, Cass."

LUCY:
Uh-huh.
-Congratulations.
-Same as you.
As me?
Ha.
"You're the father, Buck."
"Hey, Buck and Lucy are having a baby."
LUCY:
And a wedding too.
-What?
"Oh, my Pa's gonna insist on one."
And you know how mad he gets.
A wedding.
"Well, someone should buy a round of drinks."
"The Lord blesses the union of two lovers, glory to behold."
"No, no, this is nonsense, all right?"
It's nonsense.
I'm not the father of that baby.
I'm not the father of that baby.
I'm not about to get married.
"No, no."

What about Judge Travis?
He's days away from a telegraph office.
Marshal's right.
How about getting some credits today?
You told that the elderly man didn't ask for food.
It's not a big deal to find a hungry man in our city.
One moment.
I'm Deepa.
I work in a clothing store in a shopping mall.
I'm Varun.
"Cutting, baking, boiling and frying things."
This is my profession.
Did you just extend your hand?
What?
For an introduction?
No.
Sorry.
I forget this all the time!
It's okay.
No.
Let's start from the beginning.
"Hi, I'm Varun."
Deepa.
Varun...
Excuse me.
Have it.
- Thank you very much.
Shall we leave?
Here...
With no control
"Somehow, I am becoming you."
Without the eyes laying sight...
I am becoming like you.
The fiber of my life shines colorfully.
While killing me with fondness...
- We're down one.
- Just for a minute.
- I risk getting hurt.
- Don't make us beg.
That was a penalty.
It was!
I'II kick it.
"Run, a bombing!"
Who else?
The MiIanese!
could you take my window for a minute?
This has to be sent back.
hello.
Do you know my grandson Peppe?
"I have to send him this, it's a sweaterI made."
"I want it to get there fast, how long will it take?"
- Two orthree days.
- Two orthree?
"And if it rains, what will the dearthing wear?"
.
should he freeze to death?
Two orthree days?
But it's just a small package.
Your grandson Peppe?
- You're talking about Peppe?
- Do you know him?
"Peppe said, I quote:"
"""If my grandma comes, tell her she can't make sweaters,"""
"""she's gotta do fried dough, 'cause she does 'em great."""
"But he doesn't like sweaters, make him a dessert."
"Making sweaters isn't foryou, Peppe said so."
- Make scarves.
Let's see what's down there.
(FOOTSTEPS CLANGlNG)
We're clear.
My God.
He only fired two shots.
"Oh, my God, it's David."
"(MUTTERS) Oh, my God!"
EMERSON:
They must have thought he was dead.
Bled out.
He knew there was a gun hidden down here.
You still with me?
"Yeah, feel nauseous."
"Yeah, well, puke if you have to."
I haven't puked since college.
Keep talking.
Where did you go?
-Brown.
"-Yeah, how long?"
Two years.
"Before you dropped out, huh?"
MAN:
There you are.
(david YELLS)
EMERSON:
They're looking for this.
Mainframe's connected to the computer.
So whatever's on this...
You said the codes were impossible to crack.
Unless you have the original cypher.
"But whatever they're looking for, it's on this, so can you?"
"Yeah, I'm on it, I'm on it."
"I picked-up names,"
"Fill Dill, Cill, Guill, Dill, Hill, Trill ..."
Okay.
I've got it.
And will one-up Will.
-Good for you.
We could get our own school.
We are males.
-We adopts.
"-Takes you, I fit."
I have much to do.
"Okay, then can go, go quench your thirst for blood."
The many other Krills at sea.
Many would appreciate Krills have me as a partner.
I'm a hell of a partner.
You're the only school I have.
"You know that, but no intimacy."
-Are you hurt?
"No, I'm fine."
-I'm fine.
"-What is Seymour, gimme a break."
"No, no, Thank you, brother."
My kids are out there.
"Then, no!"
"Erik and Atticus, to hide."
Let's hide here.
"Rolls, rolls, rolls, where I can fly!"
"Look, My favorite penguins trapped a wall of ice."
Let's do a rotation.
-Forever.
Never seen so many seagulls in one place.
"Stay together, do not differ."
"Ith that's it, thank you."
-You're welcome.
And a coke.
-Yeah sure.
Here you go.
Your mom would be real proud of you.
Proud of a reject Juvie kid?
Close your mouth when you eat.
Very nice.
-Hyder.
So?
How is school boys?
-I hate school.
It's fine.
This whole thing's a joke.
Dad of the fuckin year over here.
Not here.
-Why not uh?
Everyone knows CPS took your kid.
Whole town knows.
Shut your mouth now.
-They don't know about Galveston.
That's enough.
-He fucking left us.
Stop.
-Don't tell me what to do.
It wasn't my responsibility to take care of everything.
Take care of Wes while you boozed up down there.
"Alright, come on."
"3 weeks dad, 3 whole weeks you were gone."
"Admit it, you wanna drink yourself to death."
"Cause when Duncan found you, you were gonna leave us for good, weren't you?"
"It's the Sunland Arms, apartment 12B."
You'd better hurry.
There's no time to lose.
Her scalp must be in very bad shape.
It is.
(DOORBELL BUZZING)
"(IN FRENCH ACCENT) Oh, uh, hello, I am Wilbert."
Your husband sent me here to make the scalp happy.
"Oh, come in."
It is not easy to come through this little hole.
"Oh, I'm sorry to have kept you out there in that cold hall, honey."
"But, you know, a nice girl can't be too careful."
(COUGHS)
Why don't you take your coat off?
"Oh, no, this is fine, thank you."
"All right, here is the coat."
(COUGHS)
I must find the place to plug in the equipment.
Over there.
"Oh, merci."
(CHUCKLING NERVOUSLY)
(WHIRRING)
"Well, I am now ready to begin."
So am I.
You know something?
What?
You're cute.
Do you know something?
Whisper it in my ear.
The scalp is dry.
Come with me.
Where?
"You're not embarrassed, are you?"
Of course not.
"I just thought you were working, that's all."
I took off.
For this?
Yeah.
Didn't your father ever teach you how to tie a tie?
"No, he didn't."
You know...
I didn't mean to make you do anything
You didn't want to do.
I'm chillin' yo.
"Oh shit, my dude..."
That's a nigga right there.
"No gas, no gas!"
Oh!
You just gonna stand there?
You're not gonna say anything?
"Yo, what you want me to say, yo?"
It ain't like they lying.
"You know, you're fucked up."
Yo.
"Yo, you ain't my girl."
"You need to chill the fuck out, a'ight?"
"Oh, so I'm good enough for you to fuck"
"And for me to suck your dick,"
But I'm not your girl?
"Well, then fuck you..."
fuck you!
"Yo, you good?"
"I'm good, yo."
"Wait, Chris."
You know... .
- You look older.
More grown-up.
- A uniform helps.
- And all the decorations.
- Yeah.
- What have you been doing?
- Living in New York.
I remember you liked to write.
- I did some writing.
- Get any published?
"No, I got a job working for a book publisher."
"He didn't publish those books with the plain wrappers, did he?"
- Remember?
- No.
"- Yes, you do."
Remember?
- Yes.
You were always afraid.
And everything frightened you.
I can't get over how wonderful you look.
Really.
You look great.
Thanks.
"You know, you never said goodbye to me when you left Peyton Place."
You never even said goodbye.
"I'll never forget that Labor Day, Norman."
I won't either.
- I see you have two Purple Hearts.
- Yeah.
What brings you home?
Vacation?
–Damn it!
Open the door!
–Just let go of me!
"Well, maybe I should just let my dick do the talking."
"How about that, huh?"
–Huh?
–Open the goddamn door!
"–Shane, come on!"
–Where is he?
Where is he?
He told me to meet him at the stash house.
–Where?
–Open up!
Come on!
Near the bridge.
"You have no idea what you just missed, darlin'."
–Come on!
–Asshole!
"Couldn't split town before you picked up the merchandise, huh?"
"You were always such an idiot, Fleetwood."
Weren't you?
–You can't arrest me.
"–I'm not here to arrest you, asshole."
–Drop it!
Put that on the ground!
"–You heard him, asshole!"
Now!
Turn around!
Turn around!
"Your girlfriend gave you up, man."
She couldn't resist my charms.
–You found something?
Come on Prewitt.
"Come on, cut that out."
You want to see this guy's imitation of Mussolini?
"Come on, show him your Mussolini impersonation."
Italian men... Italian women!
For twenty centuries...
"Sorry, I can't."
"Cut that out, Prewitt."
What are you doing here?
Don't you know it's forbidden?
It's a minefield.
Get lost.
Get that bitch out of here!
"Out, out!"
Can you get that Italian bitch out of here?
- Get out bitch!
- Enough!
Are you here to fight Germans or to insult Italians?
You're killing them!
"Out, out!"
Go!
"- Step aside boys, move!"
- The medic's here!
It's too late.
Nothing can be done.
Thank you.
Thank you.
- Pasqualino!
Pasqualino!
- No!
No!
Is everything alright?
Lydia's periods have stopped.
You're right.
But I think we should tell Dr. Vega.
Hey!
Benigno.
Hey!
I brought some of my travel guides for Alicia and you.
Thank you.
I've said goodbye to Lydia.
OCR failed!
but Dr. Vega and the head nurse were there and I wasn't allowed in.
Is anything wrong?
"No, I think Alicia has got an infection."
Can you take me home?
I'm off duty.
I hope it isn't serious.
I don't know.
They're doing some tests but they won't tell me anything either.
"Abidjan, the Yemen, Brazil,"
"Turkey, Cuba."
I'll read them to Alicia at night.
They're just travel guides.
"You wrote them, they must be special."
Are you going alone?
Yes.
I wanted to talk to you about that before you leave.
About what?
Loneliness.
I want to get married.
Married?
Who to?
"To Alicia, of course!"
I got a car.
Them wheels are yours?
Come on.
"What do you mean, come on?"
What's your name?
"Miko's the name, pedalling's the game."
How can I help?
- You know the Greenbergs?
- Yeah.
"Just yesterday, they takin' tourists..."
"I mean, doin' business."
You know what I mean?
"And today, pau'ana."
- They say anything about taking a vacation?
- Saul take a vacation?
- You gotta be kidding.
- I know what you mean.
Tom?
This guy says that Saul and Lena closed the place early last night.
"This morning, the place was for sale."
There was no answer from them this morning.
- Does this kid know anything?
- He's as surprised as we are.
- Let's run by their house.
"- You find anything, let me know."
- I like them old haoles.
"- Mahalo, brah."
"Thanks, brah."
Saul said they were taking a vacation.
- We're meddling.
- We're not.
- We are so.
- I wrote it.
- What?
In these couple of days?
"Yeah, I think it's pretty good."
These two pages.
How'd you finish so quickly?
Amazing.
Do you like it?
"Don't know, maybe tomorrow it'll look like shit to me."
But it all came within a few hours.
"Funny, huh?"
"It came out so easy, as if I were possessed."
"Yes, Director Kim."
How are you?
I'm home.
Are you still there?
How's your leg?
It still hurts.
I think I was afraid again.
I miss you.
"I'm sorry, too."
Honestly.
When are you coming back?
I think I liked you a lot as a movie director.
And I think you'll have a hard time because of me.
Please stop.
You think so?
Should I try to find someone here who resembles you?
Like you did?
"Yeah, why don't you."
Don't worry.
I won't.
"Hey, man, I don't want to put any kind of pressure on you, but..."
I bet every dime I got on you.
You what?
I guess I got carried away.
No pressure?
You call that no pressure?
Trainer coming through.
Excuse me.
Just take it easy.
Come on.
All right.
Has anyone given him a salt tablet?
No.
Okay.
"I've got your glucose, your dry socks, liniment, bandages."
Bandages?
Bandages?
"- Just relax, okay?"
Relax.
"- Come on, Magnum."
Warm up.
Warm up.
"Yeah, get them legs goin'."
- Get them legs in shape.
"- Two minutes, swimmers."
Two minutes.
"- Oh, no."
- Don't use them too much on the swim...
What?
What do you think you're doing.
I'm sorry.
No one informed me of the dress code.
I can't control it.
(DISTANT SCREAMING)
(PANTING)
I don't know when I've had such good sport.
"Thank you, fair lady."
You must feel honored to be chosen by a baron.
Bring her to me!
(ALL SNARLING)
(SCREAMS)
(WHINNIES)
(GROWLING)
What's this?
You're one of our kind.
You're wrong!
I'm nothing like you!
I'm a human being!
Unbelievable.
How interesting.
You're a seriously confused fellow.
One only has to look at your eyes to know what you are.
Unless you're...
Can it be?
A hybrid?
Is that it?
Hello!
"Sorry to interrupt the hunt, Baron Howard!"
And who are you?
A hunter as well.
Only my quarries happen to be vampires.
What?
I wanted your last meal to be special.
"So tonight, you dine on the finest silver."
"That's a shame, Frankie."
Lot of unanswered questions.
You want your fight?
You got your fight.
"You and me, right now."
"- Well, I..."
No.
- What?
"Daddy, you can beat him."
Come on.
- You're next.
- It'll be like the old days.
I will kill you.
I will knock your nose off your face.
"You wanna knock something, you knock it off of me."
- That's right.
"- All right, you got a fight."
"Greg, get my gloves."
"- I'm sorry, bro."
"- Yeah, well, sorry's not gonna get our money back."
- He was so fast.
- You should have moved around a little more and tired him out.
- We have nothing.
- I don't know what to say.
- I gave it my best.
- Yeah.
You know what?
Your best wasn't good enough.
"- Hey, you have the time?"
"- Aw, not you again."
We don't have any money.
We just lost it all.
Just around the block.
Yeah.
Just around the block.
"And be careful, okay?"
I will.
Bye.
I-It-
- It's really--
"It's really great to have you home, Mom."
"Hey, seriously, be careful, okay?"
I will.
Okay.
I guess we should talk.
"Oh, I think you said plenty the other day."
No.
"Look, about that, it just--"
Did you get the car wash keys?
"Um, yes, yes."
"Skyler, I may have... overstated things earlier, and I'm sorry to be so forward."
But I-
- I just--
I want you to know something.
I want you to--
I need you to understand that you are safe.
"You, Junior, Holly--"
You are completely safe.
Everything that I do-- Everything--
I do it to protect this family.
"So buying that car, that was protecting your family?"
Okay.
"I, uh--"
"All right, maybe it's a little flashy, but he needed a car, and--"
"Well, I had the baby."
Really?
Yeah.
"You guys took so long,"
I'm already pregnant with another one.
Here's your ice water.
Thank you.
"Anything else I can get for you, dirty stranger?"
Dr. Roland!
"Oh, my God."
I'm so glad to see you.
Yeah.
I didn't need to see the Rolling Stones tonight.
Where's Zack?
Jail.
Boom!
Just won the office pool.
Okay.
"Let's take a gander at the old money maker, huh?"
"Oh, six centimeters."
Shouldn't be long now.
But Zack's not here.
"Olivia, help."
Don't worry about it.
I know people at every precinct in this town:
"If they don't let him go, they're going to read about it in tomorrow's front page."
"Yeah, she's gonna get arrested, too."
Hey.
I slept with her.
I don't care.
I can't believe that
Zack's not going to make it.
-Yeah.
-Completely?
-Completely.
That gets me off.
You're easy.
No.
With you I am.
So do I get to...?
Do I get to work on you for a while or do we just fall asleep?
You can work on me all night long.
"I mean, you're with someone."
Why would I let myself fall in love with you?
"What, like I'm just an object to you?"
"I'm just, like, a piece of ass?"
-You just looking to get laid?
-Yeah.
Right.
"-God, you're like a girl."
"-Oh, thanks."
That's really flattering.
"Yeah, it is."
Maybe that's why I like you.
Are you having a sexuality crisis?
No.
I'm not having any kind of crisis.
"You're lucky, you know that?"
No.
I don't know that.
Why am I lucky?
You can control your heart.
"-Hey, thanks for coming out, Darla."
-Good night.
A convention of predators?
"-There, there!"
-Why was not I invited?
-Will.
"-Guys, guys?"
-Will not go ...
-Get out.
-You will not survive.
Me misses.
Will stop.
I think the best part.
"If I'm invading your space, How about this?"
"No, no, I'm talking about, separated from truth."
More ...
Why?
My life is like now.
"I can change, be less invisible."
"See, you'll be great."
"See you, kid."
"Will, please do not let me."
"I'll take you, you, you, and you."
"Please, someone, anyone, I lost my Will."
"I beg you, please Will my return."
-Mano.
-Sven.
"-I will give to his wife, okay."
"-Okay, thank you."
"Right Sven, here I come."
Form a single queue and smiled.
You must be glorious.
And you must be Sven.
"It is a pleasure for me to know, seriously because I'm thrilled."
And he's one of your best friends.
Mm-hmm.
Why don't you pursue him?
I always liked him.
I'm just not good at pursuing a guy.
"HALLIE, I'm sorry if I made you feel..."
jealous.
"I mean, I never, never meant to."
I never even knew I did.
"I guess I just feel the way you felt with J.P., you know?"
Yeah.
I understand that.
The next morning as soon as she woke up
Jill took a cab straight home to face the music.
Not knowing if that music...
would be a wedding march.
Drew.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I love you.
I really do love you.
"Me, too."
Smell my hair.
Does it still smell like cigarettes?
No.
It smells like Jill.
Ugh.
Wow.
Look at this.
"Party at our place, and it's only 9am."
"Last night, she was wearing the ugliest pair of cotton granny panties"
I've ever seen in my entire life.
Listen in on his conversation.
He said it was a friendly dinner.
No way.
Not a chance.
"Tell them, Bobbi."
"- Let""s not jump to any conclusions."
- What?
Do you have a picture of the receptionist?
"No, but she has blonde hair, like Clara."
"Like Mom""s."
"Yeah, well, she""s thinner than me... and she""s prettier."
Is this your daughter?
"She""s so pretty."
Yeah.
"That""s my oldest daughter, Cassie."
"She""s getting married."
A wedding.
You must be so excited.
Yeah.
We are.
We really are.
"Now, how long has this scumbag been sneaking around?"
"We""ve known about it for a couple of weeks."
"Clara can""t sleep, she can""t eat."
"L""m worried about you, Mom."
"We""ll get even for y""all."
"Won""t we, Bobbi?"
"We""ll nail that lying, cheating bastard to the wall."
"We""ll rake him over the coals."
"And when we""re done with David Harris... he""ll wish he never stepped foot outside your bedroom door."
"- Do you love him, Clara?"
"- What""s love got to do with anything?"
It's not your fault.
"Still, sorry."
"C'mon, Kim, you gotta pull it tight."
"You forgot this, too."
Where's the candy?
Candy?
Didn't bring one?
"We call condoms ""candies"" here."
Mom.
Mom.
Can you hear me?
What're you doing?
I'm back.
Hey.
I'll go to the immigration office the day after tomorrow.
"Don't worry, they won't detain me for overstaying."
It's not like I entered with a fake passport...
Thank you for calling Juicy Fruits.
"Yes, any girl in particular?"
Ilia?
"Sure, for how long?"
"One hour, got it."
"Yes, no problem."
- Ilia.
- Yes?
You have a booking.
Okay.
"Mom, I'll call you again when I'm about to depart."
"Yes, sorry about that."
I'll get more days off so I can train at the gym.
"Yes, thank you."
"Ilia, it's your last day?"
They did an in-service.
I got it.
"'Kay, let's take a look."
Sats down to 92.
- Turn on the suction.
- It's on.
"- No, it's not."
- I have it on high.
I'm not getting anything here.
"Inez, go next door and help Dr. Lockhart with the chest tube."
I'm not allowed to work with any of the nurses now?
The patient is paralyzed.
I can't see the cords.
- I need suction.

"Oh, it's my brother's."
He gave it to me when he met Antonio and moved to Florence.
I didn't know your brother was...
An expatriate.
I know.
It's surprising.
Okay.

What's he keeping in here?
FINN:

Him and the previous manager added this door years ago.
"God, please, oh, please, don't let him be in there."
There's no way.
"If there was a dead body in there, we'd be able to smell it."
"(GASPS) Oh, God."
What?
Is he in there?
"Oh, my God."
"Close it, close it."
What happened to him?
It looked like he was burned.
"Yeah, I don't know about that."
Did you see his suit?
It was fine.
It wasn't even touched.
Isn't it obvious?
"I mean, you read his journal."
He broke the cardinal rule.
You don't fuck with time.
"Jasper, please take his hat off."
It's my thinking cap.
What the hell is there to think about?
"We need to call the police, guys."
Hang on.

"Hey, Henry."
Put your gun down.
It's all good.
"Hey, hey, hey, hey."
"Peaceful, peaceful."
Chill out.
Calm down.
Now I've shared something with you.
I need you to share something with me.
Where's Akan going?
Now that is my ego talking to yours.
"What do you want... higher self, ego?"
"Higher self, ego?"

Who is Henry?
You wanna go on the bike?
You can go on the bike.
Is that her mother?
I say yes.
And who's that Ghena?
Why does it smell of wine here?
What wine?
We had a drink with Mashka.
Today is her birthday.
We went to a cafe with the girls.
One bottle of champagne for the 5 of us.
"You do remember Mashka, don't you?"
"We came with her last year, remember?"
A little blond one.
- What have you got on your head?
- Grandma's present.
Take it off.
Grandma's present is for winter.
Go to your room.
Get away from the jam with your spoon!

"Oh, what great caviar I cooked!"
"Taste it, daughter."
I don't want it now.
"- Taste it now, I said!"
"- Come on, mama..."
Why does Irishka say that I got a big nose?
Is it really big?
That's how they joke now.
I wish you heard what she says to me.
And who is that Ghena?
Ghena is my colleague.
We work together.
"- Got your own John Dillinger, huh?"
"- Yeah, and, like, Capone too."
Be it ever so humble.
"Yeah, where is Miss Sexy Feet?"
She's in that nest over there.
"Oh, well, you go on."
I'll wait here and observe.
Not like this.
This has to be done right.
Come on.
"Well, I see you've cleaned this up."
"Oh, yeah."
"Here, why don't you have a seat over here, Jon?"
"- No, thanks."
- You want a cold drink?
- Yeah.
What do you got?
- Let me see.
Got a little apple juice and a piece of watermelon left over from the Fourth.
July Fourth?
"- Well, this is almost..."
"- Yeah, I know."
It's a little dried out.
I'll pass.
"You know, I could do it like in the movies."
I could walk over and borrow a cup of sugar or flour.
"Yeah, if you could find a cup."
Are you kidding?
I know where everything is in here.
Lucky it was that pole and not my leg.
"Now, what do you think?"
Sugar or flour?
- Hello?
- It's me.
You ready?
"Listen, tell Michael not to let the sauce stick."
Keep stirring it.
- Henry says don't let the sauce stick.
- I'm stirring it.
"- Listen, you know what to do?"
"- Yeah, yeah."
"Don't ""yeah, yeah"" me, Lois."

We gotta have a name that scares.
- Yeah.

How'd you do what you done?
"Well, I really didn't do anything."
Yeah.
You a magician or something?
No.
You want to join our gang?
I'm sorry.
I'm looking for someone.
- Thanks anyway.
"- Aw, sure."
I guess you're like the rest of them.
You've heard we're a nothing gang.
"Yeah, well we ain't always gonna be nothing."
Someday we're gonna be the toughest.
Take over the whole territory.
Someday they're gonna run when they see us coming down the block.
All right.
"- Maggie, why don't you go?"
"- No, I'm good..."
"- I don't have a partner, so."
- We'll all be your partner.
"- Come on, we're all doing it."

- It's just you!
- You're lonely!
- Nobody wants you!
- You're lonely.
And everyone forgot about you.
"Don't say a word without a lawyer, even if they beat you."
- Stay strong.

It's quiet now.
Maybe they moved on.
Or... maybe they're just faking us out.
There we go.
Locked and loaded.
Just how mama likes it.
"Taylor, a gun ?"
Where did you get that ?
I know that what he did was wrong.
It was stupid and I was angry at him.
But you were his best friend.
You should've helped him.
You were a little girl then.
I'm a big girl now.
I gave him a chance and he blew it.
You liar.
He's the one who gave you a chance.
He made you thrive on stage and gave you the best parts.
He took you places you thought you'd never reach.
"He let you dance and sing, the best thing you ever did."
I loved your father and mother very much.
How can you even talk about love?
"Relax, it'll be easier if you relax."
My love.
We'll try again.
Help me.
- Okay.
Gently.
- Okay.
"Okay, never mind."
I can't.
"Never mind, my love."
I'll get some bandages.
"Tell me the truth, Daddy."
"What, Gonki?"
About Mommy.
Tell me about Mommy.
"Say it, Daddy."
Mommy is dead.
Say it again.
[âª]
(rennes:)I will render my decision shortly.
[âª]
"Recover the astronomicons,"
Eliminate bailey and fox.
[âª]
"By now, da veiga must have"
Handed over the dagger and
The scabbard to the gural nataz.
Yup.
They've probably decoded the runic
And have sent out their goons.
Probably.
Do you have to agree with everything I say?
Sure.
[wind blowing]
"Syd, look."
[door unlocking] [door slamming]
Guard!
I don't want him in here!
I don't think either of us have a choice.
I gambled and lost.
[âª]
"This rock,"
It's different from the others.
What are you thinking?
"It's been brought here,"
Quarried elsewhere?
This is sarsen stone.
Just like at...
Stonehenge.
Hah.
"You'll get your ID card, then you can tell your lovely Harald all."
He will make you forget everything.
Forget?
What can he make me forget?
I have nothing but hate left for him.
"But I won't let him forget, I'll show him"
He's in for a shock when he sees what he's done to me.
Hold on for a minute!
What is it?
Get dressed and hurry away!
My brother-in-law.
Damn!
Is there nobody here?
"You're sleeping in broad daylight, right?"
"But not in my underwear, Karl!"
"Also, still cheeky!"
I drove through the night.
And you've arrived 3 days too late.
Father John!
What?
- I said:
Father John!
Are you crazy?
Told you:
Not in my underwear!
In what hospital is she then?
Hospital?
The birth took place here.
Karl!
Mommy!
"You have a son, Mr John!"
Why is he in such a hurry?
"And because I was kind of black, you think you can dump me."
What the hell.
2-11 to 2-10.
2-11 to 2-10.
2-11 to 2-10.
"Dale, where you at?"
(HARMONICA PLAYING)
"Hey, June!"
Junie!
How you doing?
You got something for me?
"How you doing, Mr. Charlie?"
"Hello, is this Ronnie?"
"Ronnie, this is Ray."
"Listen, is Fantasia there?"
"Yeah, Lila."
Where is she?
"Well, have you got a number out there for her?"
"Yeah, listen, give it to me, all right?"
Yeah.
Ronnie?
"Ronnie, come here."
Ma'am?
Come here.
I got to go.
"Ronnie, now, if you know something about Lila being here, you tell these gentlemen."
"Your sister's in trouble, but I don't want you being in trouble."
"No, ma'am."
I don't know nothing about that.
"Ronnie, June Hawkins down the street just told me he was out most of the night digging frogs south of town."
"When he was driving back, he saw you driving along in front him, and Byron, he was with you."
"Now, where had you and Byron been at 4:00 in the morning?"
"Clara, please."
"L""ll do anything."
"Clara, look at me."
Do you hear that?
That rattle?
Will you take it in?
I can take it in this weekend.
Fine.
"L""ll have dinner ready in an hour."
Spaghetti.
- The casserole is in the oven.
"- Let""s brown it."
"Do you want a picture of him, Bobbi?"
"Let""s just sneak on up here and get a little peek at him."
Get your camera ready.
"That""s him?"
"Danny Caine, Mr. Hidden Agenda?"
"That""s Pam Caine""s husband?"
That guy hired us six months ago.
"We""re in it now, so we might as well go for it."
"L""m going to nail this deadbeat."
"Baby, thanks for letting me come home."
Clara told us everything.
"So when Clara called, your mother and I knew what we had to do."
You are our son.
Clara is our daughter.
"- We""ll get through this together."
"- It""s over with that woman."
"- Of course it""s over."
"- Isn""t it, David?"
"You married a beauty queen, David."
Miss Colombia Houston.
Excellent!
What's wrong now?
You've suffered internal injuries!
You're joking!
Touch your rib cage.
Does it hurt?
No.
No?
What about this spot?
"Yes, it hurts a bit."
"You've breathing problems, too."
"Yes, how do you know?"
I think you trained much too hard.
I must try to relieve your tension.
You'll be okay when that's done.
Does it hurt?
No!
It doesn't!
What's wrong?
"It doesn't hurt, does it?"
What are you doing?
Trying to kill me?
It's burning...
Stop it!
It won't hurt.
Have you finished?
Feeling better?
You're great!
Of course.
You dare to hit me?
How many hands you want to use?
You're magnificent!
"Oh, look."
The Granola family left this.
- What is that?
- It's a native American dream catcher.
It's supposed to keep all the nightmares out and only let the good dreams in to protect your home.
It's flypaper for nightmares?
Mm-hmm.
- Let's keep it.
- Yeah?
"Hang it where, the car?"
It's not much of a home.
Maybe it's time we get a real place.
Are you saying...
Why not?
We've been on the road long enough.
Maybe it's time we retire the Bonnie and Clyde act.
So I think...
I think it's time.
Together?
- Don't you wanna?
"- Like where, Neverland?"
I'm serious.
We could do this.
Where?
Where?
I'll tell you where.
Close your eyes and point.
Whatever spot you pick... that's our home.
Tallahassee.
We got a winner.
Is it near a beach?
"Yeah, it's Florida."
"Fi, we need to get the biggest armed response we can get at that place."
How big?
Very big.
Jabbar's guys are armed to the teeth
And aren't gonna go down without a fight.
I think I have an idea.
Remember that burner phone we gave your mom?
Hello?
"Mom, I don't have a lot of time."
"I need you to say, in a loud, clear voice,"
"""1212 Bayshore Avenue."
"Yes, Michael, I can be there."""
Are you sure?
I don't know if anybody's told you --
I know Riley bugged the house.
It's what I'm counting on.
I need to get the CIA to show up someplace fast.
Can you do that for me?
"Yes, Michael."
1212 Bayshore Avenue.
I can be there.
"Thanks, Mom."
I'll be in touch when I can.
M-Michael --
"We lost his pulse, Sam!"
What?
I can't find a pulse!
"There's nothing, man."
Nothing.
Nothing.
Do it!
Do it!
"No, this was never closed like this."
"Oh, there's a lock here."
- Hello?
- Hello?
Is it open?
"Oh, hooray."
Thank you.
"- Hi, I'm sorry about the holdup."
- Thank you.
- Let me get out of your way.
- Thank you very much.
Do you... do you know Anne Tyng?
- No.
"Hi, Rob Frey."
"- Hi, nice to meet you."
- An honor to meet you.
- Anne was the... the architect with Lou on the project.
- Unbelievable.
- Wonderful.
Wonderful.
Okay.
If it's okay if we just want to look around?
"Oh, absolutely."
Gosh.
"- It's painted now, huh?"
- Terrible.
"I mean, it's just such a shame."
"""Dearest Annie,"
"""I must build one of the great buildings of the time."
"""You must help me build this particular building."
"""I doubt if I can do it without you."
"""Just think how low architecture has gotten down."
- She's beautiful.
Toss your oars up.
We should say goodbye.
"Once we sail, we won't have a chance to talk."
"Goodbye, Father."
"Goodbye, Harvey."
- Boat!
"- Aye, aye, sir."
"Carry on, Mr. Crawford."
Boat ahoy!
"Captain's jolly boat coming alongside, sir."
- Full company aboard.
- Good.
This is Midshipman Crawford.
You must be proud to serve with your father.
Take the captain's son below and introduce him to his messmates.
Stand by to hoist.
Pass the word that Crawford is to be treated the same.
"Understood, sir."
Lots of women aboard.
"Wives, I reckon."
"Hello, my love."
Who are they?
Them?
They're the pressed men.
Follow me.
"Bye-bye, love."
Get those wretched women off!
- Hoist away!
- Dawlish!
Swing them over!
- Clear the deck!

What's the matter Mrs.James?
You better get some good rest tonight.
It's these the hard shifts.
"I had some bad news this morning, Miss."
My Jim's missing.
Oh!
Try not to worry.
I'm sure he'll turn up.
Oh!
"I do hope so, Miss."
I expect I'll feel better when I have cuppa tea.
That's right.
It's finishing time now.
A million bullets for dispatch by the morning!
?
But I tell you the girls have done 10 hours today already.
Yes.
I hear myself urgently.
But you expect these girls to run 14 hours on stretch.
Alright!
I'll ask them.
She doesn't have to ask us.
A million bullets by the morning!
Alright!
"Come on girls, it's gotta be done!"
Stop!
Stop there.
Stop right there.
"Just go to the bathroom, get the scissors and cut me loose."
Nothing bad has happened.
Cut me loose.
"I want you to say 10 times, ""I won't listen to my brother."""
I won't listen to my brother.
I won't...
"Louder, please."
I won't listen to my brother.
I won't listen...
I said louder.
Our mom wouldn't do that.
More clearly.
Elias...
I'm sorry.
Again.
"I'm sorry, Elias."
( turns off video )
Come now.
Please.
Cut me loose.
What happened to your nose?
Nothing.
Nothing serious.
"There, you see?"
You'll cut me loose and I'll make you breakfast.
"Cut my feet loose, they hurt."
Lukas?
"I know it's hard, but we'll make it."
"Come, just cut my feet loose."
"Come on, it'll take a sec."
I'll make breakfast.
Just cut it.
It's the bloody guerrilleros.
We can't hit them from here.
Call the helicopter.
Unit 47 to helicopter.
Please respond.
Can you hear me?
- Loud and clear.
- Those bastards are in control of the dam.
"Yes, we know."
They've taken out the guards.
We'll try to attack them from here.
Please support us.
We've got no heavy weapons.
We must try to get closer first.
Over.
- What are you waiting for?
Attack!
- Hurry up!
"- Hurry up, Jaime."
They're coming back.
- All right.
Why can't you throw hand grenades at them?
We'll be above them soon.
They're not going to enjoy this.
They'll be here in a minute.
"Hurry up, damn it!"
"Oh, my God!"
They've hit the helicopter!
Is it bad?
Can you get up?
I need help!
José is injured!
-It's nothing.
"Hey, it's me."
Why can't you tell me?
Okay.
Sit down.
There's this woman that I like a lot.
But it can't happen.
She's not a Tribbiani?
No!
So is she someone from work?
Yes.
"Well, does she like you?"
Sometimes I think she could.
But I can't do anything about it.
Why not?
It's complicated.
She was with this other guy for a long time.
Someone from work too.
I could never do that to the guy.
We're friends.
"Wait, I thought you hated everyone at work."
"No, no."
I only say that..
so Chandler won't feel threatened because I'm his only friend.
Excuse me?
"Sorry, sorry."
And I'm your only friend too.
"So this guy she used to go out with, is he still in love with her?"
"-No, I don't think so."
-Okay.
Is he a good guy?
"Yeah, he's the best."
"Well, I said maybe, but... look at his pant cuff, Tony."
Is that a gun?
Could be.
We have guns.
Not Ellie.
Uh... she packed hers.
"No, actually, mine's on me."
"Well, I-I thought you said you weren't comfortable traveling with it."
"Well, I wasn't at first, but it's become kind of a habit."
"Listen, this guy could be law enforcement, so let's show him ours and ask to see his."
"What, guns?"
Badges.
Hey.
Sorry to bother you.
"Again, you mean?"
Yeah.
"Uh, but this time I need to see some I.D."
"Well, too bad."
I'm not Navy.
She asked you a question.
You're making a big mistake.
Freeze.
Hands where I can see them.
Oh.
Okay.
"Well, what's his deal?"
I'm an air marshal.
Mike Beers.
Thanks for blowing my cover.
"Sorry I drew on you, Mr. Beers."
These two kind of...
forced my hand.
I don't think so.
[snaps] Go wait by the door.
So we have a deal?
"You cross me, and I will skin you and your girlfriend alive and make myself a brand-new pair of calzones."
- Whatever those are.
"- [man] One, two, three, four!"
[rock music plays]
- He bought it.
"- Yes, he did."
"More importantly, he had no idea it was you."
"Yeah, but was all that really necessary?"
I am not whipped.
"It's all part of the play, Richard."
- Not my play.
- No.
Uncle Eddie's play.
[upbeat music] [applause]
Welcome back.
"Today we are doing a very special show,"
"""Foxy at 50... and Beyond."""
"- Welcome, guys."
- [applause]
"So, Dr. Jane, you have a hot new book out there titled,"
"""When I Grow Up I Want to be a JILF."""
"It's GILF, Donny."
As in grandmother I'd like to f...
- Uh...
- A GILF.
- Right.
- [laughter]
"Today, 50 is an entirely new landscape."
Put a fun spin on it.
"You're a pervert, Sid."
You need to get help.
I know.
"Right, we have a big case to solve, something you're not going to have to worry about now, eh?"
No.
Big cases and police work.
"Sleet, don't say that."
I'm really bad at breaking bad news.
"Yeah, yeah, no fucking joke!"
That's why I thought I'd get you to do it.
"Yeah, really fucking funny!"
"OK, I, I'm sorry, Sid."
"Be careful, yeah?"
Are we going now?
"Yeah, we go."
Come on.
"We'll just leave him here, he'll be fine."
Good luck.
Thanks.
"Bye, Sid."
Sorry.
Don't steal anything while you're here.
"I got a call from Bomb Squad, they'd found Cowell."
The only way to deactivate the bomb was typing in the name of the kidnapper.
"Miley, Jessie or Sugar."
Time for a hero!
Dermot O'Leary's here!
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!
"O'Leary, this is it."
Yeah.
"Sorry, it does that sometimes."
My wife got the good car.
"So, how you doing?"
"Well, Stan, we need to talk."
I know.
I can't do this anymore.
What?
"You're nice and sweet, Christine, but..."
I just don't think this is working out for me.
What?
Why?
"Well, you know, I haven't been around much, and..."
I think you just might be a little too fast for me.
Fast?
It's been three years!
I got a kid that goes to this school.
I got to think of my reputation.
Your reputation?
If anything...
I helped your reputation.
Giving some of this is the best thing that ever happened to you.
You did me.
You know it!
You made me a mix tape.
"Oh, my stomach hurts."
"Yeah, I would die."

It's a great neighborhood.
And you are lucky to have such a stallion at your disposal.
"No, your needs are fine."
It's your neediness that's the problem.
- Then why didn't you say that?
- I didn't want you to make a scene.
You didn't want me to make a scene?
You didn't want me to make a scene?
Ha!
You dump Fez!
I dump fries!
There's your scene!
Here's a dollar.
Sorry about the scene.
"Oh, poor Fez."
Too depressed to leave his room.
- That's it.
"You guys, we gotta cheer him up."
- Knock first.
"If Fez is alone, I'm guessing he's not wearing pants."
"Oh, awesome!"
Wait.
Let's catch him.
"- Oh, wow."
- Wow!
Check out all this great stuff.
"Oh, my God."
Is that a race-car bed?
- I call shotgun!
- Ay!
Oh!
"Fezzie, come on out."
I can't.
"Well, you've been very nice, Mr. Thornton."
I
"- I suppose I was a little difficult, but..."
"- well, losing someone you've grown to love isn't-"
"- Yes, I know."
I'm sorry I was so rough.
"Well, I"
- I'm sorry I was so unpleasant.
Mmm.
I'm sorry that I can't think of a thing to be sorry about.
Ohh!
I suppose you've got friends and relatives back in the states.
No.
My husband's all I had.
- Why do you ask?
- Because we got a proposition to make.
Yes?
We know what brought you up here.
We've known all along.
"I mean, old man Blake's claim."
But how?
How could you possibly know?
"Give me that map, Shorty."
Yeah.
Did you ever see this?
"Or, uh, something like it?"
Yes.
"Yes, I've seen the original."
This won't do you any good.
It isn't correct.
I know it.
That's why I was going to suggest that-
"Good morning, Miss Simpson."
- How are you doing this morning?
- Fantastic.
"In English, please, Nadine."
You're not going to ask me about Gary?
Yes.
Your Internet romance.
How's it going?
- Yesterday he said he loves me.
- What?
Really?
"He signed off, "" Love, Gary."""
"Nadine, you mustn't read too much into that."
"Americans use the word ""love"" very casually."
"We say ""I love you"" like you say ""Good-bye."""
""" Hi."
You must be Gary.
I'm Nadine.
"I came all the way from Brazil to see you only."""
Just to see you.
- Okay.
Just to see you.
- Right.
"""I know that I don't know you very much."""
- Very well.
- Thank you.
No.
I don't know you very well.
"- "" But you don't know me either."""
- Ei-ther.
""" But I am sure, deep inside my heart... that you are the person of my life."""
"You know, you don't say ""person of my life."""
Why don't someone go to the Chinaman's and bring back a load of chop suey?

-Poker is so fascinating.
could I kibitz?
-You could not.
Why don't you women go on up to Eunice's?
-How long is this game going to continue?
-till we get ready to quit.
You should call it quits after one more hand.
-Go up to Eunice's.
"-Hey, that's my coat."
"That's not fun, stanley."
It makes me so mad when he does that in front of people.
-I think I'II go bathe.
-Again?
My nerves are in knots.
Is the bathroom occupied?
I don't know.
"-Oh, good evening."
"-Oh, hello."
"BIanche, this is harold mitchell."
"-This is my sister, BIanche DuBois."
-How do you do.
"-How do you do, Miss DuBois."
"-How's your mother now, Mitch?"
Blow!
You too!
"Oh, turn the lights out before you go, Stoker!"
"You made a mistake, Stoker!"
A bad mistake!
I don't mean about Nelson!
"Three, four wins and nobody will remember what happened!"
"But I paid for something tonight, and I didn't get it!"
"I don't like that, Stoker!"
I didn't know anything!
Tiny didn't say anything!
He know he was to go in the third!
I give Tiny the dough an hour ago!
- Fifty bucks!
- I didn't get any...
- I bet you didn't!
- Hold it!
You get dressed!
We'll talk about this later!
- Anything else?
- A couple of cans of soup!
- What kind?
- Vegetable!
"Oh, and two bottles of beer!"
That'll be $ 1 !
13 with three cents to the governor!
That's $ 1 !
16!
One-sixteen!
You ought to throw in a floorshow!
There he is!
"All right, Stoker, we'll talk!"
But I thought maybe we could make an exception.
Or not.
"You are not helping your cause here, son."
"Stand down, or--"
Or what?
You'll send me to my room?
And I'm not your son.
I'm not even his.
I thought I was his partner.
But not anymore.
Guess they're right about you three.
You're not ready.
[COMPUTER BEEPING]
Superman to Justice League.
There's been an explosion at Project Cadmus.
It's on fire.
I've had my suspicions about Cadmus.
This may present the perfect opportunity to--
ZATARA:
Zatara to Justice League.
The sorcerer Wotan is using the Amulet of Aten to blot out the sun.
Requesting full League response.
-Superman?
-It's a small fire.
-Local authorities have it under control
-Then Cadmus can wait.
All Leaguers rendezvous at Zatara's coordinates.
Batman out.
-Stay put.
-What?
Why?
This is a League mission.
All right.
- I can't see Carrasco or his men.
- They must have separated.
There they are.
They'll hit the mines any second now.
The road is mined!
Hurry up!
Get on this bus!
Come on!
- They're going back.
- Hurry up!
We must get away from here!
Hurry up!
We must get away!
Come on!
Fire!
- There they are.
- They're coming.
Attention!
This is a message for Enrique Carrasco and his men.
Don't shoot!
I repeat:
Don't shoot!
General Benítez wants to talk to you.
Attention!
This is a message for Enrique Carrasco and his men.
Don't shoot!
General Benítez wants to talk to you.
"In order to avoid any further bloodshed,"

- Hello?
"- Hi, this is Gigi."
- Gigi?
- Gigi Phillips.
- Huh?
"- I, um had the dentist pen."
Right.
Hey.
How you doing?
- I'm really sorry to bug you.
- That's okay.
You had some really good insights and I wanted to ask you a question.
"Okay, look, now I need to be harsh with you."
"Conor's never gonna be interested in you, Geege."
"No, I know."
This is about Jarrad.
Jarrad.
So we meet at happy hour and he's completely charming...
"Hey, give me two seconds, okay?"
"Two seconds, hold on."
Let me guess.
He said:
"""The only thing happy about this hour is you."""
He might have used some derivative of that.
[CHUCKLES]
"So he says he's going to call, but then he gives me his card and he says..."
"Oh, he's not interested."
- You don't even know if he's called.
"- Oh, did he?"
No.
- But I honestly think he's expect...
- Okay.
What about us?
"It's always Jacob, Jacob, Jacob, all the time."
"You can't change things now, Anna."
Hello?
Why are you sitting here?
Sweetheart!
It's lovely to see you.
- I can't stand it when we fight.
- Me neither.
But we need to talk about this properly.
- Yes.
- Like grown ups.
"- Of course, sweetie."
- So stop calling me sweetie.
- What can I call you then?
- You could call me Anna.
Okay.
Did you marry Jorgen for my sake?
So that I had a father?
No.
I love Jorgen.
Do you?
A lot.
So everything with Jacob was a mistake?
- No.
- What was it then?
"I was very in love with Jacob, but I was also very unhappy."
About what?
About being in love with him.
We just hurt each other all the time.
When you told me Jorgen wasn't my father   why didn't you say Jacob was?
Maybe because...
1000)}TODAY
Where am I?
At the hospital.
You were in a coma.
I can't feel my legs.
Don't worry.
It will gradually come back.
Do you know your name?
I think.
So?
Lucy Clarsen.
Do you remember what happened to you?
What is it?
Why are you staring at me?
You're a miracle.
268)}What's going on?
268)}There's nothing more we can do.
The plant is flooded.
268)}You can't just leave.
You said... 268)}You should do the same.
There's no point in staying.
There must be something we can do.
Nope.
We tried everything.
The power won't come back.
Crowbar.
What the hell are you doing?
Please have a seat.
I have nothing to offer.
Will the power be back soon?
You can come to the Helping Hand.
We have a generator. and dorm rooms if you need to stay.
- Good?
It's nociIIo.
- delicious.
- Next?
- The Scapece house.
We'II slide it underthe door.
"No, we have to hand-deIiverit."
"If they offer coffee, we'II give a MiIanese no: categorical."
- How much sugar?
.
"- Two, please."
"You say ""no, thank you."""
Got any fruitjuice?
It's lemon juice he made himself.
"Here's yourregistered letter, yourreceipt, the juice was very good, maybe a bit strong."
It's his Postamat.
"That's wonderful, but we have to run."
Even I didn't understand that.
Goodbye.
Good thing it was a MiIanese no!
"If it was NeapoIitan, we'd have stayed for dinner?"
.
SorrowfuI Mother...
immaculate Virgin...
DeIiverus from evil...
Where are you goin'?
Where are we goin'?
"Cyprus, a Ietterfrom Ciro."
"Ciro, a Ietterfrom Cyprus."
- Want some coffee?
"- No, thank you."
"When they say ""Want some coffee?"", ""No, thank you."""
Say it.
Let's go.
Everywhere.
Everywhere.
Even though-
Even though- We're scared.
We're scared.
'Cause it's life- It's life.
And it's happening.
"It's really, really happening... right now."
All right.
"Now let's kiss to make it real, okay?"
Okay.
"So, how is your art project?"
- Is it in the museum yet?
- No.
That's not how it works.
"You know, they have to know about your work-"
"I would just march in there and show it to them, you know?"
No one is going to live your life for you.
Okay.
"That's not how itworks, but okay."
"So, how's Ellen?"
"Oh, she's wonderful."
I can't sleep at night thinking about her.
I just wish I had met her 50 years sooner.
- Yeah.
- But then maybe I needed... 70 years of life... to be ready for a woman like Ellen.
This rug is dirty.
Everyone get a box on the way out.
Ow.
Ow.
"Oh, no!"
"Oh, boy."
"Oh, oh..."
"Oh, boy, oh, boy!"
Ow.
"Hey, kiddies."
Got your juice.
"Oh, thanks, Ethan."
"Thanks so much, buddy."
We can always count on you for juice and juice-related things and... really just juice.
But we love juice.
Are you kids okay?
"Oh, we're just great, thanks."
Last juice of the day.
Great.
"Uh, cran-apple?"
Wait a minute.
Something's up.
Why are you out of breath?
"Well, my trachea constricts due to histamines that my body produces..."
"Okay, okay, Rudy, stop talking."
Why are your shoes muddy?
Because I'm-I'm poor.
"Oh, I'm so poor."
And why are you in your underwear?
Because I am rich.
There's been a burglary.
Somebody stole my chocolate!
I am very shocked by that.
"Okay, what was rule number two?"
Always believe in yourself?
No!
Huh?
You're the type of woman... who needs a man you can control.
"Well, guess what..."
I'm not that man.
I'll show you!
You little whore!
"Oh, Jesus Christ."
"Emma, let me see your hand."
You keep the fuck away from me!
Get the fuck away!
How the fuck could you let her get out alone?
"You crossed the line, John."
You put the girl in jeopardy.
"Yeah, well, I didn't lose her."
She's reckless because of you!
To get to you!
"Now, I'm gonna go get her, bring her home... and handcuff her to the fucking banister!"
She's gone!
"Oh, man!"
She's probably at the EI.
Come on.
No.
No way!
You stay out of this!
You fucked up enough already!
Come on.
Couldn't you have said something... she wanted to hear?
Anything?
Couldn't you have lied?
I did lie.
Help!
Help me!
- What?
"Cousin, cousin, where did you find Mickey?"
In a train.
- What transport?
- Me
Are you an innocent?
I could say I'm a virgin man.
Not for long.
It hurts.
I bleed.
"No, you're enjoying it."
That's me bleeding.
You come when I will.
Ready?
"Leon, do not expect."
"Forget the address, forget everything."
Mickey is doing well.
Begone!
I'd like to ...
I can not ...
Yes?
Do not give money here.
Autographs and postcards Post exclusively.
Hungry?
The ladies are asleep.
Do not make any noise.
Come into the kitchen.
"Coffee, chocolate, tea?"
"Below, we, you know All of your disasters."
"Floods, terrorism, wars, famine, innocent martyrs."
"Propaganda, we would laugh."
We want to see.
"Okay, I will search for her."
I will also go to look around again.
I'm leaving first.
It's still my official duties.
Go there and look around.
Miss Kim Mi Jin!
"Oh, you are..."
You okay?
Wait a minute.
I'm with the Seoul District Prosecutors Special Forces.
Prosecutor Kim Yeong Ju.
I'm not a pervert.
Seoul District Prosecutors Special Forces?
Is it true?
There has been too many impostors recently.
It's true.
But this time what are you working as?
This dress...
Not working anymore.
"I'm currently working as a country official, I'm afraid I can't say more."
A country official?
Can it be you're a police woman?
That is also a secret.
I'm in a hurry to find someone.
I'm sorry.
That...
"The woman who was with you the last time you interfered,"
Where did you take her?
Da Hye!
Do you know how to contact her?
Da Hye!
Da Hye!
Like where?
Neverland?
I'm serious.
We could do this.
Where?
- Where?
I'll tell you where.
- Pfft.
Close your eyes and point.
"Whatever spot you pick, that's our home."
Tallahassee.
We got a winner.
Is it near a beach?
"Yeah, it's Florida."
Everything's near a beach.
"Okay, then."
Tallahassee it is.
Tallahassee it is!
Are you sure?
Is this what you really want?
What I really want is you.
What is that?
It keeps the time.
You have somewhere to be?
We can mark watches.
Take turns sleeping.
"We'll most likely have to walk through the night again, so we should rest while we can."
- I'll take first shift.
- I'll stay up with you.
Okay.
When's the last time you slept?
I don't really sleep now.
"Okay, guys, let's fly this thing out of here."
To where?
We would never get it far enough away.
Maybe the Waverider can.
"Rip, we need..."
Rip?
Rip!
What are you doing?
"I'm flying the Waverider into the sun,"
- with the meteor on board.
- And you on it.
I guess this is good-bye.
"It's been a pleasure, Captain."
"Likewise, Dr. Palmer."
"But you brought us all into this, man."
"Which is why I'm doing this alone, Mr. Jackson."
I'll have no one else die for my choices.
This isn't going to bring Snart back.
I don't want to lose another friend.
"I appreciate that, Mr. Rory."
"I must say, it's been an honor to serve as your cap..."
Rip.
Daddy?
Miranda.
I...
Where...
"I'm still here, Captain."
"I know you are, Gideon."
May I share something with you?
I'm not ready to die.
Me neither.
Which reminds me...
Don't worry.
"What are you doing, you stupid girl!"
She's very beautiful.
- Who is she?
- Your daughter-in-law.
It's 10 and she is still sleeping.
Had too much to drink last night?
"She is an alcoholic, mom."
"She and Gurmeet Singh will get along so well, I can't tell you."
Good morning.
Good morning.
"Gurmeet, Saira."
"Saira, Gurmeet."
My mom.
"I seek your blessings, mom."
She also pays respect!
"That's enough, drama queen."
I'll talk to you later.
Bye.
Are you alright?
I'm done for.
What happened?
Look at your hand.
What's happening?
"Quick to jump into bed, quick to propose."
- Awesome.
- Then what!
Yesterday we met your parents.
Today we met mine.
"So now we are kind of engaged, huh?"
Are you asking or telling me?
Do you have full on attraction?
That dog belongs to me.
"I bought him, Smith, and I don't allow my dogs to be shot."
"That is, of course, unless I shoot them myself."
That's all right.
I'll give you twice what you paid for him.
He's not for sale.
"Just as you say, my good man."
Just as you say.
"Well, what others have you?"
"- Uh, here."
Hitch 'em up.
- These two will do.
I ordered a collapsible bathtub from Seattle.
Did it get here?
It's a bathtub.!
It's a bathtub.!
You sweet meats.
You're losing your home.
Easy with ye.
Come on.
Out.
Come on.
Come on.
"Come on, Harmon."
"Here ya are, Mr. Smith."
We thought it was something to pile wood in.
The only bath a person gets up here is by the sweat of the brow.
How interesting.
Mush!
"Been a great pleasure, gentlemen."
A great pleasure!
Nice guys.
Defend us in battle.
Be our safeguard against the wickedness and snares of the devil.
Where is she?
Where's Hyo-jin?
!
Hyo-jin!
What is it?
Where are you headed in the dark of night?
I'm asking you.
Where is my daughter?
Where is she?
Girl about this tall?
Yeah.
Hyo-jin?
That's right.
She's possessed by an evil spirit.
The old woman tells me the Jap is a ghost.
He's trying to suck her blood dry...
Shut the fuck up!
"Answer me, bitch!"
Where is Hyo-jin?
- Have you seen the Jap?
- Where's my daughter?
"At your home, where else?"
She's not home.
She is.
She just got back.
Don't go now- or you'll all die.
"If you go now, your whole family will perish."
What are you talking about?
The Jap is waiting for you... to annihilate your family.
He's dead.
Drink.
Passports.
"Yes, I know,  but..."
If we had the passports
She would understand who we are.
"I repeat that he is our king, Nicolas III, king of Belgium."
What will we do about our king?
What did the Queen want us to grasp?
Its vitality...
And his spontaneity.
And smiles.
And smiles.
We need an official version of this story.
Why not the truth?
Ready?
His Majesty?
What a relief to hear his voice.
"Yes, he is here, right next to me."
"No, I mean, that's right..."
"There is Mr. Moreau over here, I take it."
Ready.
His Majesty?
"Yes...  yes, we're fine."
And you?
"I mean, kingdom?"
And the political situation?
"Yes, I understand..."
The king is fine.
We have a small problem.
"Yes, you too, I imagine..."
Excuse me if I stop...
"No, we are not in Istanbul."
You've got your million.
"No, jim, i haven't."
"Oh, of course you have."
What do you mean?
I gave it all to nick.
"I had to, jim."
He needed money desperately.
I had to help him.
Don't you see?
"Sure, i see."
Try to understand.
I understand.
I'm just beginning to understand.
"We know you're in there, jim fisk!"
"Come out, you yellow-bellied crook!"
What's the matter?
Are you afraid?
Come on out of there!
"Jim, you can't go out there."
They'll mob you!
You think i'm afraid of a mob?
Jim!
"You stay here, josie."
This is one time the colonel is going to be at the front of his regiment.
Jim!
Jim!
"What's the matter, boys?"
Losing your nerve?
"This is no joke, fisk!"
This is no joke!
"If it is a joke, it's on me!"
You can't talk yourself out of this!
- and a marquee.
"- Oh, Jesus."
You're the only one offering the moon and the stars.

"- Tony, are you OK?"
"- I'm top-notch, buddy."
Enjoying your night out?
Me too.
"Hey, Nips."
"- Don't call her Nips, Tony."
"- Why, what you gonna do?"
"I'm, uh, objecting."
Strongly.
- Come on...
"- Tony, what are you doing?"
"Isn't she pretty, hey man?"
Tony.
You two make such a sweet couple!
Out of all the world's famous lovers
- Anthony and Cleopatra...
"Taylor and Burton, Jordan and Peter..."
Stop it.
Bert and Ernie...
I would say that you two are quite possibly the greatest snog history has so far encountered.
"What is wrong with you, Tony?"
Are you OK?
What is it with you people and the concept of OK?
"I mean, we're a fucking threesome, aren't we?"
You know... peas in a pod.
"A fucking family, that's what we are."
D'you need to sit down?
Just calm down.
No...
This was not the job.
I got business to finish.
You stay here.
How do I get to the Oval Office?
Take the stairs to the ground floor..
you go to the end of the West Colonnade.
There's an air strike coming!
Get them out of here.
Go!
You heard the man!
Tour's over.
I didn't sign up for this nuclear bullshit.
I'm gonna go and I'm gonna get the money myself.
Hey!
Hey!
What?
You think I put my country through this for money?
I hate mercenaries.
It's about time.
I choose the pen!
Come here.
Get up.
Up!
Put your hand..
Weapon system unlocked.
Enter presidential launch code.
"Mr. President, please wake up, wake up."
Please!
"Sir, we're at DEFCON 1."
The nuclear football in the White House went live.
That's impossible.
It's happening.
I can not hear you!
Does your heart hurt?
Let me have a look.
"The old warriors believed, that the heart was sacred."
"That if a hunter tasted his flesh,"
I could look at the spiritual world.
But I do not see any spiritual world.
"Maybe she was the only one, who had no soul."
Food for the creatures of God.
"You disappoint me, Bishop."
I expected much more from Mara's husband.
You are more trash than the man.
Barbarous and cruel.
A daughter.
"Our daughter, Mara."
"Come on, Bishop."
Follow me.
How can you leave us alone ?
!
Are you my daughter?
My name is Aluxia.
I have been waiting for you.
- I'm dead?
- Do you feel dead?
Not quite.
Just tired.
You've been dreaming.
Yes.
And you were there.
I do not want to get lost.
"- Leave it alone, Aluxia."
- Ok dad.
Four years.
Oh?
"Killed his girlfriend, Ida, while on the booze."
Not bad for a beginner.
Eats her fill and then she's off.
- What did he come looking for?
- Me!
Do I owe you?
I'll pay you back.
So you were in the can?
"- Yeah, but that's over."
- You're quite a guy.
I'm a street vendor now:
"Matches, newspapers, suspenders."
You can't make money that way.
The main thing is to go straight.
Am I right?
- You're right.
What's your name?
Reinhold.
"See ya, Reinhold."
"You used to be my gal, Cilly."
Not anymore.
Maybe we can be friends again.
Get the fat guy for us.
We can use him.
He's done time in Tegel.
The two new guys are lightweights.
We're gonna get that guy.
- Looks real solid.
- Yeah.
And not too bright.
That was seven years ago.
I know.
"I'm trying, darling."
Did you see this?
Why are the drapes open?
"Kay, are you all right?"
-Are you hit?
-No.
It's all right.
Stop!
Stop!
Halt!
They're still on the property.
Please stay inside.
-Keep them alive.
-We'll try.
Alive!
Stay by the door.
"Yeah, come in."
"-Mike, are you all right?"
-Yeah.
"There's a lot I can't tell you, Tom."
And I know that's upset you in the past.
You felt it was because of some lack of trust or confidence.
But it's because I admire you and love you that I kept things secret from you.
Now you're the only one I can trust.
Fredo?
"Well, he's got a good heart."
"But he's weak and he's stupid, and this is life and death."
"Tom, you're my brother."
"I always wanted to be thought of as a brother by you, Mikey."
A real brother.
Is everything all right?
"Lynn, are you all right?"
You look strange.
Is anything wrong?
I was scared by the lightning and Stan hasn't gotten home yet and I just didn't want to be alone in the house.
When do you expect him?
He didn't say when he'd be back.
I'm terribly sorry.
"But as you probably know, Lynn and I are concerned about Stan."
I had a feeling that something was wrong with Stan.
A hunch.
So I drove out to see if everything was okay.
- I'm sorry.
"- Of course, I understand."
It was nice to see you again.
"Bye-bye, Lynn."
"Douglas, what is it?"
I don't know.
I don't know.
I have a strange feeling something's wrong.
A feeling like I had when Bobby... died.
Stan?
Stan?
Stan is here.
My brother is here.
And he's dead.
My brother is dead.
It could be Bobby.
No.
"No, it's Stan."
Pull yourself together.
He's dead.
How's your leg?
How about you?
"Fine, mama."
I'm fine.
[Speaking Greek]
Your Uncle John passed by to visit me.
"Oh, really?"
When?
Last month.
Too tight?
No.
"Mama, you have to stay off it."
You can't go up and down the stairs.
You have to give it a rest.
Ok.
"Mama, I could take you somewhere where you would be safe and wouldn't be alone."
There would be people around.
You wouldn't be sitting here listening to a radio.
[Speaking Greek]
You understand me?
"This is my house, and I'm not going no place."
"Dimmie, you worry for something."
"No, mama."
You are not happy.
"Tell me, what is the matter?"
"Mama, I'm all right."
"I'm fine, really I am."
[Tunes radio to Greek music]
Here it comes.
There.

What's up?
"Hey, have you looked at that cat-lady sketch?"
It's still seven minutes long.
"Yikes, okay."
"Oh, and Standards has a problem with that Michael Jackson bit."
Why?
- This is 7 Mary 3.
U.C. Medical says the baby should have its stomach pumped immediately.
Imperative.
Antitoxin must be administered.
- We have to get him to a hospital.
- Don't worry.
We will.
Send an ambulance to Malibu end of the canyon.
We'll meet them there.
- 10-4.
- Carry or lead?
I'll carry.
"Come on, Henry."
"Hey, hey, hey, hey."
You'll go with big Jon.
"Hang on, Henry."
"Hey, screw you, cop."
Get over there.
Easy.
"Easy, Henry."
Come on.
Here.

"Hey, his name is Henry."
"He's still in recovery, but the doctor says he's gonna be okay."
What about the baby food?
It's all accounted for. 15-8's got it.
"You put in a good day, fellows."
There is one other thing.
I hate to bring it up but you'll have to cut down on the personal calls at the office.
But we weren't even there to make any calls.
- Here we go.
- Here we go.
Richard!
Hi.
Hi.
I thought your car was over here.
It is.
It's down there.
You could give me a ride to it.
Doesn't that break the rules of the thing?
This can be like the afterlife.
"You know, like we're angels or something?"
Cute.
What are you doing in my car?
"No, I don't know you, and you certainly don't know anything about me."
"I mean, what if I'm a killer of children?"
Yeah.
"Well, that would put a damper on things, wouldn't it?"
"See, you're acting like I'm just this regular man."
Like a man in a book who thewoman in the book meets.
I'm not doing that.
Did I just invite myself into your car?
Is that what I just did?
"-Well, I'm sorry."
"- No, I'm sorry."
- I'm sorry.
-You should be.
Good.
Terrific.
Canyou get out of my car now?
Okay.
Okay.
"Both of you, out!"
"- But we're waiting for a call, sarge..."
- Look.
Stand by at home.
I will phone you when the call comes in.
Good.
We'll both be at my place.
"I don't care where you are, as long as you're not here."
Got it?
- Right.
- Good.
Good.
"Hey, why your place?"
I want you to see Melinda.
- Melinda?
- Yup.
"Oh, yeah, the one with the sexy feet."
Right.
And you'll get a free introductory lesson to the Poncherello School of Cool.
"Hello, Henry."
"That's a boy, that's a boy."
Feel better?
What do you think I should use?
Do I give her my Redford approach?
"Or maybe I'll be more continental, like Rex Harrison."
I just want to see her feet.
"Well, maybe I'll try my Stallone."
"Hey, hey, come here."
Hey!
"Hey, Ponch."
"Oh, mister, don't open that hood."
"Don't open that hood, whatever you do."
I'm Marybeth Cogan.
We met at the hospital.
That's Randy and Maria?
These are my kids.
-Please sit down.
-Thank you.
-l'm sorry to have to talk to you here.
-lt's all right.
Hear from anyone in the department today?
A couple of the guys.
What did they say?
I called to pick up his things from the precinct.
They said his locker was sealed.
But the captain came to see me.
He was very nice.
What captain?
Homicide South.
Eddie's commander.
He's required to call on the widow.
is anything wrong?
Don't talk to anyone without checking with me first.
Okay?
We're in the wrong business.
You get lost?
"There's a key to downtown Brooklyn, but I sure don't have it."
"Murray, Lenny, you know Kevin."
"Kevin, this is Dan."
"Kevin, how are you?"
"Tex, sit down."
Take a load off.
"Louisiana, Murray, for the umpteenth time."
Can't take a joke?
You heard Rhodes.
He's got his hands full.
"Besides, we're running out of time as it is."
"Now, now."
Where's--?
Where's my journal?
D-d-don't...
"Don't, uh-- Don't touch... anything."
"What do you mean, we're running out of time?"
That's right.
"In fact, we've only got two days to find the treasure."
I can't even find my journal.
Why only two days?
Ah!
Ha.
Success.
"Professor, why only two days?"
Because that is when the first line of Solon's riddle comes true.
"I copied it, uh--"
"Uh, from an altar I found in--"
In the caves at Exeter.
Where is it?
Hm.
There we are.
There you are.
"""When the gods march in rank."""
What does it mean?
"Well, you saw the carvings on the Ark."
"Now, as you know--"
"I mean, when the Romans adopted the Greek gods, they gave them new names."
"Now, let's see, uh,"
Hermes became Mercury.
Do you readme?
"Listen, we losthim on the bridge."
Right.
I got him.
He's headin' north on East River Drive.
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.
You take Sal.
I'll take the beard.
There goes Sal.
- You want the red or the white?
- Pour it in your ear.
"- Yes, sir?"
"- Yeah, guyjust walked in, what's his name?"
I'm pretty sure that one's a Frog.
"He made me, too."
"He lives on four, he went up to six."
"He's cute, real cute."
The other guy's a Frog.
He checked into the Edison.
Had a hooker sent up.
You should have collared him right there.
- Who's on him?
- Klein.
- How about Sal?
- We put him to bed for the night.
"Why don't you do the same, Doyle?"
You look like shit.
Come on.
"Look, my partner and I made this case, you know, originally."
- We don't want any feds screwing it up.
- Case?
In Albany.
We are in Albania.
"Yes, like Mother Teresa."
"In prison, His Majesty."
Yes...
Okay.
Yes.
"Seeing Him, His Majesty..."
Why did you tell her about the prison?
- I did not want to invent a story.
The Chief of Cabinet will call you to this number.
And then we'll call the guards.
"Now I'm off, if you do not mind her."
"Thank you, sorry."
She does not answer.
- Wait.
I do not mean to wait.
"First, you must contact..."
It's ringing.
"Yes, we are healthy and safe..."
Did anyone explain it to you?
Can you contact the embassy in Albania?
Go call the guards.
Lord?
Lord?
Ludovic and Louise were immersed in the protocol.
"Meanwhile, that little brother had returned to being a puppet."
"Sire, here's a clean shirt."
I see.
Agree.
Goodbye.
"Mr. Lloyd, the palace has canceled Our King."
-Otherwise you are very nice.
-To your health.
"When our official delegation comes here, we will bring you a decoration."
You golden boy!
I will mount the little horse...
Sing with me.
When I join the army
Everyone!
"And you, my dear"
-Call me Pepa.
"-Hi, Pepa."
-What should I call you?
"-Whatever you like, Pepa."
"-For example, can I call you monster?"
"-You can, Pepa."
-And I will also call you monster.
"-Call me monster 2,"
-so there's order in it.
"-Bye, monsters."
"Bye, Pepa."
"Boys, I like you."
Yirinka!
These are my friends from space.
"Nice to meet you, I'm the princess of Monaco."
They are just flying back.
Cheers.
"-Cheers, Pepa."
"-Cheers, monsters."
Well?
Do they congratulate us?
I'm looking forward to going home.
"We'll get bonuses, I'll buy new aquarium, feed the fish, and have peace and quiet."
Wait here.
Hello.
"Good evening, boys."
- Have you got the stuff?
- What stuff?
- The Mickey Finns.
- What do you want 'em for?
"- Ask no questions, eh?"
"- I'm afraid it's our duty, madam."
- We're police officers.
Come along.
- (Sighs)
(Footsteps)
My dear Lord Mayley!
This is an unexpected pleasure.
"Laden with good news, I trust?"
- Yes... and no.
- Ah...
Hmm...
I'm willing to pay but the point is this - my wife's rich father is on his last legs.
- So?
- He won't last a year.
"She'll get the lot, I shall be able to extract."
A year?
"I gave you two weeks, remember?"
"- Yes but £10,000..."
- You're an insurance chief.
- You earn a lot.
- My wife spends a lot.
"- If there's any left, I spend it."
- Too bad.
"I don't know where I'm going to get £10,000."
- OK.
"- Just go, Paul."
Well.
I'd better get off.
You'll call and let us know how he is?
You'll see that he's all right?
Look out for him?
"- I hardly know him, really."
- Promise me.
So say it.
All right.
I promise.
Where the hell have you been?
- How's it going?
- Great.
You brought me gear.
You have to stay in overnight for observation.
I'm not staying here all night.
"No, I've things to do."
You just had a suspected heart attack.
Lie down.
"Heart attack, me arse."
Just a touch of angina.
More lively than usual.
You're staying here.
What's it to you?
"Please don't leave me here, Paul."
Please.
You stay here.
OK.
That everything you wanted to say to her?
Let's go.
The hell with it.
The hell with you.
"Uh, you know, about the other night."
I don't want there to be--
"Don't even worry about it, man."
Myjaw's not made out of glass.
"Yeah, well, you know, blood's thicker than blonds, right ?"
"So, you got my back on Saturday ?"
Derek...
"I ain't got nobody else, man."
- You got Lip.
- Lip ?
"Man, that fool will get a nigger killed quick, man."
"No, I need you there."
"47th Street, under the El."
"I'll call you, man."
Are you down ?
"- Yeah, I'm down."
"- All right, man."
"Let me get to class, get some education like you."
All right.
Uh... I don't wanna bug you. I just came in here to say good luck.
"So, tomorrow's the big day, huh ?"
Yeah.
- You scared ?
- Shitless.
You got a minute foryour old man ?
I wanna show you something.
Sure.
Be careful.
"That wall, it's, uh, still wet."
"That'syourmother when she was 19, when I fiirst met her."
"We come, you lie down anatomically, like tenth we."
-It already is.
-It already is.
"What thinks, colleague?"
"I would begin by one ""intramuslus rigidum""."
Previous or later?
That depends on the availability of the patient.
Exact.
Tell me?
It hurts here?
-No.
-All to regulate.
Passive insensibility.
here?
-No...
-No?
"What thinks, colleague?"
-Colleague?
What thinks?
"-""Cachondum inmediatum""."
It is the same sensation that I have.
I propose that we deepen.
"Yes. ""Profundicemus, apropincuamus semper""."
"""Aprovechemus""."
"Now, you pay attention."
"Tell me, What notices here?"
to please or pain?
-Good... for pleasing.
-It is what I imagined it to be.
"An injection makes lack of ""mine-dura""."
And of mine no?
"Yes, yes, carry out, carry out."
You didn't eat the turkey sandwich I brought you last night.
I know you must be hungry.
So I...
I've prepared a protein drink and a wonderfully nutritious salad.
"Looks good, doesn't it?"
Doesn't it?
Yes.
You look pale.
- Do you have a fever?
- No.
Let me see.
Watch what you're doing.
Damn it.
I don't have time to change.
It's getting late.
- Are you going out?
"- Yes, I'm going out."
Where?
"Well, let's just say I'm..."
I'm going to make a house call.
What does that mean?
"That's my business, Mrs. Carrington."
Just as I want you to make it your business to clean up that mess.
And to eat something before I get back.
Hello.
I'm Dr. Travers.
"Yes, please come in, you've been expected."
"Why, thank you."
"Anna, please take Dr. Travers' coat."
Thank you very much.
Mrs. Carrington?
Yes.
James:
That's me.
"Hi, I'm Agnes lenbert."
I work for social services.
Who's she?
Her name is kalaya nirapattanassai.
She's a thai national.
"Hello, kalaya."
My name is James.
She doesn't speak much English.
Can we speak in private?
Why is she here?
She was arrested at the airport yesterday with 2 adult thai nationals who were smuggling heroin.
She was posing as the drug smugglers' daughter.
Where there any drugs found on her?
"No, she was just there to make it look like a family vacation."
To Pittsburgh.
Heh!
Not exactly a thai dream.
No wonder they got caught.
Where's she staying?
At a locked shelter for juvenile offenders.
But I don't understand why you're here.
I think she wants asylum.
[Slowly] Do you speak any English?
Uncle Joe.
Me and Uncle Joe.
Do you want to stay with Uncle Joe?
Does Uncle Joe live here?
Does Uncle Joe know you're coming?
Uncle Joe.
Me and Uncle Joe.
"I have seen it, Shiv."
What happened?
I am remembering a few things.
Just a second.
It's a classic 70mm 3D Jodha Akbar scenario!
Oh God!
I look so hot in that costume.
And Zak was getting beaten up back then as well.
Take a look.
He looked like a joker back then too.
And you were so sexy back then too!
Press it again.
Press it again.
Go to hell if you don't want to believe it.
Baby... slave...
Massage my feet before you leave.
- Get lost!
- Farewell my subjects!
Wow!
Helicopter!
Who am I?
Osama?
Shiv...
- Yes.
- Don't move.
- What happened?
There's a spider on you.
What are you doing!
Where did it go?
- I feel ashamed.
- Why?
"Back in that life, you had killed a tiger."
Hold on.
Hold on.
"Sam, hang it up."
Hang it up.
[Typing]
[Beeping]
Why don't I just run a search on his credit card?
Mmm.
Smart.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
- James W. Harpel?
- Mm-hmm.
Looks like he opened up a tab at Pure about an hour ago.
Thank you.
That reverse psychology stuff?
"That's cheating, Sam."
Uh-huh.
"If you ain't cheating', you ain't tryin', Mike."
Damn.
Hey.
You guys see this?
"""Mancuso menaces Montecito."
"Ghost of former owner haunts hotel."" What the hell is this?"
I don't know.
Maybe that guy Taylor went to the press.
"What, because we made him pay what he owed?"
"Well, if he thought the story was gonna hurt us, he was wrong."
Bookings are way up.
Haunted hotels...
quite popular apparently.
Quite popular apparently?
Hundred percent.
"Unfortunately, your ball won't make it over."
- Data tennis is starting to show its abilities.
- It's really a strong method.
Use that move.
Yosh.
"Do it, Kaidou."
Game set and match.
Won by Seigaku.
Seven games to five.
It's a pit between physical peserverence.
We can't lose.
Third match is beginning.
Hyotei's Kabaji against Seigaku's Kawamura.
One set match.
Hyotei to serve.
Play.
Hadoukyuu.
15
- Love
What!
Winner will be Hyotei.
"If this continues, we'll lose."
"Taka-san, that is..."
I will definitely win this match.
I want to be in the Nationals.
Single-handed Hadoukyuu technique.
I can't play anymore.
Kabaji's stamina is actually drained.
The last ball doesn't count.
Singles three no game.
Chiku'so!
What's the matter?
Sorry.
I...
That's haven't been honest with you about a couple things.
Okay.
I lied to you about babysitting my brother the other night.
That guy at church was Tim Riggins.
Mmm-hmm.
We have kind of a history together.
"Okay, what kind of history?"
"Get the door, Brian."
Hey.
"Hey, I just came by to say that I'm sorry."
Come in.
"Hey, Noannie."
Didn't Mom ban her?
"Noannie, please."
"Just watch your show and be easy, all right?"
I just feel so bad about everything.
I really cannot believe you had to apologize like that.
I wish we could erase that whole day.
It's gonna be okay.
This whole thing gonna blow over.
I was really worried about you.
Smash always lands on his feet.
Hello?
Who is that?
No.
"No, I don't."
Who is this?
"Noannie, give me the phone."
You guys are jerks.
"They can help you, Dr. Bryar."
Not any more.
- Let me know when HRT's ready.
- Got it.
"Gideon, you send those guys in there, hostages are going to die."
Yeah.
"You don't do something, they're going to die anyway."
It's not gone.
I know.
"Well, you said when the chip came out, it would go away."
It's...
I still hear it.
Then there must be more of them.
"You said it was the only one, Leo."
I can still feel the buzzing.
The burning.
- Dr. Bryar?
- What?
- Reid.
"- It's all right, Elle."
Is there another one?
You know there isn't.
"- Lf there were, Leo would have told you."
"- Don't listen, Ted."
Make it stop!
I know what it's like.
- Make it stop!
- I know what the voices are like.
He's trying to trick you.
The voices.
They won't stop.
They've been talking to you since you were a child.
I made friends with a transvestite prostitute.
Another one?
Big deal.
Uh...
I slept with Olivia!
You what?
!
That's good.
Yeah.
More stuff like that.
Tell her where.
"Uh, okay."
In your living room.
"Kitchen floor, on your bed... where your head goes."
Olivia!
"Oh, I'm not ashamed of anything I did to him."
"I am, a little."
Can you at least wear the gloves?
You're getting palm sweat all over the steering wheel.
Don't worry.
I'm getting everything.
"Over the shoulder, over the shoulder!"
"Abby, over my shoulder!"
"Okay, all right."
"If it makes you feel any better, way more people than this have gathered around to see my vagina."
That does not make me feel better.
Nor I.
Billie!
Billie!
Zack!
Did I miss anything?
I love you.
Hi.
Who's Mrs. Frederic?
"I'd tell you, but then he'd have to kill you."
What do you think?
6th to constitution?
This time of day I'd take 9th.
"Yeah, you're right."
Want to grab a beer after we drop off these two jokers?
"Ah, I can't. in-laws are in town."
"Hey, hey, hang on."
I want to pull over
And grab a paper.
They'll be fine.
"Before you say anything,"
I know that I mangled this.
I know I ran in there impulsively
Without--without thinking--without my bag--
Because I had a bigger--someone dug you up.
Oh.
So you know.
It's Macpherson.
I'm right.
"Yes, I'm afraid you are."
Now it's up to you to stop him.
Thank you.
Don't move!
"So, Mr. Ogawa, when does he get here?"
"Oh, God."
It works.
"- Hello, Arthur."
- James.
Good to see you after all these years.
To concentrate for a few days.
"I see, where to?"
There's this town called Shinduri.
On the west coast.
But I heard a sandstorm's on its way.
And it's supposed to be nasty.
- Sandstorm?
Again?
"- Yes, a nasty one, too."
So why don't you wait a couple of days and then go?
I have a strange feeling about today.
Okay.
"Well, I'll work hard on it."
"Producer Jung, everything's fine with you, too?"
"So, do you still have some money left for expenses?"
"Ah, yes."
A little.
"Later perhaps, you can..."
Thank you.
"Well, take care."
Good luck with your script.
- Thank you.
- Bye.
- Sit here!
"- No, the backseat's fine."
"- Please, sit here."
"- No, I'm okay."
Hello.
We're off.
"Wow, it's a new car."
Really nice.
Did you pay for it?
Perhaps he's doing his nets or something.
Did you telephone Dr. Mead?
"Yes, of course."
[Ursula]:
Do you think he's dead?
I suppose the sensible thing would be to turn him over.
"Oh, God."
"Oh, Janet, you do it."
He's alive.
The tide's low enough for you to get round the point.
See if you can find Pendered... and Luke.
Get them to bring a stretcher.
And ask Mrs. Pendered for some brandy.
Go on!
He's barely alive!
And send Joe Gallow on his bike to find Dr. Mead.
[Man]:
"What you got there, missus?"
"I should have thought that was obvious, Mr. Pendered."
[Pendered]:
I don't know where he's come from.
Ain't no sign of a wreck.
"- You hear anything, Lukey?"
- No.
That's enough for now.
[Pendered]:
Get him on the stretcher.
Be careful with that ankle.
I think it's broken.
"Lift on three, Lukey."
Three!
[Janet]:
"–Hey, where is he?"
Where is he?
"–What are you gonna do, hit me?"
–I don't see any witnesses here.
–Yeah?
Let my bruises do the talking.
Don't make me do something that we both don't want me to do.
–Yeah?
Go ahead.
–Just tell me where he is!
Please.
Just tell me where he is.
"Go ahead and whack me, you cracker prick."
I'll make my own million.
–Is that what you want?
–Mm-hmm.
–Is that what you really want?
–Mmm.
"–All right, let's go."
Let's go.
–What?
What are you... –Come here!
–No!
Let go of me!
–Leave me alone!
–Open up!
"You and me, we're about to get real acquainted if you don't start remembering."
–Don't touch me!
–Where is he?
–Open up!
–Let go of me!
You don't wanna tell me?
Water...
"Good, we'll continue with his regular injections."
"Are you responsible for him, Ms. Cappia..."
Cappam?
"Cappi, Professor."
The needle...
"May we give you a hand, Doctor?"
Yes!
Yes!
"Come, come... this may hurt a bit!"
Now everything's ready.
- All set.
"- Just relax, relax..."
He requires an emergency operation.
I can't tomorrow.
I'm too tired.
Then there's the weekend.
I'll operate on Monday.
What is it?
Who died?
You!
- It must have been you!
- No.
We didn't do it!
- It must have been you!
I'll...
"- One, two and three... in my office!"
We always take her with us.
It's a bad habit.
"Courage, Doctor."
Courage...
It's always the three of them who organize these pranks.
Get the hell out of here Danny!
You drunk!
***
***
- What's wrong with him?
"- Oh, Danny was so mean to him this morning."
I can still totally picture it.
"So it all started when Justin, he woke up."
He was in a great mood.
"He was like, man, I love being in love, man."
I just love it.
Makes me wanna do the moonwalk.
I could do the moonwalk.
I could get jiggy with it.
I could...
I could spin.
I could jump.
I could dance for days and days but I'm not.
I'm just gonna stand completely still.
Completely still.
Still like a stone.
Like a stone.
"And then... and then Danny,"
We pan over to Danny and Danny was all like grrr.
I think love is stupid.
Getting married.
"Getting married, ""pfft""."
That's all like a dumb mistake.
I would never do that.
And I get to be mean to you for just no reason because I'm a big baby.
I'm a big baby.
My hair's too long to be a baby but I act like a baby anyways.
Did you have to put me with the massage ads?
"Well, it was either that or the page with the personals, so..."
This page gets a lot of action.
"Yeah, I guess you're right."
"Hey, have you spoken to Anna lately?"
Yeah.
Okay.
"All right, Mary, I'll talk to you soon."
Thank you.
Bye.
PAIGE:
What I'm trying to show you is that there's a difference.
There is a difference.
BETH:
"Hey, how did you get Aunt Linda to sew these dresses in two weeks?"
PAIGE:
She wanted to do it.
LAURA:
Really?
She told me she felt like an old Indonesian lady in a sweat shop.
- Is that not right?
PAIGE:
"No, she didn't."
LAURA:
No?
BETH:
What's the...?
Why the big rush to get married?
PAIGE:
Because I am not having my wedding during a gross Baltimore winter and I am not waiting till spring.
You are so pregnant.
PAIGE:
"- Yes, no, yes."
"- Come on, come on."
"Yes, yes, oh yes."
All right.
I've deliberated.
No retrial.
Order.
"I said, order!"
Order in this court.
There will be order.
"S-h-u- you know what, comrade?"
"I'm getting a little tired of spelling ""Shuckton."""
It's a little town with a big heart and it is really easy to spell.
"Well, I am trying to speak to the Mayor of Russia."
"What do you mean, you don't have a m..."
"Look, do you people want to rape our land or not?"
Rape.
Rape!
R-a- never...
You know what?
Never mind!
Travis!
That's my name.
I'm gonna need a power shake.
And by power shake you mean Martini.
Yes.
But I'm gonna call it a power shake.
"But it is still a quadruple Martini, right?"
Yes.
"Ah, I'm on it."
Prosecution calls it's witness.
"Thank you, your honour."

Normally they shout only when they see him
Now they shout even after he has gone in
What are you doing outside?
One guy is on a chopping spree inside
What are you saying sir?
What is happening there?
Break open
What were you doing out?
Ramanathan where are you?
- My phone fell into the water
Can't you pick the phone?
Don't shout without knowing what happened.
- What happened?
Did someone die?
- Worse than that!
- What?
I'm using the phone that fell into a commode.
Alphonse...
- Look how he is responding...
He is screaming at me.
- Ignore him.
Did you trace their location?
- Shall we leave?
Okay.
AKG service apartment is Vikram's location.
Vasundhara's phone shows the same location.
They must be together.
Let's go.
Panju.
Panju.
407.
- Sir.
You seem to be very clear about what you need.
I'm the confused one running after you repeatedly.
Driver.
Start.
Go...
Hey!
She has swept his account clean.
Thank you.
"She did see us, right?"
I see.
No nausea?
No vertigo?
Here.
Now?
No.
Not at all.
OK.
I'll be able to send a positive report to the insurance then.
You were lucky.
But I wouldn't recommend these little escapades.
At least not unprepared.
Going out won't kill me?
Your respiratory system and your heart are very weak.
It's summer time.
You were dressed for the North Pole.
Yes.
Well.
Thank you.
Doctor.
Goodbye.
The member you require is no longer connected to Visiocom.
Shit.
"You have selected Eva, but she no longer works here."
Damn!
It's you.
- I'd like to talk to Eva.
She doesn't work here anymore.
I must find her.
- You must do nothing.
You've done enough.
She lost her job.
I'm the friggin' host of the show.
"Oh, okay."
We're being interviewed by a 12 year old.
Hi.
"I'm 14, and my show gets the most hits on Viddimension."
- You dig?
- Yeah.
I dig.
"I guess ""dig's"" back in."
"Now, I hope you noobs are ready 'cause I've played your beta, and I got some serious questions for you guys."
So who's gonna walk me through the demo downloads?
- I hope it's you.
"- Uh, I will."
- Come on.
"Yeah, that's a good idea."
"- Yeah, that's awesome."
Hi.
"Oh, hey, you must be Suzanne."
"I'm Deena, Dave's wife."
Of course.
Really nice to meet you.
Dave's told me so much about you.
"Oh, not too much, I hope."
Hi.
Hey... honey.
What are you doing here?
"- Hi, honey."
- What are you doing here?
"Well, you know, today's a big day for you, so I just, uh--"
I'm--I'm glad you came.
And I finally get to meet the famous Suzanne.
"- I just can't believe it's taken this long-- - oh, it's been really crazy."
Right there.
Darren vogel.
That's enright's attorney.
"Yeah, vogel bought a pair of the cuff links"
A week before the murder.
Think that's a coincidence?
"Not a chance, eric."
Oh...
Looks like we've got some babysitters.
"Have a nice day, gentlemen."
"well, what are you doing?"
What...
What are you wearing?
"Get off the phone, please."
bunny?
Yeah.
"No, I'll buy it for you, I'll buy it."
Excuse me.
"Uh, I think we've got a prospective client here."
"Yes, I-I've got to go."
All right.
"Yeah, all right."
I'll see you at 7:00.
"Yeah, love you."
"Now, you boys know that my billing rate is $2,000 an hour."
But here's the good news:
I take euros.
We are not soliciting counsel.
We're here about the tony enright case.
Enright?
Come on.
"That's old history, isn't it?"
Brilliant.
"Congratulations, young man, for a fantastic..."
"Well, whatever it was you just did,"
It was absolutely heroic.
"It was nothing, I just..."
Get off the street!
- Run!
- Hide!
Here come the goon goons!
Let's get 'em!
They run like chickens.
More goons!
We're trapped!
Hide or they'll get ya.
Over here.
It ain't no use hiding behind those trash cans.
The earthquakes' got girls in their gang.
Let's finish 'em.
"Now, where in the world did that come from?"
It was a set up.
- Let's give it to 'em.
- Yeah.
That was an ambush!
Stop banging into me.
I can't see.
I can't get out.
Get me out.
Get it off me.
Yeah!
All right!
"Hey, you really saved us from getting wiped out."
"Yeah, thanks a lot."
I can see it now.
It's gonna be great.
Lex.
It's Gina.
Please call me back.
I found who you've been searching for.
I know who the traveler is.
"After the funeral, I plan on taking some time off."
Get the jet ready.
Zurich.
You can't run away.
"No matter where you go, I'll always be there."
You can't get rid of me.
You need my help.
There's still good inside you.
I know it.
I don't want your help.
Don't go to Zurich.
I'm going.
I have to.
Dad was right.
"If you open the box, it will destroy you."
It's all I have left.
It's not true.
You still have me.
I'm done listening to you.
You make me weak.
Long night.
It's good to see the sun again.
It's too bad Lionel's not here to see it.
Lex closed the funeral to any and all guests.
"In other words, Lex is the only one invited."
"""Where's Behzad?"""
"She said, ""He took a towel and went out."""
You weren't down near the spring.
I tried the other side but you weren't there either.
You weren't at the spring.
How can you cross?
There's a bridge.
You don't ask how I am?
Where were you?
We've had no news from you.
Nothing!
I work in the fields.
You're always working or at school.
Or sleeping.
Mind you don't fall.
- You call that a bridge?
- Yes.
Your personal bridge?
All the children use it.
- How are you?
- Okay.
How's the invalid?
Who?
You still ask who?
It's obvious.
"- Oh, Mrs Malek?"
- Yes.
She didn't eat the soup from Mash Hajer and the others.
How many cooks does she have?
They're not her cooks.
The soup is an offering.
All right.
"- Ari, look at us becoming BFF's."
- I know.
- I love that it's capsulated on film.
- It's on film for...
- That's an attractive looking face.
- You're drunk.
- Good look.
- You're beautiful.
"Ari, when you..."
- Okay.
- I love this.
Have you been looking at me?
"""I've been looking at you guys."
"Have you been looking at me?"""
A lot of good practice.
Flirting in college.
It really helped a lot.
And look at Jonny's bone structure.
- Yeah.
- Jonny has the greatest face.
- Look at that.
"- Oh, mama."
He's creepy.
People keep asking me if Jonny's related to Josh Hartnett.
"- Oh, my gosh."
- Really?
"I don't even really know the answer to that, I assume not."
"I don't think he is, but I can see why they're asking."
- Just because they look...?
- What is that?
"Yeah, they have similar bone structure."
- came all this way to see me.
Michael:
SHE'LL WAIT FOR US TO MAKE A MOVE
AND PICK US OFF WHEN WE DO.
I NEED A SCREWDRIVER.
SHOULDN'T WE CALL THE PARK RANGERS?
UNLESS THE PARK RANGERS HAVE BEEN ISSUED
"BODY ARMOR AND HIGH-CALIBER WEAPONS,"
WE'RE ON OUR OWN HERE.
SHE MUST HAVE DISABLED MY GUN WHEN WE STOPPED FOR GAS.
"REMOVE THE TRIGGER-BAR SPRING FROM A SIG SAUER P228,"

"I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU THINK YOU'RE PLAYING AT,"

I DON'T HAVE A PAPER CLIP.
"WELL,DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING LIKE A PAPER CLIP --"

NEVER MIND.
"KILL HIM YOURSELF, IF YOU WANT."
?
WE NEED TO WRAP THIS THING UP.
YOU FIXED IT?
HARDLY.
I MIGHT GET ONE SHOT OFF.
YOU HAVE ONE CHANCE TO SHOOT HER?
I'M NOT GONNA SHOOT HER.
[ ENGINE REVS ] WAIT.
IS SHE LEAVING?
I SERIOUSLY DOUBT THAT.
DO YOU HAVE ANY DUCT TAPE?
Cash.
Who is this?
No I.D.
Caught her sneaking outside with this.
"Well, you're not a reporter."
Who sent you?
I don't like uninvited guests.
And I don't like waiting.
"If your security isn't airtight, we can't do business."
None of us will.
Put her in the cell.
Hook her up.
Let's go.
Move it.
"Oh, my God."
"Amanda, what have they done to you?"
You're about to find out.
Get in there.
M-more.
I want more.
- This is private property.
- Call a cop.
Think you can school me?
Watch me.
"If I shoot you now,"
I can't have any fun with you later.
You won't have any fun with me now.
I might have a little.
- Yes?
- It's Stone.
- This better be important.
"- Trust me, you're gonna want to hear this."
"Hello, John Klein."
Who is this?
My name is Indrid Cold.
"Unless, of course, you're Gordon Smallwood."
"Your father was born in Racine, Wisconsin."
He lived in a green house on Monroe Street.
You don't remember how your mother looked.
"Okay, you got my attention."
- Where's my watch?
- In your shoe.
Under the bed.
"Very good, John."
Thank you.
What's in my hand?
Chap Stick.
"You're reading my mind, aren't you?"
Did you read my mind?
"I have no need to, do I?"
What's the third line of page 51?
"""A broken smile beneath her whispered wings""."
"Still more proof, John Klein?"
What do you look like?
It depends on who's looking.
I want to meet you.
"You already have, John."
I have seen you afraid.
"You're afraid right now, aren't you?"
Can I ask you something?
"Why ask me what you already know, John?"
What happened to my wife?
You were there.
Mary Klein cannot be found by looking.
Now it's done.
I'm callin' this in.
Thank you.
"Hey, guess what?"
"In case you didn't know, you have the right to remain silent, bitch."
Hello.
"No, no, no, no!"
Shit.
Hey.
"You, you're out."
Where you taking me?
Shut the fuck up.
We're almost there.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
"Blair, I'm so sorry."
"Okay, I'm, I'm a fucking idiot."
I just...
Please don't tell me those were Timmy Song's guys.
He's the only one powerful enough to get you out.
Okay.
"Blair, we have to go."
We have to get out of town right now.
"No, Ollie."
I gave him everything we had.
And I had to borrow on top of that.
"Look, you don't have to worry about that right now."
"No, I have to worry about it, okay?"
He calculates his late fees in body parts.
"All right, when's our first payment?"
Next week.
Fuck.
It came from outer space.
I saw it.
And it was headed toward land.
I called the government in Washington about it.
Maybe it was a Sputnik or an invader from Mars.
That's what it is.
It's an invader from Mars!
A spaceship of some kind.
An unidentified flying object.
Unidentified?
"Knowing you, earl, I'd say it was either whiskey or beer."
I saw it too.
I rest my case.
I believe you.
What if it is Sputnik?
Or a flying saucer...
... fromMars?
I bet we could find it.
"Sorry, kid."
I didn't really see anything.
"If we don't stick up for the kooks, who will?"
"Is my son bothering you, sir?"
No!
call me Dean.
"Hogarth, you were going to get your pet, honey?"
"I will, Mom."
-Right after I finish talking with--
-Dean.
-Found your pet.
-Where?
"squirrel's up my pants, Hogarth."
I'm trying not to wig out here.
"Oh, it's Wayne."
How are you now?
"Oh, not so bad."
"Yeah, this one's too hard."
(TECHNO MUSIC PLAYING)
We don't have time to discuss that business.
Devon.
Stewart.
I come in peace.
How do we know you don't have another one of those in your sock?
You don't.
Speak.
Do not approach.
- Seen Katy around?
- No.
- That is all.
- (GROWLING) Stewart!
Trouble in paradise?
"If there was, she wouldn't know it."
I'm not talking to her.
Well played.
Wait it out.
That way she'll come to the conclusion that you're upset with her and ask you why.
- Precisely.
- She should anyway.
- If she's smart.
- I know.
- Why are you mad at her?
- She acts like...
You should try an open relationship.
Could be productive.
You could also try a hall pass.
A small chill by the column?
"No, a great chill."
"In addition, one is going away to me to melt."
"-Then, it is very urgent."
-It is what I am saying to him.
And if Lella had to be late?
It would be a disaster.
Then I to me leave orders before she is too much behind schedule.
Mother mine!
In fact...!
I am going to eat you!
-A moment.
"Before, undress."
-you quiet...
How long you take in uninformed?
Ever since I was born.
By where one begins?
"Hey, Gloria..."
-Álvaro!
-Lella!
So that is your fiancee.
You pick in your subjects.
And what do you do here?
I had brought you an ice cream for your birthday.
What do you do dressed like this?
You seem one whore.
"Alvaro, I..."
What I do with this?
Not even I like.
To the devil!
Lella.
-By the way?
Don't bother me.
Stealing is bothering.
Nobody steals anything on my shift.
Yeah!
Wha... we've been locked in here all day.
I don't buy it.
"I don't buy it, either."
I think I know who likes chocolate.
Everybody.
"Yes, right."
But especially kids.
I heard this one say she wants to put her face and her feet in it.
I stand by that.
It's gotta be in here somewhere.
Would you be dumb enough to hide it in here?
"I guess you're dumb enough to think we would hide it in there, Ethan."
"Yeah, you gorgeous idiot."
Or maybe you kids hid it in the bathroom.
Whew...!
"Eh, maybe give it a minute in there."
It's not in there.
"Get up, Rudy."
N-No.
Beans didn't do anything.
He doesn't have a malicious bean in his bag.
No!
No!
Don't you touch Beanbag!
No!
All right!
Bonus round.
Winner takes all.
- Freddy!
"[ Ray ] You see, Officer, in Garrison... when the car you're gonna tag has got a P.D.A. sticker..."
"I'd advise you to think to yourself, """"Hey, that's one of the good guys."
"I think I'll go catch me a bad guy."""
"If we didn't pull over P.D., there wouldn't be any violations in this town."
The problem in this town ain't the people that live here.
It's the element that visits.
"Is this a new car, Ray?"
It's nice.
We didn't recognize it.
"Come on, Freddy, I wanna go home."
Tell this cupcake to heel.
"- Okay, that's not necessary."
- Cindy.
"- Well, listen, take care, guys."
See you later.

Suppose Thompson walks in.
"If he walks in his sleep, he'll walk in."
He's upstairs snoring his head off.
What did you turn that light on for?
"Listen, are you on the level with me?"
"Oh, that's okay."
What's the matter?
Are you getting yellow?
No.
"Just careful, see?"
"Hello, kids."
Don't you think you need some dough?
It's pretty late to get a hitch around here.
I think you better take some.
Here you are.
"Go on, take it."
"No, we don't need your dough."
We'll get along okay.
"Yeah, sure you will."
"Well, so long, kids."
Good luck.
"There, see?"
He don't care.
Come on.
"Gee, he's nuts, ain't he?"
Come on.
- Have you seen Jimmy?
- Yeah.
Everything's all right.
"What's the matter, Patsy?"
Just playing a long shot.
Yeah.
You seemed bored.
-I tried to be seductive.
-Other guys can see it.
One guy under a bridge.
He wasn't interested.
-Answer it.
-It's ok.
-Nothing's wrong.
-Answer it.
-It's ok.
-I said answer it!
Answer it and turn it off.
It bothers me.
I'm going to the bathroom.
-Yeah.
-Hey I'm at yoga place.
It's not at this time usually.
"Yeah, the trainer came home late last night."
Maybe she was drunk her ass off.
She loves drinking.
You don't have to hang up.
She isn't here yet.
Are you busy?
I guess I'll have to hang up then.
I got vaccine for German Measles.
They say I don't have the antibodies.
Doctor says that we have to use condoms for a month to 3 months at least.
It takes about that long for the antibodies to generate.
You have to do them.
I can't take pills.
-Hyang Gi.
"Whoever she is, she's not worth the bother."
I think David's mixed up in something.

We have movement at the Pembridge.
Do you know what kind of man Clifford Bentley is?
What's that for?
"You a superstitious man, Silas?"
He's losing his grip on this job.
"There's a matching necklace, part of a set."
My God.
"- Jane, there's something..."
- Yes?
I saw you both earlier.
You should speak to him.
If you're serious.
About what?
- Sarge?
- What the hell was that?

"We're here in Victory Lane, awaiting the results."
"McQueen, that was a risky move, not taking tires."
Tell me about it!
Are you sorry you didn't have a crew chief out there?
"Oh, Kori."
There's a lot more to racing than just winning.
"I mean, taking the race by a full lap..."
Where's the entertainment in that?
I wanted to give folks a little sizzle.
- Sizzle?
- Am I sorry I don't have a crew chief?
"No, I'm not."
'Cause I'm a one-man show.
What?
"Oh, yeah, right."
That was a confident Lightning McQueen.
"Live from Victory Lane, I'm Kori Turbowitz."
- Get outta the shot.
"- Yo, Chuck."
"Chuck, what are you doing?"
You're blocking' the camera!
- Everyone wants to see the bolt.
- What?
"- Now, back away."
- That's it!
"Come on, guys."
"- Whoa, team!"
Where are you going?
"- We quit, Mr. One-Man Show!"
"Oh, OK, leave."
Fine.
"- Mitchell, you understand this."
- You know what I'm going through.
- I do.
"So, why won't you help me?"
!
"OK, you know what?"
There... there is another option.
It just might be the answer.
We recarpet?
What?
!
"No, no, no, no."
"This guy, he's one of us."
A vampire?
- How did you get his number?
- He found me.
He says that he has systems in place.
No killing.
But he'll make sure the kid's fed.
We have to do something.
"- You'll take Adam to him, then?"
"- Oh, no."
"Me and him, we do not get on."
"I'll call him and make the introduction, but after that I don't want any part of it."
"Oh, just take me to them."
Wow.
"Oh, wow."
This...
"Oh, this is really nice."
"All right, George!"
"Little bit of help here, please?"
Mm.
There are a lot here.
- What's after that?
- Nothing.
I know what there is.
Nothing.
- Nothing?
- There's a road near the tree.
I'll tell you what there is.
"""Near hhe hree is a wooded lane, greener hhan hhe dreams of God."""
What's after the tree?
Read the address.
"It says a tall, single tree."
There's a lot on this hillside.
is it very tall?
"Yes, it says it's very tall."
It must be different from the others then.
The single tree?
There are so many.
They're all on the hill.
That's what it says here.
I don't think this will get us anywhere.
There it is.
"There, look, a single tree!"
- Where?
- Up there.
I see it...
What a big tree!
Look at it.
He was right.

"It should say there, in the file."
I want to hear what you say.
A long time.
I didn't know you smoked.
When did you start?
Right after I quit drinking.
Why did you stop drinking?
I was a drunk.
What would you say is your current disposition?
How do I feel?
Be a fucking 'nother Toxie.
TRENT HAAGA:

He's pissed at everybody.
He's totally psycho.
This is a super long shot over the tops
Of the heads of crowds.

"Stop, stop!"
That's cold!
Help!
Please!
Stop!
"Thanks, Red."
What was that for?
- Do you want to stay at the Cozy Cone?
- Huh?
"If you do, you gotta be clean."
'Cause even in hillbilly hell we have standards.
"What, I...?"
I don't get it.
I thought I'd say thank you for doin' a great job.
So I thought I'd let you stay with me.
"I mean, not with me!"
But there.
"Not with me there, but there in your own cozy cone."
"- And I'd be in my cone, and it's..."
- Wait.
"Wait, you're being nice to me."
"If you want to stay at the dirty impound, fine."
- I understand you criminal types.
"- No, no, no, no."
That's OK.

He's brilliant.
Are you drunk?
Yes.
Why did you fire Pete?
Why did you disappear all night?
Is this some kind of a power play?
Then you should fight.
With everything you have.
- What do you want?
- I want you to stop being so afraid.
- I'm not afraid.
- I'm want us to stop being so careful.
- I'm just-
- I wanna marry you!
What?
I wish the sun would rise already.
This graveyard shift's going forever.
You okay?
"I love you too, Carter, but it's over."
I'm gonna ask her tonight.
You're going to propose?
"Actually, I already did, but badly."
- She said no?
- She didn't say anything.
But this time I'm gonna do it right.
That is a nice rock.
That was my great-grandmother's.
Great-grandfather gave it to her the day he left for the Army.
I don't think she'll mind that it's secondhand.

I'm dating now.

[MOUTHING] I love her.
I love her.
ANNA:
"You know, what I've been focusing my energy on  is like a self-discovery, as opposed to dating."
I don't know.
Maybe dating's a little overrated.
"Yes, I think."
Thank you!
Thank you?
By words only?
Earlier your smile was beautiful.
Can you smile again?
I don't like to smile!
Really?
"You don't like to smile,"
- or you don't like me?
- Let go of me!
Let me go!
Let me drive you home.
Why do you keep bothering me?
Why?
"It's not bothering, it's love!"
"If I tell you that I don't like you, will you stop what are you doing?"
What you do is not love!
Didn't I tell you that I have a boyfriend already?
So what?
"As long as I like you, I will make you fall in love with me!"
Xiamu...
Xiamu!
Xiamu!
Xiamu!
- Are you allright?
- I'm allright!
Did you get injured?
Don't come near Shu Yawang anymore!
"I come near to her,"
- so what?
- I'll kill you!
Don't you believe me?
You want me to show you?
What are you looking at?
Don't you know me?
I'm Mousy!
I'm a fighter!
You're filthy!
And you have a bad attitude!
"You see good people, and you bully them!"
"You see bad people, and you fear them!"
My big sister's no coward!
"If we don't get the money, we'll come after you!"
"Mousy, who are you shouting at?"
- Him.
- Who's he?
He's me and I'm him.
Useless bum!
Where's the money you collected today?
I collected more laundry.
- Here.
- More business as well.
Your shirt looks dirty.
Take it off for a wash.
It's OK to be dirty.
- Take it off!
- No need!
Where's the money?
Where's the money you collected today?
Ah Fook's house has a fierce dog.
Ah Sao says he's got no money.
Big Mouth shouted at me.
I didn't collect any money.
There's not even any fuckin' silverware in this place.
Oh no.
What?
What is it?
There's no beer.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Oh shit.
"Come on, come on."
Oh shit.
"Blair, Ollie."
Did you find it?
No.
The skylight is sealed shut.
How did you open it in the first place?
It was already wide open.
I just went through.
Us too.
He's back.
"Yeah, well we got a fuckin' gun."
Why don't we use it?
There's only one bullet.
"Riley, how many bullets did you bring?"
"Well, you only need one bullet to take 'em out, right?"
Technically that's true.
So here's the plan.
No way.
Guns and Riley don't mix.
Will you stop insulting my crew?
"You guys, no new plans."
"We stay together, and we find the jammer, okay."
Where?
We already checked everywhere.
Look how happy the mom is now.
"-Oh, Rach."
-Screw you!
You don't have to do it!
-Hey.
-Hey!
-What's up?
-Mona just dumped me.
"Oh, man, I'm sorry."
Why?
"Lately, I haven't exactly been the perfect boyfriend."
I didn't tell her I got Rachel pregnant.
I gave her a key to my apartment and then had the locks changed.
Then I lied to her about Rachel moving in with me.
"In a way, I judge her for not breaking up with me sooner."
That really sucks.
Especially on Valentine's Day.
Wait a minute.
What are you doing here?
Joey without a date on Valentine's Day?
"What's going on, huh?"
Girl trouble?
-Sort of.
-Really?
You don't have to seem so happy about it.
Maybe I can help.
"Whatever it is, I am sure it has happened to me."
"You know, actually, once I got dumped during sex."
"-So anyway, what is it?"
-Forget about it.
It's no big deal.
"-Come on, what is it?"
All right.
What do you got to drink around here?
We don't have much time.
"Soon they will come to harm you, and I will not be able to stop them, unless you are able to give me something to placate them."
"Some, uh, piece of information... which I can use to protect you from them."
I've already told you everything I know.
I have no loyalty to Jones.
He's brought me nothing but trouble.
"Marion, you are beautiful."
I don't think we need a chaperone.
Steadily.
Steadily.
Whoa!
Down...
Down...
Whoa.
"Carefully, carefully!"
"You all right, Indy?"
"Now gently, boys."
"Gently, gently!"
Whoa...
I told you it will be all right.
Huh...
"Sallah, get down here!"
You pour.
"Oh, that's good."
Whoops.
"What is this stuff, René?"
I grew up with this.
It's my family label.
Well...
"I have to be going now, René."
- You're welcome.
Your boarding pass.
Sir?
You forgot your bag.
Thanks.
"Nice going, Campbell."
"Hey, Ben."
Basic strategy says you should hit that.
"Burt, Moishe, Vladimir,"
"Mona, Miss Sommers, your new identities are on the bar."
So glad you could make it.
Vladimir Stupnitsky?
Yeah.
Your dad's a diplomat with the Russian consulate.
"You live in Washington, D.C."
"Your hobbies are backgammon, chess and long walks on the beach."
Will anyone help me?
Hey Gocha...
"Don't put pressure, he may die."
"See and tell me, I must kill him."
I must kill him.
"Hey, Doctor?"
- He's on the bed.
- Wake him up!
"Doctor is there, but what you do there?"
What to do now?
Gocha...
Gone again!
My partner said he's in this quarry.
He can't speak properly.
Even a sorry would hear like quarry.
"Sir, is Singamuthu's son a fool like you to come here?"
- Valentine's day?
That's in two weeks.
"Give me the sandwich, Will."
Hold my beer.
I need to talk like an old Italian lady.
What are you talking about?
Is there something you're not telling me?
Are you pregnant?
Did Candace put a baby in you?
I know you're joking but I would happily carry that baby.
"Morning sickness, stretch marks."
I want it all.
There's a point.
I think it's a little weird Especially you.
"Look, I get it."
"You feel like I'm breaking up the best on-screen duo since ""Will  Grace."""
I just want to make sure you're not bummed out.
I'm not bummed.
I'm totally cool.
"Hey, whose Twitter handle is cool Danny?"
Hm?
Not mine.
Not mine.
You know why?
I'm too cool for that.
Ah.
That sucks.
Danny.
"Yes, my sweet little Will?"
Don't be a bitch.
Oh.

"- For your own good, I hope this is a lie."
- Look at yourself.
Stupid fucking nigger police.
- I'm going to ask one more time.
Have something sweet.
"Thank you so much, aunt Anka."
"I'll be off, then."
"Wait, I've got something else."
- What is it?
- Take a look.
Thank you so much.
You really piled up a heap.
"I didn't peel this off, I was afraid to tear the stamp."
- You'll do a better job.
- Thank you so much.
"I asked the neighbours, too."
I know that you collect these things.
- Now you've got a bunch.
"- Thank you, I've got to go."
"Bye, thanks for dropping by."
The series will start now.

It was just like you said!
Lebicada wind on St. Nicholas' Day!
It was a good day for scorpionfish!
Here's one for you.
Are you hearing from me or am I getting a call?
What?
"You said you'd love to call me but then you said, ""Look forward to hearing from you,"" and..."
You see how that's kind of confusing?
"Yeah, look, we'll talk."
We'll get in touch.
You did it again.
Very vague.
You know what?
Let's just say that you'll call me and then we can skip all the nonsense.
"Goodbye, Gigi."
- He was cute.
"- Yeah, please don't cyber-stalk him."
What are you doing?
I'm not calling him.
"If he wants to see me, he'll call."
Wow.
That guy Alex really made an impression on you.
Was he hot?
No.
He was just right.
Morning.
"Morning, Ryan."

Why do you laugh?
Is your son a Police officer?
He is not even passed Inter.
How can he become a Police officer sir?
"No, he is lying."
"He is a Police Officer, I have seen."
I now understood whom you have seen.
"I, myself was confused being his own father."
No surprise in you being confused.
What are you saying?
There is a Police Officer who looks same as my son.
He even has a girlfriend.
He speaks non-stop in Hindi.
My son doesn't know any Hindi.
Are you sure?
How can person failing Inter and working as stuntman become a Police Officer sir?
You can go now..
- OK sir.
Sudhakar..

I am sending the details.
You do an inquiry.
You're so fat!

That's the usual publicity nonsense.
"Ward Fowler this, Ward Fowler that."
Nothing.
"Nothing to you sir, but to my wife..."
"Boy, she's gonna be tickled pink."
(CLEARS THROAT)
But blend it on.
All right.
No.
"I mean blend it, especially on this side."
"Oh, I see."
All right.
Like that?
I can't tell.
"Oh, am I in the way, sir?"
"Oh, forgive me."
You think?
I think you're really brave.
To consider rebuilding who you are.
I don't know if I could do that.
You could.
"- Well, I gotta go."
- Oh yeah.
"Hey, um, practice starts back up again today, right?"
"Yeah, I'm just not sure if I do."
I'll see ya.
All work and no Brooke make Luke a boring boy.
- Hey.
- I got you something.
But I don't have anything for you.

A couple of songs on there that made me think of you.
Of course most things do.
I didn't know you were into Travis.
"Are you kidding, I love Travis."
He's the best.
Who?
Travis guy.
Are we not in the same conversation?
Check out tracks 8 and 13.
You'll love them.
Bye.
Thought you might want that back.

We have most important friends.
Holy shit.
I sent my man for you.
You and the girl must disappear.
We have a place in the hold.
"Come on, go, go, go."
"Come on, go, my friend, go."
Where is Dr. Jones?
What's the big idea?
Let go!
Don't you touch me.
What about Jones?
"There's no trace yet, sir."
Jones is dead.
I killed him.
He was of no use to us.
"This girl, however, has certain value where we're headed."
She'll bring a very good price.
Mmm?
"Herr Colonel, that cargo you've taken- if it's your goal, go in peace with it, but leave us the girl."
It would reduce our loss on this trip.
Savage!
"Gosh bro, this isn't hard to understand!"
Love is like a disease.
You can treat it.
I will prescribe you some medicine.
"Here, shrimp dumplings."
Just eat this yummy stuff you like.
It will help.
"One more thing, you have to find something to do."
So you won't be free to think too much.
Working is good.
Way back when I was like you broken-hearted.
I almost flunked out of college.
I kept working.
"Then forgot everything, even being broken-hearted."
"Stop being sad, no time for that."
Just worked.
It works!

He was just looking us over.

"Oh, it's my treat."
What would you like?
Should we go over there to the inlet?
I think it's not far.
"Oh, the inlet?"
"Sure, I haven't been there yet."
"Well, hop in."
This is my car.

"Sarah's here for dinner, which, uh... is actually going to be ready momentarily, so..."
"So, what was it this time?"
"Did you run out of money, or did you have another fight with Martin?"
"Yeah, it was a big mistake."

"Sarah, wait."
Check your bank account.

- You'll pipe in every time I talk?
- Can it.
- Stuff it.
- They're in love.
- Clearly.
"Mrs. Got Bucks out there not only has a cameraman, she's got a sound guy, too."
It's like a Baz Luhrmann movie out there.
"That's Emily, right?"
- Rich people feel so entitled.
"- Yes, damn them."
I saw her wipe her face with a $100 bill.
We should line them up against a wall.
You know what I'm saying?
- Is Lorelei Gilmore here?
- Yes.
Good.
"Have a look at these, will you?"
- Wow.
Pretty.

Yup.
And do you know how miserable I've been almost the whole time?
- I don't think that's true.
"- Well, I've just kept it from you."
"Yeah, trust me, Mom, you're not that good at hiding your emotions."
Really?
I'm sorry.
You make this difficult because you want it that way.
Men are easy.
"And you've been with Michael, what,"

Yeah.
Yeah.
Something's come up.
You're kidding.
Something of national interest in West Virginia?

"Keep him at bay, okay?"
Are you okay?
You sounda little stressed.
"No, I'm fine."

We were parked up here... and sort a making out in the back seat.
And what happened next... is sort of hard to explain.
"Next day, I woke up and...both my... my eyes were swelled up."
What did the doctors say?
He couldn't explain it.
See this one here?
It ain't never healed.
We're getting engaged.

"No, the ex-boyfriend had an alibi and he checked..."
God.
"That's right, you weren't at the meeting this morning."
But I had to shop for a dress.
I can't wear the same thing every show.

Three!
Three.
"Three, tres, three."
- Hello.
- Sorry.
Just remind me.
"All right, his name is Malcolm O'dwyer."
He's some kind of lottery fanatic.

Hey!
I'm a big fan!
- Thank you very much.
- Not you.
The Lotto girl.
You'll thank me later!
"I think I know how, but it's a little dangerous."

In between.
Like eating a firecracker.
Yeah.
Okay.
Here's what we're gonna do.
Well... aren't you kids playing nice.
"Hey, Ethan, over here."
Look at my face and hands while I'm talking.
I just want you to know it's my mom's birthday today.
"Um, it isn't June 3, it's today."
Okay.
"Wait, I have some questions for you."
Uh-huh.
"Um, what does ""Ethan"" mean?"
Um...
Sounds like how Shakespeare Huh?
"So, maybe that's where it comes from?"
Yeah.
I don't know.
Maybe.
"Next question, uh... if a train leaves New York at 4:00, and another train leaves Dallas at 5:00, what time will they meet?"
Uh...
Great.
"Well, I'm kind of busy right now, so I'm gonna have to let you go."
Have fun at my mom's birthday.
Bye.
Uh... do you want juice?
!
See?
We haven't got a proper officer so we get pushed about like potboys.
He's not a proper officer.
Never seems to tire.
Hard to catch him off guard.
"He let you off light, Sharpe, back in the village."
So why so hard?
"He's just not right, Cooper."
He's not happy being an officer.
And mark my words he'll bring us bad luck
We'll do it tomorrow.
In the mountains.
Vale.
The fire's started.
Prepare to fight
Down
Get down!
Or I'll kill him
Rifles!
To me!
"Oh, my God."
"Young Perkins, sir."
Not a sound.
No!
No!
"Perkins, I want you to protect this pennant with your life."
"Yes, sir."
"Never say die, Perkins."
"Never again, sir."
They'll be back for them two.
Up!
Keep moving!
How are you holding up?
Good.
Come on.
Let's go.
Hello?
- Jane!
- Mum...
We're here now.
Shh.
"Let's pack up your things, and we'll drive you home."
"Erm... no, it's all right."
I want to stay here.
- Erm...
- OK.
- OK.
- I'll be fine.
I promise.
"Would you both stay, just for a little bit?"
Of course we will.
As long as you need us to.
What do you want?
I wanted to return this to you... make sure you got it.
It was David's.
One of the lads at the station was meant to get it back to you a couple of weeks ago.
He forgot.
Can't trust men to get anything right.
Ta.
Take care of yourself.
"One glowing review, you're the Sheriff of Hackney?"
It's just...
It's just what?
"You don't want to spend the rest of your life in uniform, like me?"
- It's gonna happen.
I can feel it.
- Shut up.
You're gonna jinx it.
"Please, God, if you give us a snow day,"
I promise I'll be a good boy for the rest of my life.
"...Abington High closed, Germantown West closed,"
William Penn Academy... open.
- Balls!
- Why?
!
I'm back to being a bad boy.
"This is on you, Mother Nature."
"Sadly, we were that one school that never closed for snow."
"Abington High closed,"
- Germantown West closed...
"- Please, please, please."
Say it.
"Say ""closed."""
"I will fist-punch the radio if you don't say ""closed."""
...William Penn Academy open.
- Balls!
Balls!
- I hate everything!
I'm a man of my word!
Ow!
"Every time, it was the same heartbreak... until the snow gods finally showed mercy."
William Penn Academy... closed.
"Am I still asleep, or did he just say William Penn is closed?"
"He said ""closed."" School is closed."
This is the best day of my life!
I feel so alive!
You're gonna have a baby.
"I hope they haul you in, turn a fire hose on you Iike the Iast time!"
-I want my girl down here!
-You stinker!
"Hey, stella!"
"Hey, stella!"
I wouldn't mix in this.
"Don't ever leave me, baby."
"BIanche, come back!"
Miss DuBois?
Miss DuBois?
AII quiet along the Potomac now?
She ran down here and went back in there with him.
-Sure she did.
-I'm terrified.
Nothing to be scared of.
They're crazy about each other.
It's a shame this had to happen when you got here.
-violence is so--
-Sit down on the steps...
-...and have a cigarette with me.
-Why I'm not properly dressed.
"well, that don't make no difference in the Quarter."
Such a pretty silver case.
"I showed you the inscription, didn't I?"
Yes.
So much--
So much confusion in the world.
Thank you for being so kind.
I need kindness now.
Bananas!
Bananas!

What do you want?
I agree with you.
"You can taste the Silvaner grapes, the Muscat."
I can sense my old lady.
What's your old lady want?
She coming to the basement?
"You mean, if we stay too long?"
Really?
- She'll come?
"- Yeah, in a bikini."
In a bikini?
I'm gonna wait then.
I'll wait till she shows up.
Till she arrives in a bikini.
- This I want to see.
- Me too.
Will she dance for us?
"Sure, she'll dance."
She could get lost in such a big basement.
It's roomy enough.
- How long have you been married?
- An eternity.
- How long?
"- 25, 24 years."
What?
- 24 years.
- How much longer will she want you?
I can't say for sure.
We're heading down a long road.
She's built to last.
"So, I'll show you your future room."
Shut the door.
I'm a masochist.
like some company?
"Yes, I would."
Hi.
"Hi, Andy."
"Hi, boss."
Hi.
Did you hear that?
That was bad.
"That was very, very bad."
Want a date?
I don't think that's going to work.
That's Reverend Whitehead.
God doesn't let him do that.
Got you an ice cream.
Being on the job probably makes you hungry.
Thanks.
What are you doing here?
Looking for you.
Where are you going to sleep tonight?
"In a hotel, if you'll get lost and let me make some money."
I-I don't think you should be doing this.
"What are you, some kind of child missionary?"
Sort of.
I did have an idea about the sleeping thing.
"Hi, Frank."
She spoke to me.
"I speak to her, but she never speaks to me."
"Hey, Frank, going to the dance?"
I-I can't dance.
"Me, neither."
"Aren't you going to introduce us to your friend, Frank?"
"I'm Frank's father's sister, Aunt V, and Frank and I are very, very close, aren't we, Frank?"
- What?
- Yeah.
Positive now?
You're only nineteen.
- I'm twenty.
- You're only twenty.
I know what age I am.
Don't start getting snotty with me.
I should be getting snotty with you.
Sorry.
"It's shocking, that is."
What do you think?
- I don't know.
- That the best you can do?
"Well, what do you think?"
I don't know.
"I should give out, I suppose... or throw a wobbler or something... but what's the point?"
"I mean, if she was..."
You should have come to us earlier.
"Before, you know, when... said you were gonna get pregnant... then we could've done something about it."
My God.
"You're positive, now?"
Absolutely certain?
Shh.
"Molly, my Irish Molly"
Good girl.
What's that on your face?
Shaving foam.
Oh.
"Well, fair enough."
"My Irish Molly, when you are near"
Who was it?
- Was it?
"Fucking hilarious, he totally did you."
- Have they chucked him out?
- Doubt it.
"Not gonna chuck him out for that, just a scuffle."
- He kicked me in the cock.
- Good shot!
- What happened to Hannah?
"- Erm, I think you blew it when a twelve year did beat you."
I fucking slipped!
He's talking to a load of Northwood lads.
- What?
"- They don't look twelve, to be fair."
"Fucking hell Si, you muppet."
We are so dead.
What?
Dead?
That should be the end of it!
"Simon's taken a beating, a child's honour's been restored."
- I didn't take a beating!
- Yeah.
This is Northwood.
"It's not the end, it's the start!"
- We do what now?
- I get Charlotte?
- Is she hard?
"- No, she'll get them thrown out!"
"I'll go find her, you go and hide somewhere."
- Hide?
"- Yes, hide."
- Toilets?
- Charlotte!
[ The phone rings. ] Charles?
Then what good are you?
Little Mosque on the Prairie S06E07 Mosque of Dreams
- RAYYAN:
Hello!
- SARAH:
Hi!
"Mom, is that bacon?"
That's bacon.
What are you doing?
I'm not eating it.
"Well, not yet anyway."
Do you know I haven't had bacon for over 30 years?
Because it goes against our beliefs?
"Well, I'm just not sure what our beliefs are anymore."
"Mom, what do you mean?"
You're a Muslim!
What if I'm a Muslim because I was married to a Muslim?
"Well, um, how long have you been feeling this way?"
"I've been on a date, I've had wine, and something else Ann put in my drink, and now I'm thinking about trying bacon."
"- No, don't do it!"
- Hey!
- That's turkey bacon!
- Oh!
I'm not going to jump in headfirst.
I've got to dip my toes in a little.
- Hey!
Hey!
- Ow!
"Fine, I guess, I had that coming."
AMAAR:
It'll be our own mosque.
Or just hitting Mike.
- It's like hitting a puppy.
You cannot...
- But we were in character.
"I know, but..."
It would have been so Of Mice and Men.
I didn't do it.
But back to the Denzel story somebody thought Michael was Denzel.
Did you ever think that maybe Denzel was just standing behind you?
- We looked to make sure.
- They were looking at me.
"I looked around for Denzel, because I love Denzel."
- But there is no Denzel.
"- No, it was me."
Did we have any celebrity sightings on the shoot?
- I don't...
"- Wait, wait."
"Yeah, we..."
"Oh, God."
"Well, now I forget."
"Remember there was a guy near Don Hill's who was crossing the street and I was like, ""That's the guy from..."""
Really?
"He's in a band, remember?"
He's handsome.
- Was it Mayim Bialik?
- I forget.
- Maybe.
- Mayim Bialik.
- Could be.
- I love Mayim Bialik in Blossom.
I don't remember.
"Mayim Bialik was, like, head of a Yiddish singing group."
- Good.
"Sifu, there's a tailor outside... to make your birthday robe."
- What?
He said he wanted to make a new robe for you.
Ask him in.
BIRTHDAY ROBE TAILOR
I thought you were the tailor Thao.
Thao has gone back to his village.
"Sifu Wong, can I take your measurements?"
OK.
"If you wear what I make for you, you'll look good."
"Why don't you make one for yourself, too?"
"- Front chest, 24 inches."
Strong torso.
- Thank you.
"Arm, three feet."
What sleeve do you want?
Literati style.
"Sleeve width, six inches."
Two feet split.
"Height, five feet."
1.8 for the shoulder.
"Waist, 30."
Do you need a nail to take measurements?
A button was loose.
I was trying to fix it.
"Oh, thank you."
Any time.
Let me measure your neck.
"Collar height, two inches."
- Are you done?
"- If you'd stayed still, I'd have finished."
"Mr. Lawrence, I told you I wasn't an actor."
I'm so sorry.
Sorry about what?
That you did such a terrific job?
That the phones are lighting up like crazy?
They love you.
And those little ad lib things you did?
You were wonderful.
Wasn't she wonderful?
"So, what do you say?"
About what?
About doing it full time.
It's just three nights a week.
I promise it won't interfere with your day job.
"I mean, I don't know."
You really thought I was good?
I told you when I met you.
You're a natural.
Mr. Monk?
"Well, I..."
Why don't we think about it?
Okay.
I will.
I just did.
I want to do it.
"Oh, Mr. Monk, I'm so sorry."
But I could really use the money and I think it could be fun.
There you go.
A star is born.
No.
Don't worry.
It's not going to change a thing.
"Sergeant Beecham shoved that junkie into a lamp post and he said, ""I'll keep you posted""?"
"Oh, yeah."
I heard about that.
"Yeah, everybody heard about it."
"I mean, people were repeating it."
It was famous.
This is even better.
This is a classic.
If you say so.
"Yeah, I just need to pick the right moment."
Captain?
"If you're ready to release the body,"
I can take her downtown.
Okay.
I still don't get it.
Who would want to kill the lotto girl?
I guess her number came up.
Hey!
What are you doing?
"Hey, what are you doing?"
"That was my line, man."
What are you talking about?
I just said the exact same thing two seconds ago.
Ask the Captain.
"Randy, this is a crime scene."
For God's sakes...
No.
You heard me.
Yeah.
You know what?
He must have heard me.
Huh?
"He'll understand, believe me."
Connie.
"If you don't listen to me and marry this man,"
you'll disappoint me.
-Famiglia!
-Cent' anni!
"What's ""Chen dannay""?"
"""Cent' anni""."
It means 100 years.
It means we should all live happily for 100 years.
The family.
-It would be true if my father were alive.
-Connie.
Hey...
"Merle, you've met my sister-in-law, Deanna."
-Fredo's wife.
-My pleasure.
"With all respect, I didn't come here to eat dinner!"
"I know, I know."
-I just want to dance!
-You're falling all over the floor.
You're justjealous because he's a real man!
-I'm going to belt you right in the teeth.
-You couldn't belt your mama!
These Dagos are crazy when it comes to their wives.
"Michael says that if you can't take care of this, I have to."
-I think you'd better.
-Never marry a Wop.
They treat their wives like shit!
I didn't mean to say Wop.
Don't!
"What are you doing to me, you big slob?"
"- Let's get him out, okay?"
"- Please, please, get me out of here!"
It's gonna be a piece of cake.
When I was a kid I used to build....
- I used to build forts in these tunnels.
- You did?
Yeah.
"You gotta watch, because when it rains, the water comes up really quick."
"Joey, listen to me."
You go find a phone.
You call 911.
You tell them to send a rescue squad.
"All right, Joey?"
Go!
Go!
"- Well, where's he going?"
"- Well, this grate is locked."
- I'm gonna need a little help.
- But you said you could do it.
- What's that light down there?
- I don't know.
- I'm gonna check it out.
- Don't leave!
- I'll be right back.
- Wait.
Just don't!
"Ben, listen to me."
I'm gonna get you out of here.
I promise you that.
"But you gotta do me a favor, okay?"
You gotta trust me.
Can you do that?
But it's no longer a Chinese's place.
It's a British colony now!
I don't care!
I won't let anyone bully me.
Alright.
Leave me alone!
"The salary which you haven't paid me, if it's convenient... may I get it back?"
What did you say?
The salary which you...
The previous line.
No.
"You told me to leave you alone, didn't you?"
Good!
Very good!
It's what you said!
"Master, you love chicken's kidney's very much."
Eat more.
More rice.
Let me do it...
"Master, your rice."
Don't you know I am on diet?
I want half rice!
Let me do it...
"Bastard, what a useless guy!"
Half!
"Look, half bowl of rice which you want!"
Eat it!
"You do this in my place, you are not giving me face, are you?"
You said you would leave me alone.
"You lost, Chan Mon-gut!"
Peace!
Peace!
"Uh, is everything okay today?"
Why wouldn't it be?
No reason.
"So, what do you want to lay down today?"
"Uh, no."
No bets.
I'm just going to cool it today.
Thanks.
So why did you call me?
"Uh, shit."
"I got to go, Ivan."
I'll talk to you later.
So what does that mean?
"It means we wait 10 hours, figure out what the hell's happening."
"Babe, can we talk?"

"Hey, Ivan."
What a surprise.
"I was wondering why you showed up tonight, and then it occurred to me."
It's probably 'cause I called you like a paranoid fucking idiot.
(HITS WALL)
"Hey, Ivan."
What a surprise.
What are you doing?
He's going to be here soon.
You can't leave me alone.
"Well, I'm not in the picture, so, send me a text message when it's done?"
"Well, I-"
"I'm not in the photo either, so... maybe I should leave too?"
- Don't you have any friends?
- None in particular.
- Who drove you to work?
- Where did you see him?
Out the window of Mr Moravia's office.
I don't miss much.
"That's Stiller, a guy I work with."
- How about that woman?
- What woman?
The one that gave you the lunch.
"That's Rose, Stiller's sister."
- Is she your pash?
- My what?
Your passion.
I don't know.
When you're...
"when you're flying all the time, you don't really have much of a chance with women."
I think you hide behind that scar too much.
- You ever do anything with her?
"- What do you mean, ""do anything""?"
"You know what ""do anything"" means."
You're blushing.
Your veins'll be too close to the skin.
I've known people like that.
I'm hungry.
Hey!
Hey!
Wait a minute!
- It's Stiller!
Hey!
- Hey!
- Jimmy!
I always get these things right!
No thanks.
"Yeah, no thanks."
"But, I really can tell the future!"
"Right, Saho?"
!
"You smell nice, Saho-san."
Ah!
That smell is incense.
I love it.
"The smell is great, and it is interesting to watch the smoke rise."
It makes me feel really relaxed.
Yeah!
I have been getting into incense lately myself!
Incense is great!
Okay!
Okay!
"Oh man, Fumi!"
You really are doing whatever your teacher does!
Of course I am!
"By the way, Hibara-san."
Hm?
"Actually, I have a favor to ask you."
Smoke?
I heard about your grandfather.
I heard that he deals with things from the other side.
Fumi-chan!
Sorry!
Saho-san was looking up things like that!
There are... a lot of things that I want to know.
Is it possible for me to talk to him?
Sorry for visiting you at such a busy time.
She works here.
I'm positive.
"She a waitress, bartender, like, what..."
She's a waitress.
I know the manager.
"I'll go talk to him, see if she's on tonight."
"Give me some money, I'll get drinks."

Donna was the chef.
Antoine was her number two.
"Back there was Ray and César, they were the kitchen staff."
"Gunther was the catering manager,"
Candace was his assistant.
Lots of other people.
Good people.
"They were here, then they were gone, and nobody came down to say,"
"""Can we please keep them on?"""
It wasn't fair.
You think?
- But Griff is different.
"- Oh, yes, he is."
Because they didn't do anything to deserve to be turfed.
"Don't worry, Goni."
They'll be leaving soon.
"Mr. Ben-Shmuel,"
I'd like you to come down to the station with me.
Now?
"- Yes, now."
I don't want you to go.
I'll just go for an hour.
"Finish the bookshelf, then go through the house."
He'll stay here to finish.
Sorry for the disturbance.
Alex?
The police came and took Yitzhak.
I don't know.
- Detention center-
Will Daddy come home with us?
"I don't know, Goni."
Is it because of the policemen who came to the house?
- Yes.
What did they find?
- I don't know.
Then why did they take him?
Did he do something wrong?
"No, he didn't."
"Always remember that, Goni."
When will Daddy come home?
"I don't know, Goni."
He said he'd be back in an hour.
They took him to ask questions.
Are they allowed to?
- Yes.
Can we spend Saturday with him?
"No, you're not a dog."
You're a great man!
We're outmoded characters.
We're outcasts.
I don't want to die like a dog.
"But you see, I didn't keep one last bullet."
I have one.
-Jeffrey!
"-Jenny, don't move!"
Don't leave me alone!
- What'll you do?
- Storm my way out!
"Don't kill anymore, please!"
Give up your guns and come with me.
What?
You saw me kill Sidney.
He was my best friend!
And you dare tell me to surrender?
"When Chang died, I swore I'd kill you."
But now I don't want you dead.
Get out of here withJenny.
How?
They'll chase me to the ends ofthe earth!
I have nowhere to go!
Get out there and say you're a cop.
See ifthey give up their guns!
Jenny!
Jeffrey!
Dumbo!
"Thanks, Mickey Mouse!"
I owe you.
You owe me nothing.
I cast that cat myself.
"And sir, while they are my-- Ow!"
Aaugh!
"No, no, no, no, no."
He's okay.
I need you to talk for two minutes.
About what?
Anything.
All right.
"These cats are more than just pets, sir."
"Why, just this morning--"
Excuse me!
Where is the manager?
"I'm from the government, and I'm here to inspect your chicken nuggets."
Uh-oh.
Look at Shorty.
This honky grandma be trippin'.
"What's up, America?"
I'm coming into your house live.
"Lemme hear you say ""We love you, Tracy."""
"We love you, Tracy!"
I am the third heat!
He's brilliant.
Are you drunk?
Yes.
Why did you fire Pete?
Why did you disappear all night?
Is this some kind of a power play?
"Yeah, yeah."
"It's not so fun being ""hands on"" with these bloodsuckers, is it?"
Could we talk about this on Monday?
No.
Just think about it.
"Think about it, boys!"
All right.
I'm hitting it.
You dudes give up that easy?
I'm not a cop.
Then lift your shirt.
Show me you're not wearing a wire.
"All right, you know what?"
Just to show you you're being an asshole.
I'm blinded by white.
Douchebag.
Come on.
I was joking.
Come on.
Don't walk away angry.
Sit down.
Come on.
"I mean, what are you complaing about?"
"You got abs, man."
Kinda.
"Whatever, dude."
I'm not even sure I want to buy anymore.
I think you turned me off to the whole thing.
Come on.
Don't be like that.
"I just need you to prove it, you know?"
Prove you're not a cop.
How the hell am I supposed to do that?
I don't know.
I got it.
Go over there and punch that dude right in the face.
"Yeah well, let's call it my retirement plan."
You killed Yale.
And Paolo.
You dragged them into this.
Now give me the fucking numbers.
You're outta luck asshole.
I forgot 'em years ago.
Really?
Oh you did?
I don't think so.
"- Papa, please help us."
- Please...
Mama?
You know it's gonna take me a little while to get to Zurich so make yourselves at home.
There's a bottle of Chateau Le Fit in the cellar.
You kids knock yourselves out.
I'll see you at the bank at four.
You remember where that is.
"'Kay, we're not staying here."
And I am not letting you out of my sight.
Get her ready to go.
Hurray.
"No, no."
Please.
- Please.
- Listen.
Listen to me.
Listen.
"You say nothing about this, and your daughter will be home tonight."
Talk to anyone and she's dead.
You understand what I'm saying.
"Look, I"
Are you a cop or not?
Now you come up with this story and I'm supposed to believe you.
When was the last time you saw this girl?
He's putting them in the water so I'll find them.
- He wants me to find these girls.
"- You're crazy, that's it."
- He called me.
- He called you?
- That's right.
- What did he say?
- He didn't say anything.
- You dreamed it.
Get in your little boat and get the fuck out of here!
You're an alcoholic.
You need help.
- Get your head examined.
- Maybe you need a drink.
- It'd ease the pain of being wrong.
- Get out of my sight.
Keep those people out of here!
Am I talking to myself?
Put Grandpa back on.
Just a second.
She sounds good.
Yes.
"Okay, bye-bye."
- Hi.
- Hi.
Are you all right?
"Yeah, I'm fine."
Okay.
This is it. 16 months ago.
- l gave all that to Missing Persons.
"Okay, mister."
Okay.

- Pass.
- Hit and run.
"- No, he's too old."
- What'd he look like?
- Medium.
- Medium what?
"- Medium young, medium height."
- Medium weight.
- Very illuminating.
"You can call him medium, what's left of him."
Barracuda got the rest.
That's the lot.
- All the rest empty?
- Yeah.
Not much business f or the one cool spot in town.
"- One just came in, but he don't fit."
- How do you know?

This one came f rom a car smash.
You don't want to see him.
- l might as well blanket the field.
- He's as crisp as bacon.
- l can stand it if you can.
- Okay.
He was like a lump of charcoal.
"Now, wait a minute."
Josephine was abducted from her husband.
Tony was abducted from his wife.
You think these couples represent a happiness he covets?
[Morgan] Or something he lost.
He's a young guy with a deformity.
Major insecurities come with that.
A trauma like that would be devastating for him and anyone in his life.

Michael:
MY NAME IS MICHAEL WESTEN.
I USED TO BE A SPY UNTIL...
Man:
We got a burn notice.
You're blacklisted.
"WHEN YOU'RE BURNED, YOU'VE GOT NOTHING --"
"NO CASH, NO CREDIT, NO JOB HISTORY."
YOU'RE STUCK IN WHATEVER CITY THEY DECIDE TO DUMP YOU IN.
WHERE AM I?
MIAMI.
YOU DO WHATEVER WORK COMES YOUR WAY.
YOU RELY ON ANYONE WHO'S STILL TALKING TO YOU.
A TRIGGER-HAPPY EX-GIRLFRIEND...
SHOULD WE SHOOT THEM?
...AN OLD FRIEND WHO'S INFORMING ON YOU TO THE FBI...
YOU KNOW SPIES -- A BUNCH OF BITCHY LITTLE GIRLS.
"...FAMILY, TOO..."
IS THAT YOUR MOM AGAIN?
...IF YOU'RE DESPERATE.
SOMEONE NEEDS YOUR HELP.
BOTTOM LINE -
You can use these for the posterior.
"Let's face it ladies, what man doesn't like a little ""junk in the trunk""?"
So...
"What do you say, girls?"
Who wants to be bootylicious?
I think I'm bootylicious enough.
Whoo.
Uh...
Hi.
Excuse me.
Um...
I'm meeting someone here.
The reservation is under Elise Lacey.
Oh.
Hi.
Your date's waiting for you.
Follow me.
"Oh, really?"
Is he normal?
- I wouldn't exactly say normal.
- Really?
You must be Kitty.
That's very good.
Thanks.
"I'll be back to tell you about specials in a minute, senator."
Thank you.
I never would've figured you for a silent treatment type.
I'm not giving you silent treatment.
I'm considering how I can tell you off without losing my job.
- You're angry.
- Yes!
Yes.
(Mrs Drayton) I'm always saying the wrong thing.
I'm sorry.
(Jo) Not in the least.
"Dr McKenna, do you -"
"Why don't all of you sort of turn around here, or something."
It's kind of - kind of hard on the neck.
(Mr Drayton) It's in one of our English counties.
It's not what you'd call a farm.
It's more of a small holding.
Here we are.
- 0h.
- lsn't that fascinating?
Yes.
- There we are.
- Uhh.
"- Hey, they look good."
- Surprise.
"0h, they look wonderful."
"Ah, looks like bread."
"- We're not going to eat all that, are we?"
- No.
- (All Laughing) - ls that the way you do it?
"Yes, just break it, just like this."
"It won't break. 0h, no."
"Well, I'm gonna"
- There.
- ls that the way you do it?
- That's quite alright.
That was a tough one.
Does it chew any better than it tears?
- ls it fattening?
- l imagine it must be.
"It's OK, polo."
There.
"feels good, huh?"
Yes... yes...
What's going on?
"Nothing, I got caught in his headphones."
He often screams like that.
"I was washing him, the headphones fell, he couldn't hear the music."
Seeing lots of strangers makes him yell... or losing his play farm figures.
What happened?
- He fell in the bailer.
- baller?
- The thing that makes balls of hay.
- I know.
He fell in one when he was small.
You've known him long?
always been neighbors.
We played together as kids.
"Right, polo?"
What's the music?
"""Give me roses""."
Fernand Gignac?
Yeah.
What else?
"Nothing else, for 37 years."
- How old is he?
- 45 years old.
"'Give him some roses, mademoiselle"
"'He has a "" rendez-vous"""
'It's very important
'Choose them for him
'Among the more beautiful ones
I'd be afraid.
What are you afraid of?
I don't know.
There's a lot of time to think.
Strange ideas come to mind.
For example?
Some things.
When you're alone?
-No.
Even though you're with me?
Even more with you.
Then you're afraid of me.
You?
Not a bit.
Maybe indirectly.
"Those ideas may scare me, not you."
I'm glad I don't scare you.
What'ss the impression you get about me?
-Fear is not one.
Will you be upset if I tell you something?
I hope not.
Sometimes you make me laugh.
I find you funny.
Yikes.
Yes.
When you're worried about something.
You're funny.
You think too much.
That's true.
Of course it is.
You're always analyzing everything.
And saying what's good and bad.
And souls don't die.
Soul?
"Mom says it's something inside of all good things, and that it goes on forever and ever."
Souls don't die.
(CLAPPING)
You're very kind.
Thank you so much.
You ever seen a better picture than that?

- Daniel Hagman.
County of Cheshire.
Poacher.
"So, you're a good shot, then, are you, Hagman?"
"Aye, I can shoot, sir."

I can put you on a charge for that.

"Excuse me, are the phones working here in Serbia?"
Where is she from?
- From Belgium.
Belgium?
"Maybe he does not know, but his country is a coat."
"Yes, we know it."
- What a pity.
You are at the center of Europe and you do not know how to keep your mini-country together.
Nor is his country a good example.
"Ignore, Dragan."
"- He is right, I like it."
"We are mythical matter, Lady Louise."
The Balkans are the Balkans.
There is love.
I hate it.
It's love.
My neighboor is on the ferry.
You told me to change the departure.

-You can not warn him now.
-A whole family!
No difference.
Do you understand the concequenses?
-You know someone on the boat as well?
-Might be.
-Dont you think about it?
-I've been ordered not to.
-Its innocent people!
-And?
If we have gotten an order..
Someone has done the caluclation
We save more people by sinking the boat
-Is it that simple for you?
"-Yes, its that simple."
What if i warn him?
I didnt hear that.
Get up in the mountains (raveen?
) and make contact with England.
There you await new orders.
I'll see you there in two days.
Did you hear me?
-Einar.
-Yes.
-Second row.
-Thanks.
Your welcome.
"And please, come in."
Thanks for last night.
Yeah.
"Yeah, it really is."
No.
Mom...
"Squirt, where the heck's your mom?"
I know I asked you to be my stepdad.
Do you mind being my friend instead?
"So Julie's had enough of the old Bullit, eh?"
We can still play ping-pong together.
Come on.
"You know, I let you win."
"No, you don't."
"Yes, I do."
In your dreams.
You ever see that movie Casablanca?
No.
It goes like this:
"Peanut, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship."
"Come on, luck be a lady, luck be a lady."
Oh!
"I can't believe this, I didn't win."
Shocking.
"Well, if it's any consolation, though, this soft serv is outstanding."
Would anyone like seconds?
"Yeah, I would."
"Yeah, me, too."
Thank you.
Sorry things didn't work out with you and Julie.
Hey...
I'm sitting here sharing ice cream with my kid.
It's been a long time since I've done that.
Tell me that's her.
"BECAUSE I SPENT MY YOUTH AND $30,000"
"ON WHISKEY AND DEVOTION TO THE JOB,"
"BECAUSE I HAVE A LONG-SUFFERING WIFE AND TWO SWELL KIDS,"
AND BECAUSE YOU AND I TOGETHER ARE GOING TO CRACK THIS MURDER THING.
MR. LOVING WANTS ED ON HIS TEAM.
YEAH?
"WELL, HE'S NOT GOING TO HAVE HIM,"
BECAUSE ED'S GOING TO HELP ME!
AND LET ME GET ONE THING CLEAR-
I DON'T PROMISE YOU A THING FOR YOURSELF.
NOT A THING!
"WELL, LET ME MAKE MYSELF CLEAR, JON."
I DON'T CARE WHO GETS THE JOB.
"FOR ONE THING, I'VE BEEN OFF A CRIME BEAT FOR 5 YEARS,"
"AND FOR ANOTHER, I'M NOT GOING TO GET"
MY THROAT TORN OPEN IN ANY DOGFIGHT.
"NOW, ED, I'VE BEEN REAL NICE TO YOU."
"NANCY, TELL ED I'VE BEEN REAL NICE TO HIM."
Mildred:
I KNEW IT ALL ALONG...
JUST KNEW I WAS GOING TO FIND A FRIENDLY FACE DOWN HERE.
"WELL, MY FACE IS FRIENDLY."
HI.
"HELLO, YOU LOVELY PEOPLE."
"I ALWAYS SEE YOU TWO TOGETHER, DON'T I?"
YOU COULD DO A COLUMN ABOUT IT.
"OH, I'D LOVE TO, DARLING."
I'M ALL FOR ROMANCE.
HAVE A RUM ON THE ROCKS OR SOMETHING.
"WELL, NOW, THANK YOU, JON."
THAT'S RIGHT FRIENDLY OF YOU.
AND I DO THINK WE SHOULD ALL BE VERY FRIENDLY
Where are they?
- You can't just barge in here!
- Where are they?
I ain't seen them.
They're not here.
Bollocks.
- Don't lie to us.
"- 'Ere, I know you."
Have a heart and tell me.
What happened to my son John?
She doesn't know.
Right.
"Well, John's dead."
Where are the other two?
A man we identified as John Bentley was killed in an explosion at the British Savings Bank...
- All right.
Now she knows.
"- Daniel Mitcham... and our colleague, Detective Inspector Leonard Bradfield."
We need to know where Clifford and David are.
I ain't seen 'em.
There's no-one here.
Right.
I'm sick of this.
- Where are they?
- I don't know.
- Who told you about John?
- What?
It was on the wireless.
"We haven't released that information yet, so who told you John didn't get away?"
Nobody.
A Bentley till the bitter end?
Deal with her.
Sats 88.
He's not talking anymore.
Why is he not talking?
Because he can't.
Let's Betadine the whole chest just in case.
- You need any help?
- Yes.
With his wife.
She's bleeding.
- I'm not his wife.
- Then you shouldn't be here.
- Where's the rapid infuser?
- Got it.
We need that blood.
Let's get her on a monitor.
She refused treatment for chest pain at the scene.
I'm Dr. Kovac.
Come with me.
- No.
Somebody needs to be with him.
"- Okay, I'm in."
- Hook me up.
- Let us take care of him and Dr. Kovac will take care of you.
Please.
What are you doing down there?
"Lewis, what are you doing up there?"
This guy's got no DP pulse.
It's called a trauma assessment.
"Lungs clear, chest tones normal."
- Got the Doppler.
- Give it to me.
- Sweet Jesus!
Get me another commander.
"I'm here, sire."
I can't wait to get my tentacles on 'em.
"Damaras already called up tentacuss, boss."
And more xborgs stand ready.
Good.
Crush this resistance.
Hard. [remote screaming] [laughs]
I'll show the prince how easy it is to handle these humans.

I hope he likes the way I'm redecorating the place.
"[screaming] [super red] Hey, squidface."
Huh?
[grunting]
Ah.
The Power Rangers.
"I've been warned about you, but you look different."
Huh.
You should have heeded that warning.
Ugh.
So much for introductions.
Get them.
[battle cries] Let's switch.
It will double your blasting power.
Thanks.
My super mega saber's all yours.
Thanks.
You gotta have the right tools for the job.
Ugh.
Yeah.
Let's get that job done.
I'm on it.
It's possible.
"Oh, my God."
What are we going to do ?
Everything we can.
Another great vacation getaway in the Pegasus galaxy.
Where is everyone?
There's smoke from the chimneys.
They're inside.
Can't say I blame them.
There's nothing I hate more than a damp cold.
Let's check this out.
"Howdy, folks."
- Who are you?
- Sheppard.
"This is Teyla, Ronon, McKay."
You from Ratira?
No.
"From over the mountains, then?"
A little further.
Then you've come a long way.
You'll be in need of food and drink.
Sit.
I take it you don't get many strangers around here.
No.
Especially not those that travel near dark.
Why is that?
You really don't know?
Callum.
What's your business here?
"No business, really."
We're just travelers.
Men without bikes.
"Oh, boy."
"Waltzer, Waltzer, look, don't worry."
"Your cut's waiting for you, that's right."
Relax.
Relax.
"Look, I tell you what..."
-Ow!
-Right.
"Look, if you don't get all of your dough, feel free to kill me."
"What do I look like, huh?"
A Laundromat?
A slot machine?
'Cause I am not a slot machine.
You are a slot machine.
"Step right up here, folks, there's a winner every minute."
Sorry.
"Oh, what, l-I hurt your feelings?"
No.
"No, and you want to know why?"
'Cause you don't got no feelings.
"Yes, I do."
"I'm a person, and I have feelings."
"Oh, ho, you're a person now."
"Hey, she's not a person, is she, Betty?"
"Yeah, she sort of is."
Nobody's talking to you.
"You know what the test is, baby?"
"If you were a person, you could do whatever you want..."
Ow.
"and you can't, 'cause you do whatever I tell you to do, isn't that right, Betty?"
Y eah.
"ROBERT, DON'T SAY THAT."
WHY NOT?
"IT'S TRUE, ISN'T IT?"
"WHEN YOU ADOPTED ME, YOU WANTED A GIRL, DIDN'T YOU?"
AND HE WANTED A BOY!
"NEITHER ONE OF YOU WAS SATISFIED, WERE YOU?"
I REMEMBER ONCE WHEN I WAS 8 YEARS OLD-
8 YEARS OLD!
"I WAS HELPING YOU DUST THE HOUSE,"
"AND THAT WOMAN FROM ACROSS THE STREET CAME OVER AND SAID,"
"""MY, MY."""
"AND YOU SAID, ""YES, I KNOW."
"""HE'S EXACTLY LIKE A LITTLE GIRL, ISN'T HE?"""
"BUT, ROBERT, YOU ARE MY SON"
AND MY DAUGHTER
AND ALL THE CHILDREN I EVER WISHED I COULD HAVE HAD.
DON'T YOU LOVE YOUR MOTHER?
SHALL I SHOW YOU HOW MUCH I LOVE MY MOTHER?
"OH, I HAVE SUCH A GOOD BOY!"
NOW I'LL BRING YOUR BREAKFAST.
YOU MUST BE AWFULLY HUNGRY.

Aunt Letha?
Aunt Letha?
It's absolutely dreadful the way they bring up children these days.
Come on.
"Tony, the bus won't run without me in it."
It's all my fault.
It's such a mess.
"Well, I guess we'll just have to fix it."
I'm sure Uncle Bene won't mind.
I'll do the engine.
You do the body work.
- OK.
"- So long, Alfie."
"Goodbye, Alfred."
"What job will you do now, Mr. Yo-Yo, uh, Yokomoto?"
"Oh, I've saved my money."
I'll probably open a Japanese delicatessen.
"Hey, kids, look."
I don't understand this.
- Man!
"- Wow, what a family."
The molecules must have rearranged themselves...
- ...somehow.
"- Uh, that's a possibility."
You know what this means?
They never saw the wreck.
I'll tell them that the reports were exaggerated.
"And, if you kids will go back to school,"
I'm sure they won't fire me.
We got in an accident.
"Oh, my God!"
We almost got in an accident.
That seems like a really important distinction.
"There was this big truck, and it barreled through a stop sign, and it missed our car by inches."
"Oh, my God!"
And everyone's okay?
"- Yes, just very shaken up."
- Aw.
"But, Mitchell, I am so sorry that I yelled at you before."
It's fine.
"Look, I brought you the birthday card for mom,"
- and you can sign it.
- Okay.
Thank you.
"- ""To our best friend."""
- Mm.
That's a little sarcastic.
It's her birthday.
- I don't know.
"- No, I mean it."
"Mitchell, I almost died."
I want our mom to have a great birthday.
"Oh, and we're doing this again."
- Okay.
"- Oh, God."
Yeah.
Hi.
"I'll be there in a sec, yeah."
"Okay, my deposition got moved up."
That's great.
So I'll just have to move everything... you know what?
- l'm sorry!
I have to get out of this house.
They say it'll be here in twenty minutes.
Great.
Hello?
Yeah.
Hold on a second.
It's for you.
Hello?
Kyle!
Thank God it's you!
I'm sort of not really that hungry now that I think about it.
"Okay, great!"
"Yes, I'll be ready."
"Okay, bye!"
- N ice.
- What?
You just made a date with Kyle?
"Yes, not that it's any of your business."
I don't believe you!
What about Brian?
Angela!
"Kyle is my boyfriend, I hate to tell you."
Brian Krakow happens to be waiting in my living room... and I don't know what you're doing with him!
Nothing!
Nothing!
We're just friends.
"Yes, when Kyle's not around, you've been using him."
You are lecturing me about using Brian Krakow... when he is so obviously in love with you and you totally use him!
- Brian Krakow is not in love with me!
- That's not what Rayanne Graff says.
You know what?
And she got her head chopped off
So her daughter Elizabeth made a vow never to marry a man.
She married her country.

Irrelevant?

"It was dad who said if I was gonna go, I should stay gone."
Your brother and me -- we needed you.
"You walked away, Sam."
- You walked away!
"- Stop it, both of you."
"You're the one who said, ""don't come back,"" dad."
"You're the one who closed that door, not me!"
This is never the life that I wanted for you.
"Look, I'm sure dad would have been here if he could."
She's such a slut.
So?
"Personally, I'm very pro-slut."
"What happened, anyway?"
"She totally banged Jamie Jaffe, that's what."
She gave him the reverse cowgirl and everything.
"Hi, Taylor."
How was your weekend?
"Fine, I guess."
You didn't... go to the rodeo?
That's my spot.
Sorry.
This is a skeev-free zone.

You shouldn't listen to those jerks.
Leave me alone.

You're sorry?
No.

Bring her back!
No!

Yellow.
It was parked outside the house.
Yellow looks like white at night.

She talks to the dead in her sleep.
She asks them what she wants to know and the dead tell her.
Have a seat.
I've been talking to my dead mother the last two nights.
And she said... she saw the girls at the abandoned farmhouse.
- Something wrong?
- Nothing.

HBO-style content.
"Well, it's not HBO."
It's TV.
And I don't think that it's a good fit--
"You know, cause I wanna drop truth bombs."
You know how pissed off I was when Us Weekly said that I was on crack?
That's racism.

Come over here!
I always come at the right time.
Where's Smithy?
He stayed down there.
I lost sight of him.
It all happened so fast.

"- Come on, get up there."
- Hurry up.
Come on.
I wonder what your father would have said about this ruckus.
"Yes, of my aunt, by the one of the rent."
"One does not worry about the rent, we can reach an agreement."
That is what worries me.
By the way.
"It has called a friend of yours, a certain Sandro."
"He has said that it is very urgent, must call to him immediately."
I have pointed its number here.

"Listen, don't confuse work and family."
"We have to know, give or take a day, when we'll finally return to Tehran."
You said it would happen in the first three days.
"You said, ""Next week."" And then nothing happened."
"I, uh..."
"And I did one recently that was so big, when I..."
What was the question again?
The question was about...
LAUGHTER
I mean...
"I tell you who misheard, David O'Doherty."
LAUGHTER
"And he was like, ""Oh, that's a sweet job"
"""you've done there,"" you know?"
LAUGHTER
"OK, top thing people get jealous about."
People that can spell definitely.
LAUGHTER
Ohh...
"I've got D-E-F - after that, I've got nothing left in the locker."
LAUGHTER
That's why defo was invented.
Defo.
LAUGHTER
New girlfriends or new boyfriends.
"Yeah, that's a good answer, yeah."
It's that sort of area.
"Flirting, flirting."
Flirting with...
Yeah.
Flirting is exactly it.
Ahh.
APPLAUSE
"Yes, the top thing people get jealous about is their partner flirting."
I'm a bit of a flirt.
"Just last night, I had a girl give me a look that left me in no doubt as to what she wanted."

"No, it's pretty good, hon."
"- Well, I -"
- No plate.
- No?
- No.
No knives and forks either.
I understand you're supposed to dig in.
"0h, allow me to show you, will you?"
You use only the first two fingers and thumb of the right hand.
"You don't use the other two fingers, and always the left hand in the lap."
"- (McKenna) 0h, I see."
- May I show you?
"- Ju-Just these two fingers, huh?"
- l'll hold it for you.
- See.
- There we are.
"Well, I, uh... uh..."
"Boy, could I use this hand."

- l'll practise on an olive.
"0h, honey, it's wonderful."
Here.
Take a bite.
- Good?
- Yeah.
"Tell me - does this way of eating have to do with religion, or something?"
I think it's more social than religious.
I don't know.
"It's well worth a flutter, but pay the tax on it before..."
"Oh, delighted you enjoyed your stay."
Very nice.
Hope to see you again before long.
- There you are.
- Thank you.
"Goodbye, Mrs. Fawlty."
"Goodbye, Mr. Firkin."
A satisfied customer.
We should have him stuffed.
"Oh, Mr. Fawlty, 3:00, Exeter, Dragonfly."
Right?
"Yes, good luck!"
Jolly... jolly good luck with it.
"Morning, Major."
"Good morning, Fawlty."
"Yes, dear?"
"What was that about the 3:00 at Exeter, Basil?"
"Oh, some horse he's gonna bet on, I expect."
"You're looking very spruce this morning, Major."
"- St. George's Day, old boy."
- Really?
"Got a horse, have you?"
What's his name?
"Did you catch it, dear?"
"Dragonfly, Major."
"- Going to have a flutter, Fawlty?"
"- No, no, no, no, no."
"No, Basil doesn't bet anymore, Major."
"Do you, dear?"
"No, I don't, dear, no."
That particular avenue of pleasure has been closed off for me.
- Where?
Where?
Whaddya have to do?
Don't you plug in the phone?
- Which part?
- I don't get it.
"What about that guy, Taka?"
We need to ask you something.
How d'ya get on the 'net with PlayStation2?
We can't?
!
But I heard you could.
Says we need an adapter...
But we don't have one!
Who does he think we are?
We ain't got one.
Have you?
Why the hell not?
That was no use.
We're back to square one.
Doesn't Taka have a computer?
"No, he just knows a lot."
Buys magazines then can't afford a computer.
What's up?
"That guy, Kanzaki!"
He'll have one.
That weirdo electrician?
He's not a weirdo!
"Who, who?"
My Dad told me.
So the weirdo's got a computer?
He's not weird.
(THUDDING)
"Thank you again, Annie."
"Good night, Hogarth."
I'm sure we'll see each other again

I've got some really cool ones.
"MAD Magazine, (LAUGHS) very funny."
"The Spirit, very cool."
Boy's Life...
Ehh...
"Oh, here."
This guy is Superman.
"Sure, he's famous now,"
- but he started off just like you.
- Hmm...
Crash-landed on Earth.
Didn't know what he was doing.
"But he only uses his powers for good, never for evil."
Remember that.
"Oh, that's Atomo, the metal menace."
He's not the hero.
He's the villain.
He's not like you.
You're a good guy.
Like Superman.
Superman.

She'll be lucky to get married.
You'll be lucky to avoid getting married.

Subpoenaed?
To appear where?

[Rick] No.
You're right.
"Walter, this is unbelievable."
Okay.
All right.
"Look, he's been through a lot."
"Just don't break his heart, OK?"
"Oh, my God!"
I just...
You know...
Wh...
What can I say to you to make you understand that we are not together?
"You know, if you don't believe me, you can ask..."
Ask my boyfriend.
- You have a boyfriend?
"- Yes, I do."
It's a very serious...
I love him.
"I'm sorry, I..."
I guess it was just a misunderstanding.
Mm.

"Lately, she has even been coming home late."
"Hey, buddy."
This place has gone totally downhill.
"Hey, buddy, where'd you come from?"
"I saw you inside, raising hell."
"Yeah, that chump took my backpack!"
"So, Natasha..."
Yeah.
"Man, what about her?"
Have you seen her?
"Long gone, bro."
She hasn't danced here in months.
You know where she is?
"Last time I saw you, you wanted to punch my face in."
You remember that?
- Vaguely.
- It was that chick.
Zoe.
- Out of the picture?
- Out of the picture.
- You got blow?
"- No, man."
Why would I have blow?
Natasha...
Got a couple ideas where she might be.
There he is!
"Welcome back, Conner!"
- Ah!
"That really does hurt, man!"
- Chemical burns will do that.
Not too serious.
Looks like the EMTs did a good job irrigating.
That ambulance guy brought my camera?
"Oh, wow, complaining."
"That's very interesting, considering nobody invited you."
"Before I came along, you were on a skateboard."
Oh!
Oh!
You like them?
"Yeah, I guess."
"Well, what do you like?"
Everything.
"Well, I don't know."
I don't really listen to music.
"Dude, that's kind of weird."
Why?
What do you like?
"Uh, right now... punk."
"I'm sorry, Avril Lavigne doesn't count as punk."
Oh yeah?
"Well, what about the Cramps?"
Stiff Little Fingers?
The Clash?
Sex Pistols?
I listen to the same music as Marissa Cooper?
I think I have to kill myself.
"Listen to punk, huh?"
I'm angry.
That's it right there.
Looks scary.
"Well, then, you can stay in the car."
"You recognize this place, Ryan?"
This isn't...
Where are we?
"Well, it's one of my mom's housing developments."
Look at this.
4 more break-ins on casino boulevard.
It's getting so you can't walk out the door anymore.
"Well, you can walk out the door."
You just can't go left.
That's not the point.
"A man should be able to walk out his front door, turn right, turn left, or walk right out into the street if he wants to."
"Don't make me lock you in the house, dad, ok?"
"Well, hello."
Ooh.
That shirt looks sexy on you.
Does it?
"I, uh, hadn't noticed."
"Hi, I'm Doug."
I'm a pisces.
I like walks in the rain and bags of pork rinds.
"Work it, baby."
Work it.
"I got the trash, babe."
That'll be our deal.
"Every time you buy me a shirt, I take out the trash."
"Oh, that's ok, honey."
I got it.
I got it.
"No, really."
It's fine.
What--what is this?
Barry's big and tall shop?
What?
"Oh, that's trash, baby."
You got my shirt at the big and tall shop?
Did I?
"What if we were to do it in the dark, dark recesses"
- of the closet over there?
"- Oh, yeah, that sounds great."
- Okay.
- All right.
[clattering]
"Oh, God, there's some stuff in there, sorry."
"Oh, wow, there's a lot of stuff in here."
That's gonna make for a tight fit.
"Yeah, you know, that'll only be sexier."
"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay."
"- Ouch, ouch."
- I can't... ow.
- Ow.
- Emma?
"- Oh, God."
- What's going on?
- Emma?
"It's Maggie, shh, shh."
[knocking]
- What is going on?
- Hey!
I'm dying down there.
"I thought Cookie would wanna see my old hockey stick, you know?"
Remember how good I was at that?
- [toy squeaks]
"- Stop it, stop it, shut up."
"Shut up, there's someone in here."
We're not alone.
I don't hear anybody.
You shut your mouth for once in your damn life if you wanna survive this night.
"- I think we're okay, I mean."
Back to work.
"Hey, Kelli Ann."
Did I get any calls?
"Since you asked me 11 minutes ago, no."
Not a lot of phone traffic.
"- Oh, my God."
- What?
What's her name?
Who?
"The girl, Alex."
There's no girl.
"You can't hide it, man."
I know strung out and you are strung out.
"Okay, please."
KELLI ANN:
This is amazing.
"You can't focus, right?"
"Jumping every time your phone rings, checking your e-mail 100 times a day wishing you could write songs."
"No, feeling the need to bring up her name in random conversations."
"It's always the same and it has happened to you, my friend."
Shit.
"Welcome to my world, asshole."
Let me get the door.
Sure I can't interest you in a little beef and broccoli?
I gotta finish this stuff.
Okay.
- Yeah.
So I'll see you at home.
- Okay.
I love you.
I love you too.
- Okay.
Pen perfect?
It's not worth it.
What do you think?
It's not very good.
It's very...
Buckley.
It's not your fault in there.
Really isn't.
I better go home.
So...
Exterior train station.
"A full moon, a clear sky."
A man sits by the shore.
There has been a quarrel.
A woman is walking away from him.
Now she turns back.
I didn't mean what I just said.
And anyway...you said worse.
Hm.
Declaration...
Stupid bloody fool's good.
Did you think of that beforehand?
Are you trying to put a fight with me Mrs.Cole?
"No...what I'm trying to say is that, if all of this stopped."
"The sparring and the jibing, and the insults and the arguments."
I'd miss it.
Even if I were dead.
I'd still miss it.
The Catrin Cole school of dialog.
On and on and on and on and on.
Lose half.
Which half?
I forgot mine...
Please...?
Give me the fucking keys!
Thanks!
"- See you at home, little girl..."
- Hey!
- Shut up!
- But I didn't say anything!
Shut up!
"Abby, I did it!"
You did what...?
They were gonna push me in a hole.
In the ice.
So I got a big stick and I hit him in the head really hard.
He had to go to the hospital I almost got suspended.
But I did it.
What you said.
I stood up to them.
Owen Yeah?
- Hey...
You wanna go somewhere...?
- Where?
"""ENTER UNDER PENALTY OF DEATH"""
- It's pretty cool huh?
- Yes.
This this kid who used to live in the building.
Tommy.
"He would come down here and drink and smoke with his high school friends, and.."
"And when they weren't here, He would play ping-pong with me."
He was really cool
Then he had to move away.
I kinda like it here...
While the two of you were down on Vor-Deeth:
How do you know that the real Hawk wasn't replaced by one of those... those fakes: : :
During the time that he seemed to disappear?
[Whirring]
You cannot possibly believe what you are saying:
You are frightened!
You bet I'm frightened!
You're trying to kill both of us!
"Wilma, whatever is in your mind..."
[Man] Right here:!
Turn it on:!
Move!
Move!
It's a photon cannon!
[Wilma Screams]
Wilma!
Hawk!
"Over here, Buck:!"
Help me:!
I'm pinned!
[Screams]
"Buck, the cable!"
High voltage:
I can't move:
Help me!
- Hawk!
- Never mind me:
Get to Wilma:
[Screams] Help her out of there:
"That cable touches her, she dies:"
"Buck, please:!"
Hurry:!
"You could have it all, my empire of dirt."
I will let you down.
I will make you hurt.
"I wear this crown of shit, upon my liar's chair."
"Full of broken thoughts, i cannot repair."
"Beneath the stain of time, the feeling disappears."
"And you are someone else,"
And I am still right here.
What have i become?
My sweetest friend.
"Everyone i know, goes away in the end."
"You could have it all, my empire of dirt."
I will let you down.
I will make you hurt.
"If i could start again, a million miles away."
I would keep myself.
I would find a way.
-One more try!
-One more try!
"-No, that didnt count!"
Thats...
"-Yeah, really..."
"Oh, we get a light, we got a ...."
Woo!
All right!
Awesome.
This way?
We can go this way...
Polaroid!
.
-Ready?
-OK!
"Everyone's a cousin in Burnley, Calum!"
"Mate, I'm not joking."
"I was on the dancefloor, this tune was playing."
I had my hand up both of their skirts at the same time.
It was like I was dancing with Sooty and Sweep!
"Very suave, man, very suave."
"Oh, mate, that will be a little surprise package I've arranged for us this evening."
But without wanting to give the game completely away...
"They're twins, they're from Macedonia and"
They don't have keys.
Shit.
You.
Out.
"Laters, bro."
"Rawley Park Estate,South London"
Mr Douglas.
Calum.
"No, no."
Ha ha ha.
John Mercer.
I'm not staying here.
Where was it you two shared a cell again?
"Pentonville, wasn't it?"
I'm not staying here.
He's an idiot.
That's a bit harsh.
Granted he's no Steven Hawking.
"John mate, don't be like that."
"Don't John mate me, please."
I'm not staying here.
You don't want to live with him?
Fine.
"- No, he says she's nearby."
Where do the Andersons live?
"Uh, Indian Village."
- That's 3 miles away.
- Let's go.
"[Woman] Here you go, hon."
I found a few more glasses for you.
Tom.
"Oh, my God, Tom!"
[Groaning]
[Kaman] Where is Tracy?
"Sir, I keep trying the Anderson house, but the line's busy."
[Busy signal]
[Garner] He must already be there.
"Garcia, have any fires been reported in the area?"
"Negative, but medics and fire suppression are on the way."
- Good.
Tell them to stand by.
- Roger that.
- There's one more thing I gotta tell you.
- What is it?
[Muttering]
[Kaman] Let's just get honest with each other.
Where is Tracy?
- She's not here.
- You're lying.
I know she's back.
Tracy's going to medical school in Ohio.
I don't believe a damn word come out your mouth!
We have no reason to lie.
"It's been five years, Kaman."
She's moved on with her life.
Looking for a room.
"My mother ain't here, but the lady in number two will show you the rooms."
Yes?
Yes?
I'm looking for a room.
Mrs. Maggione's kid told me you'd take care of that.
Yes.
I'll get the key.
Third floor.
There's something about your face that looks awfully familiar.
- You've been looking at the funny papers.
"- No, really."
"Listen, sister, all I'm looking for is a room."
Here it is.
Mrs. Maggione will give it a good cleaning.
- It's all right.
I've seen worse.
- I guess you have.
- I'll take the room.
What's the tariff?
- Five dollars a week.
- Sold.
- In advance.
All right.
Write me a receipt.
You can trust me.
How did you happen to come to this house?
"Looking for references, huh?"
An old friend of mine sent me over here.
"Jerry Connolly, the priest from the parish."
- You know him?
- Father Jerry?
- Whose money are you using?
"- Yours, thank you very much."
But our money belongs to us again.
What's the idea?
Remember our bet?
"You see, you didn't get married."
- I'll pay you later.
- No.
All aboard!
- But I've got to get that train.
- You mean you had to get it.
"You know, you didn't win that lucky quarter."
I'll flip you for a ticket to New York.
I don't want to go to New York.
He doesn't want to go to New York.
"Goodbye, Lucky, old boy."
So long.
"- Goodbye, Lucky."
- See you later.
"Give my regards to the folks, will you?"
Say hello to Aunt Lucy.
So long.
"Goodbye, Lucky."
"Lucky, here's your suitcase."
Here's your toothbrush.
"Boy, I'd give my life for a smoke."
"- Well, take the quarter."
"- No, sir, not the lucky one."
Wait a minute.
I'll get a smoke.
"I beg your pardon, have you got a match, please?"
Thank you.
I'm okay!
No need to be worry!
"I'd rather be the one who git hit, instead of you getting hurt!"
Do you know how afraid I was?
"How come you are still like a child, playing these?"
I haven't played them for a long time.
What a beautiful necklace!
I think I saw it somewhere.
It's nothing!
Get back!
"Xiamu, do you have a girlfriend?"
No!
Give it back to me!
- Tell me about her!
"- No, I swear!"
Give it back!
"Obviously you bought it for the girl you like, stop quibbling!"
I don't have any girlfriend!
Xiamu!
I... like you!
"Xiamu, it's only your sense of dependence."
I have been treating you like my brother.
Don't talk to me!
Keep it on your neck!
Ah...
Why are we here?
Surprise!
Are you?
It was joking!
Hello?
My dear!
Have you lunch yet?
He saved Ben.
- We're his parents.
How is he?
- It's too soon.
- The news said his heart stopped.
- It's going now.
- How's he doing?
- Coag looks good.
Lytes are normal.
- Blood pH 7.37.
- Thank God for small miracles.
- How's the patient?
- He hasn't gone into DIC.
There are reporters crawling all over.
- What's his temp?
- Eighty-five degrees.
- He's not warming up enough.
- Heated pleural lavage?
His heart won't take it.
We could bypass him and warm his blood directly.
- That'd be fastest.
What do you think?
- You're the Attending.
Call Cardiac Surgery for a perfusionist with a bypass pump and a heating unit.
"Lily, go get Benton."
- Mark needs you for bypass access.
- Got to stop the bleeding first.
Thoracotomy tray.
Now!
- We'll go to the waiting room.
"- No, I wanna stay."
"No, we have to go."
It's from Laverne.
"- Corporal, can I have my letter, please?"
- Huh?
Oh.
"Oh, yeah."
- Yeah.
"Here, Father."
- Oh.
[Moaning] Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
"- Good morning, Klinger."
"- Good morning, darling."
"- Come again, snookums?"
- Huh?
Oh.
"I'm sorry, sir."
It's a letter from Laverne.
Laverne... the ex-missus who left you high and dry for that butcher boy?
Morty's a sausage maker.
That's below butcher in the Toledo social register.
"But everything's changed now, sir."
Listen to what I read so far.
"""Dear Maxie, You are much in my mind these days."
"""Taking up with Morty was a terrible mistake."
"The man's soul is made of animal by-products."""
"Guess that makes you feel pretty happy, huh?"
- Seeing the sausage king put through the old grinder.
"- It's more than that, sir."
Can't you read between the lines?
She wants me back.
"Oh, that's music to my eyes!"
I love vinegar.
"So, your office is in Peel House?"
I've got clients on the fourth floor.
My office is just across the square.
We're on the first floor
- Stanley Brothers.
Pop in some time.
Pauline loves a visitor.
"Right, I shall."
I shall pop!
Please...
Are you Jimmy Baker?
Yeah...
Is your mother in?
"No, she's at her other job."
"Oh, right."
"Well, how are you doing?"
Have you been out playing?
"Singing, I'm in a choir."
"I sing, with a dance band."
We've been on the wireless.
So I've actually sung on the wireless.
"I gave you a rubber ball once, do you remember?"
You would have been about three.
"It was a big, coloured ball."
Have you not still got it?
I had better go in.
Hang on a minute.
I'm off to Canada.
Pastures new...
As they say.
Have you heard that?
"Mandy, I really like you."
That's for making me fall for you.
"Aw, they're in love."
"Ah, my face!"
We got our very own chocolate fountain!
Some of it just went down my underwear.
I like it.
This is the best weekend of my life.
It doesn't even matter that I'm allergic to chocolate.
"Rudy, what?"
"Ugh, stop eating it, then."
"Oh, 'cause I'm allergic to it?"
"Yeah, what happens when you eat it?"
"I don't know, I've never eaten it."
I don't know what...
Rudy!
Rudy!
Just kidding.
"Damn it, Rudy."
It's not that bad.
I just get a rash on my back.
There's my babies.
Why are you covered in chocolate?
Why are you covered in wine?
Don't ask questions.
"Yeah, ditto."
Oh.
I feel like I French-kissed the whole train.
Uh... yum.
"Hey, Mom, did you have a nice birthday at least?"
I did.
"Wait, who told you it was my birthday?"
"Go, I'll pay you later."
I can't start the day... with debts.
So what do you want?
I also start the day with debts...
"What am I working for, then?"
I don't give a damn.
Beat it!
I have no money.
What do you want?
Come back later!
"Just think a bit, I have to earn a living."
"Go on, beat it!"
I won't flee...
"Hi, Korotoumou."
You could wait until the morning is over.
Korotoumou... do you have my money?
Don't insult me!
- Aren't you a bitch!
"- Yes, I am."
"I have your money, but I won't pay you."
You'll pay me.
Is the Mecca wall painted... with your shit?
And yours?
Fucking bitch!
You old whore!
Calm down!
Have you no shame?
"Traoré, breakfast is ready."
What's the matter?
I don't feel like talking.
I'm worried.
- You know them well.
- I don't know what's going on.
- I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.
- What is wrong with your mom?
- She's bipolar.
She's bip...
She's an official lunatic.
And you let us get in a car with her?
"I tried to talk you out of it, but you would never listen to me."
If you would've told us she was crazy.
"No, near the mall."
"No, I'm fine."
"No, Mom, I just need you to come pick me up."
"Mom, no, please, just come pick us up."
"Izzy, I'm so sorry to have to put you through this."
"Grace, it's me."
I always knew.
I always knew there was something different about your mom.
Go.
Go.
"I'll deal with Olivia, okay?"
- Mom?
"- I'm up here, honey."
How could you do this?
You lied to me again.
You stopped taking your medication again.
"- Oh, I have my medicine."
- I hate you.
I'm done.
I'm so over it.
I have my medicine.
It's right here.
Something to preserve.
"The blood is fresh, but not human."
"Let's find out, he's at the end of the blood trail."
It smells like something big died.
"Yes, Ash has returned in his suit."
"Just smell it in your pussy with your breath, Kix."
Listen to the talk.
Pay attention!
.
"Okay, we split up"
"Come here, little bird."
"Come here, come to Dad!"
Stop the nonsense!
I have goose bumps here!
"Who knows, what is circulating around here."
"All right, I'm going in."
I'll cover you.
Let's go for it!
"You are dead, Kix"
Suck me the dick!
"What do you think this is, Commander?"
Noid art?
Hey friend.
Fuck you
"Fortunately, he is dead."
Let's take a blood sample.
Shit!
Hatta!
Hatta!
"Shit, I can not aim!"
I'm going out!
Son of a bitch have to pay!
We will manage any expense.
Please go on and make necessary arrangements.
- Sure.
What's wrong with you?
I know what I'm doing.
The way my son saw me before 10 years
The way he likes to see me.
That's exactly how I'm dressed up.
He will cry out asking if this is what he got his vision back for!
You are jealous.
He won't even be able to identify you.
Shall I stick a mustache?
Mom!
Mom!
- Sir.
Please sit.
It's a hospital.
- Where is my mom?
She will be here.
- Who are you?
Varun!
- Mom!
Where were you?
I have no clue.
What is happening?
Nothing.
You are in a hospital.
You met with an accident.
"Varun, please don't strain."
Be calm.
You were hit by a car while getting back from the restaurant.
How long have I been kept here?
"- with $20,000..."
- Wait.
Wait.
"Seriously, wait."
Wait.
Wait.
What if I go and get the watches out of the locker?
No one's looking for me.
We can... we can fence them and then we have the money.
We can do whatever we want.
"We can go wherever we want, right?"
We could change our identities and go to Tallahassee.
So you... you want to steal the watches to help me with get away with stealing the watches?
Yes.
That is exactly what I want to do.
I can't let you risk everything...
I love you.
"I love you, too."
You think you can do it?
I know I can.
You ready?
Yeah.
(Rhythmic crashes)
(Growling)
(Thunderous footsteps approaching)
(Grunts)
(Growling and thrashing)
"Oh, damn it."
Oi!
Hey!
You big git!
(Growls softly)
President Raphelson has ordered an air strike..
"on the White House, and I can hear the planes coming."
L..
I have to go.
I'm sorry.
"Delta 26, requesting permission to deliver payload."

"""Unaware of the danger."""
"""Tell me, how is that fair?"""
Oh shit!
You see...
- You are lucky.
- Yeah.
You got yourself a date With me in the rain.
A walk with me feels like a date to you?
"No, not really."
There should be a sunset for a proper date.
And flowers.
A light drizzle...
Soft music...
A long walk...
And endless conversations.
Conversations.
And what if it starts pouring down heavily?
Then?
What happened?
"This car can accommodate your dilemma, as well."
Sorry.
Take your time.
Keep getting wet.
Dilemma.
"""She's completely drenched from head to toe."""
"""She's definitely a little crazy."""

"Uncle Ray, I saw a gun."
I saw the gun.
He took a shot at me.
Tell 'em.
They took a shot at me.
[ Man ] Stay here with us.
Tunney didn't even get the grand jury for shit like this.
"Fuck the G.J. You're Superboy, huh?"
"You saved, what?"
Six black babies?
"Come on, kid, the shit plays!"
- Three babies.
"- Hey, one at a time, please."
"I got P.A. on another channel, the mayor's office, assistant D.A."
Press up the yin-yang.
The only reason they're not here now... is we got gridlock from across Bronx to the Palisades.
There's no gun.
"You didn't see it,Jack?"
You can't find it?
- Flaky.
"- Listen, I heard a shot."
"I heard a shot, Ray."
- I heard a shot.
I saw a gun.
"- In my trunk, in the grand union bag."
"- I heard a shot, Leo."

OK.
You're ugly.
You're the ugliest woman of Earth.
Everyone knows it but me.
To me.
You're beautiful.
You don't know me.
When will I know you?
Enough.
I mean...
In two weeks?
A year?
Ten years?
How much time does one have to fall in love?
You're not in love with me.
You just want to leave your apartment.
No.
I don't want to leave.
You don't want to and yet you're suffocating.
So you fall in love with the first woman who cries in front of you.
You want her to get you out.
- No.
I'm fine here.
Not me.
I'm not buying it.
You're not even handicapped.
But I am.
You revel in your phobias.
Of course.
I revel in them.
That's what phobias are.
How strange!
He still hasn't appeared.
Oh!
It fell apart!
"Oh, my god!"
This is Moriarty's doing.

What a fantastic engine I have stolen!
It works perfectly with my beloved 'Crow'!

Crap?
"No, no."
This stuff is beyond crap.
This is what crap wants to be when it grows up.
Listen to this.

Mom and Dad's night out.
Me and Golly's night in.
Hello.
What's that smell?
Delicious German bratwurst.
We hate bratwurst.
I love bratwurst.
Since when?
I'll get it!
No.
"No, no."
How can we go anywhere?
"- You're not dating her, then."
- I went to her house and...
- That's not dating.
- Have you gotten anywhere yet?
- No.
- I would have dug in the first 20 minutes.
"- Shut up, man."
- Dude.
"- Anyway, she invited me to a skate party Saturday night."
- It's a rich kids' party.
- Yeah.
"- Oh, yeah."
- This is nice.
Like it?
- Yeah.
- What is this?
250?
- Yes.
- How much?
- Way too much.
That's how much.
- I like it.
"- My mom's making chocolate cake tonight for Tim's birthday, if anyone wants to come over."
- I can't.
My parents want to have some bullshit big talk.
That sucks.
- I thought that Tim and your mom broke up.
- She took him back.
Fucking dick.
Treats her like crap.
Remember that one time when your mom kicked him out of the house?

Calm boy Erik is his son?
"Yes, it is."
"Children, let's go."
"Uncle Bud, it's not fair."
Come on you all.
-But this place is so fun.
"Erik, come on."
Not return to the land of the emperors.
Do not be silly.
-I will be here.
But it's personal at home.
His mother must be very worried.
"Erik, you better do what your father says."
But I do not like it there.
"Oh, little one, I'll tell you a secret, right."
Sometimes when you are a little different the world laughs at you.
-Right.
-Yes.
"Think you are funny, pointed wings."
We have a saying Insvelândia there.
Believe in yourself Erik Sven because they believe in you.
Can I ask?
-Yes.
"So is this your, uh, big ""Welcome to Hawaii"" plan?"
Pin me to some guy with a badge?

Come here.
Ahem.
- What are you laughing at?
"- Punk, you're like, 7 years old."
"I don't get it, Mary."
"I mean, why come back here?"
You already missed the funeral.
You think I feel good about not being there?
Truthfully?
"I don't know, I can't tell."
"I mean, we were invisible to that man."
"I would have taken anything from him, even disappointment."
Because at least it would have been something.
"Listen, Mary."
"You know this is really hard for you to accept, okay?"
But Dad loved us.
"He just didn't know how to show it, I guess."
"Hey, I got that address on Sofia Archuleta."
"Mary, right?"
"Sis, meet Danno."
Danny Williams.
- What's up?
- Not much.

Seriously?
"Ha, ha."

What is it with you people and ties?
We're in Hawaii.
You are gonna have so many guys calling you.
Can I have your leftovers?
"Molly, men aren't Chinese food."
You can't just heat them up the next day.
I'll take 'em cold.
"Hello, Alex."
"Oh, hi."
You came to see me...
Mr. Larson.
What brings you here?
"Uh, a peace offering for your dad."
"I know he's ticked off 'cause I screwed up his real estate deal, so I brought you all some of our tavern's famous corned beef sandwiches."
Mm.
Yummy.
That's very considerate of you.
"Can I see you in my office, please?"
Should I come in and take notes?
- No.
- Please?
Can I come in and...
"Right, get back to my own work, that's what I'll do."
You look great.

Yes.
I don't know if I can.
It may have gone down to the bank.
I've got to have it back.
Why?
It's just as good a check as Mrs. Ryan's.
"I know, It's just that I've got to use that check for a transaction after business hours."
Nobody'll honor a personal check.
"Oh, I see."
It's endorsed.
I know.

Yoon.
You accepted the job from Peng?

You know the scale of that job is 2 months of work.
You've only got 2 weeks.
And you accepted it!
Yeah.
You know even though I...
"I didn't screen it, you should have known better."
Why did you take it?
Peng always takes advantage of people.
You're the only one who looks up to him.
You know when he said that you're the first person he thought of.
He lied!
You know that?
"At least someone thinks of me, Je."
"Thought of you, that's f*cked up."
He only cares about his job.
So he sweet talked you into taking this job.
Turn him away from me.
Keep up with me.
You can move faster than that.

I...
I just wanted to be with you.
"Oh, my God."

Hm?
"Now, you have fun."
That is an order.
You're going to enjoy bossing everyone around in Singapore?
Too soon to be funny.
Be happy.
Mwah.
"Rio awaits, and I've got a meeting at the office to get to."
"Oh, I'll miss you."
You're late.
The other bidders were hoping you wouldn't show.
I'll be happy to disappoint them.
- Sweetie?
- Yes sir.
- Stay close.
- Thanks.
See you later. 9:00.
Red eleven.
I'm approaching the cabin.
It's 5250.
Angels?
The signal's jammed.
Somebody doesn't want us listening.
Angels?
You're cutting it a little close.
I'm not here for the company.
I'm here to place my bid.
Are you sure your employer's prepared
- ...to compete in the big leagues?
- You'll see.
Welcome.
Business is for tomorrow.
Tonight...
A toast.
To the most beautiful flower in the world.
Salud.
Na zdorovie.
None of you have met my boss...
But he's successful because he's risk-averse.
That's why you all have been drugged.
The first thing to go is muscle control.

"- Bonjour, partner."
How was Paris?
"Bonjour, ça va."
I'm not there yet.
I see.
I've found a buyer for our mega-centre.
There will be no sale.
You'll love the price.
I'll demolish a few more houses and build as many mega-centres as I wish.
As you say.
But let's meet and talk it over.
Please don't conduct negotiations behind my back.
What negotiations?
Hello?
Let's meet.
Hello?
An Alexander Kirienko film
Yeah.
"Uh, yeah, this is much better than watching Damon visit Cougar Town."
- No offense.
- Don't remind me.
I've always wanted to see this place.
"Yeah, I guess it's a bit much."
Heh.
"Yeah, my entire house could fit in here, like, twice."
I feel like I've been here before.
It's weird.
Do you guys wanna watch a movie or something?
These are great.
That's just a little hobby of mine.
I did the entire Mustang series when I was 9.
- You like cars?
- That's an understatement.
Come with me.
"So the thing about cherries, you have to..."
Mm-mm.
"Oh, my goodness."
That's amazing.
You were quick.
And that would be my cue.
You're giving up already?
"Oh, yeah."
"See you, guys."
"Prepare yourself, my friend."
"Whoa, wait."
How do you have this?
It got passed down through the family.
Why don't you?
I mean...
The police are investigating bars near the Nam Mountain area.
What's that?
I'm going to eat it after I raise it.
You should've picked a tastier one.
What the hell is she?
- What's going on?
- What's wrong?
"Mister, big problem!"
Your daughter's face came out like this.
Catch him!
You bitch!
It's me.
Dad.
I'm sorry.
I got him!
Excuse me.
Please let me live.
"You know we're foxes now, so we can't let you live."
Foxes?
"Dad, why'd you go on and tell him?"
You've got such a big mouth.
Shut up.
"He's going to die anyway, so who cares if he knows."
Wait.
Can't we let him live until that day?
"I know you're a bit reluctant, but if we let him live it could spell trouble later."
"Sorry, I know it's a waste."
Where should we start chopping?
Mutant Girl
Dismembered Woman
Knife Man
Kumiho Circus Troupe
"Franz, let us wear our old clothes and..."
- What else happened?
- Nothing!
Where did you first meet him?
On the streets?
"And I drive around, risking my life!"
You're a whore!
Leave me alone!
You whore!
I risk my life and work so hard!
Get out of my apartment!
Leave me alone!
Open the door!
It's my apartment!
Out!
Get out of here!
But I saved your life!
Get out!
Scoundrel!
Get out!
Out!
"Yes, she's so soft and faithful!"
I was on the verge of killing you.
Just like Ida.
I wanna be a decent man but it's so hard.
We just remain in the gutter.
"I'm going to drive to the countryside, I can't stand it here anymore."
"We still have a lot to do out there, in Weißensee."
Revenge.
Ede and Biberkopf gotta come along.
"- So, you're taking Franz with you?"
- Yes.
"No, come on."
Already?
[Laughs]
Whoo!
"Now, do me a favor."
I want you to move around with her a little bit.
See if she's worth a shit.
Come on.
"Aye, aye, captain."
This is a fucking good burger.
Did you make this?
I'm on break.
How did you find me?
"Mm, girl's got to eat."
One of mine saw you here and told me.
Ahh.
"I'm not here for you, love."
Don't worry.
What do you want?
"A couple of my girls got picked up and started talking to the cops, saying my name, talking about my business."
I've never said anything.
"I know, Chris."
"That's why you're still here enjoying your new life, spending time with your sons."
The other girls aren't so lucky.
Anyway.
"Point is, if the cops do show up asking you questions,"
I hope you forget my name.
"Of course, Terry."
I'd never say anything.
Sure.
I know you wouldn't.
Ah.
Don't worry.
I stuck a bloody Band-Aid in it before we left.
Holy crap.
Look at that!
Cool!
A diving board!
Oh... my...
God.
This is the greatest thing ever.
And someone just dumped it here for us to find.
We've got to take it home!
What are we gonna do with it?
I don't know.
But...
look at it!
It's... it's got the... and it's... up and... and bounce and... and bounce!
He's right.
We need it.
"One, two, three... go!"
"One, two, three... go!"
"One, two, three, go!"
"One, two, three, go!"
"Aah, Jamie, this is ridiculous!"
"You'll eat dead bugs out of the zapper, for God's sake, why won't you eat your peas?"
You love peas!
Come on.
This is name-brand stuff.
It's three times the price of the food I eat!
"If you want to breathe, you have to open your mouth."
See?
There's no reason for...
"Now you're just going to have to eat some eyebrow, too."
Promise you'll do it.
Not until you tell me what's going on.
"Okay look, just get out of your apartment."
Turn off your cell phone.
I'll call you at the inn as soon as I can.
Go now.
Okay.
Tell Julia I love her.
Mama?
Right.
Who's Julia?
She's my daughter.
You were married.
Kyra's a friend of mine.
We both wanted a child.
I want you to tell me the truth.
About what?
"You, me, what happened in Berlin."
"I told you, we worked together."
Don't.
"The memories are fading, I can feel them disappearing."
I wanna know the truth while it still matters.
Please.
You were studying in Washington.
I was assigned to recruit you.
You seduced me.
It was part of the job.
Why me?
We knew you could help flip Kozlenko.
Who am I?
What is my name?
Kozlenko.
Kusuma.
I am sheik bin-Khalid's living son.
Only god will decide when I die.
"Now, put your gun away."
We have work to do.
You shouldn't be here.
Yeah.
"Well, you hung up on me."
I was... worried.
Hey.
What's wrong?
Hey.
Look at me.
You have to finish mixing the explosives.
Have you forgotten what these people did to you?
What they said about you with those other students?
Have you?
No.
"They destroyed your marriage, and now they're trying to destroy your career."
"No, no."
"Amira, please, stop."
Amira?
I knew you were lying to me.
"Oh, my god!"
He was the one you were texting?
"God, Amira."
You are sick!
You are a sick bastard!
I'm gonna tell everyone...
The door!
Lock the door!
If I catch even a whiff of you dog whistling these guys...
- Do you
- Get over there.
Get your hands on your head.
[Cloudy] Hold 'em up.
We told you people we were comin' back.
We're gonna keep comin' back here until you clean this bar up.
Keep your eye on your neighbor.
"If he drops something, it belongs to you."
"What is this, a fuckin' hospital here?"
Huh?
"- Turn around there, fella."
"- What do we got here, huh?"
This belong to you?
Huh?
"Stand up there, ""noddy."""
Get your hands on your fuckin' head.
Get in there!
"- You wanna take a ride there, fat man?"
"- Oh, bullshit."
Huh?
Pay attention.
We're gonna ask questions later.
Turn around.
[Man Whispering] Fuckin' bullshit.
"All right, shut up there."
Shut up!
Anybody want a milk shake?
"All right, come over here."
You... and you.
"Hey, whiskers!"
Come over here.
- Move ass when I call you.
"Give me a year, J. D."
"Fuck the year, homes."
I'm gonna go make my collections.
Órale.
"What's up, peckerwood?"
SANTANA:
Power became our game.
Make sure the meeting's set for tonight with the Black Guerrilla Family.
Power to provide everything you find outside.
Make sure the Aryan Brotherhood's behind us.
Make sure they're part of the whole thing.
(speaking spanish) I'll be over with the carnales.
"You got your people, Big Jim?"
big jim:
"Be straight with me, man."
"Hey, Santana."
SANTANA:
Extortion.
They wanna do it.
What should we do?
Go ahead.
(speaking spanish)
gambling.
You just give it a little bit of time.
Prostitution.
All right.
"It's done, man."
We give you three packas.
Make sure it's done right.
"We got it together because we had to, didn't have a choice."
The eme is here because before there was nothing.
"You all right, Santana?"
All I know is how to sit down and order a meal.
Not for you.
Just a place to hang.
The chef is great.
The shows are good.
There's a lot of whores coming in.
What do you want from me?
Tommy's a bad seed.
What am I supposed to do?
Shoot him?
That wouldn't be a bad idea.
I'm sorry I said that.
I didn't mean it.
It's just that he's scaring me.
please.
Know anything about the restaurant business?
He knows everything.
He's there day and night.
he could be a stool.
You want me to be your partner?
Is that what you're telling me?
please.
It's not even fair.
You don't understand.
You run the joint.
Maybe I'll try to help you.
Paulie.
You've always been fair with me.
he goes to Paulie.
he goes to Paulie.
Tommy hecallsPaulie.
But now he has to pay Paulie everyweekno matterwhat.
That's no question to ask a young girl!
What's Pepita the Elephant?
An elephant.
Right.
You're both nuts.
How old is she now?
Are you afraid she's yours?
-Is she?
She has no father.
Would you like some coffee?
-Yeah.
Give me your hand.
I'll read your palm.
You have a weird pulse.
It's like two parallel rhythms.
A steady Finnish hump.
And a fiery beat.
You're like Iceland:
"ice on the surface, fire inside."
You should show this fire to a red-haired woman.
She's been waiting for you for quite a while.
"Damn you, Jesse!"
Wrong hole.
The balcony will be out there!
Move it!
I'll come back tonight.
-It's a deal.
I'm no little girl although I like firefighters.
Fight fire with fire.
Ouch...
I don't think you're up to this.
I must fire you.
"Nick at Nite, once in a while."
"All right, I'm going."
Will you wait here?
I want your opinion on something.
How does Mona feel about Rachel moving in?
I'm on my way to tell her.
"She's been away all week, but she'll be cool."
She's been so supportive.
"She even got the baby a T-shirt that says ""Fossils are my friends. """
"Come on, Mona."
Don't kiss ass.
So I'm gonna take off.
"Oh, shoot!"
"Oh, shoot!"
Rachel wanted to see this tape.
-What is it?
-My friend giving birth.
Could you take it to your apartment?
"""Candy and Cookie""?"
"Candy's the mom, Cookie's the daughter."
The father's name is also Cookie.
Why am I friends with these people?
I wanna show you something in the bathroom.
"Monica, grow up."
-What's behind your back?
-Something I want Phoebe's opinion on.
-You don't want my opinion?
-Not really.
"Come on, I'm your older brother."
Ask me.
"Okay, big brother."
Which one would make your best friend want to do your little sister?
- Good.
I'll excuse myself.
"I'm gonna go to the ladies room and I'm going to remove my new, improved butt."
I would like you to order me a petite fillet and a wedge salad.
- And then we'll get to work.
- Will do.
Apology accepted.
- You must be Nora.
- Yes.
- Lawrence McGill.
- Very nice to meet you.
"Oh, my God, look at those earrings."
"Let me guess, a carat and a half?"
"Uh, yeah."
"Uh, are you a jeweler?"
No.
I make it my business to notice beautiful things.
Yes.
Please forgive me.
I'm a little nervous about all this.
- You're a virgin.
- Hardly.
I have five children.
I mean a dating service virgin.
"Oh, yeah."
"Well, yes."
I am.
Are you?
"Oh, no."
I'm an old whore at this point.
Lots of first dates.
"Seconds, not so much."
- Marco Zuloaga.
- I'll put you through.
- To get a referral slip stamped?
"- Along the corridor, Administration."
- Who is it?
- It's Marco Zuloaga.
I'm calling from Jordan.
I read that Lydia died.
"Yes, that's right."
"I'm so sorry, Marco."
I would like to have been told.
We've had so many problems here.
What's going on?
They said Benigno doesn't work there anymore.
Benigno's in jail.
In jail?
Why?
He's accused of raping Alicia.
What are you talking about?
Try to help him.
The poor guy's got nobody.
- Have you been to see him?
- Me?
"After what he's done, I can't."
But he needs help and you're his friend.
- All right.
What jail is he in?
- It's in Segovia.
"Wait here for me, please."
I'd like to see an inmate.
"That's in Visitations, through that door to the left."
Thank you.
But it's not just your legs.
I'm crazy about that little nose of yours.
That cute little button of a nose.
"Hey, Animal."
Animal.
I've been crazy about you for years.
"I've seen every picture you ever made, six times."
"I'd just sit there, watching you."
I wouldn't even open up the popcorn bag.
Animal.
"Animal, wake up."
Wake up.
Betty.
Betty.
"Animal, this is me, Harry Shapiro."
Harry Shapiro!
Harry.
Cut the music!
Cut the music!
Cut it!
At ease.
At ease.
Somebody cover the doors.
"Now, listen."
The men are here to pick up Dunbar.
They're taking him to Berlin.
"They got the proof, looks like he's finished."
Only he's not finished yet.
Hoffy and I figured out a long shot.
I've got all the barracks behind us.
- What are you gonna do?
-Get that smudge pot.
Do you wanna leave ?
I like this place.
It's been a long time since we came here.
Your mother is gonna wait.
It was at least a year and a half ago.
"I wanted to take a book with me, and I forgot."
It was quite sunny !
You had to insist to bring me here.
As usual I dithered.
Aferwards I was happy.
Things were never the same after that.
"Try to sleep now, sweet heart."
Was it Francois who's just called ?
"Yes, he is on the way."
You didn't tell him.
No.
I don't want him to worry.
It's bad enough with you being upset.
This should be him.
Mom ?
Yes sweet heart ?
How do I look ?
Great.
Hi François !
Everything's alright ?
Yes !
How is he ?
Did he sleep ?
No even if he's really quite exhausted.
"He can't sleep, can he ?"
And he keeps asking about you.
"I go see him, and then I will make us dinner."
I told him that it was an interesting idea.
That's the funniest thing I've ever heard.
(SNICKERING)
JOHN:
Can you imagine that motherfucker roaming around Parker center?
(LAUGHING)
DUD:
He'd put a stopper in the bottle.
(BOTH LAUGHING LOUDLY)
That yokel wouldn't last 10 minutes.
Put a stopper in the bottle.
(LAUGHING)
FERN:
"Hurricane, what are you doing back there?"
You know no one's supposed to be back there.
"Just getting a candy bar, Fern."
You going to pay for it this time?
"Hi, boys."
I saw your car parked out front.
Charlie come to relieve me about a half hour ago.
Dud?
I didn't mean to put you on the spot this morning.
"(RADIO SQUAWKS) Listen, Dale, we didn't mean..."
"Oh, that's me."
"Yeah, this is 2-10, go ahead."
LARRY:
"Hurricane, I just got back from Little Rock with that picture."
10-4.
That's us.
You leave it?
Yeah.
"Jimmy, you got it?"
~ Um...
~ What?
Do you not think she has the right to know her husband was murdered?
No.
No-one has a right to know anything till I know who killed Mr Newcastle.
"We work for the dead, not the living."
Off you go.
Are you sure she can manage it?
She's never done it before.
Only one way to learn.
Are you ready?
"Is this your husband, Mrs Parker?"
"I-I-I mean, yes."
"It's Scott all right, but... just the shell of what he was."
What he used to be.
"(I'm sorry, Scottie.)"
~ All right.
~ Where did you find him?
"I, er..."
I don't have any details.
How did... he do it?
Do what?
Kill himself.
I'm afraid I don't know anything about his death.
"Don't know much for a copper, do you?"
Are you the tea lady?
When did you last see Scott?
Night before last.
Me birthday party.
Happy birthday.
~ Thanks.
~ Was it?
"Oh, right, right, right."
Stairs.
[laughs]
"Look, son, in this business, you wait too long, you wait tables."
[Arnie continues set]
[Arnie] Brain cancer.
[laughs]
This is my favorite.
"Oh, I've never seen a ring like this before."
It's so twinkly.
"It's a rose-cut diamond, from India."
[lounge music playing]
I can't stop looking at it.
"Nicky, see this ring?"
"Hint, hint."
"No one does subtlety like you, babe."
[laughs]
"Olivia's dad was a jeweler in Romania, and now she makes her own stuff."
"Come on, come see my wine cellar."
I have some bottles here that Bob Hope gave me.
Whew.
♪♪
- Oh.
- [clears throat]
Uh...
[laughs]
"It's okay with you, I'd prefer you fuck me the old fashioned way, 10 percent at a time, huh?"
You come to my house with your junkie girlfriend.
I have two kids here.
What are you talking about?
"That, I..."
[chuckles]
And she never asked any questions anyway.
The furniture's all Maurice Valencia.
Looks like Roma.
This is all silk.
This is from Siam.
Come see my bedroom.
"-Tommy, will you take him?"
-Of course. I'll eat this fucking dog.
Love that crystal ball or what?
This is where we spend most of our time.
I love the floral arrangements.
French.
"Janice and I were having so much fun, she started screwing up at work."
I had to straighten out her boss a little bit.
Fuckin' Janice can do whatever she wants to do!
Got it?
Got it?
"I'm who ya gotta run through, you understand?"
.
Hang up once more and you're gonna deal with me!
Get off of her.
You're an animal.
"Spider, on your way over here, bring me a Cutty and water, huh?"
-Did you guys eat?
-l'm starving.
-l'll play these.
-You'll play those?
Do I fuckin' stutter?
I'll play those.
What am I?
A mirage?
What?
-Really?
I'm sorry.
-It's been delightful.
-It was our pleasure.
It was wonderful talking to you.
Fredo!
"Fredo, you son-of-a-bitch, you look great!"
Frank Pentangeli!
"I thought you was never coming out west, you big bum!"
I've got to check on my boys.
-What's with the food here?
-What's the matter?
"A kid gives me a Ritz cracker with chopped liver and says, ""canapés""."
"I said, ""Can of peas, my ass."
"That's a Ritz cracker and chopped liver!"""
Bring out the peppers and sardines!
Seeing you reminds me of New York in the old days!
"You remember Willi Cicci, who was with old man Clemenza in Brooklyn?"
We were all upset about that.
"Heart attack, huh?"
"No, that was no heart attack."
That's what I'm here to see your brother Mike about.
-But what's with him?
-What do you mean?
Do I have to get a letter of introduction to get a sit-down?
-You can't get in to see Mike?
-He's got me waiting in a lobby!
-Johnny Ola.
-Al Neri.
-Do you know my lawyer Tom Hagen?
-I remember Tom from the old days.
Rocco.
Yes.
Don't worry; the shorts won't fit him!
That's his problem!
So?
He's been following me!
Following you?
!
Don't worry!
I'll fix him!
Keep this...
Make a hole in this and have it.
Okay?
I'm secretary to Bhardwaj and Bhardwaj the name is Banwarilal Pandit.
Have you seen the woman?
Which woman?
The well-endowed one.
She was...
Are you talking about Laxmi?
You know her?
You are God-sent!
I am God-sent and I'll give you some of God's offerings now!
You tease women in our area!
Hey!
What's wrong?
Have you no womenfolk at home?
"How are you, Shantabai?"
Are they having a fight there?
Yes.
Which is why I've brought these coconuts for you.
Make a hole in this and have it.
I know that.
"But, aunt..."
- I'm leaving this afternoon.
- Mamma wishes you to leave at once.
Excuse me.
Edward promised he would bring the atlas to Barton.
I'll wager he will do so in less than a fortnight.
Dear Edward...
Hello there!
Sir John...
Dear ladies!
Upon my word!
Here you are!
"- Sir John, your kindness..."
- None of that!
"Hush, please!"
"Here is my dear mamma-in-law, Mrs. Jennings."
You must be Mrs. Dashwood.
Was yourjourney tolerable?
Poor souls!
Why did you not come up to the park first?
- We saw you pass.
- I made John call the carriage.
- She would not wait.
- We have so little company.
I feel as though I know you already.
Delightful creatures!
- You'll dine at Barton Park daily.
- Dear Sir John.
We cannot...
No refusals!
I'm quite deaf to them.
But I insist!
Let us settle in.
Then the sword might not even work.
"And if it doesn't, the guy's going to come looking for it."
We are in a race.
We're in a race.
You two have to find what happened to that tsuba and fast.
"Well, Artie, we're looking for a 500-year-old sword."
800.
Exactly.
So it should be easy.
You guys follow the tsuba.
I will follow--
Ah...the implosion grenade.
And one of us will find the thief.
W--wait.
"I mean, wh--wh--where are you going?"
Somebody is making new grenades.
Somebody who promised not to.
Again he doesn't answer.
And no good-bye.
This is impossible.
Keep at it though. you're the smart one.
- What are you doing?
- What?
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
You're--you're doing great.
- Hello.
"- Leena, hey."
"Hey, is--is Claudia there?"
"Okay, she won't be able to find it either."
Claudia's out.
It's just me.
Good night.
I see...
So this is the lowest layer.
"You say the two of them are here, right?"
Yes.
What shall we do?
This wasn't mentioned in Fubuki's report.
"Have Jinpu, Usyuki and one more stay behind to guard, and the rest of you, go down to the lowest layer."
Damn you!
This is special agent Fubuki.
The two Dangaioh pilots are in my custody.
"Boy, I'm in trouble now."
Wake up.
Both of you wake up!
"Are you okay, Big Brother?"
Kaori...
Hurry and get out there!
Burst and Flail are ready to go.
What on earth happened?
I'll explain later.
Just hurry!
"Hitomi, hang in there!"
"Chidou, you okay?"
Where the hell were you?
You ready to transform?
Am I ready?
!
"Come on, we'll give it back to 'em twice as hard!"
Here we go!
Bout...
Dimension!
Dangaioh.
"No matter what the event is, how can she apply it so thickly?"
"You just want to play with me, right?"
You take me for fun!
"I said, you played me for fun, didn't you?"
"You don't keep your word, you bastard smelly man!"
Why are you late?
I've been waiting for you.
You actually dare to cheat in front of me.
Bastard!
Hey.
Is your head messed up?
So I have to spell it out now?
I don't like you.
Bastard!
Miss Kim Na Na.
Hey.
Miss Kim Na Na.
She completely lost her spirit.
Here.
"Thank you for the kiss, agent."
What is this?
Money.
There are several zeros on it right?
"Here, 1 million Won."
Good bye.
Does it hurt?
"You have thick skin like walls, so it shouldn't hurt."
"For medical costs, right?"
"Hey, Shin Eun Ah."
What?
President's daughter disappeared?
"No, she did not come here."
Honey...
- jeffrey.
"- Hey,darling."
- You're home early.
- Is that a problem?
- No
- No?
Close your eyes.
Come on.
Okay.
All right.
"Oh,my."
They're gorgeous.
But why?
Tonight is your night.
You're going to be hearing a lot of speeches from people and...
I'm not going to bore you with one of my own.
I'm just...very proud of you.
"Jeff,there's something I need to tell you."
- sara.
- Hi.
"Senator,we still have to meet with the governor's people."
And security's now requested we arrive an hour earlier.
Thank you.
You should get ready.
Was there something...?
No.
"Later,when it's,um... when it's just us."
All right.
Shall we?
Okay.
"Don't reference the early readers program, at least 15 people in this room voted against it."
Set your perimeter!
- It's still alive!
- Shoot at it!
SOLDIER 2:
Retreat!
Retreat!
Let's get out of here!
(SOLDIERS YELLING)
Hogarth!
"He's unconscious, but he's okay."
Let's get him in the car.
"Drive, baby, drive!"
Step on it!
Floor it!
It's gaining on us.
Faster!
Faster!
Hurry!
(SOLDIERS YELLING INDISTINCTLY)
All battleships fire at the robot!
Now!
"Now, damn it, now!"
Nothing can stop this thing!
We've hit it with everything we've got!
"Not everything, General."
The bomb.
The Nautilus has first strike capability and is not far offshore.
"You scare me, Mansley."
You want us to bomb ourselves in order to kill it?
"General, the giant seems to follow whatever attacks it."
"We can lure it away from the town, then destroy it."
Radio the Nautilus.
"Father, please wake up!"
Father!
Father!
Chun-su...
Are you all right?
You should've just let them take the dam salt!
Why did you fight?
"That's salt is our livelihood, and I won't be robbed of it."
"I have to get you married off, and..."
What's more important than your life?
I'm sorry...
"I'm your father, and I have nothing but poverty and hardship to leave behind..."
"Stop that, Father."
"Chun-su, look under the ashes in the furnace."
The Furnace...
Father!
Chun-su...
My dear boy Chun-su...
Father...!
Father...!
Why didn't just give it to them?
Why didn't he?
That old fool!
What's more important than his life?
Why didn't he get treatment when he had all this?
That fool!
That idiot!
That old fool!
I won't let them get away with this!
Father...!
Father...!
My poor Father...!
Come along.
"Chop-CF"")?"
Big Sally.
(INDISTINCT SHOUTING)
Eh...
"Well, home is where the battle is."
"Right, private, it is our duty to ensure that no harm comes to the cripple, understood?"
Follow on.
"If you can hear them, but you can't shoot them, you can probably grenade them."
"Drop an egg down there, laddie."
(MAN SHOUTS INDISTINCTLY)

Come along.
"Good Lord, how embarrassing."
(GUNS FIRING)
Dodged a bullet on that one.

"Spasibo, Yuri."
"Sugar, could you just do me one small, little, teensy favor?"
Anything.
Could you leave me alone for like 30 seconds?
Anything but that.
"Yeah, I forgot my gumdrop buttons."
Yeah.
"Could you run over there and get 'em for me, please?"
Sure I can.
I'll be right back.
"Gingy, Gingy..."
"Run, run, run as fast as you can, if you want to remain a gingerbread man!"
"Oh, Gingy."
I don't understand.
I thought you were happy.
"- Oh, well, I..."
- It's all my fault.
I should have tried harder!
"No, no, no!"
Don't try harder!
Maybe I'm not pretty enough.
I can be pretty!
Really pretty.
The girl of your dreams.
- Remember?
- Leave me alone!
Gingy!
"Let go, Gingy!"
"Fall with me, so we can be together forever!"
Here's a thought.
You let go!
Together.
Together for...
"John, who is this?"
Where am I?
What part of London is this?
"Well, if I tell you that it wouldn't be a safe house, would it?"
And you wouldn't be in protective custody.
"And besides, it's only for an hour."
(GROANS)
"You do know what they'll do when they find me, don't you?"
(PHONE RINGS)
(BEEP)
WOMAN:
"Pick up, come on, come on."
"Bitch, pick up!"
"All right, now listen."
Have you done as you were asked?
Have you?
(HANGS UP)
RIPLEY:
No sign of Cameron.
Flat's completely empty.
LUTHER:
Why the empty flat?
LUTHER:
It's almost like he's never been here before.

"Hello, your call cannot be taken at the moment, so please leave your message after the tone."
(BEEP)
MAN:
I know you're there.
"Benny, it's Ripley, mate."
"I need you to trace a call going to this number, yeah?"
"Hello, Cameron."
- (HORN BLARES)
I am not having drinks with you.
You might be a pervert.
"I might be a pervert, but you're definitely a car thief."
I said I was sorry.
"- You didn't, actually."
- (SIREN WHOOPS)
- Oh.
- Damn it.
"That's why I said, ""Eyes on the road!"""
Screwdriver. (GRUNTS)
License and registration.
Hi!
"Terribly sorry, officer, but it's actually my car."
I'm trying to teach my girlfriend how to drive stick.
She's got a lot to learn.
I know.
"But, you know..."
Women.
"All right, I hear you."
It's a warning...this time.
Yeah.
Thank you so much.
What are you?
Some sort of misogynist?
You're welcome.
"Go, go, we got lucky."
We?
"- This isn't your car either, is it?"
- Hmm?
I stole a stolen car?
Now how about that drink?
You know it'll be three months until we get a spare part.
Make sure it doesn't happen again.
It won't.
Back to work!
I've got them very cheap.
Take a look at the large one.
- How much?
- 350 FM.
That's for women!
Try it on.
Too small for my girlfriend.
Look at him!
She's looking good.
How much for the trousers?
I'll give you 50 FM.
"No, 150!"
I can't give you more than 50... for that used rag.
I've made some progress with a serious man.
A rich man from Sarakollé.
He just needs to swallow the bait.
This has no future.
"She'll end up getting married, like our sisters."
Watch out!
The Director's coming.
You old whore!
Who did you date yesterday?
"In the afternoon, Seydow."
The ugly one?
Is the Minister in?
I'm Makan's secretary.
Fatou!
The Director wants to see you... tomorrow at 4 pm.
What we need is someone who's attractive but not too expensive.
Someone who's not too bright but brave enough to be casual about frostbite!
"Mr Arkwright, could you come a minute?"
Julie!
Little Jelly Tot Julie!
"Miss Arkwright's Stores, 1982!"
Ho--ho!
"Hey, sh--she might even do it for sweets!"
Can you...
Can you get me out?
"What are you doing inside that, Granville?"
It's got me by the dangler!
How very inconvenient for you!
"I was so busy trying to keep me fingers out of the way, I forgot about me dangler!"
-
"- You do, don't you?"
-
"- Anything I can do, Mr Arkwright?"
"Funny you should say that, Jelly...er, Julie."
-
- What are you doing?
-
"- I'll be with you in a minute, Granville."
-
- Would you mind walking to the door?
-
- To the door?
-
- And back.
Good lass.
-
- Get me out!
"Oh, my."
"You have got a present for mommy, don't ya?"
You need a diaper change?
- I'll do it.
- All right.
You have at it.
- Go see auntie Nic.
"- Okay, baby."
Who's the best baby?
Not in your mouth.
Not in your mouth.
"Ooh, that's yucky."
Wait.
"Oh, gotcha!"
"It's okay, baby."
"Auntie Nic's not really a baby person after all, is she?"
"Okay, I know-- oh, not a ""baby person""?"
Then what's this?
"Oh, well, I mean, honey, of course you're a baby person."
It just takes practice.
That's all.
Maybe she just doesn't like to have her diaper changed.
"Oh, no."
She doesn't.
"None of them do at this age, but you'll learn all that."
"Actually, you'll just get a nanny, and she can deal with all that stuff."
Okay.
There we go.
We're all better now.
- What?
"- Thank god for nannies, right?"
"I'll make sure to get one that's a ""baby person."""
"- Nefedov, where does all this bounty come from?"
-We are strengthening ties with the locals!
- lt is foryou to live wealthily.
- Thanks.
And let your life have happywings.
-What's that?
- Give it to me.
"Calm down, my little one..."
- My congratulations!
- Thanks.
- Foryour health!
- Good luck to you.
"- ls that you, the charmed one?"
-You recognized me...
- Good luck to you!
- Good luck!
"Comrade mayor, may I invite you?"
"No, thanks, ma'am, some othertime..."
- Listen to my command!
- Lesha!
Prepare forthe march.
- ls it all right that we are kissing in public?
-All right.
- ls it a farewell kiss.
- l'll be back soon.
What's wrong?
What's up?
Why are you crying?
Why are you all crying?
Why is everybody crying?
"The carrot is very bitter, it needs some sweeties!"
Bitter!
Might be able to pick up his movements.
I've got a croupier to find.
(PANTING)
"You're a hard man to track down, JC."
I need your help with something.
"Get lost, Harry, this is my downtime."
(yells) What the hell are you doing?
Did I not tell you?
I'm your new personal trainer.
- Please!
- Ah-ah!
The tall guy the other night in the casino.
The one that got chucked out.
What's his name?
"- You can't do this, Harry."
- This is just the warm-up.
What's his name?
The one that was screaming for Freddie Lau?
Alright.
Alright.
Stop.
His name's Kevin Grey.
He used to be on the staff.
He got chucked off a couple of months ago.
- Why?
- I don't know.
"It's OK, I've got my badges."
Why?
"Look, all's I know is that..."
is that there was a girl between them.
Some stripper who worked in Soho.
Freddie Lau stole her from Grey and Grey went mental.
"Blimey, the newsagent's is closer now we're in a smaller studio."
Shut up.
You're spoiling the magic for everyone.
Oh.
"Oh, look, the newsagent."
"Hello, me old darling."
"Yep, it's me, Richie Rich."
Don't faint.
Treasure the moment.
Here's a pic.
Put it in your box of precious things.
I don't understand what you're talking about.
"Oh, yes."
"Oh, yes, I'm sure."
"One of the cool type, are we?"
Gonna boast to your friends?
"""I met Richie Rich and pretended not to recognise him."
"Hee hee. """
What a sad little life you must lead.
Are you mad?
"- Perhaps a little zany, yes."
- Excuse me.
Do you have part one of Poncy Cooking with part two free?
- Certainly.
"One pound, please."
- Aha.
"I'm afraid I have no money so I'll just take part two for nothing, shall I?"
- You stupid slag!
"Come on, Richie."
"- One pound, please."
"Er, hurr..."
I'll give you a mensh on me next programme.
"Night, hon."
Sorry!
- Trauma.
"- No problem, I just have to hurry."
How come?
- Don't get upset.
- Why would I be upset?
I need to clean for...
Sandy?
There's a real estate agent coming by first thing in the morning.
I need more milk.
A...
A real estate...
"OK, I give."
Why?
I was going to tell you on the way home.
To value the townhouse.
Value?
I just want to see how much it's worth.
- I know what value means.
"- I'm not selling, it would just be good to know in case."
- You're going to be in Dallas...
- I told you I'd pay my share!
- It's too big for me and Maya.
- It's only a contract!
You don't know that!
And it might be nice to be close to Mom.
Mom?
"Yeah, in case I need help."
"Sandy, Mom dropped Maya on her head."
It was an accident.
"Mel, you can't just go and make changes like this..."
Yeah!
We should come back to the beach tonight and go skinny-dipping.
Yeah!
You know?
"Like,I just want to be naked in the dark ocean with you."
Naked.
You know?
Johnny?
"No,no,no,no,no."
"Everything's fine,it's just..."
What?
I like you.
"I just need you to,like,taper it back a little."
Just a little.
Like this.
You don't need to do that.
It's all good.
We're cool.
"You're kinda,like,bam, instant on me,bam?"
Yeah.
"and I need to,like,ease into it."
Have a little flirty time.
I don't want flirty time.
Flirty time's awesome.
"Flirty time is not awesome,okay?"
This is awesome.
This.
"This is awesome,okay?"
Come on.
"Don't be afraid of it,Bella."
You have absolutel no patience.
You're going to drive yourself crazy for nothing.
Have some tea while you catch up on old times.
"Thanks,Jenny."
Be careful.
- Here's my friend's hand.
- Here's your tea.
- Thankyou.
- A pleasure.
Is he another friend ofyours?
"No, he's thejanitor."
We don't have a janitor in this building.
"Oh, he's the plumber."
There's a burst water pipe outside.
Your voice sounds familiar.
Have we met before?
I met you in the night club.
"I loved your singing, but you wouldn't sing withoutJeffrey there."
"Oh, I remember."
What a coincidence.
"Dumbo, take care ofJenny for a while."
I'm going to the bathroom.
So am I.
There's a second bathroom in the bedroom.
"Jenny, there's a rat in the kitchen!"
I'll catch it.
Hey!
Don't shoot!
It's me!
Somebody's aiming at my ass from below!
What happened?
Where'sJeffrey?
I know you both lied to me.
Tell me the truth!
Ow!
Stop!
Ow!
Ooh!
Ah!
Ow!
-
- What's going on?
-
"- I'm just having fun, that's all!"
"You get dressed up to do a bit of shopping, not to be knocked over by an errand boy!"
"Of course not, Mrs Featherstone."
"Come and sit here, my dear."
Take the weight off your purse.
Not even me husband used to get as close as that!
Whereabouts did you catch her?
I don't know.
Everything went black.
She's a widow woman.
Everything's black to start with!
"God, it could have been anywhere!"
"Hey, come on, you're supposed to be customer--finding."
Get out there.
Go on!
"Dear, dear!"
"You look sad, Granville."
You poor love!
What is it?
It's advanced training.
"Oh, if it's only to do with the shop!"
I thought you were really depressed -- heartache or something.
That's what I mean.
"- Yes, it was."
"Well, at least Jo seems well."
- I kissed him on the ear.
- Perhaps if you had another?
Why ever not?
Surely David's capable?
Yes.
But he can't bear to pass me in the hallway for fear of touching me.
"- Come on, Lucy."
- I do love you.
It's not necessary to tell Father about this.
- No.
- No.
"Come on, then."
"- Bye-bye, Grandma."
"- Come along, Jo."
Agent Muller.
- Someone's in with Muller.
- Good.
Give them 60 seconds and then go in.
You've left a trail a blind man could follow.
We're surrounded.
Speak in English.
The Führer wants you to... reassess the strength of Patton's army in East Anglia.
It's invasion strength.
They have the photographs.
General Patton is ready to invade Europe at any time at Pas-de-Calais.
- Hitler's astrologer...
- Astrologer?
My God.
He believes... attack will be at Normandy.
All right.
What happened to your head?
"Uh, the sky is falling."
Do you have a pair of dress pants or a skirt or something I could borrow?
"Thank you, Lee."
Whatever.
"Hey, you know in that Cat Lady sketch?"
Do I have to hold a real cat?
Cat Lady sketch?
That thing's gonna get cut.
"Oh, good."
Who's that?
That is the new network dude.
"Mmm, yummers."
He reminds me of Scotty on General Hospital.
What?
"No, ew, Jenna."
Do not like that man.
That is a bad man.
"God, you have a gift."
Laura Bush is your size.
"Hi, uh, what are you doing down here?"
I'm known for being hands-on.
Clearly.
"That's how you should dress for work, by the way."
"Yeah, if I was president of the Philippines."
Afghanistan is a different situation...
I'll have an apple juice.
"Oh, we don't have apple juice, sir."
Then I'll take a vodka and tonic.
"Hi, I'm Liz Lemon."
I know who you are.
I thought there was a...
You're not the one who disappeared.
You would've had to have been there in the first place.
"No, not Artie."
"Oh, all your--all your secrets,"
"And your--and your treasure hunts,"
And that damned place.
"You know, James believed in life."
You need to get one.
Hold on.
Hold on.
Carol.
Carol.
Carol.
Could you please--please.
Wait.
Wait.
Wait.
- What?
- Listen.
Listen.
Listen.
"Carol, if you're harboring him in any way,"
You're in danger.
What are you doing here?
Just about to ask you the same thing.
Why are you bothering that poor woman and torturing yourself?
It is called investigating a case.
This isn't the case.
This is self-pity.
The case is the implosion grenade
And the sword.
And someone out there is running around
Never a rumpus here.
Most orderly.
"It's that girl, lvy, that barmaid."
Pretty girls always cause trouble.
- I'd throw her out if I were you.
- What?
Lvy?
I can't do that to Ivy.
A great man can always change his mind for a reason.
"Yes, sir."
"Why, certainly, sir."
"Yes, sir."
"A troublemaker, that's what she is."
Out she goes.
"Yes, but now, while the evening is still young."
"- Yes, sir."
"Certainly, sir."
"- Yes, certainly."
What happened?
I've done nothing.
Just minding my own business.
"- That's my decision, my girl."
- Stop pushing!
- Don't hang about here.
- Who's hanging about?
- Go on.
Don't argue the point.
"- Oh, good riddance."
What's happened in there?
"- Is there some trouble, lvy?"
- Trouble?
"I was sacked, that's what!"
"Well, sir, I guess I am a lucky guy at that."
"You know, I hardly ever lose a coin toss."
"Go to the horse races in Hot Springs, bet on a long shot."
Damn if the son of a bitch doesn't come in.
My mom used to always tell me I was born under a lucky star.
CASHIER:
What you got there?
WOMAN:
A couple rolls of film.
"Baby, there's an article in here about Julia from Dark Memories."
That ain't Julia.
That's that damn twin sister...
With her evil self.
"No, it's not."
Can you tell him who this is?
That's Julia on Dark Memories.
Mmm-hmm.
Told you.
Got any maps of Houston?
We don't need no damn map of Houston.
PLUTO:
"Be cool, Ray, be cool."
CASHIER:
"Good, Bill."
How are you?
BILL:
It's real quiet out there.
We got the two most exciting jobs in town.
(MICROWAVE BEEPING)
LILA:
"Your other burrito's ready, baby."
He's watching me.
So you didn't take the bedtime pills?
I did.
But I still couldn't sleep.
That's odd.
So how are you today?
Feeling better?
Let's have a look.
C'mon.
This side.
They're all dry.
Let me check your neck.
Wow they are all gone.
Lift up your t-shirt.
"So there aren't anywhere else, right?"
All gone.
So you are cured.
"Yes, I am."
Why you sound like you knew it already?
Oh that's why you didn't wear a jacket.
"You know if you're all better, you didn't have to come."
Done.
Congrats.
So next month we won't see each other anymore.
"It's all good, doc."
Thanks a lot.
Hey...
You are okay.
It's all good.
You understand.
It's all good.
"Before you went you knew this would happen, right?"
So what's wrong with you now?
It was Roth who tried to kill me in my home.
It was Roth all along.
"He acts like I'm his son, his successor."
But he thinks he'll live forever and wants me out.
-How can I help?
"-Just go along, as if you know nothing."
-I've already made my move.
-What move?
Hyman Roth won't see the New Year.
"You're to take it easy, he'll be back tomorrow."
Fly in my own doctor from Miami.
I don't trust a doctor who can't speak English.
"-Gracias, señor."
-Buenas noches.
"-Honey, go to the casino."
-If you're feeling better.
Feel fine.
-Play the bingo game.
-Okay.
"Nice to see you, Mr. Paul."
My sixth sense tells me Fredo brought a bag full of money.
Where is it?
-You're pulling out?
-Just want to...
Just want to wait.
-How do you feel?
-Terrible.
I'd give four million to be able to take a painless piss.
-Who had Frank Pentangeli killed?
-The Rosato brothers.
"I know, but who gave the go-ahead?"
I know I didn't.
Anyone called me?
"Oh, daughter, the veggie caviar worked out real good, with a soul to it!"
- I asked you:
Did anyone call?
- I can't hear you for all that music!
"Ira, I beg you, turn that stupid music off!"
Stop it now!
Go to your room!
I'm sick and tired of all this!
All right!
What's the matter?
My little baby...
"Nina, why is she like that?"
Like what?
A normal city child.
They're all like that in kindergarten.
They got a load of things to do.
I asked you:
Did anyone call me?
"- Well, did they?"
- I had no time to tell.
Someone did.
What's wrong?
Have you lost something?
Have you?
- Someone called?
- Yes.
It was embarrassing.
"I took it up, they say nothing."
"I yelled, then someone says politely:"
This is Ghena.
"And then he asks, you know:"
Whatever you said just now.
You continue the tale.
"Do it, sister."
Remember anything?
"Whatever it is bit, or scene let it be anything."
A villain entered the scene then.
Who is he?
- How will he be?
- He's...
- Come out.
- He stole my bike.
He's short...
What's his name?
Bald head...
Halwa...where are you going?
My back is punctured.
But you're not like Halwa.
Isn't it?
He's just like you.
Where's my bike?
Where's my bike?
Stop...stop...
Where's my bike?
To whom did you sell it?
"You come aside, I'll tell you."
How could you love such a man?
I don't know.
"I'm angry on him, I hate him...but..."
Whatever he said was fresh and new.
I liked his kick.
Did we love so much?
It's good.
[PHONE BEEPING]
NATE:
It's already been over an hour.
Bar's closing soon.
"She's gonna come, I know she is."
"Whoa, wait."
Dan is Gossip Girl?
Gossip Girl?
You crazy?
"- Dan, what are you doing here?"
- I Loopt you.
Are you waiting for Gossip Girl?
"Yeah, and I know you don't approve."
I'm gonna go close the tab.
"This grudge-match thing, it doesn't seem like you."
What's going on?
- I don't wanna be irrelevant.
- Irrelevant?
You're Serena van der Woodsen.
"Gossip Girl might be right about me, but she's wrong about you."
"Without Serena, who would I have dreamt about?"
I might have spent my whole life on the outside if you hadn't let me in.
Which I'm holding against you.
[LAUGHS]
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
"Oh, my God."
"Oh, that makes sense."
"- Wait, they're a team."
- A team of what?
"- Wait, why are you all here?"
- I got a text saying to meet you.
Ka-pow!
"Oh, Lightning!"
If you figure that out you just gonna be OK.
"Oh, yeah, that..."
That is spectacular advice.
"Thank you, Mr. The King."
"Ladies and gentlemen, for the first time in Piston Cup history..."
A rookie has won the Piston Cup.
Yes!
...we have a three-way tie.
"Hey, that must be really embarrassing."
But I wouldn't worry about it.
Because I didn't do it!
Piston Cup officials have determined that a tiebreaker race between the three leaders will be held in California in one week.
"Well, thank you!"
Thanks to all of you out there!
Thank you!
"Hey, first one to California gets Dinoco all to himself."
"No, not me!"
"No, you rock, and you know that!"
"Oh, yeah!"
Whoo!
Yep!
All right!
Got it!
"""First one to California gets Dinoco all to himself. """
"Oh, we'll see who gets there first, Chick."
Huh?
"- Hey, kid!"
Congrats on the tie.
- I don't want to talk about it.
"Let's go, Mack."
We'd better go back to the Doctor.
-Where did you get that?
-It's too small for me.
-What is it?
-It's a present.
-I've been trying to get it off.
-Who from?
-I hope you haven't broken it.
-Nyssa.
"Adric, Nyssa, come on."
Doctor!
I don't want you two chasing after the Master independently.
"You, Adric, should know how dangerous he is."
-That's the man who brought me from Traken.
-Yes.
He said he was a friend of yours.
-But he's the man on the bridge.
-Yes.
-You said to be prepared for the worst.
"-Indeed I did, and I am prepared for the worst."
"Why are you prepared for the worst, Doctor?"
Because he's here.
Please remain where you are.
I have it in my power to bring Logopolis to a complete halt.
There's much more to this block transfer computation than we thought.
"Yes, that's how they built a replica of the Pharos Project."
"Yes, yes, but why?"
Hmm?
Why build a replica of the Pharos Project?

Listen.
-I don't...
What's up with step one?
You've skipped step one and two.
What's step three again?
You ask me what's wrong!
Got it.
Good.
You bet.
Go ahead.
Where?
- Step three.
- What's step three again?
(EXHALES)
We'll skip step three.
I'm just going to tell you what's wrong.
That should have been step one.
Wrong.
Step one and two are fundamental steps.
"You missed steps, Stewart."
How?
"Step one, become angry with someone."
"Step two, tell that someone that you're angry."
"Step three, resolve anger with that someone."
- Step four...
- (SCOFFING) Step four.
"Step four, resume peaceful existence."
Your logic is frighteningly bewitching.
Phantasmagoric.
It's time for you to go.
What?
Where?
Leave here?
It was a rebound.
Come in please.
Paula calling Hedley.
"Come in, Hedley."
Come in.
Hedley here.
"Come in, Paula."
Where are you?
"Well, I'm at the north waterhole, but no astro-chimp."
Where's Dad?
He's out in the bush looking for tracks.
"You know, the trouble with chimps is they're very tricky, and it's almost impossible to track them."
"But if anyone can find a missing chimp,"
I'd place my money on Marsh.
I'm afraid Daktari hasn't had any luck either.
- How are you doing?
"- Well, not too well."
"And you know, I guess it takes a chimp to find a chimp."
Judy's out in the bush scouting around.
"Over and out, Hedley."
"Oh, Clarence, I hope Judy can find Sally."

This guy was a lottery nut.
Isn't tomorrow night the big jackpot?
Yeah.
"Yeah, he probably knew he'd never win, which makes him a whole lot smarter than me."

It's fluid!

I don't have a wipe.
G-give me a wipe.
Just I need a wipe.
Where's Natalie?
I'm your biggest fan.
I never Miss a show.
Thank you.
That means a lot.
"Natalie, what's your favorite number?"
"My gosh, there's so many."
- Mine's 19.
- That's a good one.
Do you think it's gonna come up on the show tomorrow?
"I'm sorry, Mr. Monk."
- Will you be at this Lenai Street address?
- Yes.
No.
She'll be at Robin Masters' estate with me.
I will be staying at my own house.
You can reach her at the estate or through Rick at the club.
You can reach me at my own house.
Won't you be more comfortable at Robin's Nest until your relatives arrive from the mainland?
OK.
"Mrs Greenberg, one last thing."
If you think of anything else...
- I will call you!
- Fine.
Thank you.
They make me so nervous.
"Now, why do I have to stay at this Robin's Nest?"
- Why does she have to stay there?
- Because they might try and grab her.
They don't want me.
They want Saul.
They don't want her.
They want Saul.
- You know who's got Saul?
- No.
Mrs Greenberg?
'Dr Haywood to paediatrics.'
Sorry you had to wait.
I was in surgery.

"I`m under here, kids."
Go back to bed.
"Go back to bed, now."
The bed was very soft.
"""Weird-o-rama! """
This is the same street Wyatt Earp kept law and order on.
It seems kind of dirty and touristy.
The Old West was dirty.
Everything isn`t like home.

The ambulance is saying 15 to 20 minutes.

You will not wait.

End of story.

She's downstairs.
"Oh, she's signing autographs."
"You hate this, don't you?"
What?
Natalie getting all the attention.
No.
I'm happy for her.
Sure you are.
It's good for her.
She deserves it.
Long overdue.

This is the last dispatch from Havas news agency:
"""The findings made on the trunk of the Munich-Paris train led to the discovery of a fingerprint left by Jacques Dollon, the man wanted for the murder of the Baroness de Vibray and the theft from the Princess Danidoff."""
This is madness!
I'm going crazy!
Not now!
"I need sensational stuff, so sort it out yourself."
Go!
"Hello, Fandor."
Good morning.
She was in her room.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
- How are you?
- Better.
I find it peaceful here.
I got your message.
What's wrong?
"Ah, yes."
I read your article on the princess Danidoff.
I 'm sure now:
Her name was on the list with the date of April 12.
"Sorry to bother you, but someone is asking for Miss Elizabeth on the phone."
Anyone know you are here?
"No, just you."
I can accompany you?
"Yeah, sure."
Hello?
Elizabeth Dollon?
"Yeah, but where?"
"I mean, there's no EMF."
Maybe we could find out who it is.
Check and see if somebody died around here.
Way ahead of you.
I had to break into the principal's office to get this.
"Oh, and FYI, three of the cheerleaders are legal."
-Guess which ones.
-No.
"Ahem, there was one death on campus."
It was a suicide back in '98.
Some kid named Barry Cook.
What?
[SIGHING] I knew him.
How'd he die?
He slit his wrists in the first-floor girls' bathroom.
-That's where--
-Where the chick got swirlied to death.
"So, what, this ghost is possessing nerds?"
"And using them to go after bullies, yeah."
"Well, does that sound like Barry's M.O.?"
Barry had a hard time.

"Well, if I was older, do you think that I would make a very good husband?"
"If you were older, I think you'd make a wonderful husband."
I'll be back when I'm 25.
Will you wait?
That's a long time to wait.
It won't be as long as you think.
Now don't move.
I'll be right back.
Nancy?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
What are we fightin' about?
I don't know.
I guess I do.
I'm jealous.
Of Wilbur?
He's only 14 years old.
He is?
"Well, how old did you think he was?"
"Oh, much older."
"I mean, he's very mature for 14."
I thought he was at least 15.
"Oh, Bob, you're so silly."
(CLEARING THROAT)
Now let's see.
"""Nancy, I know I'm not very much,"""

The snarfblatt dates to prehistorical times when humans used to sit around and stare at each other all day.

Salvatore Boca.
B-O-C-A.
They call him Sal.
He's a sweetheart.
He was picked up on suspicion of armed robbery.
"Now, get this."
Three years ago he tries to hold up Tiffany's... on Fifth Avenue in broad daylight.
He coulda got two and a half to five... but Tiffany's wouldn't prosecute.
"Also, downtown they're pretty sure he pulled off a contract on a guy named DeMarco."
[Jimmy] What about his old lady?
Her name's Angie.
She's a fast filly.
- She drew a suspended for shoplifting a year ago.
- [No Audible Dialogue]
She's only a kid.
"Nineteen, according to the marriage license."
Mmm.
Nineteen going on 50.
What else?
He's had the store a year and a half.
Takes in a fast seven grand a year.
So what's he doing with two cars... and hundred-dollar tabs at the Chez?
The LTD's in his wife's name.
What are we going to do with everyone ?
People are scared.
They'll get hungry.
And what about looters ?
We just have to get organized.
"Also, keep the radio on and gather up anything you think might be useful... flashlights, blankets, water, batteries, you'll be fine."
I can't get through to either of the boys.
"Well, keep trying."
How about you ?
We should get you to the hospital.
"I'm fine, it's just a bump on the head."

Not his or hers.

They're at the Cooper house with Taylor.

Okay.

I wish I could say the same for Ryan's car though.

He went away on a pilgrimage ten years ago.
You never mentioned that.
You never asked either.
You just thrust a rose in my hand.
What could I do?
!
He's been away for 10 years.
He won't return!
What if he does?
In that case I'll get you a divorce.
Have you nothing else to do?
We gotta go

"Coming to the stage, from the BX."

Vanessa!
(Cheering and applauding)
"It cracks and clicks and the glass it rips to pieces,"
Too sharp.
I sometimes slip between the creases
I been building out your weakness.
(Woman) Wow.
Brow and bone structure bent to your likeness.
I like this.
Live in the middle with a piece of mind.
Make like a mirror and turn me lovely.
"Face to face, and say you love me."
(Woman) Yes!
(Woman) Yes!
(Crowd cheering) Yes!
"(Woman) Aw ma, you did your thing up there."
I'm proud of you.
Thank you.
Let me talk to you for a second?
"Okay, you have one second... go."
"So I'm saying, I think you look mad sexy."
You here with somebody?
Yeah.
"All right, that's cool, ma."
I'm kidding.
I'm here with my friends.
"Got you, got you."
And where do you think you're going?
"Oh, I thought I'd try my luck in Haematology."
I know what you are.
"So, you know what I'll do if you come any nearer, Goldie."
"- What, like the rapper?"
"- No, the Blue Peter dog."
"Oh, right, yeah, cos..."
"Oh, yeah."
"That's, um... cutting."
"But, you know, having worked with drunks in AE for two years, it takes a little more than that to scare me."
"Look, I'm not some naughty little kid."
"Yeah, draining a defenceless old man of blood is a step beyond naughty."
Now... settle!
"OK, um... just keep telling yourself, ""I've got this job."""
I've turned up.
I have got this job.
"Ah, the banks have crunched."
Do not get cocky.
"Oh, thank you."
Thank you so much for the vote of confidence.
"Mm, and keep saying the interviewer's name."
That builds a bond.
"Like, ""Yes, Ken."
"You're right, Ken."
"""I totally agree with you..."
"Ken."""
- See?
- Mr Mitchell.
- Yeah.
- Don't call her Ken.
Hmm.
Seriously.
- Yeah.
Because we're bros.
OLDER TED:
"While I was racing through the streets of New York, trying to get back to the bar, your Aunt Robin was doing her best to keep Jim away from Maggie."
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)
Do you want to go back to the bar and see if Maggie's still there?
(EX CLAIMS) No way!
I love erotic dog photography.
Did you see the one over there of the corgis doing it people style?
(ROBIN LAUGHING)
I'll get us a taxi.
I just feel bad leaving Maggie all alone.
No!
Let's have a glass of wine first.
(ROBIN SIGHING)
(ROBIN EX CLAIMS)
"Oh, man."
(ROBIN EX CLAIMING)
Look how filthy I am.
"I am just a filthy, filthy girl who would totally go to second base with a guy as a favor to a friend."
(ROBIN MOANING)
You like that?
(ROBIN MOANING)
"I'm going to call Maggie, see what she's doing."
"Oh, God!"
"Maggie, Maggie, Maggie."
"Give it a rest, jeez!"
She's hanging out with Ted tonight.
- Ted?
What about David?
- They broke up.
Maggie's single?

How are you?

You've certainly produced the best musical done at college.
I had a great gang.
How about a dance later?
- Certainly.

Okay.

I'm not old enough to... remember that event.
but trust me:
the poor and the noble... lose every war since then... regardless of flag...
And women...
Women have no flag.
The real Italian flag does not show three colors... but the male organ.
"Moral, Homor, Family... the cult of religion, are there, in between the legs."
- My God!
- I disagree...
A little exaggerated.
There's only one flag... this one.
But that is from Savoia.
Listen.
American airplane.
I think it is German.
And why the US don't fight back?
The Americans are asleep.
They rise early.
I heard another noise before.
Listen.
There's people at the stairs.
- Let them in.
- Ok.
Easy.
Slow.
Come in.
She was taken by God.
Let's go out.
"Nunziatina, Carmela, stay here."
Bring what's needed.
Quick.
Let's go into the other room.
I'm not gonna answer it.
What?
What?
I don't have the money.
What do you want me to do?
"Ok, you tell your mom, she gives you the money, you're out of debt."
Then you enroll in a public school.
You make it-- you make it sound just so easy.
It's--it's not--
I will give you until tonight to tell your mom.
"Nick, please, man."
I will get the money.
Ok?
That's--that's not a problem.
"I'll get it from this guy who owes me anyway, and I can pay him back with that and she'll never know."
Ok?
[Cell phone rings]
Uh...
Please don't make me sorry that I told you this.
Your client will talk?
Not on your terms.
What do you want?
An s-visa.
No.
What do-- TRENT HAAGA:
All right.
"No, let's get smoking."
Let's have him go.
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
Can we come back tomorrow?
TRENT HAAGA:

Whoa!
Whoa!

INTERVIEWER:
Damn.
[Chatter]
OK.
Here's what's happening right now.
We are locked with camera.
The stuntman is prepping.
"OK, we need some nice, respectful silence"
While we do this work.
And then we're gonna light him on fire.
[Whistle] Safety guy up here.
INTERVIEWER:
What do you think about this next stunt?
"Every time I've done these, they've been really horrible,"
So-- INTERVIEWER:
They have?
TRENT HAAGA:
"Yeah, I'm not really optimistic."
"But, you know, we'll see."
Want to make a dollar bet?
We'll make a dollar bet.
INTERVIEWER:
"OK, I'll make you a dollar."
All right.
I'll make a dollar bet saying that this sucks.

"Yes, I'm a real racecar."

My whole life!
Then you know who I am.
I'm Lightning McQueen.

- Yes!
Yes!
I must scream it to the world!
My excitement from the top of someplace very high!
- Do you know many Ferraris?
"- No, no, no, no, no."
They race on the European circuit.
I'm in the Piston Cup!
- What?
- Luigi follow only the Ferraris.
Is that what I think it is?
Customers.
Customers!
"Customers, everyone!"
Customers!
- OK!
- Customers?
- I don't know.
It was kind of nice having a roommate.
Sushi?
I hope you have a better plan than that.
It's all about misdirection.
I don't wanna show my hand too early.
"Well, the two of you have had enough misdirection."
"Trust me, show your hand."
"Move your toes, Trina."
Good.
- O-neg's here.
- Put it right on the infuser.
"Trina, do you remember anything?"
They started shooting.
They just started shooting.
Threading the catheter.
Wire back.
- What'd she say?
- Hook me up.
- Ten blade.
"- Trina, how many of them were there?"
"Two, in an SUV."
I saw them drive up.
- Another 50 of fent.
- Knife back.
- Curved Kelly.
- I might have seen them getting away.
Anything more specific?
"It was a 4x4, gold or tan maybe."
It looked pretty new.
Anything about the men?
Height?
- Yeah.
"No, you don't."
'Cause I just made it up.
"Don't you want a warm, wet jimmy ha-ha?"
No.
You live there?
Cool.
I'm gonna live in an apartment.
"Next year, maybe."
"- Yeah, right."
- I am.
"My sister's gonna get a loft apartment, and she said I could live with her."
She won't even letyou sit in her car.
- Can we come in?
"- Yeah, can we come in?"
We'll be good.
"Go eat it outside, Robby."
Okay!
I just need to put on my jacket.
- Can we see your parents' room?
- My parents are separated.
My dad sleeps there.
"He'll be home, like, any second."
"We're each going to do it, and you have to tell us what the difference is."
"Like, how it feels different when she does it from when I do it."
Exactly.
"Thank you, Rebecca."
"You're welcome, Heather."
- But first we need a towel and-
- And a washcloth.
Right.
A wet washcloth and a dry washcloth.

It's not my blood.
It's...
It's David Bentley's.
He's dead.
Let's get you to the station and get you cleaned up.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
"We'll get you in the car, all right?"
"Take her to the station, OK?"
When are you coming back?
I don't think I am.
What?
"Do you know what my mum said to me, when I was joining the force?"
No doubt the same as mine.
That you were mad.
She said I'd end up dead.
And you think this has proved her right?
"Kath, you can't give up."
You've got a shot at joining CID.
I'd give my right arm to be in your shoes.
"It's not giving up, accepting your limitations."
I need someone to look up to.
I'm not much of a role model.
You're not if you quit.

So surreal.
He was standing right in front of me.

"He wasn't in the hospital but, I think he's messed up pretty bad."
They took Robbie in handcuffs.
-Shit.
'You seen it?
Have you seen Wes lately?
Nope.
"You got this, man."
You'll win the whole race.
I have to.

(Hollis) You've seen my belt?
-No.
Dam.
[Searching drawers].
Found that nice tie mom got you?
"Yes, it's right here."
I don't know how to tie it.
She always did for me.
-	 Know .
Come here.
Lift up your chin.
Here you go.
Here.
It's good.

Come on.
Somewhere east of here.
I've heard there may be children there.
Voilà!
How on earth did you manage that?
"Garden centre, piece of cake."
- Perfect!
- Thank you!
Look at Naj.
Never seen him so happy.
Maybe he'll move in with them!
"Come on, we're naming the chickens."
- Why?
- Cause no-one eats pets with names.
Got to be something that suits them.
- Nugget?
- Something nice.
Korma?
- What happened to you?
- Car crash.
Suits you.
Both.
Are you OK?
We're naming the chickens.
"You can have one, but you'll have to share."
- Otherwise Abby won't get one.
- She not back yet?
That one there.
Eagle Eye.
What do you reckon?
Look at him.
He knows exactly what's going on.
You couldn't get anything past him.
Pretty...
Pretty... every one said...
But...
The taste of people change in any moment...
What is out of fashion is thrown in the drawer and never used.
Hey...
Am I Pretty?
What a soft feeling!
Although it's a little worn out
It's ok!
I'll borrow them!
Beautiful.
I'm just a traveler passing by.
Lost my way under the rain.
It's seems I entered your house without permission.
I'm sorry.
Will you let me go out soon?
That's a very nasty smell.
Even here it's all battered.
Up to be thrown in the dump indeed.
"But, before that..."
I won't forget...
"Before becoming useless, were wonderfully useful to people..."
Good work.

Do you need one?

I'm going back to Seoul.
You are?

Director Kim.
You know I once lost my father in a rest area like this.
You did?
There was this little stream behind a building like this one.
"I was there, but no one knew."
They went crazy searching for me.
My dad really scolded me for that one.
Let's see each other in Seoul.
Don't strain yourself for me.
"No, don't say that."
Brought you something.
- Is it chocolate?
- No.
"Oh, wait... it is chocolate."
How's she doing?
"Couple more hours, and she should be out of the woods."
Mel...
I don't think you should come to Dallas.
I said I was scared.
I didn't say I didn't want to go.
"I know, but..."
You're getting cold feet.
- No my feet are fine...
- Liar.
I think you're going for the wrong reason.
Is this your thing?
Thrill of the chase and then lose interest?
I'm the bad boyfriend you want to make happy.
"- Peter, what the hell?"
- And you don't even know it.
- I'm going to Dallas.
- I don't think you should.
Tough!
"You made your bed, you're gonna sleep in it... with me."
I saw you kissing Jerry.
- That wasn't...
I wasn't kissing...
- Looked like you were.
He was kissing me.
- I actually came up here to see a patient.
- The jackass?
- Don't...
Two more.
Do not waver.
You'll leave?
Yes.
I'll leave you alone.
Who said I'd let you leave?
Then let me ask you one thing.
What?
Why in God's name is he doing this?
Because her father has sinned.
What sin?
What sin did I commit?
Her father suspected another.
"He tried to kill him, and finally succeeded."
But my daughter...!
My daughter...
My daughter got sick first!
How can that...
How can that possibly...
"One more, now."
How can that be...?
Don't do it.

That's what I'm here for.

His name's Noogie and I'm married to him.

Nothing.
The doctor said I need rest.
And I expect your support.
There'll be some new rules.
I want absolute quiet in the house.
I have to sleep.
"If it's important, knock."
And no visitors.
"If anyone asks,"
Mom is ill.
We'll keep the blinds closed.
I have to avoid sunlight.
"You'll play only in the garden, quietly."
Bring nothing inside.
"No branches, no animals..."
What are you doing?
We'll start over.
Right?
We need to hold this family together.
One from me and one from Lukas.
Very nice.
I'm serious about what I just said.
"We won't forget, right?"
Good.
-Can I turn on the light?
-No.
I put it in here to keep it fresh.
Can we leave this open to get some light?
This is our baby's birthday cake.
I don't want any.
Suit yourself.
It's good.
You should try some.
Today's his birthday?
No.
It was in September.
I missed it.
I left him with Mama before he was two years old.
That means I've missed four birthdays so we celebrated all four of them last night.
Does your mama know about....
Know what?
"No, I never told her."
"I never meant you any trouble, Dale."
I still don't.
Wouldn't Bonnie be surprised to know she had a half-brother in Nigger Town?
You should have some of our baby's cake--
Quit calling him that.
Why?
That's what he is.
"Damn it, I told you I didn't want any."
-Do you want this?
-What are you doing?
-This is what you want.
-Cut it out.
"Cut it out, goddamn it!"
Why did you ever fuck with me?
"The drunkard has tattled, has he?"
Not him.
Producer Ranbir Kapoor told me his.
"Does he know about it, too?"
Of course.
It'll be out in the newspapers tomorrow.
"In the newspapers, too?"
Yes.
I've sent the news!
You're not an assistant director anymore.
You've been promoted.
Jaiprakash Paswan is now an independent choreographer!
What a cold reaction!
No!
It means the same!
Won't you reward me for the good news I've brought?
What do you want?
Don't you remember?
No!
This won't do!
What if someone sees us?
You mean aunty?
Yes.
That's how you hurt your own feet!
So let's go...
Okay...
"I mean, I've got to go to the loo!"
But aunty's using it now.
I'll go after she comes out.
I have a lot to do!
When must I come again?
When I'm not around
Ted Carter?
- No.
"- Don't you lie to me, don't lie!"
I'm not lying to you.
"Doc, help me."
I need your help.
"What do you mean by ""help""?"
I don't want to have the baby.
Give me something.
There's nothing I can give you.
Tell me who's responsible.
I can help you that way.
You can get married.
He's already married.
Then he'll have to take care of you and provide for the baby.
Who is it?
- Please just give me something!
- Selena!
"I've done a lot of things, but I've never broken a law."
What you're asking me to do is break the law of man and God.
"Now, tell me, who is the man?"
"Selena, tell me who he is."
Who is he?
It's my stepfather!
It's my stepfather!
It's Lucas!
"Hi, doc, come on in, have a drink."
I've got Selena in my office.
Selena?
What for?
She's pregnant.
I told her she'd get in trouble.

Impossible!
I just saw her coming up the stairs!
"This thing about in and out is a long story, Haribhai."

"you saw her, I didn't."
And both of us didn't see when I went upstairs.

That's the smartest thing
I've ever heard you say.
Ever.
Stop insulting my crew.
I was complimenting him.
I what you doin'.
Thank you.
So this is Chosun...
So.
"Yes, sir!"
Send out the scouts.
"Yes, sir!"
This is war at last...!
"On April 13, 1592, some seven hundred Japanese warships appeared on the coast of Pusan."
It was the advance guard of Chosun invasion Konishi Yukinaga's fleet.
This was its beginning of the brutal seven-year war between
Chosun and Japan...
Jakbo.
"Yes, Dae-man?"
Isn't that Su-chang from the shipyard?
Yes.
He's trying to get himself killed!
"Hey, Su-chang!"
Are you crazy?
Where did you get that uniform?
Did you steal it?
"I knew you weren't normal when you took a hammer to a warship, but..."
Did he just hit me?
Jakbo.
Yes?
"I'm right, right?"
Yup.
Dae-man!
- Did you hear the news?
- What news?
The high commander made that boy a commander!
"Starting today, Su-chang is a commander!"
Come again?
Where are you going?
is she your aunt?
Yes.
Why don't we go to your mother's?
She says that our house is too small and that you deserve better.
I think your mother's wrong.
Small things have their value too.
You're small but skilful.
I'm going to grow.
The house won't grow though.
You'll grow up and go to school.
- How far does your school go?
- Until 11.
You want to keep on studying after?
I'll go to Momenieh until I'm 15.
"For the final years, I'll go to Kermanshah."
Where is it?
"Over there, look."
It's over there.
Look.
The blue window.
- The blue window?
- And that's her son.
"I see, he's her son."
Yes.
Where's the cemetery?
Up on the hill.
I have to go.
I'll take the others to Hammad's.
Are you worried about them or your book?
My book. I have an exam tomorrow.
You'll come back?
I'm about halfway through.

[Fire alarm beeping]
[Groans] Damn it.
Ah-ha!
"- [Beeping stops, magazine thuds]"
- God.
I've got such a headache.
That makes two of us.
The only thing helping me is this sweet tea.
- I swear I'm addicted to it.
- My lord!
[Chuckles]
What... what is happening in here?
"We wanted to say ""thank you,"" so we cooked for you."
[Laughs]
And at what ungodly temperature did we cook these eggs?
"Um, the temperature you cook eggs at... high."
"Ah, yeah, really hot."
"[Chuckles] Yes, well, that is not cooking, Nate."
That is an egg-secution. [Chuckles]
"- Hey, before we leave..."
"If you believe this, whatever it is, and I don't bring it forward in this day and age..."
I'm not willing take that risk.
You've shitting me right?
I've known you too long.
Thank you.
There's a flight at 7.30 am.
"- You got a hotel here, right?"
- Yeah.
I'll pick you up first thing.
"We're gonna figure this out, Ray, you and me."
We're gonna gat all this squared away.
This ***.
Where I am?
"You are where you need to be, honey."
"You don't have to this, Chase."
This is the only way to ensure the project success.
What project?
What are you talking about?
What is he doing?
Chase?
It's ok.
Don't worry about what he's doing.
What is that?
What is he doing?
Marcus?
Marcus?
It's just an experiment.
But one I'm sure will work.
Ready.
"You're sure about this, Chase?"
I've nothing but faith in you.
Chase?
What is Cock or Balls?
"It's like Rock paper scissors, except you stand back-to-back, unzip your fly, pull out a little bit of skin, and the other guy has to guess whether he's looking at your cock or your balls."

Somebody wins?
[Eddie] [groans] I'll go first.
[clears throat]
"If I win, you gotta face Cassie."
"Okay, and if I win, you shut the fuck up about that book."
Deal.
"Wait, y'all actually about to play this shit?"
No peeking.
No need.
I can draw a courtroom sketch of his dick.
"All right, ready?"
"Yeah, did you find it?"
"Three, two, one."
- Balls.
- Fuck!
Every time.
[Ron's zipper opens]
- You all right back there?
- Yep.
Whew!
Okay.

What do you think of that?
"Yeah, drink it in."
Why are you so fucking close?
Balls.
- Cock.
- [Adam] Wow.
Bullshit!
I love music.
I like all kinds of music.
"Maybe he'll talk to you now, I think."
Prop him up in the chair f acing the wall.
I can't bear the sight of your handiwork.
"And don't put that thing away, in case."
In case there's more music?
"There he is, all tuned up f or you."
That's better.
"You're a stubborn man, Mr. Murdock."
"Your whole attitude, I find thoroughly aggravating."
What time is it?
That seems a little beside the point.
"It happens to be 10:45, or thereabouts."
"You're licked, Martinelli."
"Quarter to 11, manager, Hotel Southern will phone me here."
- Don't f all f or that.
- Shut up.
"Yes, Mr. Murdock?"
Do go on.
I'm interested.
He's just making with the mouth.
"Wrong, as usual."
Yes?
"-That, mostly."
"It's been pretty bad, Doc."
Where's Jim;
-Waiting at the hotel.
-Waiting;
To take the children home after you've seen them.
Oh.
Did he mind about my seeing them;
I could use good some employees.
They don't challenge you at all in this hotel.
How much?
"Three Euros an hour, plus tips."
"Three Euros, fixed?"
Fixed.
Welcome!
"Nora, you've made the right decision."
I hope that in the next few years...
"Viktor, that's enough."
... we'll lay the groundwork for a great program.
Here's to a fruitful cooperation.
- Harmann.
That's you.
"Yes, but please don't interrupt!"
There's more.
Can I choose now?
Pop culture.
It crashed.
"So tell me, I heard you were politically active?"
Do you still want to see the rest?
Yes.
That'll be a bit difficult  without hands.

You all right?

"Let yourself in, will you?"
What happened?
That crazy kid.
She locked me up with my own cuffs.

Anybody hurt in this wreck?
I thought I told you to get plastic folders for this stuff.
Your scrapbook is like you.

I also got two feds.

Shall we go in?
"- Yes, we're anxious to continue, sir."
Want to get together after rehearsal?
I don't think so.
How about this weekend?
"I can't, I'm working."
I'm busy with my father.
I'm sorry if I offended you yesterday.
Forget it.
Walk gracefully.
It's Europe.

He says that it is your job to answer the tough questions.
"You owe it to me, to the marriage, to confess everything."
- Pastor Paul...
- This is where we did it.
Can you believe I brought her here?
The same place we were married?
Pastor Paul says we should confess our sins.
Let the confessing begin.
"Make a list, will you, honey?"
Cheated on Clara.
Cheated on Lisa.
Here.
Clara:
Controlling.
Go ahead.
Lisa:
She likes for me to make the decisions.
"Let""s see."
Clara spends too much money.
"Lisa""s broke, but she""s not afraid to ask for help."
She likes for a man to take care of her.
"Lisa is tiny, or petite."
Clara is a big...
- thick person.
- Fat.
You had a great body when we were married.
You just got to work out a little.
Clara has pretty eyes.
"Well, they are."
"They""re beautiful, honey."
They are.
"Lisa, her body""s fit."
Take all of it!
The monster took my shoe!
- Candy!
"- Yay, treats."
I love treats.
- Felicia.
"- Hi, Daddy."
That was a nice grip you had on that big fat kid.
"Farkle, excellent work with your teeth."
"- Fergus, my lad."
"- Daddy, Daddy, Daddy."
We're gonna have to work on your timing.
"All in all, not bad for your first Halloween."
They're growing up so fast.
And look who got her first clump of hair.
Did you see?
Farkle got him in the ankle.
- What about little Fergus?
- Nothing yet.
"That's all right, sweetie."
Mama didn't get a scare this year either.
"Fear not, my love."
The night is still young.
Hold the phone.
Who left the door open?
You don't think that someone's inside?
"Now, who'd be stupid enough to break into an ogre's house?"
"Oh, wow."
Terrifying.
I don't know how I'm gonna sleep now.
"Happy Halloween, everyone."
"- Oh, man."
They are my family.
I will hear of it if they are not treated well.
My cabin is theirs.
Mr. Jones...
"I've heard a lot about you, sir."
Your appearance is exactly the way I imagined.
Good-bye.
Look after each other.
I am already missing you.
You're my good friend.
Sallah.
That is for Fayah... that is for your children... and this is for you.
Thank you.
A British tar is a soaring soul
As free as a mountain bird
His energetic fist should be ready to a dictator...
Where did you go?
I'm cleaning up.
Where'd you get that?
From him.
Who him?
Katanga.
I got a feeling I'm not the first woman ever to travel with these pirates.
It's lovely.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Really?
Yeah.
What'd you say?
Wait...
I don't need any help.
You know you do.
- Need to talk to you.
- Okay.
Why don't you take a few minutes and come to my office.
"Yeah, sure."
Mr. Milliken?
Mr. Milliken?
"Oh, my god."
Mrs. Milliken!
Come quickly!
Quickly!
Hey.
How's the hand?
It's fine.
How'd Chappelle find out?
"I don't know, it doesn't really matter."
What's going on out there?
"Almeida's going to be interrogating Nina, and I'll follow it from a feed."
"Okay, good."
Make sure Tony puts double security on the doors.
Get back to me as soon as she gives you anything.
"Agent Bauer, keep pressure here."
Sure.
Thank you.
"Jack, you're about to find something out about me that's not going to make you happy."
What are you talking about?
Excuse me.
Do you mind?
I've got a daughter.
- A daughter?
- It was sprung on me a month ago.
"Her mother dropped her off, and she split."
It's a long story.
- Peachy keen.
I'm Alice.
- What can I get ya?
"- Oh, I don't know."
Let's say a  big bowl of nachos and a Jim Beam neat?
"You betcha, dark and stormy."
"Oh, and Alice, tell Mr. Malvado that Seth Gecko's here to see him."
[elevator bell dings]
"He's right over there, Mr. Malvado."
"Thank you, preciosa."
I'll have my usual.
On your feet.
Oh!
"Whoa, whoa."
"Easy there, compadre."
"Should I take my shoes off, too?"
Clean as a whistle.
Sit.
[grunts] I thought Geckos traveled in pairs.
"Oh, right."
I guess you didn't hear.
Reunion tour got cancelled.
Uh... creative differences.
You got huevos de piedra coming up in here.
[speaks Spanish]
Can I just say how much I dig this place?
"You know, the whole Merle Haggard vibe goes real nice with the Thulsa Doom accents you got goin' on."
Thank you.
It's been a way station for a thousand years.
A saloon when we were part of Mexico.
"Not like the Twister, though, huh?"
"No, more, uh, truckers than desperadoes in here."
Oh.
Hey Lola.
Yes!
Yes!
Finally!
Somebody knows Lola!
I always liked him.
All right bye.
This is awesome.
Now you can be back in the band and we can be together all the time.
Ooh.
Just one simple rule.
Just 'cause you're mushy on Miley.
Don't mean you can be huggy on Hannah.
What?
"Come on, I can't have the world thinking that Hannah steals."
A boyfriend even though she wouldn't be stealing.
Her boyfriend 'cause my boyfriend is her boyfriend.
Which brings me right back to... what?
"You're dating Miley, not Hannah."
Got it.
You just tell me which one to kiss.
This one.
Okay the two minute kissing window is now closed.
-Dad.
-Come on Mr. Stewart.
[Grunting] Look at this Jesse.
Your horoscope says.
You are dangerously close to a slow painful death.
Now come on get the TV on.
It's time for the monkey to drive.
When you ask do you wanna dance.
- How long has this statue here?
- Children.
Mike.
"When the statue distributed, gave to us."
- Causing panic?
- We have broken.
Someone attacked.
"The interesting thing about it, crying."
At least so he says come here.
Think of a miracle.
- Hey!
What are you doing?
!
"If you do heroin in the form of a pie, kururken sweat."
"I made heroin virgin, Father."

Neela.
Also brought his son.
"Do you receive the goods arrived, so?"
The same conversation?
"- Oh, my protector came to visit again."
- Lazarus.
"I can see, our friend has grown even more."
With prehistoric animals.
And Nazis...
I think.
Still drawing?
Sure.
"I was published in ""Parapluie""."
I saw.
Like it?
A lot.
You know I like what you do.
They cropped it an added yellow print.
It doesn't matter.
It's good.
I have to go.
It's late.
Kremlin-Bicêtre is far.
"""Whenever painters try to cast off representation, they do so destroying painting and their survival as painters""."
Any good?
It's amazing.
Do you agree?
To some extent.
We follow our own path.
But it costs you sometimes a lot.
You can't know.
I understand.
I think I do.
I saw Christine.
And?
She didn't go her own way.
She wants a relationship.
Hence the older man.
You want a relationship?
What's that behind you?
Turn round...
"To the left, the one you touched."
Careful you don't break it.
Try to free it.
Pull it out.
Toss it up to me.
He was tall!
It's your size.
is it the left leg or the right?
It's a leg bone. lt's not a shoe.
"Are you well, Mrs Godarzi?"
"Thank you, you're very kind... lt's very difficult reaching you."
"It was the same in Tehran, always engaged."
Yes...
We're ready.
"Yes, they're ready too..."
Everyone's ready.
"Yes, if you don't mind, when you call, you have to wait a few minutes until I drive up to higher ground."
"Yes, that very place."
"Yes, yes."
All right.
Don't mention it...
Thank you...
Good-bye.
Behzad...
Hello.
Are you well?
- Why are you here?

"When I brought the bread, I asked Mim Kharaman,"
Go!
Go!
Right behind you.
- Come on!
- Ah!
This way!
Hurry!
- Won't they search the Abbey?
- Probably.
Behind there.
Quiet.
Hurry.
- Bread.
- Thank you.
- Be safe.
- You too.
We'll move you when the search dies down.
You must go before the Abbess sees you.
Come.
This way.
- Never do that again.
- What?
You broke rank.
You took action with no plan in place.
You've never broken a rule to save someone?
- Your job is to follow my orders.
- Our job is to recruit fighters.
We got what we came for.
We got lucky.
"If you want to stay on this team, you can't be so impulsive."
- We almost lost you once.
- Is that what this is?
It's like renting' a video.
"Once you're finished with it, you just pop it back through the slot."
I've got a new baby lined up.
"Oh, aye?"
One of me own.
- You what?
- Yeah.
- You're not pregnant?
- Yeah.
- Aren't we?
- Mm.
Bloody hell.
Aren't you gonna congratulate us?
"Aye, yeah."
"I'll crack open a bottle of Ribena Toothkind, shall I?"
We're gonna envelope together.
How are you gonna support yourselves?
The money from two paper rounds don't go far.
- I wanna set up a nursery.
- No.
I were gonna call it...
Crash Bang Wallop.
(KNOCK AT DOOR)
I need to be there.
"- Hiya, Moz."
"- All right, Alex?"
How you doing?
Just on me lunch break.

Felix.
"Run,run,run!"

"Go to second, go to second!"
"Go, baby, go!"
"Go to third, go to third, ziggy!"
"Go, babe!"
"Run, run, run!"
Home run!
Home run!
Home run!
Slap me some skin!
"Oh, my god, you did it!"
Ah!
You cannot ruin this one.
"It's hand wash only, so make sure and tell bonnie,"
Or i guess you can tell your dad.
Maybe your dad does the laundry now.
Maybe he does.
I was thinking
"Now that you are gone a little bit,"
Maybe we could have some girlfriend time.
That'd be cool.
Are you ever coming back?
"Yeah, of course."
I'm gonna come back all the time.
I made a playlist for you.
Are you trying to take my room?
Can i?
"No, you can't."
"Maybe when i go to college, though."
We should go get pizza.
Wait a minute.
Dad... what is it?
"That sweater, Zoe."
Whose sweater is that?
It's my friend's.
He lent it to me.
"""He""?"
"Oh, no."
No.
Are you hanging out with boys?
"Zoe, I've had this talk with you before."
All boys are bad.
All of them.
"Yes, Dad, yes."
Seriously?
"I gotta go, okay?"
I love you.
"- I love you, too."
- I love you.
"Bye, bye-bye."
My dad always says never judge a book by its cover.
"Take Pin, for example."
"The guy looks like he swallowed a bag of lemons... but underneath it all, he's surprisingly..."
"Surprisingly likely to be a horse thief, after all."
Sedatives.
Pin... what have you done?
Go away
Stay out of our village you slut streetwalker
Go away
We don't want to live with you anymore
Go away
"I promise you, when I get my licence you can quit and go back."
I already quit.
"Yeah, OK, but you can dance"
- and go to school can't you?
- Not really.
"Alright, but it's kind of expensive for both of us to go to school, so, you know..."
It's not gonna happen.
"Drugs, med school."
Duh.
"OK, but I can, I..."
I got this.
I can control the drugs.
Duh!
"No, it's cool."
"Listen, you'll dance, you'll put us through school,"
- and then I'll...
- Decide you're too good for me?
"It's not gonna be forever, babe."
Stop talking to me and hope I get the idea?
How 'bout I be the doctor and you be the stripper.
- Where are you going?
- I have to pee.
Calm down.
"- Cool, yeah."
Right.
- OK.
"When you come back, we'll get a little more coke."
We'll get out of here.
- We'll figure all this out.
Promise.
- Yeah...
Yeah.
As you wish.
See you in three months.
Then.
Yes.
I'll call you.
Thank you.
Kevin.
Hello.
Hello.
I apologize for this morning.
You weren't so formal this morning.
I shouldn't have said all that.
What?
- Everything I said.
No.
It was...
A learning experience.
Do you always judge people like that.
from the start?
In five minutes.
You understand it all?
It's more complicated than that.
Sometimes.
I talk to someone.
and feel as if I were inside them.
watching them from inside.
As if there was a bond between us.
You didn't expect me to call?
No.
You said you were suspicious of me.
that you were afraid to call.
I had good reasons to be suspicious.
- Of course you will.
- Adam's a pro...
- Of course.
All adults.
"- And, uh, we're all adults here."
Let's play some video games.
I hate this stupid game.
Shoot!
The game hates you.
Next victim?
Who's up for it?
"I am, if that's cool."
"Yeah, it's, uh, it's cool."
"- Oh, just gonna--"
- I'm gonna go with you.
- I'm gonna get the potato salad.
- Would you go...
"Oh, I'll go with you."
I'll go someplace else.
I didn't know you could drift in this game.
It takes practice.
"You brake, accelerate, and then you move the wheel like this."
Watch it.
Sorry.
I didn't mean...
Bri--Brian.
"Adam, come on."
We cool?
"Everybody's cool now, right?"
Good morning.
"Yeah, but we definitely want something back before 10:00, okay, so would you..."
"Hey, everybody, look who's back, huh?"
"Go, go."
"- Keith, Keith."
Listen to me.
You're making a mistake.
"Go, go, move, move."
Rebecca.
"Rebecca, can you hear me?"
Can anyone hear me?
!
Previously on 24...
"Six months ago, U.S. Special Forces launched an assault on the compound of Ibrahim Bin-Khalid, killing him and eight members of his terrorist organization."
Bin-Khalid's people found us.
Where is it?
"A strongbox that belongs to Sheik Bin-Khalid, taken from his compound the night your squad came and killed him."
Carter?
I get 22 in hand after TDS.
"Sairu, can we talk later?"
"What happened, lady-killer?"
Got scared?
Yeah?
- Look carefully.
- At what?
"Nose, it's like mom."
"Smile, it's like dad's I think."
"I'm an awesome combination, yeah?"
Yeah?
Absolutely awesome.
"Wait, uncle is staring at me."
"Don't worry, uncle."
I'll handle your defective piece with utmost care.
Okay?
"I have the patent for the helicopter,"
I did the chief scout for five years
And I can stand under water for three minutes.
I see that Belgium's suffering is the least of her worries.
"Strength, enough with the suffering of Belgium."
Let's go.
"Mr. Lloyd, just wait."
Let's go.
"What do you think, Ludovic?"
Do you have any suggestions?
"No, that's fine, sire."
Link heaven to the present situation of our country...
It's a good comparison.
It's not too much...
How are you saying that?
Go on?
- Sure.
"Louise, who's the lucky one?"
- Sorry?
The ring.
"If you really want to know it, it's Pierre-Armand."
Let me guess.
"French and you've known studying law, right?"
Did you dig into my past?
"- It's all online, baby."
Tell me about Pierre-Antoine.
- Pierre-Armand.
"And I'm not his treasure, Mr. Loyd."
- Call me Duncan.
Me dia.
"Hey, stop."
We have to go to Sofia.
[CROWD CHUCKLING]
"Oh, what a beautiful dog."
"Seriously, Devon, I really did feel just a moment, a splash, of hesitation."
"No, there wasn't."
There wasn't any hesitation at all.
PAIGE:
You just did it again.
That was a pause.
DEVON:
I did not pause.
You must be Beth.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Heard a lot about you from Paige.
Actually been lobbying to sit next to her single sister for weeks.
"Oh, yeah?"
So you must be:
"""Dan."""
Sort of.
- Sort of?
"- Well, I'm actually a Wiccan."
- A what?
- A Wiccan.
Wiccan?
- Male witch.
- Right.
So I also have a magical name.
It's Brother Phoenix East-Horse.
But I didn't know if that would fit on the card.
Love that.
I'm guessing that I'm gonna hear a whole lot about you.
"Nature-based pre-Christian paganism, yeah."
You have to see the view.
Join this road.
"Gentlemen, this is our research department."
We are proud of what we gained through research.
"Yes, here is Frederik Jackman and Tonje Sandvik."
Tonje Sandvik our research leader.
Is that you?
Aksel god.
Do you know me again?
-Yes.
Of course.
-Here's Report.
-It's Not necessary.
But it is the latest version.
"We have what we need, thanks."
Shall we proceed?
-Yes.
OK.
"Thus, it is so ..."
It's so disrespectful.
"Yes, it must have been a shock."
Where is Lars?
I need to call him.
"No, wait a minute."
"Eva, listen to me."
PWG is the only card we have.
"In a few days the deal is done, and so you'll never have to see him again."
-What do you mean?
-Drag Back.
Hear what they have to say
He will not getting buy a single share.
-So You'd rather go bankrupt?
'Cause there's a jungle out there
It's a jungle out there
There's something wrong here.
This is wrong.
This is very wrong.
"This is very, very..."
Wrong?
This was no random mugging.
This was all about her.
He was after her.
He took her purse and some jewelry.
He wanted us to think robbery.
She was stabbed six times.
That's right.
Two in the neck.
Four in the back.
"Or, was stabbed three times."
Look at the pattern.
"It's two, two and two."
Three times.
With a pair of scissors.
Yes.
That's possible.
Who brings scissors to a mugging?
Scissors say what?
Spur of the moment.
Not planned.
Plus the mud on her shoes.
There's a mud puddle near the exit.
But there's a light right there.
"If she was walking, she would have seen that."
"So, she was running when she left the building."
Miss Elizabeth Dollon.
Ah!
Let her in.
She comes from Switzerland.
"Sir, where is my brother?"
"Miss, I beg you, rest easy."
He was arrested but it probably was a mistake.
"I know, but it is terrible."
"You know, Miss, what would be truly terrible is that he was really guilty."
Why did you not free him?
He has therefore not been able to defend himself?
"On the contrary, Miss."
H defended himself.
And where is he now?
Can I see him?
Listen...
I would rather...
I mean...
I fear that seeing him
You're hiding something.
"I want to see him, you hear me?"
"He's dead, isn't he?"
"Alas, Mss."
"No, it is not possible."
This is not true.
He was killed?
"Listen, lead me to him."
You can not refuse me.
It's too horrible.
"I beg you, calm down."
I'll take you to your brother.
Your brother was innocent.
Terminated.

Maybe you should remove trousers if you have the Holy Spirit.

Why?
Why are usually them that they do it to me.
I can also legarti feet.
"For the same reason, usually because ... to me that is doing this."
And this why?
Because usually Am I that are ridiculous.
So we can forget.

You need to do evil to survive?

Jimmy you don't understand anything.
What I don't understand anything is why anybody would want to take your picture.
That's what I don't understand.
You're just a freak.
A weirdo.
Behind your back everybody laughs.
They call you chicken woman.
That's why you look just like her.
Such a sweet point.
"Don't step on that shoe, we'll have to pay for it."
C'mon!
C'mon!
One day the chicken woman had chicks.
"And everybody stepped on, cause they were so ugly..."
Don't talk to her like that.
We still have two rolls of film.

I was wondering if you can score some tickets for me and Zeke?
Or not.
Becky!
Hi Julian!
Look out!
"Beck, are you alright?"
"Grap my bag, I'll get your bike."
How many bikes is it this month?
"I don't know, four?"
Hi Becky.
How are you doing?
"Oh, I am doing fine."
How are you?
Hi Guys!
Hi Katie.
Hi Baby.
What's wrong?
No kiss for the former-boyfriend?
You smell like farm wather.
"I got it, calm down."
I take it as he's not handling the break-up to well?
No.
Hi Guys!
Are you going to check out my gymnastics today?
"Oh yeah, bet you look real good bent over the bar."
Up your!
"Name the time, You got 4 more years to get a piece of this solid man."
What did he mean?
I really don't like what I'm hearing.
You guys will drive me crazy.
"Between my mom, the cops and no job."
We haven't even paid the rent.
Why?
It's been paid.
How?
Here.
Did you pay it?
Don't I live here?
How many times have I told you?
Enough!
I support this house.
I am not a sponger.
"I sleep here, eat here."
I am here... got that?
I'll go with you.
The way I look they'll never believe I am gay.
Make me a Zenne.
Some cream?
"Oh, you speak German?"
My ex-husband was from Bavaria.
I lived in Munich for many years.
How did you like Bavaria?
I don't know.
I didn't really feel at home.
"The people... but now, I miss it very much."
Bavaria is beautiful.
I hope Ahmet will enjoy it there with me.
What are you doing?
Take this!
Stand in line.
"Hey, I wanna meet him."""
"And Kat's like, ""All right, I'll go introduce you."
"Come on."""
"- Oh, my gosh."
- I never met him either.
Andy was talking to somebody and then Kat goes:
"- ""Andy, this is Ari."""
"- Oh, man, that is so funny."
- Great.
- I couldn't help it.
"This is at The Box, which is an amazing space."
This was amazing.
This was...
Yes.
Yes.
- This was a really fun day.
- They did that how many times?
Like 10?
"Upwards of 10 probably, right?"
- Yeah.
- This is one of my favorite days.
"We're all, like, hanging out in there."
- My parents were here this day.
"- Yeah, your parents were there."
I love everybody's different faces.
Look at this.
Bewildered.
"This was originally slow motion, right?"
Or I guess we shot it regular.
"It was, but we realized the song wasn't long enough for us to play it in slow motion."
- Right.
"Oh, man."
- It's nothing.
- It's not nothing.
"You know, this whole float is supposed to be about friends creating something together and everyone is fighting."
Matt and Tyler hate each other.
You and Elena are on the outs.
I just...
I don't like it.
[SIGHS]
And I can't fix it if I don't know what's wrong.
"I can't talk about it, Caroline, I'm sorry."
Damon.
Thanks for coming.
Sorry I'm late.
"The dog ate my, uh..."
Never mind.
- What's with all the furrowed brows?
- I saw Isobel last night.
Isobel's here?
In town?
- You're late.
JOHN:
Didn't realize I was on a schedule.
What's with the sideshow?
ISOBEL:
Cherie is a little jazz singer that I picked up in a blues bar in Brooklyn.
And I got the cowboy at a gay rodeo in Amarillo.
- He's gay?
- Not right now.
He's very good to me.
"Hey, Cherie?"
[ISOBEL SPEAKS IN FRENCH]
I'm teaching them French.
And you can count on him.
Have a wonderful trip.
"Enjoy the spring, and not least the Parisian gentlemen."
"OK, I'll try."
Ace!
(doorbell rings)
It's open!
- I'm just about to leave for Paris.
- I know.
Camilla told me.
- I'm here for the keys.
- Keys?
Of course.
I'm really confused.
- I'd better show you around.
- Yeah.
Didn't get much of a tour the last time.
"That's Camilla's shelf, that's yours."
"You can make up a different system if you want, you and..."
Camilla.
"Jesus, Johan!"
What are you doing here?
You never called.
I couldn't stop thinking about you.
I lost your number.
"I tried to find it, but..."
I don't know what annoyed me most.
Him appearing from nowhere.
Again.
Or him sharing my flat with Camilla.
(traffic noises from outside)
(heavy breathing)
It was a bit rushed.
I could do better.
Ok.
That's good.
"Sarah, that's really good."
"And Debbie's actually one of my favorite models necause she's so flexible, and she moves in really interesting ways, you know?"
"So, what do you do with that now?"
Oh...nothing.
It's just an exercise.
You mind if I keep that?
Thanks.
Yeah.
"You know, you really should've gone to art school."
"What is this, a mid-life crisis or something?"
Do you have cancer?
"No, no."
"No, no."
"Well, then what?"
Art school?
That's what I should do?
I thought it was Commerce or...
"Pre-med or I'm ""on my own."""
I said that?
Ah.
"Well, I wish I hadn't."
"I mean, I know that doesn't really help."
It helps a little.
Well...
"I had a really nice time today, Sarah."
"Yeah, me, too."
Good.
Take care of yourself.

Think on the bright side.
At least during New Year this time you can relax at home like everyone else.
It will be a new experience for you.
"Anyway, I got to go."
I got a briefing.
Bye.
Happy holidays.

"Yes, this is my town."
It's not new to you.
"You've read books about it, you've seen movies."
People are always talking about New York.
"It's the most exciting city in the world, they say, the most glamorous, the most frightening, and above all, the fastest."
How old is he?
I'd say about your age.
My age?
Sit down.
But you don't understand...
Sit down!
I'm telling you all this in confidence.
He's the only hope we have of catching the killer.
The man we're after is after Hoolick.
He's after Hoolick.
"When he strikes, we'll catch him."
But we need someone to keep an eye on Wilbur every minute.
Do you mind if I tell my girl about this?
You're to tell no one.
Wilbur's life is at stake.
It's more at stake than you think.
I knew we could count on you.
We'll keep in touch with you.
Good day.
Good day.
My age?
"Hello, Mr. Miles."
Not now!

Aunt Nancy's drawing room.

It's okay.
Really.
Good luck with it.
It looks perfect.
Good night.
Good night.
Got a little...
Playstation.
Perhaps... are you running away?
"Go back in the house, Seth."
"Hey, hey, hey."
You can't just run away.
What are you thinking?
"What about, like, Child Services, or my dad?"
"Okay, then, wait."
"Hey, I want to come with you."
"You know what I've always wanted to do, besides sail to Tahiti."
I want to do that whole Kerouac thing...

Fair enough.
Where are you going?
I don't know.
"New town, get a job somewhere, save some money."
Great plan.
Sounds like you've given it a lot of thought.
You got a better idea?
"Actually, I do."

Hi.
Last time I was here I stayed in room 323.
Kind of a good luck thing.
It's available?
Nope.
But I got 305 across the hall.
That's fine.

"Good evening, Mr. Dzasokhov."
"You're a very pretty girl, Alex."
You know that?
Thank you.

-You can even ask sister...
-You're such a joker!
"Hello Grandma, of course I should still be your prettiest and your favorite granddaughter!"
"Oh my, my granddaughter is really clever."
So how are you my dear?
What made you call?
"Well, there's something I'd like to ask your permission for."
I'm getting married.
Really?
Is it to your boyfriend who's a doctor?
.
"Yes Grandma, to Migs!"
Our wedding will be on June 1 0.
-Oh my I'm excited!
-You know what Grandma?
I love Migs so much.
And I know he'll take care of me.
"Come on, my dear."
I might as well get a dog or something.
When it comes to sex.
the man has to be in charge.
In every way.
"He has to take me when he wants, where he wants."
I'm just Woman.
just a sex object for this man.
And I need that.
And I like it.
You're right.
I swear...
Seriously.
How are you getting home?
- Leave your horn here.
- I'll take it.
- Leave it here.
- I'll drop it off tomorrow.
- By bus.
I promise.
- With the graveyard shift.
I'm the Fuhrer of this party.
- I'll take it with me.
"- No, leave it here."
Leave it.
You'll bust it.
- We need it.
- You guys have no sense of reality.
Of what's real.
How will you get home?
I have to open the door first.
How will you get home?
With who?
Sometimes it's just a bit monotonous.
Just a tiny bit dull.
"Hi, Claire."
"Frank, come here."
Have a look.
- Frank!
- Marvelous.
- Look at this.
It's a Torben Din.
- Very nice.
"- 25,000 kroner."
It's a steal.
- It is?
"- Yes, it's worth at least 30-40,000."
- I have to go help out the Gimp.
- He's putting Bodil in a home.
"- Well, good for him."
You just can't eat a thing around a mentally handicapped person.
- He's skin and bone.
- Why can't he eat?
- You can't eat around those people.
- Why not?
It turns you off food when fellow human beings are barmy.
I've never heard that before.
- You haven't?
- No.
- Mia said I was speaking for myself.
- I've never heard anyone think that.
I shagged a handicapped girl once.
I shagged a retard.
- But you can't.
A real retard?
"Madam, nobody has arrested you."
Now please go home.
"If you want to know anything about crime, ask the police."

Must you keep jumping out?
You seem to have jumped in.
What on earth...?
- I...
I got caught in a storm.
- It hasn't been raining.
It was raining where I was.
Cats and dogs.
"- And mud, I see."
"- Yes, I must brush that off."
"By the way, one of your girls has been telephoning."
Really?
Which one?
I mean...
What do you mean?
She had a twangy voice and refused to give her name.
It's a Korean lullaby.
The thing about land mines is...
You got to remember where you put 'em.
"Otherwise, you blow up your own men."
The lullaby was the enemy's way of communicating that information.
One word in each line indicated a different location.
We did the same thing.
Crosby and Sinatra.
"""Snow..."
Beard...
"Grace."""
"""Snow..."
"""Beard..."
"Grace."""
Where are you putting them now?
"""Little brook..."
"In the woods."""
There's more.

"""Among the pines you flow."""
Pine Street.
It matches.
Broke the lock and put a new one on.
"Yeah, and the kicker is, it looks like he broke it from the inside."
"He broke out, not in?"
This is where he came back.
"Well, let's find out."
Looks like somebody was painting.
There's paint over here too.
"Doc, give me a hand with this."
Okay.
You're right.
Eveyone used to call her her as Meena with love
Did you call her that too?
- No.
In college I was a shyster.
I was scared to talk to girls.
But this girl was vey...
"An_ay, forget it."
What use digging up the past?
Exactly.
No use.
Was she beautiful?
"Yes, she was nice."
Roundish face.
Large eyes.
Long tresses.
"Now that you mention her, I think she was quite exotic."
And so you fell for her?
"- Who, me?"
Forget it.
At the beginning I never used to look at her.
"But one day something strange happened, and..."
Forget it.
Why dig up the past?
- Right.
No use.
So you were saying...
what happened that day?
"What day... yes, that day ...it so happened..."
"ARer college, I find only Meenakshi standing at the bus-stop."
I didn't mind her.
Like me she must've come to catch a bus.
There was a silence.
- Forget him.
Ain't nobody watching you but me.
All right ?
Now show me some attitude.
"MissJohnson, we don't have time for this."
Areyou readyto continue ?
- MissJohnson !
- l'm ready.
Whoo !
Yeah !
"That's what I'm talkin'about, baby."
"Look, all due respect, ifyou don't let this girl in, you're crazy."
[ Murmuring ]
"Thankyou, sir."
Thankyou very much.
"MissJohnson, I can't say this on the record yet, but welcome toJuilliard."
[ Laughs ]
Thankyou.
Thankyou.
[ Laughs ]
"Oh, yeah, hype it up."
"Hype it up, everybody."
"Hey, I heard you got intoJuilliard."
"That's like the hottest school on the planet, right ?"
"Yeah, it's pretty good."
"Well, I know they got all these famous dance teachers and shit, but ifyou need some new moves, you know, some real flavor, you know who to call."
All right ?
All right.
- Congratulations !
- Thankyou.
Hold it.

Addons you recognize this?
"recently,youhavecompleted online tests, such as that."
"Yes, and?"
Addons This test is called:
"""What kind of lover are you?"""
Addons So ...
What kind of lover you are?
Yes ...
Let us know!
Addons
- Repeat the question.
"- No, that's good."
"I say that the test is the mistress, sadist."
I know.
That's why I was good.
But that stupid test.
I make time to go.
The test was wrong?
Is not it?
Well ...
"I'm not sadistic, implies that if."
"Your answer was given to Addons and results, but lying a few questions, right?"
I do not know ...
"I have not taken seriously, to be honest."
Addons This is a question to the 4 ...
Thanks.
You and Amanda should take a walk around the marina.
Sunsets are really pretty.
Maybe we will.
Dead man walking.
Hi.
Hello.
Can I come in?
There's a front door.
I wanted to see you.
This is quicker.
What happened?
"Oh, I"
- I slipped and hit my shoulder.
Jumping off another roof?
"Kyle, I've learned my lesson."
And I'm here to learn another one.
"You said I have to work my way up to do things like levitate, so start teaching me."
I can't.
There's nobody around.
I have plans tonight with Amanda.
"Oh, Amanda."
She's home?
As a surprise.
You're anxious about it.
"Your heart's beating really fast, I can tell."
"She told me, ""We need to talk. """
So?
You don't think that means anything?
Uh... it means she wants to talk to you?
Isn't that a good thing?
That's what I thought.
"No, but I'll leave a sweater that smells like me right next to you."
"Monica, come on."
You want to have kids.
I do.
But the stork is gonna bring mine.
"Seriously, you're not gonna make me watch this alone."
She's right.
Of course not.
"Honey, get the tape."
This reminds me of a very specific part of the tape.
"Oh, sure."
But if you leave a drumstick under there and you're a bad roommate.
Here we go.
Okay.
"Oh, my."
"Come on, come on."
Why is that baby torturing that woman?
Why have I seen this thing three times?
It's beautiful.
-It's horrible!
"-I know, I know!"
I'm so sorry for you!
What do I do?
I don't want to do this!
How do I get out of it?
-You guys!
"You guys, look!"
-What?
Did her ass explode?
"No, the baby's out."
Look.
Look at those little fingers and toes.
- So let's try the other.
- That's where it has to be.
- Are you getting tired?
- No.
- All right.
[Rachel] I'm gonna start to scream soon.
I'm gonna go out and throw myself under a car.
That's the only thing I can do.
He was waiting for the doctor's call when I left.
What kind of a mother am I?
What kind of a mother am I?
I don't know where he is.
He might even be in a hospital.
I don't know.
I'm gonna start to scream at the top of my voice.
I don't care if they put me in jail.
I have to find my Freddy!
I want my Freddy!
Fred Baker.
My only child.
I'm gonna break everything.
I
- If I can't find him...
I will break everything here.
Everything.
"Fred Baker, where are you?"
Where are you?
Where are you?
"Fred Baker, where are you?"
Where are you?
[Ida] It was hanging up from the ceiling.
"He must be one of those there, on the wall."
"Fido, come here!"
You guys are crazy!
What do you think you're doing?
- The swine!
- Are you all right?
You picked the wrong guy!
Here's your hat.
Did they hurt you?
They picked the wrong guy.
"What's going on, Officer?"
What's happening?
So you don't know either?
He's playing dumb.
What do you want?
Franz is ―
He's in there dancing with some fat cow.
Violets.
"Here, Cilly."
I shouldn't really accept these.
How much longer will it be?
You two gonna become trash pickers?
Break every bone in his body ― he won't change.
But you're a clever girl.
"Listen, I'll get you ten other guys."
"I need him, and he'll do as I say!"
Forget about Franz!
"You love him, huh?"
Won't help me out?
- No.
- Say that again!
Let me go!
You don't like me anymore anyway.
Unless Venice has been overrun by the French.
No flag.
No signal.
Why not?
She must see our colours.
She must've heard us clear for action.
"Mr. Ponsonby, private night signal."
Hoist the night signal.
- No reply.
"- The gun ports are open, sir."
We can't wait for her broadside.
"I'm just as suspicious as you, but we must be sure."
We can't expose the ship like this.
We must fire now!
- All right.
Run out your guns.
"- Aye, aye, sir."
But hold your fire!
Run out your guns!
Heave!
What ship are you?
We are His Majesty's ship Defiant.
What ship are you?
Fire party to number five gun!
Mr. Ponsonby!
It's his arm.
Get him below.
"Hudson, King!"
Get the captain below!
The captain's been hit!
Take your orders from me!
Ready!
Oh.
"So, who's first?"
Uh...
[Chuckles]
Um... tell you what.
"Uh, why don't you let me tie you up first?"
Then how am I gonna be able to do all the terrible things that I've got planned for you?
"[Laughs] Oh, I'm sure you'll figure something out."
"[Chuckling] Isn't that right, Kendall?"
Kendall...
Kendall?
Damn it.
She's gonna miss all the fun.
[Grunts]
You've been had.
That dirty little...
[Chuckles]
I'm getting tired of chasing you.
"Well, there's no rule against taking a short break."
[Laughs]
[Alarm blaring]
What the hell?
"Hey, where's your friend?"
Huh?
Castle:
Thought we had a deal.
No more double-crosses.
"Sorry, Ricky, but I am going to be the one to take those trophies in."
Castle:
"Well, good luck with that, because I'm looking for a murder weapon."
"It's a unique blade, but I guess you wouldn't know that."
- You're lying.
You'll call her first thing?
Thanks.
Bye.
- Walter can't represent me on this.
- Why not?
Because it's criminal.
I don't understand why they want to talk to you.
"I told you, I don't know why."
"- Rick, I'm not the enemy."
- l'm sorry.
It's just I don't know what's happening and I suspect that Karen does.
- Karen is behind this?
- She wouldn't tell me.
Maybe she wasn't allowed to.
Miles?
"It's Rick, again."
"Uh, call me as soon as you get this."
It doesn't matter what time.
"Rick, it's okay."
"Rick, come here."
Please?
I know this is going to be okay.
I know who you are.
I know how you conduct yourself.
"Whatever these people may have done, it doesn't concern you."
"Hello, Rick?"
Hi.
Stephanie Arlyn.
I'm sorry.
We were wrapping up a deposition.
That's okay.
"- This is my associate, James Davis."
Slut?
"""Kim""?"
You have her number programmed into your cell phone?
- Who is this dirty whore?
- I didn't sleep with her!
- Who is this fucking whore?
- I didn't sleep with her!
- No.
"But you wanted to, right?"
- No!
- Bullshit.
Is she prettier than me?
- No!
- Liar!
"- No, Jen!"
"What am I supposed to do now, huh?"
What the fuck am I supposed to do now?
You've ruined everything!
Will you listen to me?
Nothing happened!
Nothing?
You kissed her.
You were out with another woman all night.
I'm pregnant.
- Is that fucking nothing to you?
- Yes!
No!
How many times did you kiss her?
Don't you dare lie to me.
Several times.
"Oh, God, you make me sick!"
"But it didn't mean anything, baby."
Here!
Maybe it's a black hole.
Stop it.
It keeps you in school.
Came out of nowhere.
Swallows everything in its path.
For something that does not exist is quite impressive!
It's beautiful!
"Uncle, Ramon?"
"Children, take me home."
So this is all we are.
Food.
And we think that a lifetime without knowing the truth.
Criel Goodbye world!
Erik.
Boadicea.
Aticcus.
Ramon.
You see!
It is the main event of the females.
I'm about being thrown to the ground and crushed for thousands of Ticas.
"Rejoice Ticas, the emperor has returned!"
Ignored by thousands.
The emperor returned!
I have so much love overflows.
"-Ramon, live!"
How long!
I thought I had not left.
Ramon has twins?
There are only three.
"Children, friends."
"Friends, children."
"You're here about Ben, of course."
What about Ben?
-Ben Haverman.
"This morning, the newspaper said he had died."
"Out of the blue, it said."
That must have been our Ben.
"Bronze Lion, ex assault group member, it has to be him."
"Yes, it's Ben."
Oh God.
Out of the blue.
Was it his heart?
Are you going to the cremation?
"-No, I have to do something else."
You?
"-Well, so many people are dying."
Fantastic garden.
"-Yes, it's my pride and joy."
It takes a lot of time.
They're beautiful I've never seen them before.
Which ones exactly?
-The pink ones.
I've got those from Israel.
The children brought them for me.
Nice holiday present.
-They live there.
Have a seat.
"Yes, they're three very tough rascals."
They participate in every war.
"Syria, Jordan, Egypt, you name it."
They've got that from you.
They're real American Jews.
Very fanatical.
"""And I meant what I said, and I said what I meant."
"""An elephant faithful, 100%."""
Give me five!
"Yes, sirree."
"Hi, baby."
- Your mom smells good enough to eat.
"- What does she smell like, Daddy?"
She smells like pepperoni pizza.
Sausage.
Lots of cheesy cheese.
And a frog.
"Clara, honey... did you tell Mr. Rodriguez that we would eat the cost of his kid""s procedure?"
- Dad?
- Boo Boo!
"Hey, baby, welcome home."
My girl.
"This afternoon, I hired a new receptionist."
"J.T., take the elbows off the table, honey."
"It""s rude."
Thank you.
"- What""s her name, Daddy?"
- Rebecca Singer.
But she goes by Lisa.
She just went through a rough divorce.
"She""s completely broke."
Can you imagine?
Take your fingers out of your mouth and eat more.
"L""ll bet she""s super nice."
She just needs somebody to give her a break.
"- That""s way generous of you, Dad."
- Just try one string bean.
"You know, it felt good."
Not anyone else.
"You seem like a great kid, Sam."
Just live the life you wanna live.
We came back here so you could talk to a teacher?
He's a good guy.
"Well, whatever."
Go have your Robin Williams'
"""O captain, my captain"" moment."
Just make it quick.
"Excuse me, sir."
Can you tell me how to find room 305?
Sure.
"Um... head down the hall, take your first right, and it's the..."
third door on the left.
"Thanks, Sam."
"You got tall, Winchester."
Trust me.
This will help.
That ghost is dead.
I'm gonna rip its lungs out!
"Well, you know what I mean."
"It knew my name, Dean."
My real name.
We burned Barry's bones.
What the hell?
"Well, maybe it wasn't Barry."
Maybe we missed something.
We just got to go back.
No way.
How did we not see this before?
- What?
- Check it out.
Forbidden!
Officer!
This wheel didn't understand ifs forbidden area!
"It's rolling, rolling, rolling up to there."
Itjust happened.
"It's rolling, rolling, rolling up to there."
Itjust happened.
Now you come down and give it to me!
I can't come down!
It's forbidden!
Go.
So I am coming in by myself to pick it up then I will go!
Are you going to come in?
!
It is forbidden.
No way!
Go.
Go.
So I would bowstring to get it.
"It's not forbidden for this rope, is it?"
Where are you from?
Bushehr_
- Where are you going to go?
- Tan
- Where are you going to go?
- Tan
Tangak!
- Where are you going?
- I am just gonna get some water.
It's out of water then
That's it.
There is no water inside it.
Trying to get into shape.
Some other shape other than hot dog or igloo.
I can't think of nothing new.
"You know, there's more than just those two shapes?"
There is?
Let's try this one.
An octagon.
"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah."
Like that Chuck Norris movie?
That ain't Chuck Norris.
And it's not an octagan either.
"Hey, do Octopussy."
Like this here?
That's what I'm talking about.
There you go.
You know what?
I gotta go take a dump.
I don't know.
All these shapes just freakin' hurtin' my kidneys.
Why can't people just like me for me?
"But sadly, no one does."
Not even the president.
"He's a great guy, though."
"If I don't come up with some new shapes,"
I'm gonna lose my damn job.
He says he don't need me.
I be the first to go.
I have an idea.
That will cost you $20 dollars.
What do you want?
Shake:
Get your car washed.
"McQueen's driver arrived in California, but McQueen was missing."
- McQueen was reported missing.
- ... to race an unprecedented...
Sponsor stated they have no idea where he is.
I hope Lightning's OK.
I'd hate to see anything bad happen to him.
"I don't know what's harder to find, McQueen or a chief who'll work with him!"
Lightning McQueen must be found at all costs!
They're all asking the same question:
Where is McQueen?
"Oh, boy."
Where am I?
"- Mornin', sleepin' beauty!"
- Ah!
"Boy, I was wonderin' when you was gonna wake up."
Take whatever you want!
Just don't hurt me!
A parking boot?
Why do I have a parking boot on?
- What's going on here?
Please!
- You're funny.
I like you already.
My name's Mater.
Mater?
"Yeah, like ""tuh-mater,"" but without the ""tuh""."
- What's your name?
- You don't know my name?
Uh...
"No, I know your name."
Is your name Mater too?
What?
"Oh, my gosh, you guys."
The yoga instructor just smiled at me.
He has the cutest... dimples.
Shh.
Ok... he's telling us to shut up.
His smile is just his state of zen.
"Oh, God."
Namaste.
Namaste.
Do you guys really do this all the time?
Yeah.
I have to.
I'm older than you.
I get fatter quicker.
Sorry I'm late.
I just got your message.
You're late.
Hey.
Hi.
What's going on?
You guys look so serious.
I was just telling Dale about my wedding
"Um, Drew still hasn't picked a tux yet."
Or groomsmen for that matter.
"Well, you know we're guys."
We take a little bit longer with that stuff.
Yeah.
"Well, I gotta go."
I have a hair appointment at 2:00 and then a couple jewelry design appointments.
"Oh, that's so fetch."
"Congrats, girl."
"Thanks, girl."
Where does the guy live?
"Why, you gonna go there?"
I think I should.
Don't.
You'll regret it.
"It's just a suspicion, but..."
You know how the villagers have been dying out recently?
He's got something to do with it.
He's not human.
Give me his address.
It's out in the middle of nowhere.
You've gotta have a general idea.
It's hard to explain in words.
It's deep in the valley somewhere.
How much further is it?
Still a ways ahead.
Shit!
What's the matter?
It's there.
Over there.
I don't see a house.
Look.
Right over there.
"Whoa, isn't that a deer?"
"So, you weren't making this up."
"What did I tell you, dammit?"
What in God's name...
What's happening?
Look.
You know...
What's going on?
"That should do it, right?"
It's OK.
I was too drunk to worry about it.
But really.
What were the odds I'd be scooped up by that other removal guy?
I couldn't take a step without being reminded of Johan.
"- So, what's up?"
"- Yeah, what's up?"
"Well, let me think."
Just screw the brain out of me.
"So, you really moved my stuff?"
(cell phone rings)
"Yeah, two hours or something."
I just need to move this piano.
"See you, honey."
Yeah?
Yes...
"Yeah, OK."
- What are you doing?
"- Hey, OK..."
- You're sick.
Sick!
"- Hey, sorry, OK?"
(slow jazz)
"I know this is awkward, but I'm just back from Paris and I..."
I just thought...
Can I come in?
"No, this is a bad idea."
I really feel bad.
"You were so good to me, and I just didn't..."
"I know I've completely screwed up, but if you'll forgive me..."
"Anna, please don't!"
I don't blame you for not daring.
What the-- this isn't the-- you've got to get over here.
"This isn't the-- the camera's looking at us, right?"
This isn't the fucking hospital.
"Aw, shite."
"This-- you know, this isn't the fucking hospital."
Do it like-
- I'm a fucking failure!
I suck!
I suck!
INTERVIEWER:
"Could you do that again for the camera, Lloyd?"
[Laughter]
"Well, I'd say that."
(SLURRING) I fucking suck!
"My movie was a fu-- no, no."
[Laughter]
HEIDI SJURSEN:
I told my mom this morning
That I was gonna be making out with a chick today.
What did she say?
[Laughs] My mom's so cool.
"Like, she didn't flip."
"She was like, really?"
"Like OK, honey, have a good time."
"Yeah, have a good time."
Did everything work out yesterday
With the Sapphic love scene?
No.
"Why, what happened?"
There was a revolution.
The actress did not wish to take her clothes off.
"And, you know, and she did the first scene"
.
-I'll introduce you to my childhood best friend.
-But why will I meet her just now?
"-Because she came from Canada, she just arrived."
-Make sure she's just your best friend okay?
-Yes!
Come on!
What?
"You know, Migs and I have been playing together since we're 2 years old."
"As a matter of fact, he's my first boyfriend!"
How old was I when I answered you?
"-Around 1 6, right?"
-What 1 6?
Around 1 5 and three fourths!
-Come on.
-So you've been a couple.
Yes!
"We're childhood sweethearts, right?"
"I'm sorry, I thought Migs told you."
"No, it's okay!"
I was just surprised because he never mentioned that to me.
Haven't I told you about it?
"You know, why don't you guys tell me how you met?"
Oh!
It's like this.
"We were together in the hospital, she's a nurse there."
There it is!
Hence the uniform!
Then it's okay that you're together!
"Are you okay, Joy?"
.
Are you okay?
"You love it, don't you?"
What?
The thrill of a new case.
I'll see you around.
Don't fall for your target.
What are you watching?
Ooh.
Porn?
"No, it's just something for this case."
Mm.
I'll get it out of you.
Right.
Oh!
You're late.
"Yeah, I had to meet someone first."
Mm-hmm.
"Someone tall, ruggedly handsome, carries a gun?"
Keep your enemies close.
"Yeah, I'll bet you kept him close."
Duly and diligently.
Hey.
I'm glad you guys could make it.
Wouldn't miss it.
Morgan was one of our favorite clients.
Yeah.
"You know, the day we met at his place was the day he died."
"Yeah, we heard that."
"Sorry he had to go through it alone, you know?"
"Oh, he wasn't alone."
"Well, no man is an island."
We are all... connected.
Right.
A camel!
Uh-huh.
Course this isn't really Africa.
It's the French Morocco.
"Well, it's Northern Africa."
Still seems like Las Vegas.
We're just a hundred miles north of the Sahara Desert.
I don't know. ln school they call this the Dark Continent.
This is twice as bright as Indianapolis.
You just wait till we get to Marrakech.
- Marrakech?
Sounds like a drink.
- Mmm. it sure does.
(Chuckles)
"(Horn Honking, Tyres Screeching)"
(Yelling ln Arabic Language)
Wait a minute.
Hold on there.
What's the matter?
(Both Speaking Arabic Language)
"Well, I sure want to thank you."
"Without your help, anything might have happened here."
"My pleasure, monsieur."
There are moments in life when we all need a little help.
Yeah.
Just what was the trouble?
Uh... your little boy accidentally pulled off his wife's veil.
- 0h.
Yeah.
- Hank!
"I want to introduce my wife, Mrs McKenna."
- How do you do?
Don't you?
Or do you just beat them until they do it?
Agreed.
But only until Casa Antigua.
Good.
We march in an hour.
We must hurry.
The French colonel will send the scouts after us at dawn.
How do you know it's a colonel?
Why not a captain?
Or a major?
Unless you watched us yesterday.
Watched us die and did nothing.
I'm sorry.
So am I.
"Now, listen."
I'm in charge here.
"Not them, not Harper."
I'm in command.
You follow me.
"Speak French, Harris?"
"Oui, certainement, je parle..."
That'll do.
I want two boards and some pitch.
"Hagman, I want a lantern, a pound of gunpowder and a pound of old iron."
"Cooper, go on sentry."
"- And, Perkins..."
- Sir?
Dig a proper grave for Captain Murray.
"Yes, sir."
- Out!
- That box on the horse.
No.
But I bet you do.
Mm-hmm.
"I bet you have a big, thick pair of bifocals."
"She doesn't have daddy issues, she has granddaddy issues."
I'm ending it.
"Ted, I beg of you, don't quit on a body that won't quit."
"Ooh, ooh, that'll go sweet on a bumper sticker."
That's going in the journal.
"Wait, did you steal my dream journal?"
No!
"Now, get back in there before all your teeth fall out and you're naked in front of Shaker Heights High School in a play you never rehearsed for."
Bastard!
We don't connect on a single thing.
It's over.
It's not...
"Look, Carly, I got to tell you something."
"I just, I don't see a future here."
"Oh, my God."
Are you dying?
"Oh, that is so hot."
Hey... is that R2-D2?
Do you like Star Wars?
I love Star Wars.
"Me, too!"
♪
"I mean, I've only seen the new ones."
Close enough.
So?
Yeah.
I knew it!
I could feel it.
"- Come in, have a drink."
"- No, thanks."
I'm in a hurry.
You're always in a hurry!
"- Mrs Keka, a letter for you."
- Thank you.
Put it away.
It'll rain in the afternoon.
Thank you.
Mr. American!
Here it is.
From America.
"Good, good."
Do you save those things for me?
Of course I do.
I'll get to you.
"Tesla, turn it off."
What can I tell you?
He gets scared shitless when he hears this.
Pensions are finally safe!
- It really scared me.
"- Go on, have a drink."
"Tesla, I can understand your inventions, your ideas..."
"I support that, but..."
Can you tell me how many pension robberies we had here?
I've got no idea.
Of course you don't.
- Do you want me to tell you?
- Go ahead.
Not one!
Not a single robbery!
Who on earth would attack me here and steal the pensions?
- Good job.
Good job.
"Okay, let's send her for a head CT."
I'll be in Exam 2.
- What's your name?
- What?
What's your name?
- I'm Harper.
This is John.
"- Hi, Molly."
Good.
Other eye.
Yeah.
Your optic discs are perfectly normal.
- Are you sure you have glaucoma?
- My medicine must be working.
- How long have you been lightheaded?
- I wouldn't call it lightheaded.
It's more like I float.
- How long have you been floating?
- About two weeks.
How long have you been smoking marijuana?
About two weeks.
- Having trouble?
- I lost Radiology.
- That's bad.
- No kidding.
- You have a file-recovery disc?
- No.
Let me have a go at it.
"A couple damaged clusters, but everything looks intact."

- Pramod!
"Pramod, come here."
I missed you.
"Oh, I missed you."
- Have you been fine?
"- Yes, everything is very good."
What is this?
You're so tall.
Let me have a look at you.
Let me see.
"Oh no, Pramod."
You're taller than me.
What is this?
And you got new goals and everything.
- Are you happy with that?
- Yes.
- Did you miss me?
- Much.
I want to ask you about something.
"You don't have to answer right away, because I'm staying all week."
"How would you like to come and live with me, in Denmark?"
Should I throw in two wreaths and wait for the Père Lachaise to open?
Coming?
Just a sec.

We can't stay here!
- Do you have money?
- No!
"It's full of memories, this place."
I started when I was thirteen.
I never hurt.
I made supermen out of them.
"Don't worry, my tiptoes are always cold."
The ice queen doesn't want to die.
To sleep... to die... to kill... to make love...
Same battle.
What are you?
- Hatchet man?
Pocket knife?
- Pardon?
Friend of a friend?
Where did Mickey unearth you?
Is the cadaver in your way?
We could...
We could move it across the street if you like.
I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.
"So, how did it go upstairs?"
Fine.
Is that your boyfriend?
"Oh, no, this is my boss."
"This is Adrian Monk, who is a hugely famous detective."
He solves...
"Natalie, who does your hair?"
"Oh, God."
"Well, you take your time."
Okay?
"I'll just be over here at the crime scene, if anybody's interested."
Natalie?
"My mom's in the hospital, and it would mean so much to her if you would take a picture with me."
Please?
- Okay.
Thanks.
Murder!
Or suicide.
Or murder.
It's a tough call.
Yeah.
This is a tough one.
"In many ways, this reminds me of the killer astronaut case"
I solved last year.
You probably read about it.
"Hey, Monk?"
Look at this.
No.
Not as far as I know.
Why?
I don't know.
He's just weird.
He's my brother.
Don't worry.
He's just a half brother.
Then I just half embarrassed myself.
Mr. Pedro Paulo's office.
It's Sharon.
"Sharon, the intern."
"Hello, who is this?"
Since when do you have an intern?
Jealous?
Me?
Jealous?
Are you mad?
I'll be right with you.
Take a seat.
I just called to check something.
I'm filling out a questionnaire in a magazine.
Did you ever make number two in front of me?
What?
Number two.
"You know, in the bathroom."
Poop?
"No, of course not."
I knew it.
Thanks for clearing that up.
Good-bye.
Seven years of marriage... and we never made number two in front of one another.

It was silence however on the next night.

"You notice it immediately, Ágika."
First...we begin it with 5 cardboard.
"- Mariska,come."
"- I'm coming, major lord."
We start it then.
"And now, listen."
"Oh, what you say to him, ...what?"

Danny.
"Oh, my God."
I saw it and I thought of you.
It's beautiful.
"Here, here, here."

I didn't want him dead.
"You must've choked it back into his windpipe, right?"
Yeah.
"Yeah, it was an accident."
"Oh, jeez, we gotta find out who she is."
"If this guy's feeling cornered, all bets are off."
Tonight's his last chance to get revenge on anyone who's ever wronged him.
She's most likely his next target.
[Dialing]
"Garcia, we're gonna send you some photographs."
- What do you want me to do with them?
- Blow up the background.
See if you can find anything that tells us who this girl is.
I'll hit you back.
[Man] Uh-uh.
We're closed.
"No, you're not."
Not to me.
"Boy, what's wrong with you?"
Get out.
Not tonight.
Where is she?
Where's Tracy?
"Kaman, I said... get out."
Can't.

It was my fault Raven got out yesterday.
I was supposed to fix the gate.
It's...
It's fine.
It's no big deal.
You could have been hurt.
And...
I'm...
I'm sorry.
"Pin, if it wasn't for you, I would have never met Raven."
"You'd have met him, one way or another."
Some things are just meant to be.
Don't say anything...
but I know how Raven got out.
"- It was horse thieves, wasn't it?"
- No.
Pin forgot to mend the gate.
Oh.
Kind of boring.
We don't know who's stealing sedatives.
It's horse thieves.
Or who Ghost Pony is.
- Or why Bob's obsessed with the muck heap.
- And she's off.
I guess I'd better head home.
My mom will be worrying.
- But you'll be back tomorrow.
- Will she?
You want a ripe mango?
Come on!
I'm in the mall!
Yes sis.
"Okay, bye!"
How's Joy?
.
Why are you looking for her?
What do you want to hear?
.
That she's okay?
.
And she's not looking for you?
You two have incredibly think faces.
Don't you ever mess with my sister again.
I saw Migs yesterday.
He even asked how you're doing.
What did you say?
.
Of course I nagged him!
Oh my!
He was even with that Bela!
After what he did to you?
.
I can't believe his guts!
"Sis, what I did was right, wasn't it?"
"Sis, is it really like that when you're pregnant?"
You're not just craving for the food.
You're also craving for the place where you want to eat!
My gosh.
"And you know, this place is too far!"
Even taxis can't get here anymore.
You'll find Mrs. Karras in the last bed on the left-hand side.
"No, no."
"No, no."
Go get someone else.
Don't bother the father.
Go to your bed.
Go to your bed.
"No, no."
"No, no."
The father will be back to see you.
It's all right.
Mama.
"It's Dimmy, Mama."
Dimmy.
"Why you did this to me, Dimmy?"
Why?
"Come on, I'm gonna take you out of here, Mama."
I'm gonna take you home.
"I'll get you out of here tonight, Mama."
"Mama, everything's gonna be all right."
"Mama, I'm gonna take you home."
"Mama, I'm gonna take you home."
-Couldn't you have put her someplace else?
-Like what?
Private hospital?
"Who got the money for that, Dimmy?"
You?
There seems to be an alien pubic hair in my drink.
-I beg your pardon?
-Never seen it before in my life.
Have you?
We're pretty comfortable up there compared to the Gemini and Mercury programs.
I simply don't know what to do!
Yeah.
You good in the garden?
I think so.
Yes.
Yes.
Have you thought about...
Carrots?
Right!
I'll get that recorded.
Thank you.
How's it been anyway?
What the scenario didn't make you feel welcome?
He can't see the point in me.
There's a dog in the script.
"We don't even employ Jack Russel to write woof woof, do we?"
Just been readin' your work.
Umm...them could be better.
We should get some lunch.
I don't accept charm.
It's official business.
I've a proposal for you.
"When I'm not busy special advising, I work for a man called Gabriel Baker."
Remember him?
The Hungarian.
He's a producer.
Desperate to me.
A film that will make a difference.

Hello.
Sorry.
Excuse me.
- Bring him in.
- Yes sir!
"I'm so famous, there's bound to be impostors."
I want to see the Commissioner!
Where's he?
Where's he?
He's a mad nutcase!
Does he look like one?
All mad nutcases say someone hit their head!
Someone hit my head!
"The Commissioner, where is he?"
Say something or he'll get mad.
I'm the commissioner.
I'm Hiroshima Tora from Japan.
Ali Baba Toyota wadashiwa Yamaha!
Abracadabra toro sahimi tempura sayonara!
He can't even understand my Japanese.
What?
- O sake teppanyaki yamato desu ka.

What's the name of Hiroshima Tora's father?
"He doesn't even know his pa's name,"
- he's not Hiroshima!
- l am!
- How dare you pose as Hiroshima?
- You...!
I have the Emperor's appointment letter.
Don't try to fool us with a bit of paper!
Emperor's letter...!
"Come on, take him out!"
Take him out!
I'm Hiroshima Tora!
David?

"Look, lady."
"Officially, this case is closed."
That's understood.
The circumstantial evidence points to an inside job.
"The aunt's a nut, but she's clean."
No one else will buy a nine-year-old doing all this.
Hasn't he ever been checked out psychologically?
"They checked him out at social services, but he passes with a clean bill of health."
"Squeaky clean, beyond suspicion."
I need to see those police reports.
( Sighing )
All right.
You got a fax?
"Uh-huh, at the school."
Okay.
In the morning.
"But before breakfast, because it sure as hell ain't rated ""G."""

"Um, I'm-- yes, he is."
Could you hold on?
"Mr. Jenkins, it's for you."

- 'Morning.
I'm expecting a fax.
Nothing yet.
"Okay, thanks."

And you believe?
"It happens, Mr. Gordon."
"When I was a kid, a tenement on our block collapsed."
Buried some people alive.
"From then on, every time I passed that spot,"
I believed I could always hear them moaning and crying for help.
You through there?
Get started upstairs.
"Why don't you go to bed, Stan?"
Why should I?
Because you make me sick to my stomach.
Douglas...
"All right, Stan."
"You've had enough, let's go."
Mr. Gordon will excuse you.
Let's go.
Excuse me?
Do you think I had too much to drink?
"Whoa, wait."
Wait a minute.

I'm trying out my new gun.
Is my third car stolen this year.
I'm a little fed up.
Get it?
We didn't steal it.
We just borrowed it.
"We returned it, didn't we?"
Here it is.
It never even moved.
Tell that to the cops.
Go call them.
"No, wait!"
Why bother the cops?
We didn't hurt anyone.
We just went for a ride.
Just killing time like we were hitch-hiking and you picked us up.
You weren't around.
It isn't ladylike.
I don't want to be ladylike.
"Yes, you do."
"That's why you're joining the Honeybee Scouts, so you can play with normal kids instead of those two animals."
I'm getting cleaned!
I don't want to be a Honeybee Scout.
I like rockets and computers.
So marry an astronaut.
"But for now, go play with those girls down there doing girl stuff."
Dad!
- What're you guys doing?
- Waking up fish.
Cool!
I give up.

It ain't your choice.
I don't need your permission.
- Shit.

Can you move?
And you know what?

"No,I..."
I thought you were gone.
I was gonna make you some breakfast.
Come back to bed.
Come here.
Are you okay?
I'm in bed with the girl of my dreams.
Why wouldn't I be okay?
I'm so glad we talked yesterday.
"I was really overwhelmed and ready to bolt, and you were just so cool and understanding."
I don't want to make the same mistakes I made last time.
You know...

"Multiple cuts and bruises, concussion, possible skull fracture."
She have profile?
Her boyfriend does.
"Colin Blakely, The New Shadow."
"A year ago, he's bussing tables, now he gets 3 mil a picture."
So it fits the pattern of the other eight.
"Victim's high profile, young Hollywood, no forced entry, no prints."
Hmm.
Where was Mr. Blakely?
Clubbing.
Got home at dawn and found her.
They must have known he was out and got surprised by the girlfriend.
That's a big escalation.
Where's The Shadow now?

"You know, it's getting a little stuffy in here."
"You know, I'm gonna go get some air."
"- Oh, no, you don't."
"- Oh, no!"
Not without your umbrella.
Come on!
"Here, let me get that."
Wait for me.
"- He's like this genius, super secretive."
- Okay.
"And apparently, they're working on this new project."
Big money involved.
Groundbreaking.
But nobody knows anything about it.
"Well, maybe if I play my cards right I can get you an exclusive with Shou."
Hmm?
Fo Shou?
Yeah?
You should take a photo.
"Seriously, if you get a photo of anything that they're working on, that's a fuckload more money than four pound signs."
Cool.
"Well, where is this place?"
Mr. Copper.
"Oh, hi."
Um...
Just Cooper.
"Mr. Cooper, I apologize."
Just Cooper is fine.
"Then, in that case, I'm just Katie."
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Follow me.
"- Oh, yeah."
- I'll just get my pack here.
- Rav will take care of that.
"Oh, Rav will take care of that."
"Okay, great."
That's good.
I don't wanna carry it anyway.
Rav kind of reminds me of like an end-of-level boss.

I do not want to kill any innocent.
"This is the Commander Bishop,"
Spartan-7 Humanoid Command.
You are located in the Federation area.
In the death zone 714.
What have you lost here?
Under the authorization code of the Federation Z-4711
A report of the genome documentation.
You have five seconds to meet.
Five  four three two one...!
"The target moves, permission to shoot!"
Permission denied Kix.
We have no idea who he is.
We reached it on foot.
I'm going to take his death.
"Stop the fire, stop the fire, Kix!"
That is an order!
Where is the?
Do we have eye contact?
"Negative, it's gone."
"Damn it, bishop!"
I had it in sight.
Subutai!

Salt!

Commander!
"Commander, are you hurt?"
Where is Subutai?
Subutai!
Subutai!
Here lessor company was here for 6 years.
Computer cleaned.
There is nothing here.
- John?
Did you hear what I say?
- Yes.
TS ...
"Good job, make the brother."
"- Hey, you."
Should not be in bed.
- I could not sleep.
- Do Yorulmadın?
"- No, just can not sleep."
"OK, so how can you explain a story?"
How is this?
- Up the stairs.
"- Up the stairs, okay."
"Once upon a time, once upon ..."
"A long, long time ago ..."
Very distant land ...
But so far ...
There is a little angel sleeping there ...
"I have done for yourself, John."
"Not for me, not for our daughter."
Have you done for yourself.
"Do not lie to yourself, even for a moment."
"- Hi, John."
"- Hey, Rache."
Ah ...
I made lasagna last night.
"Many, many more remained in my hand."
"If you open up, can I bring some of that."
Nice color scheme.
"Here,s another cabinet."
"No, it,s a bidet!"
How practical!
It really is.
"I,II just sit down."
- Not too sturdy.
- Sure it is.
This is great!
Did you see the tub?
Look!
Straight out of hollywood.
"It,s comfortable, with handles and everything."
"CIaudine, Jean-MicheI, please get cleaned up and meet us in the living room."
What kind of decor do you prefer?
I Iike antiques.
"I Iike natural, ecological materials."
"AII we,ve got is modern."
"Here,s one possible layout for the living room."
Do we have to follow it?
"No, do what you Iike."
- Can we keep it?
"It,II give us ideas."
- Sure.
"Ladies and gents, our table"
Now take a peek
And the chairs of plastic
Green is so chic
"Isn,t our hi-fi cool?"
And the TV?
Where does it go?
What could that be?
She wouldn't wear anything that wasn't perfect.
It doesn't matter anymore.
[ Sobs ]
Wait.
Wait.
Wait.
Can I-
"- Can I, uh, drive you home or somethin'?"
"I'm sorry, Mr. Spooner."
I--
I have to get out of here.
[ Sighs ]
No wonder nobody wants to touch me.
"Al, you scared me."
Scared you?
Comin' out of the coffin.
What about me?
You know how I feel about dead people.
I'm a coroner.
Yeah.
"Well, no."
"Actually, you're a mortician."
[ Chuckles ] It's 1 957.
"Uh, you're in Riven Rock, Massachusetts."
And in little towns like this sometimes they appoint the local mortician as the coroner.
This is horrible.
"Hey, I wouldn't mind sitting out this leap either."
"Well, maybe you can."
"I don't think I need you on this one, Al."
What do you mean you don't need me?
I don't need you.
What?
"On my bus, in my bible."
"Thanks for subbing tonight, Eddie."
"My pleasure, coach."
"Eddie, you want to ease up on the pedal there?"
I got it all under control.
What the hell was that?
Everyone okay?
Dirk!
Winchester.
"What are you gonna do, shoot me?"
Don't need to.
"That rope is soaked in salt water, Dirk."
You're not going anywhere.
"All right, everybody stay where you are."
You'll be okay.
Aren't you the P.E. teacher?
Not really.
"I'm like ""21 Jump Street."""
The bus driver sells pot.
Yeah.
It's not here!
Where is it?
No way you'll ever find it.
Where is it?
!
Sam Winchester.
Still a bully.
"You, you jocks."
You popular kids.
you always thought you were better than everybody else.
"And to you, I was just Dirk the jerk, right?"
Now you evil sons of bitches are gonna get what's coming to you.
Good to know.
- Where's Jackson?
- Change of shift.
"Come back for more, have you, tough guy?"
"Oh, you're looking a whole lot worse than I am."
Whatever.
Where are you going?
Tequila and tacos.
You want?
"Come back inside, we need to talk."
- I'm done talking.
- Let's head inside.
"Ah, shit."
Seriously?
Okay.
I get it.
"Jackson's hatchet, man."
Come on.
"Here I am, do it."
"Go back inside the house,"
"I'll grab my service weapon, tell Jackson I made a move on you."
He doesn't have to know.
"I'll take it from here, Agent Briggs."
Let's take a drive.
She's beautiful.
"I envy you, your emotional responses to things, I..."
I train myself out of it.
But there has been a cost.
"Well, maybe you should stop with the daddy routine."
Let people figure it out themselves.
"You're right, Flynn."
I can't fix you.

Do you really think it's a good idea?
Sure.
Why?
"- Why, why?"
"- Yes, why?"
- Why not?
- Why should you?
It'd be good.
We'd be together.
- But we're always arguing.
- That's not true.
Do you really like being with me?
"No, a big shiver!"

- Hold still...
How long have you gone without?
Since I was born!
Where should I start?

Obviously you're not fans.
You're heating on me 'cause I'm supposedly not a fan.

- I've got this.
You can't talk to my friends that way.
- Is that a fact?
- Yeah.
I bet I can pour this beer on your head...

Oh!

She says thanks.
"Uh, look, I got to go."
Bye.
I got to go meet my friends.
My... other... friends.
"I should get back, too, and protect my cover."
"But wait, listen."
"We have to promise not to tell anyone about this place, okay?"
"Now, Ryan's not going to obviously, and I could get grounded, so that leaves Marissa."
I can keep a secret.
See you tomorrow.
"Me, too."
We'll fix this place up.
Cool.
"I'm telling you, Ryan, this plan is foolproof."
"Hey, Ryan!"
"Hey, Ryan, you ready?"
"Okay, the key here is not to panic."
Do you have your supplies?
"Yeah, but there are cops at your house."
"I mean, do you think it's safe?"
I'll handle Johnny Law unless...are you losing your nerve?
Meet me in the driveway.
He couldn't have gotten far.
We'll search the neighborhood.
Seth.
I was going to get you.
We got to talk about Ryan.
Horton died.
"Sorry, colonel."
"-Things fall that way sometimes, Bill."
-Yeah.
Sure he ain't here;
You can look.
I....
"l shouldn't have asked that, colonel."
Good night.
Night.
"Why is Brock frightened, Sarah Beth;"
Doesn't he know Mac can get him off;
"Yes, Papa, he knows that, but he knows he can't get you off."
"The man Brock shot, he called Brock names."
"Not pretty names, either."
They'd sound awful at a trial.
Especially when they're true.
Brock thought-- He wanted to spare you something.
He can't spare me anything.
It seems none of us can spare the others anything.
"You go to bed, Sarah Beth."
I've got to find him.
I've got to get to him before he does something.
I've got to get to him before some sheriff gets him.
"He's a good boy, Sarah Beth."
"Yes, I'm glad we know how good."
"You find him, Papa."
I'll find him.
"Get your Afternoon Star right over-- Here's your change, lady."
Late Afternoon Star.
"Thank you, sir."

That's not actually my line.
Mr. Monk said it first!
I thought that was you.
"It's you, right?"
"Yeah, yes, it is."
- Yeah.
- Natalie Teeger.
"Oh, my god."
I hate to bother you.
Would you mind?
- Really do have to.
- Sure.
- We should... we should head up.
"- Mr. Monk, do you mind?"
- Captain's probably.
- Mr. Monk.
Bend.
Bend a little.
"Bend, please."
Bend.
I never know what to say.
I know what to say.
I write those letters?
Of course I wrote the letters.
My name's on them.
I'm not gonna Deny that.
- Did you bother reading them?
"- Yes, sir, I have."
Then you know I didn't threaten anybody.
I offered the producers and the lottery commissioner some constructive criticism.
I know why they don't listen to me.
I know more about this lottery system than any living American.
- [Doorbell Buzzing]
[Sighs] I'll be right there!
Who is it?
[Danny] Miss Elliot?
Yes?
Miss Karla Elliot?
Yes.
We're having wiring problems in the building.
Do you mind if I come in and check your baseboard outlets?
Are you kidding?
"7:30 at night, and you're gonna take outlet inventory?"
"Oh, well, if you're eating, I..."
I could come back later.
It won't take but a few minutes...
"No, if you're gonna crawl around the floor and count little holes in the wall, come on in and get it over with."
Come on.
Okay.
Who was that?
[Chuckles] I don't know.
He'll be gone in a minute.
There you go.
Thank you.
Do it.
That's good.
Mmm.
Ahh!
[Whispering] I love you.
I have always loved you.
[Ticking]
[Ticking Continues]
Ya haven't got a warrant.
You just want to get me in some kind of trouble.
Really nice name.
Thank you.
- Ozone Overseas.
It's a small company.
Maybe you have heard the name.
Your style of calling a big company small..
..and thus calling yourself big is great.
"You are late, Mr. Bajaj."
Umbrella Creations' conference is over.
It doesn't make any difference.
He is a victim of overconfidence.
He thinks he is going to get Umbrella Creations' order.
"Continue dreaming, Mr. Bajaj."
This time we will get the order.
Okay.
"Anyway, see you."
- Sure.
All the best.
See you.
- Bye.
Let's go.
- Yeah.

Yeah.
I guess it is.
Yeah.
Natalie Teeger.
"Oh, my God."
I hate to bother you.
Would you mind?
We really do have to...
"Oh, sure."
We should head up.
"Mr. Monk, do you mind?"

Mr. Monk?

"I'm sure you do, Mr. O'Dwyer."
What am I gonna do with you?
You need to warn His Holiness.
Casey!
Henry?
"Sweetie, what is it?"
"Angela, is there something you need to tell me?"
I'm sorry.
I've been very selfish lately.
"I haven't really let you in, have I?"
"Henry, if you won't talk to me, if you won't tell me what's troubling you, how am I supposed...?"
You need to confess.

Hello?
St. Anthony.
He was the patron saint of...
Uh...
lost things.
I thought that was St. Jude.
"No, St. Jude is lost causes."
So how can you tell when something stops being lost and starts being a lost cause?
We're going to find Casey.
People don't just disappear.
Well...
"That's the problem, isn't it?"
She was disappearing... before she was ever lost.
Henry's illness...
"I'm trying, Anna."
"Do something about it, Harry."
For all of us.
WOMAN:
Mr and Mrs Clayton?
OK?
WOMAN:
Mr Clayton?
There's someone to see you.
I'm sorry about your daughter.
Is she OK?
Yes.
How did you know?
How long have you been following me?
Awhile.
I haven't got much time to explain.
- It's not safe for me here.
- What?
- Or you.
- What are you talking about?
"I was meant to give it to someone else, and he knows you have it, Harry."
- You're talking about the bracelet?
"- I know you're a good man, which is why I gave it to you instead of him but he'll come after you."
- Who'll come after me?
- The man it was promised to.
What is this?
Whoever wears the bracelet is endowed with immense luck.
"- Well, that's shite."
- (WOMAN LAUGHS)
"You're already starting to feel it, though, aren't you?"
No.
"Wait, wait, wait."
"Hi, Christo."
Manou's resting in her room.
I'll tell her you're here.
Let her rest.
She OK?
Just OK.
Still after that van gang?
Still am.
I hear they hit again.
"Near the beltway, right?"
My only advice is:
"when you bust 'em, shoot first!"
You know anything?
I'm not a snitch.
Ask your questions elsewhere.
Who worked over Manou?
What do you mean?
Leo...
"I'm 46, I spent 1 8 years in jail."
She's the best thing that happened to me.
"Someone hurt her, I gotta know."
"If I tell you, what'll you do?"
That's up to me.
You're in trouble any time you step out of here!
"You're a hood, Christo."
With a record for armed robbery.
"If you smack your neighbor over a trifle, you go back to jail!"
Manou needs you:
"if you go down, so does she."
Screw your cop morality.
"Anyway, it's settled."
I dealt with it.

She said you're a really good person.
She hopes you can find someone better.

- Give him something and send him away.
- Yes.
Come to your senses!
In Hyung!
In Hyung!
"Your Excellency, you're home."
He must have had an event at work.
These events are important to one's career.
The police have been busy all day due to the explosions at the harbor.
"- Father, you're home!"
- In Hyung! &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Father!&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
- Take him to his room.
"- Yes, Sir. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;In Hyung, wake up!&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
Take care of the body.
It was him that night!
Gil Dong...!
Let me go with you.
I didn't tell Yi Nok about him.
I said that it was not my duty to reveal to her what he himself hid.
But that was just an excuse.
"But the truth is that I know that if she sees him, I will lose her."
That's why I couldn't tell her.
I must have fallen asleep.
Did the chief leave already?
I must have dreamt about Gil Dong again.
He was sitting right here.
It's still warm.
"Hey, my son"
"Here you are, sir!"
We are looking for of Bulent Tiryakia!Where do we find him

He is making my daughters shift from place to place.
"He plays cards, has debts every where and has got us a bad name."
Grandmother!
We all know about father.

All these days she supported him.

Shoot!
"C'mon, shoot!...Shoot..."
Shoot!
"Shoot, but know this Nejdet..."
"I would never betray you, lan."
"Ibo, there is no return from here, son!"
"You will never forget that i pointed a gun at you, Lan!"
"And i can't live in fear, Lan."

My Higgs radiation simulation.
Matt:
"The ""God"" particle."
Amy:
It's a particle that we're trying to make in the collider.
Amy:
"I'm supposed to be investigating how it acts on living tissue, but my programme just crashes every single time that it starts to look bad."
Connor:
"So what, you think Higgs radiation is dangerous?"
Amy:
I don't know.
I'd know if I could get it to finish!
Connor:
They wouldn't run the LHC if they thought it was a danger.
Connor:
Must be a glitch or something.
Connor:
Have you tried on the central computer system?
James:
Except... she doesn't have access to the mainframe.
Kate:
Are you not allowed to use it?
Connor:
Well... not exactly.
(Typing on keyboard)
Connor:
There we go.
James:
Nice!
(Alarm sounds)
Matt:
Nice one Amy!
"That's right, I'm crazy."
You must have suffered living with a crazy woman!
Do you think I have nowhere to go?
There are men everywhere.
"Hang up, moron."
"Dammit, it's a mountain."
Man...
I'm at the top.
I guess I have to go down.
Bring me some money.
Why?
I got caught at a motel having an affair.
"By My husband, of course..."
He brought the cops.
The moron got those errands people to follow me.
"They took my bag, too."
I don't even have a damn coin.
Who?
College what?
So what if he's young.
So you're bringing some money or not?
"Listen, bitch, if you weren't gonna come, what's with the twenty questions?"
"Bitch, you said you were jealous of me having an affair, too."
Bitch...
Being a friend means to help out in times of need.
Bye!
Hey could you lend me about 50 dollars?
Me?
"If you have some money, Lend me about 50 bucks."
30!
That's all I've got.
I'll pay you back
There's delay but not denial.
"Just like I came here, to help Kanji bhai."
Help me?
I found out about your condition.. ..only after I brought the house.
"The court case, lost your shop.. ..and your wife and children too."
"Kanji bhai, don't worry."
You can stay here.
"ln return, I will only use your things."
"Television, fridge, etcetera."
"Fine, but remember.. ..one day I will buy this house back from you."
So be it!
"I mean, I promise."
He's a nice man.
- Something you said.
"No, just.."
Cheers.
Calls himself God.
I think he's drunk.
"Thank you, for letting me stay in my own house."
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
I will sleep outside on the terrace.
And you can sleep wherever you want.
It's your house.
Thank you.
Goodnight.
"And yes, the light switch is at the back."
Switch off the lights before you go to sleep.
Another power failure.
No. you switched it off.
"- No, I didn't."
You're drunk.
They were four.Selim...
"Son of the Yaşarans', Selim."
Shut up.Don't mention their names.
They are very powerful people.They'll get out of jail in two days... ... and come back to do you even more harm.You hear me?
They were all at the engagement party.
I've given their punishment.
I've punished them.I'll tell you everything once we're out of here.
Please Fatmagül.Okay sweetie?
- Who is it?- It's me.
- Where have you been?- I'm back.
Making me wait here for hours.Locked in this room.
Kendin geziyorsun tabi maaşallah.
Do you have to brush me downas soon as I'm back?
I was busy with work and stuff.It's not like I'm late on purpose.
You don't carewhat this woman is doing with no money.
I didn't even eat anything.
"- Okay, okay."
"I'll order something now.- You're very generous, thank you."
"Hey, okayI am sorry."
"I said sorry, girl."
"Okay, I've acted like a jackass.I'm sorry."
"Okay, I won't be late next time."
Mukaddes you're prolonging this.
Look at me.
Look.
Smile.
As if I could smile right now...
"Anyway, I shall go wash my face."
"And then we go and eat, okay?"
"- So, did you go to the doctor?- Tsk."
[No]
"I went to the nursery school, to see my son."
"Gil Dong, the soldiers are coming!"
"Run, quickly!"
I told you not to look for me!
There's no time!
"I'll try to divert the soldiers, so you run that way!"
You!
Are you going to die in my stead?
Why would I die?
Do you know how fast I am? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I'm faster than you and faster than arrows!&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
So run away!
How can you be faster than arrows? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Stupid girl.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
I don't hear anything now.
Do you think they're far from here?
I can't see.
Move your hand...!
Who are you?
Do you know me?
Hey!
Hey!
Chungyi ran away!
I know.
She's safe.
But we have a problem.
Why are you running away?
Hey!
That's... that's Doe Eyes!
We can't be seen by her.
We have to go!
Where did he go?
Hey! &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Are you in here?&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
Why did you just leave like that?
Who are you? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Why did you help me?&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
- She wasn't that bad.
- What?
Telling the only cool boy in Eastbourne I have flatulence issues is okay?
I don't think he took any notice.
"And, anyway, he was well into you before your mum came in."
- Do you think so?
- Yeah.
You were great asking him about his band and stuff.
"- And he likes cats, like me."
- Yep.
Did you see the way Tom held onto my hand a little too much
- when he gave me the onions?
- He didn't!
He is so gorgeous!
They're both beyond the Valley of the Gorgeous.
"Oh, are you sure my mum hasn't ruined it?"
"Oh, GG, it was really fab."
- Fabbity fab?
- With knobs on.
And Robbie will understand.
All parents say stupid things.
He'll probably like you more 'cause he'll feel bad you've got a mum that's beyond bonkerdom.
You're right.
"God, Robbie's just so muscley and dreamy and..."
"- Tom said, ""See you later."""
- I know.
So did Robbie.
- What exactly does that mean?
- I'm not sure.
Do you think Tom says that to everyone
"like a sort of ""See you later"" sort of thing?"
No.
HENRY.
"(voice breaks) NO MATTER WHAT YOU THlNK,"

The first thing I wanna do is I wanna hear this class the greatest class to ever graduate the University of Rochester the class of 2012.
Let's hit it!
This is your day to take stock and congratulate yourselves.
"You have successfully completed one of the major steps in life's long journey, and you've done it at one of the outstanding educational institutions in the world."
"Over 50 years ago, I sat before you, the class of 1958."
"Since I've put my 50 years in, it's time for a little bit advice."
Exercise your passion.
Seek out what turns you on.
Find something where you really enjoy what you do every morning.
Wait!
"Hey, hey, hey!"
"Aw, Mike!"
"Michael, we love you."
"Okay, everybody."
That's a wrap.
- Good day.
- Where are we from?
From Galanta.
"My name is Katka Szabová, I'm from Galanta,"
I'm 26 years old.
Are you nervous?
- Of course.
- Can we help you anyhow?
"- Sorry, but you will sing?"
- Me.
"(Ja - German word for ""yes"")"
- Ich verstehe.
"- Also gut dann, na ja."
Do you think you can sing?
"Of course, I also think I can sing."
"All right, we will finish this discussion after the performance."
We should not dig into it any further.
Here you go!
"No art, no skill, just a feeling, but for me it belongs to those who perform or entertain, they can't do much, only create an atmosphere, but here she took too much."
She did not.
- That's the kind of people.
- She did.
"Katka, I want to say, that Paľo pushed this."
I just want the good for you.
Let me ask: would anybody of you pay for this?
We're not here in some singing school.
- How much?
10 rupees.
Bring this bag also.
- I am already carrying two bags.
Why dont you give it to brother-in-law?
He is already carrying the burden of the family.
You bring it.
- I will bring it.
"Have you understood, uncle?"
They say I am not securing marks and you dont have job.
"Sister, where are you going?"
Those brinjals are fresh.
You wait here.
- Is it necessary?
What happened to these people?
Uncle!
- What is it?
Do you like that girl?
"I have told you about a girl, Do you remember?"
She is the girl.
Who?
That train beauty?
Yes.
Will you do a favor to me please?
Take your parents out from here.
"Ok, I will do that."
Will you buy me a chocolate?
I will give you as many as you want.
Mom!
- What happened?
"Mom, the chips which you kept out for drying.. ..will be spoiled in this rain."
"Sister, Why are you still standing here?"
Ah.
"I mean, don't you have an original vampire to worry about?"
"Ah, ah, ah, do ten more of those."
You're going to want to buff up if you start dating this one.
Self defense and all.
What is your problem?
Your doctor vervained me.
And then she bloodjacked me.
What?
"I mean, when did you even see her?"
When I went to the hospital to accuse her of killing her ex-boyfriend.
"Which, by the way, very sensitive subject."
"Damon, what the hell are you doing, huh?"
Why are you mad at me?
I told you I'd handle this!
I proved your theory...
Diagnosed psycho case.
You're welcome.
Why are you doing this?
Stop moving.
"Jamie, let me go."
"Jamie, he needs help."
- Jamie!
- Bonnie!
Bonnie!
What the...
These chains aren't strong enough.
You need to leave.
Run!
So?
She didn't tell me where the coffins are.
The vampire showed up.
"Hey, I'm busy."
Go and let the students practice.
"Oh Ha Ni, teach him well."
Yes.
"Now, Sunbae, you be the girl."
"Okay, girl."
The head is lifted like this.
"""What are you doing to me?"""
"""Try to forget me if you can"""
"You won't be able to forget it, right?"
I won't be able to forget it.
"Wow, this is really great!"
"Yes, I understand the timing now."
But for the kiss... when I watch movies
Do I turn to the left or right.
Or like spiderman...
Do I do it upside down?
The angle?
"No, I think kissing is about timing."
"Ah, kissing is timing."
Timing...
"Ha Ni, you are very good at kissing."
No.
"Truthfully, I don't really know about it."
What are you talking about?
"If you're at this level, you'll be able to publish a book."
Isn't she hard to understand?
"In the tennis club, the girl who follows Baek Seung Jo around."
You heard about that too?
Is that rumor true?
Yes.
There must be a fun rumor going around.
"I beg your pardon, but when is today?"
I don't care about today!
It's boring!
Every day - it is today.
How do we cope with that?
Can it be that one day Time will stop and we will say:
Yesterday is every morning.
Life is awfully boring.
"Life is awfully boring, Yesterday is every morning."
"Let tomorrow come today, It is where we hurry."
"Let the future come our way, - Then we wouldn't worry."
Don't you see that everything around belongs tomorrow?
Don't you feel the future has already come?
"lf the future had come, now it would have been... the New Year!"
The New Year?
The New Year?
Let it be the New Year!
"What, what New Year?"
The New Year doesn't come just like that.
You have to see it in.
Then let's!
"Let's, let's see it in!"
Let's!
"I'd say, why don't we really see it in?"
"It is so pleasant, my friends, to see in the New Year."
Very pleasant.
How?
How?
How shall we see it in?
"To see in the New Year, we need, first of all, a Christmas tree."
"Secondly, Santa Claus."
"And, last but not least, the Snow Maiden."
Some illness it's hard to put your finger on.
It's now every night!
"I know he's not working, I know he's not"
She thinks I'm driving you away.
She's a child!
How do you kill someone with voodoo?
"I put his hair inside the wax coffin, buried it in the graveyard."
That's ridiculous!
You wanna raise the dead?
But you can't kill people with voodoo. sometimes a soldier falls on his own sword.
You speak to my wife again and I will kill you.
Oh my god!
No!
Daddy!
Bad girl
I failed him. no!
"Milk, water, and dates"
"Allah akbar Allah Akbar, I can't hear pass them water"

La verga (look it up in a spanish/english dictionary)
"- Oh, all right!"
You go first.
- Can I invite boys?
"You haven't got some fancy fellow we don't know about, have you?"
No.
"Honestly, Dad."
"No one says ""fella"" any more."
"This isn't the Middle Ages, you know."
Or the '70s as you call it.
"Sorry, Dad."
I must be hormonal.
Can I have a D. J?
Why would we pay for one when we've already got one in the family?
- What?
"- Oh, yes."
No way.
"Oh, I want music from this century, Dad."
"If we hire a club, we'll get a D.J. thrown in."
We are not going to hire a club.
I can get a very good rate at the community hall.
We've thrown some legendary bashes there.
We still know how to get down.
"Hey, wait, missy."
I haven't told you my news.
"Okay, just please stop snogging."
It's not normal.
- I have been offered a promotion.
"- Oh, cool."
Maybe I can get a PDA instead of a mobile now?
"Georgia, where in the world do you find the most geomagnetic thermal activity?"
"- I don't know, Dad."
- New Zealand.
But you have to keep it a secret and return it at the end of the year.
All right.
So now you know.
Good luck.
"- - lf you believe in magic - - - Ooh, magic -"

Yeah.
[ Chuckles ]
"So, you've got this sort of Frank Sinatra thing going on."
[ Chuckles ]
Right.
I feel like I've discovered this whole new side of me.
"I mean, uh, music is so expressive."
[ Chuckles ]
Okay.
Take it.
Separation Agency
Stop sighing at the ground!
Stop sighing at the sky.
I guess she doesn't want to see you.
Really?
Ask her to call me later.
Huh?
He understood.
She likes you a lot.
Don't worry.
"No, it's okay."
I'll eat dinner at home.
By myself.
I'll just go.
See you.
You're not the one who got burned.
Why are you hiding?
Leave me alone.
Why are you being so childish?
How long will you hide there?
I said leave me alone!
"Don't just yell for help, you need to help him first."
At least you can say &amp;amp;quot;l love you.&amp;amp;quot;
You're better off than me.
Su-Eun.
You know why I wanted him to propose to me?
It was all for him.
If he confessed his love and thought about marriage and such.
"Then, he could think about me once more before jumping into the fire and make him a bit more scared of the fire I thought I could change him."
That's how it started but now
I've become sort of fixated on it.

( suspenseful theme playing )
"Is he gonna hurt me, Frank?"
Maybe a little.
"But you're a brave boy, aren't you?"
"Will you stay with me, Frank?"
"Yeah, sure I will."
( dramatic theme playing )
"Yes, yes."
We're at Dr. Garber's office now.
"No, no."
I don't think it's serious.
Probably nothing but a simple sprain.
We'll take an x-ray at the hospital to be sure.
We're going over to the hospital.
Why don't you meet us there?
"I-I know you're busy, but-but this is Saturday."
"All right, then you can just stay there."
It's only his son.
DR. GARBER:
"All right, young man, let's test that ankle."
How does it feel?
Okay.
Fine.
We'll have that arm fixed up in no time.
Would you want me to go with him?
"No, don't bother, Frank."
You can take the car back.
Dr. Garber will drop us off later.
"Then you'll tell me about it when you get home, huh?"
Frank... thank you.
You having trouble?
"I don""t know where the gold is! sardar, you don""t know."
But kaka sir surely knows.
"Am I right, kaka sir?"
"Won""t you serve your country?"
"Mr. Diwan, I can even lay down my life for my country! kaka sir.. where is shekhar?"
"- I don""t know! kaka sir, don""t fool us!"
Where is the culprit?
"I think you don""t know that the government will reward.. ..the person who helps to seize the gold by giving 10% share. kaka sir, constable is right."
We give you 10 minutes to think.
You can think.
We are waiting for you outside.
"Let""s go, Mr. Diwan!"
Listen..
Bhuta singh.. the police is right.
- Then?
This is the golden chance to serve our country.
You are so lucky.
- How?
Go with the police and get shekhar arrested.
And get myself killed! - shut up!
I will give the address.
You can serve your country.
Fine. send Ms. kitty in.
Did you call me?
"No, Ms. kitty."
Your good luck has called you.
- What?
The police are waiting for you outside.
- Police?
The police know that you are hiding here.
"Now I can""t hide you here for long."
There is only one way left for your escape.
So thank you for that.
"We can take one or two questions, but remembering we've got the forum."
Any questions?
We'll save it 'til then.
Great.
"- Esra, I've heard you're replacing Luciel  by taking care of Mrs. van de Berg."
- Yeah.
- I know some of you don't think it's such a good idea  but this is what Sander and I decided.
"I promise you, I won't be in your way."
- Hidde is doing well.
"Corien, thank you for acting  so determinedly."
It was hardly a pleasant situation.
"Let's see, to wrap things up..."
"Oemaima, you're off to see Esmee and her baby."
Please don't start any arguments this time.
- I don't start arguments.
- Oh well great.
Then I'm done nagging.
Get to work everybody.
- Wait.
Wait.

"Take care of other, but mostly of yourself."
- Ah beautiful!

"Even if my child had been a culprit.. ..still I wouldn""t have been lenient."
Thanks.

"And you can call me crazy, but I like to roll the dice"
So I'm willing to bet that I'mma be crazy for the rest of my life
[dramatic music playing]
-(reporter) The carnage continues today as yet another body was found.
This will be the tenth victim of the mysterious Kool-Aid Killer.
"-(announcer) For years, he's waited in the shadows, forgotten."
-There's a madman loose and he's killing people.
-This is his calling card.
-He feels forgotten and he's sending a message by killing everyone that doesn't drink Kool-Aid.
-So he's basically killing everyone above the age of five.
-I hate my life.
[crash!]
-Oh yeah!
-(announcer) This summer... get ready... the rivers are gonna run red.
[crash!]
-Ah!
-Oh yeah!
"[muffled yelling, explosion]"
-Knife to meet ya.
-[muffled noises]
[crash!]
-Oh yeah!
Can I axe you a question?
-Ah!
-Go!
"Go, he's gaining on us!"
Step on it!
[crash!]
"-I'll teach you to make fun of me, Dane Cook."
Heads up!
-Ah!
I sure know that.
I would like to ask you something.
But tell the truth.
The whole truth.
What did you use before this performance?
"Rolls with meat pie,... and green tea."
Some meat pies are good dopes.
"All right, where's the talent?"
She has something strange...
"I don't think you had to use something, you're just that kind of type."
"You have no extreme talent, but you enjoy the singing, and I wanted to see it to the end."
A lot of energy comes out of her!
- Certainly!
"- It's strange, Paľo."
Yes for me!
- Strange.
- I felt good.
Something painful.
Mournful.
The singing grobian here just wants some notes...
Galee mein maarey pherey He walks around in the street
Paas aaney ko merey  to come near me
Kabhee parakhtaa nain merey too checks out my eyes sometimes
Kabhee parakhtaa tore  and sometimes checks out my walk!
"Ambersariyaa, mundyave kachiyaa kaliyaan naa tod  Ambarsariya, boy don't pluck bud"

Bhuta singh!
- Yes!
Do you want to lose your life?
- No!
"lf you spilled out everything, then you will lose your life!"
No!
- Listen!
- Yes!
Patriotism and business are not linked with each other!
Got it? - okay!
Where is shekhar?
"He has gone to Alibagh to meet his wife. shekhar, look at your state."
Why do you wander around like this?
"Why don""t you surrender yourself to the police?"
At least you will feel at peace.
Peace?
"That""s why l have always helped.. ..the police in the name of patriotism. seema.. now what I am doing.. ..l am doing it for peace of my mind."
That day is not far away when you will take my name with pride.
Beware!
That day will never arrive! shoot him!
"lf you want to save the child""s life.. then drop the revolver."
"lf you didn""t come out till I count 5.. ..then we will kill the child!"
1 .. 2.. ..3..
No!
Give me my child!
Leave him!
Leave him!
No!
"I won""t let this happen!"
Did Jamie take care of him?
He did.
But she's not going to talk now.
There's no way.
I tried.
"Well, you should try again."
What did you do to me?
You'll be fine.
But don't try and use spells.
Those herbs I used muted your magic.
Where's Elena?!
"She'll be fine, too."
"Bonnie, listen to me."
I need your help.
I need you to tell me where those coffins are.
Why?
"Because if you don't, that man compelled Jamie to kill himself."
I can't.
This goes beyond you and me.
All you need to do is tell me where they are.
Then we'll have held up our end of the bargain.
"Bonnie, please."
I've almost got it.
Abby hasn't called yet.
"Jamie, please, just let us go."
No!
"Please, don't do anything."
"Look, I don't know why I shot him."
"I don't know why I'm holding this gun, but if you move or do anything,"
I'm going to shoot him again.
"Ok, I won't."
Who gave you that gun?
Quick! we need to make a sign.../get their attention not tath sign/not like that!
"I know, I need to fire the flare gun I was saving here it is"
"-Dad, you hit the plane.  -what? and I didn't even aim!"
"If I aim, I hit. something hit Ludoviquito on the head"
"-is anything wrong?/is anything broken? -no, fortunately (Little Ludovic's) Ludoviquito's head broke its fall"
"- It looks like a radio, no? -well...."
"-ow, ouch. -oh son, not so loud we can't hear a thing. which song can I play for you?"
"-The one by Sepito -No, no."
Ask for help stupid
Do you have the one called 'help stupid'?
"-No, no."
Ask to be rescued!
"No, I don't want to leave."
"Don't get me wrong Federica, but nothing could make me go back to the City Peluche, never ever..."
"-""everyone remember that this weekend is the"
World Cup final between .... and ....
Help!
Help!
Help!
Hello?
Anyone?
SOS?
"-SOS, or whoever."
-Speaking...
I'll put some clothes on.
So you are the Major?
I was the Major.
I guess to some I still am.
"Now, Terry here was my right-hand man back in the glory days."
"That was a long time ago, mate."
Why'd you get out of it?
I was a crazy bastard back then.
Yes I'm
I just want to be a boxer first
I'm so sorry
"Hey, fella."
I think you can help.
Coem with me
How'd you like to go to a movie premiere?
I'm hurt
[Light music]
Here I go out to sea again.
Sunshine fills my head and dreams hang in the air.
Gulls in the sky and in my blue eyes you know it feels unfair.
There's magic everywhere.
Look at me standing here on my own again.
Up straight in sunshine.
No need to run and hide.
"It's a wonderful, wonderful life."
No need to hide and cry.
"It's a wonderful, wonderful life."
The sun's in your eyes.
The heat is in your hair.
They seem to hate you because you're there.
"And I need a friend, oh, I need a friend to make me happy."
Not stand here on my own.
Look at me standing here on my own again.
Up straight in the sunshine.
No need to run and hide.
"It's a wonderful, wonderful life."
No need to run and cry.
"It's a wonderful, wonderful life."
[saxophone]
"I need a friend, oh, I need a friend to make me happy, not so alone."
"In case she's changed her name, you can identify her with the red mole."
There's a huge grudge between us.
"Remember her."""
Are you Shu Baifeng?
Miss Mu.
"I admire your boldness, but you can't address me by my full name."
Don't you have any manners?
I can't disobey my mother.
My mother once said:
"Should I see her enemy Shu Baifeng, ...I must kill her."
Who is your mother?
Qin Hongmian.
Then it's your mess.
Leave us.
Yes.
You too.
What a resemblance!
I should have known... with your personality.
What are you talking about?
Follow me.
How do you know Yi Yang Finger?
That's my father's exclusive style.
That's the master stroke of our Tuan Family.
Hasn't your mother told you?
You stole it from my father.
Don't make up any excuse.
"Call Tuan Yu out, we must put an end to this."
Lady.
You can never marry my son.
You forgot your word.
I want to hear this from him.
He can't see you right now.
She doesn't even get tired and comes very often...
Baek Eun Jo.
How could you talk to your life saver like that??
That's alright.
It seems like you're not getting tested today.
Yes.
"In the end, her motive for coming here is about hyung anyways."
Here you go again.
Seung Jo didn't come yet?
"See, I told you."
It's all about Seung Jo.
If you keep saying that...
He'll be coming soon.
It seems that Ha Ni should come back home.
Again?
You came?
"Baek Seung Jo, even if you talk like that..."
"Seung Jo, now that you know Ha Ni you feel great right?"
"Eun Jo, are you okay? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net"
How is Eun Jo?
We would be in big trouble if Ha Ni wasn't there.
True.
It would have been a disaster without Ha Ni.
Thank you.
"Thank you, Oh Ki Dong."
It's a relief that everything is fine.
How is the building of your house coming along?
Is it doing alright?
"You know, it's a major pain."
It happened because of the earthquake so the insurance won't really pay for it either.
We're still fighting over it right now.
"It'll all go well, I guess."
"What has happened, Kishan?"
What has happened?
"Will he survive, Mr. Shashtri?"
Doctor said the next 24 hours are critical.
No!
"- Child, I'm a manager of this guest house cum temple."
I've witnessed any tough wishes getting fulfilled.
If your love is true... ...Goddess will have to favour you.
This is a true lover's oath to the Goddess... ...until my Kishan regains conscience... ...I'll not wear these bangles.
But my child. how did this happen?
He's a police officer.
Goons killed tow of our men.
And we've no clue about the rest of the four.
Wonder where they would be.
You very well know where Jackie is.
Where's Jackie?
Where's Jackie?
Tell us Jackie's whereabouts and we'll release you.
Tell us.
Tell us where's Jackie?
Radha!
Kishan!
Kishan!
"Goddess heard my prayer, Kishan!"
You are alright.
You are alright.
You are alright.
"At least now drink some water, my child."
"Thank you, Goddess."
"Sir, Jackie's two men are killed."
And four are jailed.
"Still, you couldn't bring my daughter."
Could she have gone there for another reason?
Why do you always think aboutthe worst and ugliest possibilities?
"- Abla, you are being over optimistic.- Come on, please."
Don't we all know Meltem?
What are you talking about Hilmiye...
"Tell me, didn't we know our own kids?"
Nothing surprises me anymore.
- Nothing...- Selim will be devastated if he learns about it.
- Don't tell him anything about it.- Of course we can't say such a thing to him.
Shall we change the music?
"- It's my turn now.- Floor is yours, abi."
"- Good evening, Fatmagül Ilgaz?- She's there."
Thank you.
"Good evening, Fatmagül Ilgaz?"
Give me it.
- From him?- Give me that.
What is it?
"Abla, give it to me."
"""I'll send you my best wishes."
"At exactly 10 p.m."""
"""All together, to many happy years."
"Mustafa."""
"- God damn it, God damn it!- What is it?"
"Hurray, hurray!Dad look!"
It's amazing!
"Kerim Abi, is this your present then?"
Hey stop!Stop!
Fatmagül.
Don't cry.
My birthday has been ruined as well.
Is this how it's gonna be?Will my happiness always be left unfinished?
"Don't let it demoralize you, Fatmagül."
"Look, there's a crime here and the guilty ones will get their punishment."
- And you?
"- I said ""anyone guilty""."
We told everything to a friend of yours.
All right?
"Kerim Bey, what did you do with the money?"
Bought this car?
I'm wasting my breath with you.
You're a waste of time!
"Kerim Bey, please!"
"I'm sorry, Usta."
They are in front of our house as well.
- They are everywhere now.
- But that's a bit over the top.
What did I tell you before?
All I care about is my business.
- I don't want this in front of my shop.
- You're right.
"You're right, but it's not like  I'm calling them to come here."
"What the hell, man?"
- Damn it.
- Kerim...
This won't go on.
It's so troublesome to have you here.
"I promised your dad, but... ..."
I can't continue with you any more.
What did you promise to my dad?
- Don't go and tell the man now.
"- No, I just want to now."
Did my father tell you to give me the job?
I'm sorry...
I have a daughter who is to be married.
We're done.
Great work.
Great work.
"We are B.A.P, great work."
We're finished.
Now I'm going to hurry back and wash up to go to sleep.
I'm not sure if I did well.
But tomorrow will be a better day.
PEACE!
We're done.
See you tomorrow.
Bye bye.
Before we start shooting
I was going to get something cool to drink.
But I ordered some napkins.
- Where is this?
- This is the 21st century.
- There's a soup stain here.
- This is the 'it' item for 21st century.
A boy from 21st century.
Something unbelievable has happened.
Something that should not happen...
We were supposed to film here.
But there's a problem.
So we have to film the next scene first...
So we have to head to the hotel right now.
Let's go to the hotel!
None
"It's huge, there's a pool!"
How many rooms are there?
The water's too hot.
The cost of one night's stay so much.
I can't control it
"My heart is broken,heart  I can't bring my mind together"

Two three!
We are SlSTAR~
I didn't know we had so much fans
A lot of you came
We are back with our  2nd regular album after a year
You know that we don't have any ballad songs
There is one ballad song  in this album
We have an amazing  song
For that song...
She wrote the lyrics  of that song
We have that song.
Which one is it?
Correct answer
I cannot stand it any more.
I will marry you tomorrow itself.
Why do you look like that?
I am giving you time only till the marriage hour.
You must change not only your mind ...
That will never happen.
- It will happen.
Never.
Cant you hear?
Dont you know the fate of Ravana who kidnapped Sita?
Open your eyes atleast now.
Hey Ravana!
Get ready for the war.
Change the story.
Are you Rama?
Take the nuptials from Sitas neck and give them to Ravana.
He will tie them.
Are you mad?
Why will Rama remove Sitaa nuptials.
"Hey, remove the nuptials."
"- Sir, it is a sacrilege."
It is a sin.
Did you see this?
The power went off.
This is a bad omen.
What nonsense?
Inquire what happened.
Maybe lord Rama has come.
"Hey you, come here."
Did you check everything?
Yes we checked all the fuses.
Now check the transformer.
"Wow, it is cold."
I heard it's supposed to be really hot here.
I always envisioned this place with the sun shining all the time...
- It rained today.
- Cool.
None
- Let's go over there.
- There's nothing here.
"Board shop, board shop!"
I like this.
None
None
You know Dropkick Murphys?
Dropkick Murphys!
My ideal girl looks good simply in a white top and blue jeans.
This is the perfect size.
I only bought one pair of shoes.
I'm picking out clothes now.
"I have to buy a board, a board."
All done.
Zelo is very excited right now.
Zelo!
Don't I look silly?
Can I see how I look?
My hair got short all of a sudden.
"For this album, I was going for a different look"
"With an American feel, in general."
So I cut my hair real short for a unique styling.
"lf I don't style this hair and go out,"
Then I look kind of foolish.
I've always tried to cover my ugly face with hair.
So I grew my hair out but now I can't even do that.
- So?
I didn't realise whether it was a cow or a bull.
Why?
Was the bull wearing pants that you couldn't find out?
You fool.
Go and get betel leaf for me.
I am in the mood for betel leaf today.
"Father, money?"
I gave you 10 rupees in the morning.
I.. lent it.. to friend?
On what interest rate?
- One..
One percent.
None.
If you don't get the money in 24 hours.. ..then I will recover the money by selling you off?
"But father, who will purchase me?"
Quiet.
Get out.
You fool.
Who are you?
10 rupees.
And 50 paise interest.
But how can I take this?
I can't accept this?
- Keep it.
Everything I own belongs to you as well as me.
"No, no, no, no, no.."
"You shouldn't touch my feet, da.."
Kishen.
I suggest you accompany me to my restaurant.
I will treat you to a cup of tea.
Or let's go to my place.
"Well, again, Tilda Swinton."
Thank you so much for doing this.
It's really a treat.
"We'll get into your career in a moment, but first I'd just"
like to ask you about the name Tilda.
It's Pretty unusual.
How did your parents choose that name?
TlLDA SWlNTON:
"It's a funny story, really."
Most people do think it is short for Mathilda.
"Actually, it is, it is long for Ilda."
JULlE KLAUSNER:
"Oh, that's counter intuitive."
So your parents just named you Ilda?
TlLDA SWlNTON:
"No, no."
I chose it for myself on my second solstice.
Mommy and poppy never gave me a name.
"Not that they didn't love me, but woodland cattle can't speak."
Most people know this.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
OK.
"So tell me, Tilda, when did you know that you wanted to be an actress?"
TlLDA SWlNTON:
I am not an actress.
That's a pretend name for a job that does not exist.
I am a gardener of art.
I grow it.
I pluck it.
I eat it.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
Then let's set aside acting for a moment.
I'll be 'the last but not least Snow Maiden'!
"And I will, I beg your pardon, be Santa."
Then that makes me the Christmas tree.
That's right!
"And we will decorate you, and dance the round dance around you."
"What will we dance, I beg your pardon?"
Ooh!
The round dance.
"The boa's home is Africa, ln Africa he lives, -"
"So cute, and slim, and ever-green, Just like the summer leaves."
Why - green?
Because I'm a Christmas tree.
You won't make a Christmas tree.
And why is that?
Why won't he?
A Christmas tree is prickly.
And he is soft.
A Christmas tree has to have needles.
Ha!
We can stick needles into him.
"Oh no, don't stick needles into me!"
The parrot is right:
I won't make a Christmas tree.
Then we don't have a Christmas tree?
But we have the Snow Maiden and Santa Claus.
We don't have Santa Claus either.
Santa is cold.
"And the elephant - there, feel him - he is warm."
We'll freeze him!
There!
No!
Please don't freeze me!
You cannot claim insurance in such cases.
Because these are natural calamities.
But I don't believe in God.
Tell him.
I don't care if you do or don't.
You're signatures are right here.
I am so sorry.
Sorry?
What sorry?
Sir.
"Sir, I've invested my entire earnings in the shop."
Even my house is mortgaged.
And you're saying sorry.
"I know, but your claim cannot be approved."
You may go now.
"No, sir."
I won't leave until my claim isn't approved.
Security.
Sir..
"Sir, why are you calling security?"
I'm talking to you decently.
"- Yes, sir."
"Take him away, please."
- Why call the security..
Come on.
- Just a minute.
Just a minute.
Come on.
You just know how to swindle our money.
Mind your language.
You should be publicly beaten.
Throw him out.
Even if just for me.
Imagine it wasn't him.
He tried to find out the truth but ran out of time.
"Now he wants me to do something, Malena."
"Pablo, that doesn't make sense."
Know what really doesn't make sense?
Trying to save a dead person's life.
You know what?
They had been locked up for 4 months.
And tortured.
But they managed to escape.
They picked up the girl and ran.
They tried to start a new life.
But that son-of-a-bitch... found them again.
He went after them and killed them.
"Pablo, are you okay?"
"No, I'm not okay."
What did you expect?
How could anyone do something like that?
You know what really gets me?
I don't know anything about them... about what they did before.
"I'd like to know who they were, Malena."
Time's up.
"I'll take the ferry back tomorrow and meet you, okay?"
"Pablo, be careful."
"Stay here, okay?"
Mommy.
Where's my mommy?
It's okay.
Your mommy's okay.
Stay here.
Don't move.
This is the improved version of flamingo.
If you insert money here...
-How is it?
Do you want a glass?
-I'm all right.
I got rid of three lions today.
"Wow, I caught a leopard and two hippos."
"Everything you need for safari, from guns to clothes, you can borrow here."
There are different classes; Class A gets a jeep and two assistant robots.
"Class B only gets a jeep, and Class C gets one assistant robot."
This is just beyond my imagination.
"Thank you for inviting, but I'm leaving now."
"Wait, I called you because I wanted to ask you a favor."
Please come here.
Hey!
Wait!
Where are you going?
I see.
He thinks I'm his mom.
Watch out!
"One, two, three."
This was a robot as well.
Hey!
Come out now.
It's not scary anymore.
"Look, bad snakes are..."
Hold on!
I can't leave you alone since it's so dangerous around here.
"We robots are also friends with animals, as well as with humans."
All right.
"Since it's hard to call you, I'm going to name you Pura."
Pura.
"Okay, I'll get the ham rolls."
But do me a favour.
Don't get up to mischief.
When have we ever got up to mischief?
"Okay, Rex."
See the sun?
"The first one there gets two ham rolls, okay?"
Thank you.
Shall I call a doctor?
No.
I'm all right.
I have to ask you to tell me what happened.
I went to his office to take him some papers.
He locked the door and pounced on me.
He put his hands down the front of my dress.
Then he tried to tear off my clothes.
I was so scared I couldn't even scream.
He must have been drinking again.
I have heard that Mr Fuchs has a drinking problem.
What happened after that?
He grabbed me and I finally managed to scream.
"When I heard Ricarda, I went into his office and saw he'd got hold of her."
I'm going to the police to report him.
Calm down.
We'll deal with this.
- Are you going to ignore it?
- Don't worry.
This will have consequences for Mr Fuchs.
I'll speak to him.
"Ms Limmer, how could you do this to me?"
"Ms Bosch, please..."
"Mr Fuchs, please."
Leave no one behind.
All of us.
Do you feel better now?
Did I seem like I wasn't good before?
Did something happen with you and Madam Noh?
You looked so fierce just now when you were talking about her!
I've never seen you like that.
You looked like a stranger!
Something became very precious to me without me realizing it.
But I thought I had lost it.
So did you lose it?
No.
"Fortunately, I didn't lose it."
That's good.
Then you should reconcile with Madam Noh.
You said she was like a mother to you.
"In my opinion, she cares very much for you."
Yes.
I should go.
You should go now.
I should keep my promise.
"Oh, your name!"
What's your name?
My name is Chang Hui.
Chang Hui?
You can't say it out loud.
You can't say it in front of anyone.
And you can't call me in public.
Can you promise me this?
Then why did you tell me?
Because I wanted you to know what it was.
If I know that you know my name... ...
You're really smart?
Are all those people with you well?
Of course!
I didn't even get a chance to greet them properly.
"Yes, we were preoccupied too because of Gil Dong...!"
Damn it!
I know Gil Dong is dead.
"Yes, we heard the news too."
- Were you alright when you heard?
- Of course.
The living must keep on living.
"That's good, Doe Eyes."
You've forgotten him already.
What are you doing?
Still peddling medicine?
"No, my grandfather sells the medicine."
I work for Yongmun.
Yongmun?
"I'm really close to the Young Master, and somehow I ended up working for them."
"By Young Master, you mean that fellow that is slightly better-looking than me?"
"That's right, the good-looking Young Master."
He must be really nice to you.
"I'm not that dumb, you know."
But I think the Young Master is in love with me.
He must have bought her another chamber pot.
"The other day, he embraced me!"
- So how did you feel?
- Me?
I...
I just...
Why are you asking me that?
Just drink.
"1128 01:35:51,860 --&amp;gt; 01:35:53,971 I'm not everyone, Ender."
"1129 01:35:54,100 --&amp;gt; 01:35:58,500 I'm your husband."
"1130 01:35:58,600 --&amp;gt; 01:36:01,800 You shouldn't hide it from me."
"1131 01:36:03,834 --&amp;gt; 01:36:08,559 Are you aware in which state did you put, to protect Faruk."
"1132 01:36:08,600 --&amp;gt; 01:36:12,800 Calm down, please. -..."
You didn't even deign to tell me
"1133 01:36:13,882 --&amp;gt; 01:36:17,550 Please!"
"1134 01:36:18,754 --&amp;gt; 01:36:21,352 My wife and I are talking privately."
"1135 01:36:22,273 --&amp;gt; 01:36:24,230 Of course."
"1136 01:36:41,111 --&amp;gt; 01:36:43,989 - Did you see my mom?"
- Today it's my day.
"1137 01:36:44,054 --&amp;gt; 01:36:46,362 Can you imagine?"
Eylül kissed me.
"1138 01:36:47,300 --&amp;gt; 01:36:50,400 - Mert, where are you?"
- I'm coming.
"1139 01:36:50,600 --&amp;gt; 01:36:54,600 I don't care about the name, She wants me."
"1140 01:36:59,755 --&amp;gt; 01:37:01,808 Mom?!"
"1141 01:37:05,400 --&amp;gt; 01:37:10,400 ~Neither the wedding attaches us nor the court separates us ~ 1142 01:37:10,674 --&amp;gt; 01:37:14,995 ~God protects us from the evil enemies ~&amp;gt;"
"1143 01:37:15,384 --&amp;gt; 01:37:19,493 ~They say without wedding, let them say ~"
"1149 01:37:53,154 --&amp;gt; 01:37:55,322 Come on.. 1150 01:37:55,553 --&amp;gt; 01:37:58,936 Where are you bringing your mom, Yaman?"
"1151 01:37:59,300 --&amp;gt; 01:38:02,000 Hold tight."
"- Yaman 1152 01:38:02,400 --&amp;gt; 01:38:04,500 Don't be annoyed with me..."
"1153 01:38:06,956 --&amp;gt; 01:38:08,996 Come on guys..."
Lets continue to have fun.
"1154 01:38:09,600 --&amp;gt; 01:38:13,100 ~...You're the man... ~"
"1155 01:38:16,000 --&amp;gt; 01:38:21,000 ~ Why do we keep fighting all the time~"
"1156 01:38:22,247 --&amp;gt; 01:38:23,715 My bag !... 1157 01:38:24,349 --&amp;gt; 01:38:26,237 ..."
This is your creation!
"1158 01:38:29,251 --&amp;gt; 01:38:36,177 ~ ~ Why can't we break up in a humanly and friendly way ~ ~ 1159 01:38:36,727 --&amp;gt; 01:38:42,347 ~ ~ There's respect to all those years that we lived through ~ ~ 1160 01:38:42,434 --&amp;gt; 01:38:44,433 Mira, enough.. 1161 01:38:44,587 --&amp;gt; 01:38:49,505 ~ ~ If every day is a torture, if every day is this mess~ ~ 1162 01:38:49,869 --&amp;gt; 01:38:52,311 Mira, stop it!"

"1170 01:40:24,730 --&amp;gt; 01:40:27,786 Are you already sleeping ?"
James:
"I thought there was an exit, back at the dead end."
"Next one's about a three hour walk away, it's at point 17."
And that's if we don't get lost.
Connor:
Is there anywhere safe we can stop on the way?
Amy:
We need to let someone know we're down here!
James:
There's a mainframe computer room about half way round.
We can send a message from there.
Amy:
Ok.
(Electrical flickering)
Connor:
Which way now?
James:
We have to go that way.
(Flickering lights)
"(Low machine noises, heartbeats and breathing)"
(Sound of tearing meat and chewing)
(Monster screeches) (Sound of rapid heartbeat)
(Monster screeches)
(James screams)
(James screams in anger)
(Monster gurgles and scratches on floor)
Matt:
Jesus...
What does it take to kill one of these things?!
Amy:
They're people Matt!
Matt:
See?
"It feels like someone else is touching them, not your own hands, right?"
- Wow.
Freakilicious.
"- Oh, I could get used to this."
I don't think we should be doing this.
It's kind of lesbiany.
"Well, you asked me what it was like to be felt up."
"So, what's the best thing about having a boyfriend then?"
It just feels really natural.
"You know, really grown up."
And the snogging is wicked.
Sven uses varying pressure.
That's what foreign boys do.
My parents snog occasionally.
Even at their age.
Cringey.
Seeing old people over the age of 30 snogging is just horrific.
"Of all of the boys I've ever snogged, Sven is definitely the best."
'Cause he's emotional.
Where have you got to on the snogging scale?
What?
Jas and I invented a snogging scale.
The Ten Stages of Snogging.
- You're mad.
- No.
It's scientific.
- How would you know anything about it?
- Please.
- Who got 82% in Bio?
- True.
We cut out all the letters about kissing from the problem pages of every girls' magazine.
You?
"- Yes, son."
You are very bold!
You looks so scared as if I'm kidnapping you.
Unmannerly girl!
Just now you said I'm a spring of the garden.
Shut up!
Santo!
Raghu!
Where have they gone?
"Don't worry, Mr. Shreekant."
We've informed all the police forces across the state and Goa.
Yes.
And we're looking for them.
"If possible, connect me to the IGs of Gujarat and Karnataka, too."
"Okay, sir."
I'll talk to them now.
Thank you.
What happened?
What happened?
I'm missing my parents.
I saw a nightmare.
Nightmares are to be forgotten once you open your eyes.
Why to trust them?
Father is so careless about me.
He didn't care to know where I am and in what condition.
But we keep him informed.
Why do you take tension?
All the police officers are same.
You've got no heart but a stone.
How do you know what living means... without parents?
You'd never feel that.
I had a chance to be somebody else.
"To be Abby Wilson, the woman..."
"Not Abby Bennett, the witch."
"I'm not proud of what I did, Bonnie."
I ran.
I know I ran.
"But you had your dad and your grams, and, ok, let's face it..."
Your grams is way better at this stuff than I am.
You don't know?
What?
Oh.
How?
We were doing a rough spell...
And we both exhausted ourselves.
Her more than me.
"Well, she raised you right."
I'm sure she was very proud of you.
"Well, now you know my whole story."
Yep.
How about you tell me yours?
What brings you to me?
"It was a dream, actually."
I thought you were supposed to help us.
"But if you don't have any magic, it's..."
"Well, no spells, no."
But I'm not completely useless.
"I mean, the earth still provides herbs and such."
There might be something I can do.
I...Don't think so.
"Bonnie, please."
Let me help you.
"So what, you'd think I wouldn't find out?"
-What's happenin' guys?
Yo!
Do people still say yo?
Can I say yo?
"Well, I'm sayin' it."
Yo!
Dawg!
Check out this awesome attempt at this assisted backflip.
"-One, two, three... [groaning]"
-Fayul!
That's my new thing.
Fayul!
That's not my new thing.
But this attempted flip was a fail.
"Now, the original video was relatively hidden, but I guess the guy submitted it to FailBlog and now it has over a million views."
But most of the comedy comes from the poor dude here who gets kicked in the head and then busts his face on the fire extinguisher.
[crash!]
Did you hear that sound?
It sounded like a f--king car wreck.
[laughter]
And then you got the friend over here who literally ROFLs.
"That ROFL would make an amazing GlF, wouldn't it?"
"-Rahahaha, rahahaha..."
"-All right, that's it."
I'm done with that video.
Yo.
"Sometimes, you know, your friend gets herself stuck in the dryer."
"And it's cool, you know, it happens to the best of us."
-Whoo!
"-Come on, get out!"
-I can't!
[laughter]
(laughs)
"I'll get you, Patman!"
Principal Cooper.
"Egbert, stop that horseplay and get to class."
Can I quote you on that?
"Thank you, Mr. Superintendent."
"Elizabeth, you're here late."
Just doing some fact-checking for my audition tape.
"Well, I know you'll do a great job."
"You asked for it, Patman."
(hissing)
"(Manny) Hey, Bruce, wait up."
Want to get something to eat?
(Bruce) Great idea.
"So, why do you want to get involved with this Oracle show, anyway?"
"I want to do the editorials, share my opinions."
I feel like owe it to these simpletons to tell them how to think.
"Hey, you're the man."
Of course.
What about the audition tape?
Done deal.
Made a call.
I'm bringing in the best director money can buy.
(coughs)
"Good morning, Sweet Valley High."
"Today's top story... 3, 2..."
*♪ I've got some news for you*
*♪ I am the one you need...*
Missing school fund discovered.
After a recent probe into the school department's budget...
Go again.
"OK, take 14! *♪ I've got the perfect story* missing $5,000 fund..."
My father asked me to protect the plants.
My fathers will surely kill me.
There's no need for that.
Because there's something going to happen to you.. ..after which you will die of shame.
What did you say about us on the phone?
Ghost.
Witch.
Today we'll make your plight such that.. ..you won't be able to face the entire neighbourhood.
What do you mean?
I mean..
Kundan.
We mean.. that day we pulled your father's loincloth.. ..and today its your turn.
"No, Kundan."
"Kundan, I would be left with no clothes."
It's okay.
"- Mala, please tell them."
"Kundan, be careful."
Kitchen Kumar is very delicate.
Kishen.
Give me this cloth.
No!
"Mala,"
Where are my roses?
Where are my roses?
The roses were drying.
So I made a paste out of them.
Where's the paste?
I..
I.. it was mother's anniversary.. ..so I fed the paste to mother..
"No, to the bull."
If it was mother's anniversary.. ..then you should've fed the paste to the cow or the bull?
The cow.
Don't wait here then go mind your business.
Don't worry this much about me.
"- Is where you will go, a near place?"
- No.
It's not like Kuzey will reply to your letter right away.
"I'll leave you alone, but it's best if I go now."
It is best.
You could wait.
How are you gonna go from here?
"It's okay, I saw a taxi stand near here."
Want me to walk there with you?
"Okay, as you wish."
- Goodbye.
- Bye bye.
Annoying.
"Sorry, for making you having to put up with this."
It's clear enough for me.
You don't have to explain anything.
"If I tried to explain it would take ages, anyway."
I have no hurry.
I will get to know you guys slowly.
- My son!
- Don't leave your seat.
- Hoşgeldiniz.
"- Hoşbulduk, my son."
"The air is damp, it could rain any minute."
"- You won't start will you, mom."
"- No, son."
I won't cry this time.
- How are you?
"- Fine, thanks to God."
How are you guys?
You think I killed my ex-boyfriend?
I think psychopaths are incredibly high-maintenance.
"If you care about your friend, go figure out how Alaric came into the icu on his deathbed and walked out an hour later without a scratch."
Fair enough.
I can't.
I can't.
Try harder.
Can't he just rest for one second?!
"We're doing this my way, Caroline."
"If you can't handle it, you should go."
"He's right, Caroline."
Just go.
No!
Tyler!
"Go, Caroline."
What are you doing?
"What the hell, man?"
Does it bother you?
Knock it off!
Good.
Get angry.
It's in you.
You know it is.
I said knock it off!
Your bond to Klaus is putting my daughter in danger.
"Now either you turn or I kill you right here, right now."
"You've grown into such a beautiful young woman, Bonnie."
"Please, just stop with the muffins and the compliments."
I just want to know the truth...
Why didn't you come home?
I had no magic.
"I was in a new city, and I realized"
I'm not negotiating.
And you understand that holding them indefinitely is the same thing as dropping them in the ocean?
"No, no, you leave Mystic Falls and then give me a call in a few years, and...We'll talk."
I'm going to give you another chance.
Just one more.
Let's make a reasonable deal.
Or what?
"You make one move, and I will..."
"Yes, that's right."
Crazy Stefan.
Mmm.
How's that working out for you?
Any friends left?
I just can't believe I'm actually going to see her.
Or meet her.
Sort of.
Since I don't really remember her.
You don't really talk about her.
What's to say?
"She left, never wrote, never called."
Not even when my grams died.
Can we talk about you and Damon instead?
I'm not talking about it.
He kissed me.
It's not going to happen again.
I mean...
Was it good?
It doesn't matter.
That means it was.
It's Stefan.
I told him I'd call him as soon as I got the address.
Ignore.
You want to ruin our country by selling the gold to the enemy!
"No, kaka sir! sher khan will lay down his life for his country!"
"But he won""t let this happen!"
Take the reward for your patriotism!
"John, Basheer will be at the port with the truck!"
Go and check! kaka sir!
- Yes!
We had already given the instructions.
That he should be at Aaram port with the truck!
"Pinto, you will remain a fool."
"You won""t understand anything. come on! come with me! oh God!"
"Pinto.. its not good to interfere. kaka sir, what are you talking about?"
Fool!
This gold is worth crores.
And John is no longer required.
Just think.
"You risked your life, you locked horns with Tiger singh.. ..and did this great job."
And John should get his share for doing nothing?
Now think.
"What is the need of John? oh! kaka sir, now I understood."
"We don""t need him!"
- Yes!
Tiger singh!
You are alive!
Good!
Good that you have come!
That Pinto shot John!
You are intelligent!
Use your brains!
Take advantage of this golden chance.
Become rich.
Let this launch go.
Reşat Bey has been waiting for you.
- Hello.
- Hello Turaner Bey.
"Believe me, I am terribly sorry."
We're facing a very ugly slander.
"But, we won't let it go any further."
- We took our precautions.
"- It's too late, Reşat Bey."
It will be front pages of every big newspaper in the early edition.
[Song:
Kimseye Etmem Şikayet Singer:
Şevval Sam]
Oh God!
"Is he OK, Fevzi?"
Is he wounded?
Call an ambulance.
Quick!
"OK, I am on it."
For the love of God.
Don't talk reproachfully to me.
Please.
- Do you know how bad I feel?
"- I can imagine, my dear."
But you didn't call me once today.
"You make me feel lonely, when I need to hear your voice the most."
"Don't talk as if you don't know what I've been doing, and how busy I am."
I'm working to clean up those idiots mess.
"And now we have the girl's fiancé deal with, too."
I weaved between the town and the prosecution office all day.
I didn't have time to blink an eye.
It won't be easy to cover this up.
I am so scared.
Do you think Selim could do such a thing?
- Can't we take a look at that newspaper?
- It's on its way.
What's wrong Perihan Hanım?
What do your in-laws want this early in the morning?
Hello?
My love?
What's the matter?
They say it's Reşat Yaşaran's son.
Who?
Give me a name and I'll strangle him!
They told me last night.
And it's on the newspaper this morning.
"Tell me who said that, and I'll sue that bastard."
"It's on the local newspaper, Münir."
Turaner Bey has just called me.
The news reached even him.
"Yeah, I know."
The girls fiancé has already told me.
- What?
"- He's here, he's gone crazy."
I'm trying to explain it to him.
- Damn it...
- But I'll find that man and make him pay for it.
- God damn it!
- I'm going to the prosecutor right away.
"Yes, of course."
Going to the prosecutor.
Don't get the prosecutor involved.
Don't get us deeper down.
"Don't you worry, I'll take care of it."
"Call you later, uncle."
Wait !
[ Groans ]
"Well, safer than a tube sock."
[ Sighs ]
"- Okay, that-- That was good."
- Yeah.
- See you at dinner.
"- Uh, yeah."
I'll see you at dinner.
"So, Finch, this is your plan ?"
"You know, I don't think girls are into the whole mini-golf thing."
"Kevin, I'm sure that they're not."
"Actually, there is one small matter that I need to ask for your cooperation in."
"- In the spirit of this whole pact, you know ?"
"- Sure, what do you need ?"
"Whatever you hear about me, you agree."
And tell all the boys the same thing.
"Look, I gotta go."
Sixteen minutes round-trip.
"You know, Finch, it's-- it's senior year."
"I mean, don't you think it's time you learned how to take a dump at school ?"
When was the last time you looked at the facilities in this school ?
[ Murmuring ]
- [ Grunts ]
- Excuse me.
"Uh, that's Paul Finch, right ?"
- Yeah.
"- Well, you've seen him in the locker room, right ?"
"- Uh, yeah."
"- So, my friends, they want to know."
Is it true ?
"You know, that he's... equipped."
Go to him.
Shailu!
You are still wasting time here?
Venkat is leaving the city.
- My God!
You are bleeding!
Were already in a lot of trouble.
"- What happened to you, dad?"
"This is nothing, baby."
He was very angry.
Leave that matter.
Venkat is leaving the city.
Go and stop him.
I tried to convince him to change his decision.
But he was very angry.
His anger was increasing every minute.
As a last effort I fell at his feet.
With out respecting my age he kicked me.
I hurt myself by falling on a stone.
I dont care if my body is hurt.
It will be cured in a few days.
But he hurt my heart.
He threw this ring to the ground.
Any way he is a man.
But we have to bare it.
If you go and fell at his sisters feet..
Not necessary.
"Listen to me, baby."
I am saying it is not necessary.
I dont want.. .. to fall at the feet of a person who rejected me.
"If he wants me, he will come to me."
He had a dispute with Bhadram in the past.
This is my first visit ever to the city.
-Really?
"-Yes, I swear to God."
But my son is living here in the city.
He is married to a lady from a very wealthy family... ...and he has an amazing child.
"Wait, I will show you his picture."
His name is Hamada.
See how cute he is?
How old is he?
A year and 6 months.
God wills.
He is cute like his grandmother.
This was in the past.
"You know, I have never seen him."
And he also gave me a hard time... ...till he gave me a picture of him.
When he come to visit me I asked him... ...why didn't you bring your son and wife?
He answer travelling makes my wife tired.
"Here I am, a very old lady... ...but people helped me to catch the train and come... ...and my son waited for me in the station."
But there is nothing we can say.
It's noday's lady's.
"By the way, what's your name?"
-Abdallah.
-God bless you.
You look handsome and have a good taste.
Thank you.
"Look, I will show you something... ...and tell me your opinion honestly."
Show me.
I got it for my daughter-in-law... ...and I am afraid that she don't like it.
"But tell me honestly, don't lie at me."
So beautiful.
Seriously.
"Yes, I swear it is beautiful."
You're not tougher than a Boy Scout.
You have to go home.
Lee:
"Thank you, gentlemen."
I appreciate it.
I'm heartbroken... right now.
"Keegan ""Yeti:"" You did great."
Lee:
My wife gave me one bit of advice before she left.
"It was, ""Keep your head."
Don't freak out.
"Keep your head and you'll win."""
I kept my head for two days.
"The last challenge, I failed myself by not thinking all the way through."
I just feel like I let my kids and everybody down.
"Michael ""Hitch:"" Lee owned up to his mistake."
"If I was his kid, I'd be proud of him."
Lee:
Phew.
"Hey, Paul."
"Good luck, man."
Paul:
"Thanks, Lee."
So I'm the last man standing.
That feels pretty good.
"And I'm, I'm ready."
I'm ready for the next stage.
NARRATOR:
"Scouts, welcome to the final challenge."
"Paul, you're going head-to-head against Will, Rob, and Rio... ...in one final challenge that consists of three different events."
"We're incorporating Scouting skills that require concentration, endurance, and your smarts."
"This is the Toyota ""Iron Scout"" Challenge."
I'll take a shower and go out.
"Okay, as you wish."
"- Good morning, sir."
- Good morning.
"Lawyer Necati Bey called twice, sir."
Thanks.
Good morning.
"Yes, yes, I just woke up."
So how did the trial go?
"Unfortunately, we didn't get the decision we hoped for."
- What?
- The lawyer took into account the last developments.
Until Mirza Çeltik's investigation is over... ... he was released by the court pending the trial.
So is he... is he free now?
God damn it!
He can't leave the country though.
Who cares if he can't go out of the country?
Is he out there and free now or not?
Aleykum selam... aleykum selam.
What are you doing here?
And how did you get in here?
What is going on?
What do you think you are doing?
How did you get inside?
"Come, let us have a talk with you."
What are we gonna talk about?
This was for Cemre.
Barış Bey!
Get up!
Don't!
Come here.
I had made you an advance payment before the trial... ...
Tell me your name.
"One, two, three, four, five, six."
"One, two, three, four, five, six."
Trick or treat.
I give you treats and tricks.
"One, two, three, four, five, six."
Father Moore!
Papa!
Emily!
Emily!
"She feels so hot, Father!"
She's burning up!
Hold her down there on the straw!
Hold her!
Emily!
Doctor!
I need you here now.
Watch her vital signs.
In the beginning was the word.
And the word was with God.
"And the word was the word, and what a wonderful word it was."
Through him all things remain.
"Without him, nothing was made that has been made."
"And the 70 disciples returned again with joy, saying:"
"""Lord, even the devils are subject unto us through thy name."""
Her heart is racing.
It's almost 180 beats a minute.
I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven.
Behold.
I give you power to tread on serpents and scorpions... ...and over all the power of the enemy.
"And nothing shall, by any means, hurt you."
Get it off!
- That's more like it.
A shoe?
So you won't listen?
- No.
What have you done?!
You have ruined my uniform.
What will I wear to the function now?
What happened?
"Aunty, see what this crazy girl has done."
She has wet my clothes.
She threw water on me.
How can I go to the function in these clothes?
Your love and affection has spoilt....
"What happened, aunty?"
- Nothing
Don't worry.
I'll iron them out.
Renu...
Hey fatso!
Your clothes have come.
Get ready soon.
"Tut, tut!"
You shouldn't say that.
"- Yes, you're right."
What is the function about?
They'll distribute awards and deliver lectures.
Sit.
If it isn't too much of a bother could I have a cup of tea?
I'll get it.
"Dear sister Vandana,..."
Suraj has finished his Air Force training... ... and now he is an Indian Air Force pilot.
"The responsibility that you delegated to me,... ... to fulfil Suraj's father's dream,... ... has been fulfilled by me."
"Today on the bases of this truth, I've dared... ...to come and ask for your daughter's hand in marriage."
Do you know the punishment of stepping in this house?
"I've gone through many punishments, father."
And I'm ready to go through any punishment.
Then watch my last punishment.
Brother!
- No!
What are you doing?
"Stop, Jamna!"
Stop there everyone!
"No, uncle!"
Don't do that.
Think of your daughter and your prestige.
He's that goon who has brought shame to my prestige.
He snatched away my daughter from me.
I'll not spare him.
"Yes, he has snatched away your daughter."
He has...
Shoot him.
Kill him...
"But remember, first you'll have to kill your own daughter."
Radha!
Radha!
Radha is Kishan's flute.
No one could separate it.
She'll live and die with him.
What are you doing?
At least think about me.
Lowly!
Your father arrested so many criminals.
And you want him to be a criminal today?
God!
Come on.
- I see.
"Call him, call him."
Where is he?
I have a even fresh matter today.
I will call him.
Grandpa.
Grandpa.
"Tanya, hi."
You didn't tell me that your grandpa is Albert Einstein.
"Shut up, okay."
My grandpa means everything to me.
"18 years ago when there was an earthquake in Indonesia.. ..my mom, dad.. - Do all scientists.. ..get their haircut in the same saloon?"
I will kill you.
Bunty.
Come on.
Grandpa.
How is my child?
"Grandpa, he's Bunty."
I am Gonsalves.
Anthony Gonsalves.
"- Hello, sir."
"Sir, what is this?"
This.
This is a time machine.
A machine that will connect us with our past.. ..and make our future better.
"A machine that will break the sound barrier.. ..and take us back, I mean to our past."
Time machine?
"Professor, they are are just film fiction."
"How can you make a time machine in reality, professor?"
"It can be made, we can make, we can make."
If we can see the past then we can also travel into the past.
She asked me to put her in touch with some juvenile delinquents.
But I am a juvenile delinquents!
She doesn't know that.
"To send her off, I introduced her to Sylvester."
He's most probably the one and only dumb-writed triad member in HongKong.
He's know for his capability to kill.
He's getting a real reputation for that.
Moon!
Moon!
Fuck you!
"How do you do, Mrs. Leung?"
Can I borrow some soya sauce?
Sure.
Come in!
I'll get it for you.
Thank you.
My pleasure.
"Moon, who's she?"
She's from the social welfare department.
A charming lady!
I won't charge you for this.
"Thanks...More, please."
Take the whole bottle.
That's too much.
He visits you often?
Not really.
He used to live in the shop he worked for.
But he lost his job.
That's why he hangs around with me.
He got bullied a lot on the street.
He has to find himself a job.
What and how?
I did this cool collab video with my boy Dave Storm.
Bam!
Go and check it out.
It's freakin' awesome.
He has an awesome idea for a channel.
He takes suggestions from the audience and makes songs out of them.
It's really cool; he's a really talented guy.
"So anyway, go check out the video."
"If you like his stuff, be sure to subscribe and I will see you guys after Thanksgiving."
"So tell me guys, what would you do?"

She looks at me every day.
Mary Jane Watson.
"Oh, boy."
If she only knew how I felt about her.
But she can never know.
I made a choice once to live a life of responsibility.
A life she can never be a part of.
Who am I?
"I'm Spider-Man, given a job to do."
"And I'm Peter Parker, and I, too, have a job."
Parker.
Parker!
"No, no, no, stop!"
Stop!
"Parker, you're late, man."
Always late.
"I'm sorry, Mr. Aziz."
Different.
I think he grew up fast.
"Forcedly.... - He is more mature, but he is a good person."
He tries to look harsh but in order not to be hurt... it's obvious he is the only one who is not aware...
"Yaman is a tender kid, he is merciful, he is a real man.."
"Mira, what happened , Mira, what is wrong my girl?"
"We lost hopes with you- I am not late, take it, there are exactly 1000 TL here, count it!"
Is it OK?
"Kenan's issue will be solved, right?"
Hopefully!
"Brother , what time is it?"
- Half past two.
"Brother, can I use your phone shortly."
I have to make an urgent call.
I will pay for it.
But don't let it be so long!
"- OK, give it."
"Hello?&amp;gt; Hello Mert, it's me ,Yaman."
"Hello Yaman, where are you man?"
Half an hour is left for the exam.
"I am dying from worry.-I am on my way, I am coming, I will catch it, don't worry!"
"OK, were you by Mira's side too?"
What happened to Mira?
- Okay... okay... see you!
Mert i'm saying what happened to Mira?
Yaman! &amp;gt; Where's Mira?
Inside.
Her parents are with her.
"What happened, what does she have?- I don't know, they said they would take her for operation but..."
"Why are you here mom, what's happening?"
"Sude, calm down.- Oh my God!"
Again everything comes from you.
You're driving me crazy.
Really.
Not something forced.
Something natural.
I got it.
I'll try again.
It was gym class.
There were students outside running around...
So we secretly went into the closet.
Pushed a girl onto a mat...
"But suddenly, the students were gathering, outside, the teacher is pounding on the door."
But we couldn't stop.
The girl's voice was getting louder and louder.
And the door was about to open.
But she was reaching orgasm.
I'll have Sam- gae-tang.
You don't even have any money!
Aren't you gonna buy me?
You just watch while I eat!
Don't drool!
You drive me crazy.
Really.
Don't pout.
"Alright, just for today."
You always treat me.
"Next time, bring some money."
You get free sex and now free food!
That's too much.
Sam- gae-tang.
Are you always so quiet?
I like people's voices.
Why are you so attached to talking?
After that?
- Weather report.
Who will give that report?
Gali Ganna Rao.
If we call him he can tell when it will rain.
9848032919.
This is my cell number.
Gali Ganna Rao.
This is my name.
People always misunderstand me and feel.. ..that I give them wrong information.
I only read the report given by the weather department.. ..but dont control the weather myself.
It will be good if you understand that.
Please call later.
Ok?
Catch!
"Sir, we are in trouble."
We did not still get the report which.. ..we are supposed to get by now.
- What shall we do?
Oh!
I see that you are new to the job.
You dont know about me.
Do you think that we depend fully on their report?
Now select one finger.
The pointing finger?
There will be no rain.
Go.
"Sir, there is a phone for you."
Who is that?
- A fan of yours.
This is Gali Ganna Rao speaking.
This is Gun the Gagan speaking.
Are you the person who gives the weather-related news?
"Hey girl, turn the oven off in five minutes."
Let it settle a bit as I am getting ready.
Then let us make a nice package for it.
"Yes, ma'am."
"Ebru Hanım, we've got a mail for you."
I am so excited to see Kuzey.
"But, also nervous that I will see Sami there."
"I mean, I can't go in before or after Sami."
Since we have limited time.
I will have to see his face.
"I know, he will try to talk to me when he sees me alone."
"But, I will not listen to him."
Why would I listen?
"God forbid, I don't want to give him any hopes."
"If he gets some hope and throws his ring away,"
I would feel sorry for the woman.
Ebru Hanım?
"- Who received the mails today, Hasan?"
"- I did, ma'am."
- Who brought the big yellow envelope?
"- A courier, ma'am."
"Barış, get up!"
Barış get up!
"I'm telling you to get up, Barış!"
"What did you do, huh?"
What did you do?
What's going on?
"Calm down, what did I do?"
Celebrated for the end of Ferhat case.
And getting rid of the Burak problem.
Is this how you want to get rid of him?
- What is the matter?
One wrong step from your side. ...can harm your daughter's honour as well as life.
Your enemy Jackie.
"Damodar, tell him something."
Have patience!
Your anger can risk her life.
"Before that I'll kill all of them, Damodar."
She's my daughter.
"She's not only yours, but all of us' daughter."
Give this to me.
Come to your senses.
"Aunt, reason him something."
Don't play with the laws and trust me.
After all I too have some duties towards this family.
I'll bring Radha back.
You please control him.
I'll call the police.
God!
What has happened?
Pasha!
Today you've challenged me.
I'll not spare you and your son alive.
IG Shreekant!
Now you'll understand my language.
"Well done, Jackie!"
You are lying.
You are not a police officer.
"Listen, try and understand."
- You are a liar.
I don't want to hear a word from you.
Get lost!
"Otherwise, I'll kill you."
I said leave.
Bonnie...
This was a mistake.
"She has no magic, she can't help us."
"Bonnie, wait, please."
Don't go.
Talk to me.
Please?
I'll wait outside.
"Hi, Elena."
Nice lake house.
"You know, we never got a chance to officially meet, doctor...Fell."
"You're Alaric's friend, right?"
Damon Salvatore.
Saw you at the council meeting.
What are you doing here?
Strolling the halls.
I like to wave at the newborns through the window.
Sorry about your boyfriend.
Animal attack.
Brutal.
Ex-boyfriend.
And thanks.
I'm still kind of processing.
"Yeah, I'm sure."
"You know, I just thought I'd come by and tell you that it wasn't an animal attack."
And then I realized.
You signed the death certificate.
Would you rather I say he was staked like a vampire?
"Wasn't he the guy that coined the phrase ""animal attack""?"
Why do you even care?
Because Ric likes you.
"And if you're a psychopath, it would probably really suck for him."
I have been waiting for this day for so long!
You always wait for bad days.
But not me!
Let me tell you!
"I won""t get seema married to him!"
Listen..
Lajwanti!
You know they are childhood friends!
They like each other!
To hell with that!
I have always been against this relationship!
And I will always be against it!
"More than me, you will regret it."
"Aunt, I have come to talk about my friend Rajesh alliance""s.. ..and not my alliance."
For sP?
"Why didn""t you tell me before?"
We accept this alliance!
Wait!
I will just bring sweets!
ls somebody there? shekhar.. what is all this?
"lt""s all about destiny, Mr. Diwan. congratulations! shekhar! shekhar, what have you done?"
ls this the reward of my love?
"No, seema."
Fate is testing me.
Friend has asked for the sacrifice of love.
"But why are you making me the victim of this friendship, shekhar!"
"What""s my fault?"
"I am helpless, seema. l have given my promise."
"Now even if God told me, still I can""t break my promise."
Who are you to take decision of my destiny?
lf you are helpless then I too am helpless!
"But I can""t kill my love like this!"
- Yes.
But I'd still be good at it.
Really?
It's really big!
- Really?
- Yes.
For real.
- Take it out!
- What?
"Your thing, pull it out."
Here?
"Take it out, underneath!"
It's not so big.
"- Yes, it is."
"- No, It's not."
"When it's hard, it's really big."
I don't think so.
"Yes, it is."
It is big.
- Then make it hard.
- Here?
Hey...let's go somewhere else.
Don't make me laugh!
No way...
"That thing, I doubt it can even get hard!"
"No, It gets hard fine."
-What's your major?
- Astrophysics.
You go to a regional college and you think you're going to build spaceships?
"Well, not exactly make spaceships but we study the creation and evolution of the universe."
We also observe and research the cosmic space of the earth's mesosphere and
- planetary movements...
Who will treat me like a human?
"Look, don't behave like this."
Think that your baby feels whatever you feel right now.
"Ok, my baby..."
"Ok, my baby..."
I shut up...
Everything is fine.
Ok...
Narin...
"I didn't have the face to come to you, so I came to your mother."
"But, God wanted you to hear what I said."
You see...
Have you heard?
"Ok, don't forgive me and Mustafa, but..."
Please don't attribute our sins to this innocent baby.
"You have a conscience, Narin..."
Don't leave us in the dark...
Please Narin...
"The things Asiye told, are they true?"
Is Mustafa like a child?
"Yes, that's true."
"He didn't recognize me, either."
He only recognized only you from the pictures.
All of these wouldn't happen if he could forget only me.
You're right.
Don't go alone at this hour.
I will go alone.
I am not afraid.
"My lord, brighten my path and keep my heart pure..."
Please don't see me as one of your cruel servants...
Good morning Yasar...
Could you please take me to Mustafa?
Hello...
I obtained permission for each one of you.
"There is not going to be any restrictions on the number of visitors, despite Mustafa's illness."
What illness?
We all know why he is here!
Okay...
Duriye..
Metin didn't say anything.
"That is, he is just saying it is protocol."
My son!!!
My son...
Son...
Son....
It is time for medication..
"Mustafa, son.. where are you going?"
We came to see you..
"Look, Asiye is here.."
Yasar is here...
Your mother...
Your father...
"You say that, but Mustafa doesn't recognize you."
We are going
My son....
How could they do this to you... how????
We... ... are such a burden to you..
If only Kadir could get out.. ... we won't stay...
"And, you won't even let us do any work."
We just sit around.
You are not a burden to anyone.
I am going to ask you something...
Are you not comfortable here?
Is the place too small?
Why are you giving Demet's letter to Kuzey?
- It will get on his nerves.
- What is it to you?
It's her who wanted me to do it.
How shameless of her to  write to him after what she did.
"Have you no shame, talking behind her back without know what really happened?"
"Isn't Demet your friend, too?"
"You're one of a kind, Cemre."
"You talk about shame, yet... ... you are here for your lover, as a married woman."
- You are really unbelievable.
- So are you.
"- Kuzey Tekinoğlu, right?"
- Yes.
Anything else?
"Well, three letters."
But I can give them to him.
You'll have to leave them here.
They will reach him once we check them.
Is that so?
Alright.
- The visiting room is upstairs.
- Thank you.
- Sami Tekinoğlu.
- You can sit.
Are we going to see him together?
- You will do as you were told.
- I was told nothing.
- Neither was I. - It's 15 minutes.
You want to see him separately?
"No, I will see my son for as long as I am allowed."
He can wait outside if he wants.
"Okay, we got it."
"Climb, if I want, without all the shouting."
"I just want to know that I feel strong, you know."
"And clouds really should be white at least, and oceans should meet us at the beach, and I don't want to overreach when I know what's in store, raw love."
"Life, a day at a time, my love."
"Life, a day at a time, don't know."
Love.
Life in a day and life in a day and life in a day...
I want to drink from the clearest water.
I want to eat the things I ought to.
"I just want to know that I feel strong, you know."
"I want to reach the greatest mountain, climb, if I want, without all the shouting."
"I just want to know that I feel strong, you know."
"And clouds really should be white at least, and oceans should meet us at the beach, and I don't want to overreach when I know what's in store, raw love."

Law may give bail to Jackie's men.
But I want an order of Jackie's death penalty.
"Don't worry, uncle."
I've prepared such strong case against Jackie... ...that even the supreme court can't save him from the gallows.
Jackie surrendered?
- Yes.
Why?
Why?
- Because Radha told him to do so.
What?
- Because Radha is in love with him.
What?
Radha?
Which Radha?
Our Radha!
Radha takes him as her husband.
Radha has taken a promise from him to be a good citizen.
This enmity has turned into a love story.
Serious!
Serious!
Serious love story!
"And if Jackie is hanged, Radha..."
Radha... what will she do?
"I'll commit suicide, brother."
I can't live without Kishan!
"He isn't a criminal, brother."
He's made a criminal.
I've never hidden anything from you and sister-in-law.
I swear upon you... ...he never looked at me with evil intentions.
Had he wished... he could have done anything with me.
"But for the sake of my love, he embraced death."
"Save him, brother."
- Where should I put my hands?
- The waist is safest.
You're a quick learner.
"Now, tongues."
They're a health and safety issue.
The secret is to strike the right balance between yielding and giving.
"Start slowly, like a turtle, not a lizard."
Avoid washing machine syndrome.
"Sadly, this session's over."
My next client's here.
"- Hi, Georgia."
"- Hi, El."
"Thank you, Georgia."
I'll be in touch.
"You did tongues, didn't you?"
Number six.
"You did a big fat tongue sandwich, didn't you?"
"Oh, my God."
"All I know is, he was from Saliva City."
But who cares?
I'm a snogging sensation.
Wait!
Mum?
Dad?
I just want you both to know how much I really appreciate all you've done for me.
"I mean, it can't be easy since you can hardly remember being my age"
'cause it was so long ago.
Have you been inhaling fumes from the science lab?
I want to talk party details.
"Oh, Georgia."
I told you I needed to talk about something important.
"Oh, this is important!"
"I feel strong, you know."
"And clouds really should be white at least, and oceans should be there at the beach."
And who needs books when we've got speech?
And who knows what's in store for raw love?

woman:
I wrote a letter to him.
It's easier then speaking.
I explained everything from the beginning.
I told him you and me were too new.
Then I told him everything I feel.
"My emotion, my concerns, everything."
I poured my heart out to him.
I hope he'll understand me.
How are you?
Are you in the station?
"Yes, I am drown in paper work since I was called back to duty."
I thought that case was closed.
"I mean, the guy is caught."
It is over.
"A second Demet, please hold on a sec."
"Hello, yes Aziz?"
"Deniz Hanım, returned to the country a week after she left it."
- And she didn't leave again.
- So she's in Turkey for two and a half months.
"- Yes, abi."
"- Okay, thanks."
- Hello.
"- Hello, what's up?"
Maybe I should call you later.
There's a connection between Ferhat's daughter and the man who said he killed Ferhat.
"I need to talk to Mirza, please find a way."
"There's no way, Deniz."
If they see you with him... ... it will peril the plausibility of his statement.
Maybe he'll die even before the trial.
The last reports were very bad.
- Wish I could at least say goodbye.
- He doesn't want that.
Why can't we do that?
Speak up
Can't we not hear it?
No， she must tell me why
My mammy said a man getting intimate with a girl before marriage may desert her some day
Did your mammy tell you that?
"I was not in， sister, right?"
My daddy told me I must try it by any means
Otherwise， she may become secondhand like her
Right What?
My mammy told me like that
My daddy told me like that
What now?
Well， your daddy's right， and so's your mammy
But that bloody ghost won't give up so easily
What now?
Go down for the wedding night
Okay
Go now
"Sister, now the 1st thing is to take a bath"
Hurry up
Why are you wearing a hat?
Higher
Open up， Mimi， the groom's here
Take care
Lucky money for opening the door
How much? $99，999.90
So expensive， I give up
Name your pricer
Make it cheape
I'll pay you $9.90.
Give me 10 $ change
And the court wants to punish me for it.
Prince.
Will I be banished?
Will I have to go away again?
Will my mom have to go through that cause of me?
"No, Prince Yuning."
- Crown Prince.
- Prince.
That won't happen.
What's with the long face?
Guess you're not glad to see me.
"No, not at all."
I'm really REALLY glad to see you.
Then why do you look so depressed?
"Look, you haven't even called me, 'Brother.'"
It's just...
I thought maybe you didn't want to see me again.
What?
"You went through lots cause of me, though."
"No, cause of you?"
Where'd that come from?
It was my idea to skip out.
But you told Father it was yours.
"Listen, you're the one that's had it tough because of me."
I'm really sorry.
"You stood up for me, worried about me."
"Some brother I am, watching you take the blame."
"No, I'm to blame."
If I didn't go on the bridge you wouldn't have been arrested or gotten sick...
It's all my fault.
No.
"No, Yuning."
I'm taking pictures right now.
All the passersby's look incredible.
I want to ask so many of them
lf I could take pictures of them.
There are tons of people who look much better than we do
They look very modelesque.
I got this stain from a hotdog I ate earlier.
I guess I'm clumsy sometimes.
Thankfully I dropped it after I finished my scene.
Dae Hyun and Yong Guk are filming at Time Square and Central Park fountain.
It's like a dream.
When else would we come here to film for a MV!
"Right now, we are at Central Park."
We're here because Dae Hyun is filming.
He's filming for the MV right now.
And I'm just going there to watch him.
"At Central Park,"
The trees are all very tall and the air is very fresh.
Look over there.
It's a horse.
I've only seen it in NY I think.
Horses in NY!
You don't see that often elsewhere.
Horses on the streets.
This place sure is humongous.
The trees are enormous and the streets are wide.
It's one thing that stands out about America.
This place is so big I feel like I'm in a giant's forest.
Dae Hyun is a natural at acting.
This place is Central Park.
ln the middle of Central Park
I took a picture over there by the fountain.
I'll see what He does to me.
"Go home, it's going to rain."
You'll get drenched.
It's an earthquake.
Swamiji Rain?
Rain?
- Rain?
My hand's paining.
I won't be able to write my exam tomorrow.
I'll slap you.
I'll make you hold the pen in your mouth and write your paper.
You're scolding him.
But what about you?
- What did I do?
What?
The festivities were left incomplete.
You've to admit that there's God.
You spread the rumour.. ..and immediately there was an earthquake.
- Remember.
- What earthquake?
Even the utensils didn't budge.
Papa.
I think they took your announcement too seriously.
This news just came in from parts of the country.. ..that the idol of Sri Krishna's eating butter.
ls the Lord eating butter?
- No.
"Priest, offer the Lord some buttermilk."
"People are offering cheese, cottage-cheese.. ..butter, buttermilk to the idol of Krishna."
"- Oh, God!"
The rumour has spread so far.
"Please, eat it."
This is low-cholesterol cheese.

"YOU KNOW, SOMEBODY HAD SAlD SOMETHlNG ABOUT SPEAKlNG BRlEFLY"
ABOUT COLLABORATlNG?
"HOW DO WE DO IT?  &amp;gt;&amp;gt; THAT'S THE HARD PART. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE SAD ANSWER IS,  IT'S A GlFT."
I THlNK THERE ARE SEVERAL THlNGS THAT YOU HAVE TO BE SURE OF.
YOU HAVE TO SURE OF YOUR OWN TALENT.
YOU HAVE TO HAVE HAD RECOGNlTION AND FEEL SECURE.
AND YOU HAVE TO BE SURE OF THE TALENT OF THE PERSON WlTH WHOM YOU'RE WRlTING.
"AND IF YOU DO THAT, AND IF YOU'RE A COLLABORATlNG KlND OF PERSON... (chuckling) IF YOU CAN GET ALONG WlTH PEOPLE,"
IF YOU CAN GlVE UP SOMETHlNG YOU THlNK IS REALLY IMPORTANT
"AND ONLY FlGHT ABOUT THE REALLY, REALLY, REALLY IMPORTANT THlNGS,"
"AND YOU TRUST THE TALENT OF THE OTHER PERSON COLLABORATlNG WORKS,"
"BUT THE PROBLEM IS, ALL TOO OFTEN, PEOPLE WANT IT THElR WAY."
"WE COLLABORATED WlTH A WOMAN IN CHlCAGO AND IT DlDN'T WORK AT ALL,"
BECAUSE SHE WASN'T WlLLlNG  TO GlVE AN INCH
"ON WHETHER YOU SAY THlS IS A ""TAXl""  OR THlS IS A ""CAB."""
"I MEAN, ON THE LlTTLE THlNGS-- AND IT DlDN'T WORK. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT WASN'T A COLLABORATlON.  &amp;gt;&amp;gt; NO."
DO YOU HAVE SOMETHlNG TO ADD TO THAT? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; UH...
NO.
"ONLY THAT, UH, THE WAY WE WORK IS..."
"ONE OF US WlLL WRlTE  SOME STUFF,"
"AND THEN, TURN IT OVER TO THE OTHER"
AND THE OTHER  HAS THE OPTlON
OF IMPROVlNG ON  WHATEVER HE OR SHE GOT
AND GOlNG ON FROM THERE.
AND THAT WAY-- ONE OF THE THlNGS WE WERE TALKlNG ABOUT EARLlER--
DEBBlE WAS TALKlNG ABOUT EARLlER--
IS HOW NlCE IT IS  WHEN PLOTS SURPRlSE YOU.
"AND YOU KNOW, WHERE THlNGS, YOU KNOW, COME UP UNEXPECTEDLY."
"WELL, THE NlCE THlNG ABOUT COLLABORATlNG  IS YOU SURPRlSE EACH OTHER,"
"SO IF YOU'RE ALREADY SURPRlSING EACH OTHER,"
YOU'VE GOT A BETTER CHANCE OF SURPRlSING THE AUDlENCE.
"SO, IT'S A LlTTLE LlKE CHEATlNG..."

Every time when Ahmed comes back from Somalia.
He tells terrible stories and says:
I wil never go there again.
"But he also says: when Somalia needs a president in 10 years,"
I'm ready.
"When he went there for the first time, he met relatives, that he never saw before."
And his uncle took him to the desert.
Ahmed must sleep in the desert in order to turn adult.
They go far out.
It is cold.
There is noone.
Ahmed cannot sleep.
Suddenly he hears an animal.
A lion roars nearby.
It is creeping through the camp.
Ahmed tries to wkae his uncle.
Hopefully he has his gun with him.
The uncle wakes.
"The lion roars again, and the uncles tells Ahmed, that he should not wake him up because of a lion which is 20 miles away."
This way Ahmed became a grown up person.
"The choreographer of Lion King didn't want us to imitate animal movements, as everybody does it."
But we dance the souls of the animals.
This a cow.
No.
This is a pig.
No.
A giraffe.
No.
A horse?
No.
This is a monkey.
No.
"But you are still a baby, you are my big baby."
"Okay then, Okay, have some rest,"
Don't ever force your leg okay?
"If you need something, shout to us."
"Okay, I am lying down.- Bravo !"
Lie down!
"Mira, did you talk to Orkun?"
"Yes mom, is the third time you're asking today."
What does he say?
- He doesn't say anything.
"He went together with his dad to the fabric in Luleburgaz, they will be staying there for some days."
"See ?, he is escaping too.&amp;gt; Mom, don't please!"
"The owner of this wants his vehicle in some days, you have to take care of the instruments order right away on morning.Beeren calling"
"OK, no problem, I will solve it tomorrow!- Good bye! &amp;gt;Good night uncle!"
Yes?
Err...
"I called to tell you I am fine, maybe you are worried about me,"
It's me Berren...- Beeren?
Aa Beren...
So good you called me..
I was thinking of you.&amp;gt; Really?
Dad?!...
Daddy... &amp;gt; My sweetheart...
"Where were you ,i was so worried , dad..- I am sorry.."
I am sorry.
I will solve everything.
"I know my dear dad, i know..."
Shall I go and talk with him too?
No.. just let him..
It means he is suffering from love.
My precious boy!
He is growing up dear Ender.
This is Dayton Way in Beverly Hills.
It's actually a very expensive town.
"I don't fit in very well, do l?"
&amp;lt;'Bear' Yong Guk's shoot begins&amp;gt;
The background saved me.
It's like L.A.
It looks fantastic.
Feels like L.A. here.
Pictures come out beautifully here.
Nature is definitely better than creating expensive sets.
No matter how costly a set is it's incomparable to nature.
okay.
Great job.
"Now, it's Zelo's turn."
The first scene is a wrap.
Zelo will now be shooting a skateboarding scene.
Zelo will film something similar to me.
Directors are so good at filming.
They're making us look very attractive.
We look as though we're Korean-Americans living in America.
I'm pretending this iPod is an iPhone.
"Woah there, wind."
None
I'm doomed.
My face is bloated.
I can feel my face all swollen.
I'm screwed.
I think that's a person over there.
Look at him wash the baby like she's laundry.
(Born in Busan) I've been to Gwang-an-ri Beach in Busan.
"Hae-woon-dae, and Song-do beach."
But I've never been to such a huge beach like this before.
- What are you guys doing here?
"- Come on, shoo, get lost!"
"- All right, all right!"
"- All right, time is tight."
Let's begin.
You there.
Read.
- Why me?
- Because I said so.
"- ""How to hold a costume parade."""
- Get to the point.
- The director... advances...
- Advances what?
"- Can't see, it's faded."
- Hand it over.
- That circular looks really old.
"- Old, yes."
"Obsolete, no."
I might add.
You know what I mean?
- The director announces...
Announces!
"""Attention, let the costume parade begin!"""
- Attention!
Let the costume parade begin!
Music!
- You got it!
- Get closer!
"You, out of the way!"
"So there is no chaos tomorrow, we'll divide the square into sectors."
"Children separately over here, and adults over there."
Slogan chanting can be done by the support staff.
Go.
"Please, I need this job."
You're fired.
"Look, give me another chance."
You're fired.
"Parker, hello."
You're fired.
Why?
Dogs catching Frisbees?
Pigeons in the park?
A couple geezers playing chess?
Boss.
Not now.
The Bugle could show another side of New York for a change.
"We got six minutes to deadline, Jonah."
We need page one.
I don't pay you to be a sensitive artiste.
I pay you...
Still not now!
I pay you because that psycho Spider-Man will pose for you.
He won't let me take any more pictures.
You turned the whole city against him.
A fact I'm very proud of.
Get your pretty little portfolio off my desk before I go into a diabetic coma.
"Is your wife, she lost her checkbook."
Thanks for the good news.
"Please, isn't there any of these shots you can use?"
I need the money.
Miss Brant.
Get me a violin.
"Five minutes to deadline, Jonah."
Run a picture of a rancid chicken.
"Let me see, where were you?"
Mert whispering: is that Mira?
Hello?&amp;gt;Just a second..
I will go so you can talk comfortably.
Your voice sounds interrupted...
Last night was left half.
"In fact we have to complete it. want to talk with you a bit tonight, but alone."
Okay?
Don't take Mert with you.
Only you and me.
"Look, girl!"
"I am telling you the last time clearly, I don't have anything to do with you and will never in this life."
"Did you understand it?-Ah..ah...-Ah or not, this is it!"
You will have nothing from me!
I'm telling you this from the beginning.
Do you understand me?
"Hey, talk properly !"
You're the girl that my friend loves.
"Be wise, be worthy of him!"
I am trying to explain it politely but...
"look Eylul, if you sadden that boy, I will break your heart, know this too!"
OK?
Did you get me?
You're out of your mind!- Whatever it is!
"Don't call me again, ok?"
"Or even say ""Hello"" as a human... or don't even greet me."
That's it!
Mert?!
I forgot my phone.
There is a girl at our place...
Err...
Giray's girlfriend... stupid... she calls me constantly..
"I was good, wasn't I?"
"So, it looks like a tough assignment."
Maybe you could give me a hand.
Or maybe both hands.
"OK, those who didn't get talent positions, there's room on the crew."
Talk to Patty.
I thought my tape was really great.
"Elizabeth, some people like yourself excel at the written word."
Not everyone's meant to be an on-air personality.
There's still room on the crew.
Get it together!
We've got a show to do here.
"Enid, did you get that?"
"(Todd) Man, Patty's really trippingon this director business."
"(Patty) People, please!"
Are you feeling any better?
Not really.
You're still *The Oracle's* star writer.
No one can ever take that away from you.
"I wanted it so bad, Todd, and I thought my work was really great."
"Well, what did Collins say?"
There's nothing he can do.
"If you ask me, they should change the name from *Oracle On-Air* to *Airheads On-Air.*"
Hey...
"Present company excluded, of course."
"Hi, Liz..."
Todd.
Have you met Russ?
"Yes, I have."
"Well, just wanted to say hi."
Don't forget to watch me tomorrow.
Is it wrong to hate your sister with a passion?
"Well, uh, let's see, something wrong with the distributor I think."
Want me to give you a hand?
Thank you.
I sure appreciate it.
"Well, it doesn't look too serious."
Good.
( dramatic theme playing )
( phone rings )
I'll get it.
Hello.
"Uh, let me talk to your mother."
"It's for you, Mom."
Hello.
Hello.
Mrs. Pryor?
Yes.
"Now, you look, I've got your husband."
What?
"If you want to get him back you're gonna have to pay me $100,000."
What are you talking about?
I guess you heard me all right.
Now you better start thinking about that money.
"For your information, my husband is right here at home."
"Believe me, I've got him and I'm not going to give him back until you pay."
"It's the first time I've done this kind of thing and I'm nervous about it, so don't kid around with me because I might hurt the man."
I don't know what kind of a sick mind you've got but I don't appreciate your sense of humor.
( dramatic theme playing )
Cheyney...
did you make the call?
"Cheyney, did you make the call?"
Yeah.
"Yeah, well, what'd she say, Cheyney?"
There is only one way we can reach the ship.
We have to go underwater!
"But if we do that, we may freeze!"
I'm prepared to die!
"If we make a hole in the ship, they will have to delay!"
You're right.
Here!
They made this for us to help us breathe underwater.
Young Sook!
Mother is going!
God of the Sea!
We are laying down our lives to save our daughter!
Please have mercy!
We... we made a hole in the ship!
It's our turn now!
Let's go!
What?
We can't leave today because of a hole in the ship?!
It will take at least a day to repair it.
"As of today, you owe me forty thousand yang."
"Goodness, awesome!"
Increase security!
"Seize any trespassers and torture them! &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Yes, sir!&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
In Soon!
Next!
- Choon Dang!
- Myung Shin!
The front has been fortified.
Go for the back!
Alright!
What do we do?
It's fifty thousand yang already!
Nobody's in it.
"Um, I think there's only one floor with any people on it."
[Anthem playing in background]
"We're in the hotel room and, um, we've been told that they're bugged."
That they're listening to us.
I don't know if whispering is going to help.
That might be where it all stems from.
Hello!
Hello!
"Come in, Come in Tokyo."
"Hello, Hello."
"Hello, Hello."
We're here.
[Woman singing on TV]
"Right after we get there, we were taken for our first meal."
"The first time you eat in North Korea, it's kind of a sign of the very weird things to come."
[Girls laughing]
[Girl speaking Korean]
Is this where we go?
Here?
The table is over here.
We're in a big banquet room.
As you can see it's huge.
There's about 20 women who are getting ready for our dinner.
"First of all, they give you about 3 or 4 courses of absolutely inedible food."
It's just matter.
It's like fried matter.
"And you're kinda going, yeah, yeah."
"But you're waiting for every one to fill in, when's this banquet happening?"
When's the banquet?
There is no banquet.
Where is everyone?
"""You are my love, my dream-boy."""
"""You are a Hero of my love story."""

How many fingers am I holding up?
Say two
He's fine
"Come on, Bring it"
You're not gay
Will it lead Pasha on the gallows?
Yes!
Definitely he will.
Never.
Because you'll withdraw your statement.
"I spent 35 years of my life, listening to the... ...threatening from the boys like you."
"If I wish, I can kill your entire family in just five minute."
But you've a big family.
And it's in your hands to let it prosper.
It was my duty to warn you.
"So, I have."
You are lucky that my gun is under maintenance today.
Your darling daughter Radha.
"Stop, Shreekant."
I've no one in my family.
But you've many.
Think about it.
19 days are left for you to give your statement.
"Santo, let's go."
Hail Lord Krishna!
"- Lord, what a festival!"
Hail Lord Krishna!
"Uncle, we must leave for Mumbai now."
Never!
Shreekant Mathur has never got... ...afraid of anyone's threat nor will he in future.

"Otherwise, he'd have started firing."
"Let go off it,"

He's just a police officer by profession.
"Otherwise, he's very soft hearted person."
Inspector Damodar!
"Bye, Bye, Seeya!"
Is this enough for my sister-in-law's birthday?
-Sister-in-law?
-Yeah.
-Who?
-Su-eun.
Since when has my sister been your sister-in-law?
We're not even married.
You who don't even have to propose...
Su-eun told me to call her that.
You're on your period aren't you?
Should I cook seaweed soup for her birthday?
I'm good at it.
"You fry up the beef, add a dash of sesame oil, you boil it with soaked seaweed... fantastic!"
She'll like it.
What do you think?
Let's rest a bit.
"It's hard on you, isn't it?"
Of course.
You make me carry these heavy bags.
Not that!
Then what?
Don't you think you can take it easy?
- I am taking it easy now.
- You've been doing it a long time.
And worked harder than anyone.
What was that?
It means &amp;amp;quot;l love you forever.&amp;amp;quot;
Doesn't it?
Sister-in-law taught me.
"It means, &amp;amp;quot;l love you, so let me touch your breasts!&amp;amp;quot;"
Huh?
"Bridge, neighbors, courage, inclusive?"
Inclusive.
OK.
Let me just take that word for you and break it down into syilables and see if it helps.
"As he got up in grades and his reading vocabulary got larger, he was faced with all these multi-syilabic words that he couldn't decode."

Good.
So can you put it together?
Inquisitive.
Excellent.
OK.
Go on.
Clever.
Success.
And Adam's reading problems were affecting his spelling and writing as well.
What's your best guess with success?
How do you think it's spelled?
Good.
That's pretty close.
"By the time he got to ninth grade, he was getting no Special Ed help."
And he was really at a distinct disadvantage.
He fell apart.
He stopped going to class.
"He stopped doing his homework because, essentially, it was way beyond what he could do."
"And when Jane said, oh, he needs help, people said, you know what, if you look at his profile, he's solidly average."
There's nothing going on here.
He's not trying.
Where do I live?
"- Jaipur, aunt."
So I am speaking from Jaipur.
But your voice sounds quite clear.
"So why are you yelling, you fool."
"Aunt, father has said.. ..that we should speak louder on a trunk call."
He's a fool.
Maybe you might know better.
But he will kill me.
If he misbehaves.. ..then throw him out of the house.
"But.. aunt, won't that be a bit too much?"
- No.
He drives my mother crazy.
But isn't your mother dead?
I am talking about my mother.
Don't you and father have the same mother?
"Oh, no."
He's the servant's son.
After the servant died my mother raised him.
What?
My father is the servant's son?
That means I am a servant's grandchild.
Ask Bhikhu.
Bhikhu knows about it.
- Yes.
Bhikhu is your father's brother.
"The servant of my cruel, low-down, scoundrel neighbour.. ..is my uncle?"
"Kishen, aren't you ashamed to abuse your neighbours?"
"Why shouldn't I, aunt, why shouldn't I?"
"The mother's a witch, the daughter's a specter."
"You know, last month.. ..they pulled down my father's loincloth."
Do you know that?
We need to stand up in that complaining all the time
If I hear one more person go
Oh my god.
I am so sick of white guys dating all of our women
I will slap you (slap) (slap) (slap) (slap)
And if an Asian girl only dates white guys
Who cares?
There's billions and billions of women
Even if you are not an Asian guy
Let this be a lesson
"You tell yourself, you are the bottom"
You are usually right!
"So,,, Shut up with that negative attitudee"
Yeah...
That's all I have to say.
So..
Byeeeee (Waving)
A Day for an Affair
- Hi.
- Hi.
-What did you do today?
- I went to the school and handed out lunch.
"-On my way home, I bought a couple of fish."
-What are you wearing?
My pajamas!
-Why are you wearing a uniform?
- I have a ceremony today.
I'm buying a cell phone today.
It's been ages since my old one broke.
A cell phone?
Your phone's right there.
You said you didn't need it anymore.
I will give you the rest of the payment today.
"Oh you were hungry too, right?"
Here!
Come here!
Don't call the police.
I will kill him right here  if you call the police or the security.
I was put in jail because of him.
"Come here, come."
Lion...
Get up.
Fight me like a man.
You were doing stuff behind my back.
Why don't you hit me once?
"Slap me once, just once."
"Hit me once to wind me up, come on!"
Get up.
We are not finished yet.
Get up.
May God accept your prayers.
I first found out that Mirza Çeltik's deceased son was your boyfriend.
And then I found his grave.
Then I tracked the fresh flowers brought here everyday.
And here I am before you.
Hello Komiser.
"You know Kuzey was released today, right?"
Mirza Çeltik doesn't have many days ahead.
You are trying to close Ferhat's case.
Why would I want that?
For the same reason you come here everyday with flowers.
I am not doing anything.
I will prove it.
I will prove it.
"He wouldn't say ""See you later"" slowly unless he means ""See you later."""
"Otherwise he would just say ""See ya later."""
- Don't you get it?
- When is later then?
I don't know.
I'm not boy lingual yet.
But I tell you what.
I see a snog at the end of the tunnel.
Big fish little fish cardboard box

"Lindsay, stop it."
You don't have to come.
"Oh, Robbie, stop."
I promise I won't get in the way.
"Oh, no."
"I don't mind, honestly."
Come on.
"Lindsay, stop messing about there."
All right?
Or you'll just have to sit in the back then.
"Oh, Robbie."
Maybe they're just mates.
"Don't be a plonker, El."
Mates don't hold hands.
"I already feel fed up with boys, and I haven't had anything to do with them yet."
I don't know how she got in there before you.
- I can never compete with Lindsay.
"- Yes, you can."
You've got much better qualities than her.
Yeah?
Like what?
"- Well, you're really funny."
Millwall!
Millwall!
- What the fuck's he doing here?
"- Martin, sit down, son, sweet."
- That's it.
"Do as you're told, you mug."
- Fuck off.
Bovver.
You know we're gonna have to stop meeting like this.
People are gonna start to talk.
"So, what you doing up so late, anyway, on a fucking school night?"
Shouldn't you be at home with your pals... ...all shitting at the thought of us turning you over?
"What, did you have a lover's tiff?"
"Well, what do you want, Bov?"
Fucking Yank's an undercover journo.
He's at our boozer now.
"Tommy, you gotta give him the chop."
He's got them eating out of the palm of his hand.
"What makes you think I'd want to sort that out for you, eh?"
Because the Major's there too.
Stevie Dunham's in there?
"- Oh, thanks, Pete."
- Shut up!
History student my ass.
Who the fuck are you?
"Look, I'm sorry I lied about being a history major, but that's it."
- I'm not a journalist.
"- Well, it don't look fucking good, does it?"
- Why are you keeping a record?
- It's a journal.
I've kept that my entire life.
Are you working for the Times?
Must've gotten up really early.
I'm sleep deprived right now.
"But since it's our MV, I'm anticipating a good outcome."
And it's really fun.
I'll be sure to enjoy it.
Peace.
"Right now, we're in NY to film MV. on some bridge."
I don't know where this is though...
Him Chan is already shooting first for the MV on this bridge now.
This is my background scene.
It's awesome.
our solo shoots are over.
We'll film a lip sync all together as a group.
Lip sync like an image cut.
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.
Step back a little...yes.
A chatting scene.
Cut.
What's wrong with us?
"Now, what you do with this coffee is,"
Drink it in a sentimental way.
"Put it down, and pet it once like this."
And try touching the coffee cup here.
This one here?
"You know, something like this."
Put your coffee cup to...
"- You know what I mean? - oh, this one?"
"- No, no."
- Then this one?
Then touch that cup in front of you.
You're thinking of the girl that's supposed to be with you.
- Yes.
- They told me they'd sent the papers from my father's office to this storage room.
"I have to see a lawyer tomorrow and if I don't take a copy of the birth certificates along, they won't..."
Please!
Whose name was it under?
Doctor Gabriel de Luca.
Come on in.
Hello?
Mr. Kleinman?
"If it's okay, I just wanted to ask you a few questions..."
About an article of yours on Manuel Leonardi.
REMAlNS FOUND ARE THOSE OF MANUEL LEONARDI
It says here they only found the father's body.
What happened to the mother and daughter?
They never found the bodies.
I don't understand.
What were they doing at the hotel?
They didn't have a house?
- They were running away.
- From what?
"LEONARDl'S DEATH COULD BE CONNECTED WlTH THE ""DOCTOR"""
"The ""doctor""."
POLlCE UNABLE TO FlND DOCTOR INVOLVED IN SERlES OF MURDERS
Manuel and Amalia Leonardo went missing.
"They were taken from their home on February 3, 1980."
"What do you mean ""went missing""?"
"""Relatives of more than 30,000 who disappeared during the dictatorship ask for justice."""
"DOCTOR LERHMANN, SANTA CRUZ MlLITARY HOSPlTAL."
FEBRUARY 1978.
Excuse me.
Are you all right?
Would you like to come in for some coffee?
Harry sent me roses.
"So where you been, pal?"
You don't return my calls.
I've been busy.
Taking pictures of Spider-Man?
How's the bug these days?
"The less you see of that man, the better."
"Now, les all go into the other room and have something to eat."
I'll get the hors d'oeuvres.
So how are things going at Oscorp?
They're great.
I'm head of Special Projects.
We're about to make a breakthrough on fusion.
"How lovely, Harry."
"Your father would be so proud, rest his soul."
Thank you.
"We're actually funding one of your idols, Pete."
Otto Octavius.
I'm writing a paper on him.
You want to meet him?
You'd introduce me?
You bet.
Octavius is gonna put Oscorp on the map... ...in a way my father never even dreamed of.
"M.J., could you give me a hand?"
"She's waiting for you, pal."
What do you mean?
The way she looks at you or doesn't look at you.
However you want to look at it.
I don't have time for girls right now.
"Why, are you dead?"
I've been kind of busy.
Taking pictures of your friend?
I'll let go when I count to 3 and you hook him out 1， 2， 3
Get hold of him
Wait.
Why are you still staying here?
I want to get your first time
lf I can't break your virginity before midnight
I'll never get reincarnated
Where's Robert?
I'm Robert.
Robert is me
Lisa， please help me so I may get reincarnated
Never
Let me help you if sister won't do it
Don't! lf you touch me I may be sent down to hell
What?
Sorry， I can't help you
I'll find someone else then.
Bye
Never.
Get hold of him
Get hold of him
Get hold of him.
Don't let him get away
Follow him
Landal， are you all right?
It's all because of you
Had you yielded to me， he wouldn't have got you involved
I....
Shut up!
I may say it now even when I'm not drunk
We've been dating for 7 years.
We kissed and caressed
Why didn't you answer your phone?
- It's nothing.
- Are you gonna come pick us up?
Is Fatmagül all right?
- Where are you?
- I don't know...
"It says ""Dolapdere Taksim"" Do we take the turn here?"
I don't know either.
"Hold on, let me ask somebody here."
"Okay, call me right away."
- Let us forward a bit then...
"- Let's not get lost, Mukaddes."
Shut up Rahmi.
I am so tired already.
"- Damn it, what's your hurry?"
- Be careful Mukaddes!
I'll go get your brother and yenge.
Stop being stubborn.
Just eat these.
"You passed out, out of hunger."
Eat them before they get cold.
You'll feel better.
I shouldn't have known...
- How stupid I am...
"- You couldn't have known, something that didn't happen."
I've explained that non sense to you how many times now?
There was something strange that night... ... with the three of you.
"And then, that woman..."
She said she was Fatmagül Ketenci's brother's wife.
What did she come to talk with your dad about?
God...
The woman was looking for her when she was missing.
It's my first time on an elevator in Las Vegas.
You haven't in the hotel?
Did you walk up to the hotel room?
We were on the 20th floor.
- We didn't film then.
- You're right.
That's why this is my first time.
"Wow, elevators in Las Vegas go up too."
Same as Korean ones.
Great work.
It feels just like Las Vegas.
Great work.
We're in Las Vegas.
We just finished shooting for the MV.
I had an all-nighter yesterday and couldn't sleep today.
I just woke up in the middle of my nap to come to the shooting.
The director expected me to look awake.
"So I was jumping around, trying to be hyper."
Thankfully the scenery was great
So I could get in a happy mood.
(Satisfied) I'm feeling pretty good now.
I'm all done filming so I'll be leaving with the photographer.
None
We played like crazy on the bus.
You can only check it out in the MV.
We'll be all done at the desert.
The desert scene is the final one.
"""We're Hurricane, We're Hurricane"""
I've gone insane.
I've been up for almost 24 hours.
We're heading to the desert now it'll take about 20-30 minutes.
"It's where the scorpions live, my favorite."
Why did you send her there?
What was she doing at your mom's house?
"What did you do to my daughter, tell me!- It's okay dear, okay..."
Mira?!...
Yaman did you take the exam?
Yaman did you take the exam?
"No, I came to you..."

"- What is all this about, Reşat Bey?"
- What do you mean sir?
Haven't you seen the local newspaper?
I am...
I am very sorry but I don't know what you're saying.
The party members have just read  your town's local news to me.
Explain to me what this rape scandal is about.
"They mention Selim's name in it, too."
You will tell me everything.
You will tell me what you did to Fatmagül.
Are you alright?
Back off!
They asked me to help the girl.
So I went to the hospital.
And I found out that the girl had an affair with Kerim.
Lies!
Don't give me bullshit!
Tell me the truth!
You just don't want to see the truth.
The real lie is what you see here.
This rape slander.
"- Good job, Christine."
"- Oh, thanks. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Gordon)&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Monti?&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
It just shows the inexperience.
- Helene?
- Helene is a disaster.
Helene was shocking.
"According to them, it was, like, way undercooked."
You're not the worst.
She is.
And Tali.
I mean...
Disaster.
I don't know what Tali was up to.
- No.
- Dave?
"The sand, you know, big, big technical error."
"I didn't wash the mushrooms, and I think I started too late."
"Any freakin' dish but risotto, man."
"Like, seriously."
Ryan and Tali are the two people that I want to see go home.
They're just total idiots.
"And, if they don't stay on their toes,"
I'm gonna be the one to take 'em out.
Clearly we have to take him out.
You took the words right out of my mouth.
I'm gonna have to throw someone under the bus.
"Once one of 'em's gone, the other one's..."
"Remember, you're the best."
- How do you feel?
- Good.
"All right, guys. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Gordon) Back to your stations, please."
Thank you.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
It's educational.
You'll gain skills Lindsay can only dream of.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Are you Peter Dyer?
"The man, the myth, the legend."
"- Your parents aren't here, are they?"
- No.
My hours are between 4:30 and 5:30 before they get back from work.
Any musical requests?
The right tune creates the right vibe.
Coldplay?
50 Cent?
Dido?
Inner Relaxation Mix?
Whatever.
You choose.
"Now, what kind of experience do you have?"
"Oh, loads."
You have to be completely honest so I can evaluate you accurately.
"Okay, I guess I practise a lot on the back of my hand."
"On average a person will have over 25,000 snogs in their lifetime."
"So close your eyes, relax, feel the magic."
We're going to do a standard one first.
"Wow, you're a natural."
- Really?
- Not too firm or toothy.
- That's very common with beginners.
- Great.
"Next, movement."
When I move my head in you go the other way.
The boy leads and the girl always fits in.

You need to have a pee.
Tai-Chan.
"If you don't pee, you can't watch TV, can you?"
Hmm?
Hey.
Here we go.
boy:
Why do you have lots of hair growing? man speaking native language:
Because I'm a man. boy speaking native language:
What about women? man:
"Women don't have hair, not as much."
[man speaking native language]
Say good morning to mummy. boy speaking native language:
Good morning. man speaking native language:
Here's the incense. boy speaking native language:
I don't want to. man:
"Daddy will do it alone then, Tai-Chan."
"Tai-Chan, here, sound the bell."
"When daddy has put the incense in, you can sound the bell."
[bell rings]
Not yet.
It's too much.
"Well... ...congrats on the Epstein account, Van Holden."
That should be a nice commish.
I bet your father's election had nothing to do with it.
"Fuck you very much, Todd."
"Gentlemen, if you will excuse me... ...I must partake, once again, in this restaurant's fine facilities."
Fucking lucky bastard.
What the fuck.
Matt Buckner?
Is that you?
"Jesus, Matt, you look like shit."
"Hey, Buckner, do you mind?"
- You said you'd hook me up.
- What?
"When I took the fall for you at Harvard, you said you'd hook me up."
"You gotta be kidding me, man."
"They were your drugs, and you said you had more to lose..."
- ...and that you'd hook me up if-- - All right!
"Yes, I said I would hook you up."
"Jesus, Matt, I--"
I'm in a meeting right now.
Call my office.
Talk to Cindy.
She'll make an appointment for you.
"You gotta be joking me, you spineless shit."
- That you'd hook me up if-- - All right!
"Yes, I said I would--"
- What the fuck is this?
"- Oh, this?"
- It's my ticket back to Harvard.
- Give me that.
I wouldn't do that.
I don't wanna write all those extra essays they make you do.
"I mean, how am I supposed to know what my ""most emotionally significant moment"" was ?"
"So when my ""U"" of ""M"" acceptance came in December, I just said the hell with it."
- Onions ?
- What ?
"You, uh, want onions ?"
"Oh, no, thank you."
So what are you gonna major in ?
"State's got a good business school, and I could probably walk-on to the lacrosse team."
"Well, you've probably got it pretty figured out, then, huh ?"
"I mean, business is okay, and lacrosse is awesome, but... what am I gonna be, a professional lacrosse player ?"
I really have no idea.
Thank God.
I thought I was the only one.
"Well, you're not."
So we're gonna be close next year.
You mean East Lansing and Ann Arbor ?
Yeah.
[ Chuckling ]
[ Stifler ]
What are you talkin' about ?
I can't go to the prom with you.
I'm holding out for someone else.
[ Laughing ]
You gotta be fuckin' kidding me.
"I know it's a long shot, but I figure Paul Finch might ask me."
Finch.
Shit-brick.
"Oh, gosh."
I-I forgot.
[ Stammering ]
You look okay.
When are you available?
"And now, Hong has a report on today's weather."
"When you go out today, be sure to take an umbrella."
We are expecting showers today.
The rain should cool down this unseasonably early heat.
After the showers pass...
It'll rain today.
Soo-jeong
Hwi-chan!
NO ENTRY except Snow White &amp;amp;amp; 7 Dwarfs!
Help me out.
"If this keeps up, our son will be uncontrollable."
Because it keeps getting more serious!
How can you be so laid back about this?
"He's your son too, isn't he?"
All you do is accuse me of being overbearing.
"Oh, whatever!"
It's because you never seem to care about anything.
Okay.
I have an incoming call.
Let's talk at home.
"Yes, Ms. Kim."
How are you?
This is Hwi-chan's picture diary.
Take a look.
"These days especially,"
He seems to have many complaints about you.
"I'm aware that much of what he writes are lies, but..."
- I need to see my son.
"- But, he's in another class now."
"Maybe later, you should talk in a quieter environment."
Please sit down.
I'll take a beautiful picture.
Stop smiling.
"Now, here we go."
Do you know where he is going?
Maybe New York or Paris.
Maybe we should make them meet before he leaves.
You know why none of the Dwarves hooked up with Snow White?
They couldn't tell her how they felt.
Not one!
They were all ashamed of being dwarves.
In fact...
"In fact, Snow White had a thing for short guys."
"When the Prince dismounted from his horse, he was goddamned... uh really short."
"This is a secret, but actually he was the youngest."
"The eighth, who was adopted away."
You know why the bitchy queen died so miserably?
She was tricked by the mirror!
"When you look at your sweetheart, you don't look with a mirror, you look with your heart."
What's all this about?
It doesn't suit you.
It's too heavy.
Hi!
What are you doing here?
I have something to say.
What is it?
I'll tell you later.
- Can't you say it now?
- Later.
"Oh, I better go."
I'll call you then.
I'll be waiting for you!
Hello.
This is how brynza cheese is made.

"- Wait, Georgia."
"- Georgia, don't go."
- Georgia!
"Georgia, what are you doing?"
You'll be late for your first day back at school.
I'm coming.
"- Georgia, Mummy wants you."
- Libby.
"Oh, flip, flipper and flipping hell!"
Excusez-moi.
C'est trés grotesque.
If you don't mind?
Oi!
Cheeky.
"Libby, stop putting Angus in the fridge."
"What do you want for breakfast, munchkin?"
Stuffed olive?
"Just because I did something so beyond the Valley of Sad City last night it doesn't give you the right, as my parents, to humiliate me further."
Today is the first day of my life as the new Georgia.
"And who is she, my little elf?"
"She's not an ""elf""."
Not a munchkin.
"She is a mature, sophisticated woman called Ms Georgia Nicolson."
"So, to celebrate the new me,"
I've decided what I want to do for my birthday party this year.
"I want a proper party in a club, with a D.J."
"You're not old enough to get into a club, never mind hire one out for a party."
"If you haven't noticed, I'm a woman now."
I wear a bra!
Bob.
Are you really trying to damage me permanently?
"There's no way that you are having a party in a club where there's drinking, and it's full of randy men."
Ferhat's daughter.
He wanted to make the guy stay away from his daughter.
- Did the boy harm his daughter or something?
- No.
It's just jealousy.
He wanted to give him a scare.
You know.
- Hello Aziz.
- How can I help you commissary?
"Ferhat's daughter, Dennis Norton."
Check if she entered the country lately.
It can be under either Dennis Norton or Deniz Çoşkun name.
"English passport or Turkish passport, okay?"
- I'll check the last three months.
"- Okay, let me know."
"- Hello, Demet."
- I've just seen your message.
I was suffering in wonder why she didn't reply to my message.
"It said ""call me"" in your message."
What happened?
"What do you mean ""what happened""?"
We didn't see each other in days.
I want to see you.
"Even if it's for only 5 minutes, please."
"Give me some time, please."
I don't feel okay with this.
"I know, I feel uneasy too."
But I miss you.
This can't go on when Kuzey is this much opposed to it.
We can't do it without his consent.
What consent are you talking about?
"Each passing day, his barks are getting thicker."
Just wait.
Woman:
Here father.
(Man:
Is it clean?) Woman:
"Yes, of course."
Man:
Then do as I tell you.
Fold the sari into eight folds.
Woman:
"All right, father."
Man:
"And you, you count that she does it right."
(Boy:
"All right, grand-dad.)"
Man:
"One, two, three, four folds we make."
All the germs from the water we take.
Chorus:
"One, two, three, four folds we make."
All the germs from the water we take.
"Five, six, seven, eight folds we make."
Our drinking water safe we make.
"Five, six, seven, eight folds we make."
Our drinking water safe we make.
Woman:
"Here, father, your eight-times folded cotton sari."
Man:
So this is the cotton sari.
And through this we will have clean water.
(Applause)
I think it's safe to say that all of us here are deeply concerned about the escalating violence in our daily lives.
Please don't freeze me!
Please...
One Snow Maiden won't make a New Year celebration.
There.
And I say - it will.
Absolutely!
Today the Snow Maiden Will visit girls and boys.
"And she will bring them presents, And she will bring them toys."
So you are determined to see in the New Year?
Yes!
And you no longer need the old year?
"No, we don't!"
"Go ahead, see it in then."
But mind you: the little elephant will miss out on his Birthday.
How is that?
Why?
"He hasn't celebrated his Birthday this year, right?"
He hasn't.
And he won't.
Because you don't need this year any more.
But how will he do without his Birthday?
I wanted to give him ripe bananas as a Birthday present.
There won't be any ripe bananas either.
They'll stay green.

What do you think he was going to do with all that?

I think...

- What's so horrible about what he did?
- How long have you worked here?
"- All right, this is my first year..."
- Want some fruit punch?
- But he's a swimmer!
2:12 on his back!
- Those who don't swim don't drown.
It's the other ones who drown.
You think it was easy for me to tear Inochkin from my heart like that?
"- Then bring him back, comrade Dynin!"
I'll take full responsibility!
"- All right, calm down."
- Then I'll go get him?
- Wait till I'm finished talking!

And we're plum grateful cause you worked so hard on them.
Mine's just not as cool as I was imagining.
She asked.
I guess what we're all saying is that they're just not what we had in mind.
That's okay.
Not a problem.
There's plenty more where that came from.
And when it comes back to me--
"And believe me, mate, it fucking does, that madness."
"I mean, when I hear, you know, the--"

But he's dropped out.
We found his journal.
Full of stories about all of us.

He is nothing but a thug!
You are unworthy of being here!
You there!

Are you saying even the deer is first for the prince?
Why you still...!
Take him out and lock him in the storage.
Yes sir.
"Is that you, Kwon-yoo?"
Please forgive me.
I've wrong you by not teaching the lower ones.
Please forgive me.
I told you to stay away from here 'til he leaves.
What?
What are you worried about?
Don't worry.
I hear you are not reading lately.
Is it true that you your time is consumed by hunting?
I was trying to broaden my view like  others by not focusing on study alone...
Was I really asking you that?
What is the reason you keep going to the Shin family's house?
Is it because of his daughter?
Only the Shin family...
She is the first one that I like...
Maybe you can help me get my magic back.
I thought you said you didn't want it anymore.
I don't.
But if it's what you wanted...
I would do that for you.
You're better.
Yeah.
"I shouldn't be, but I didn't have any say in the matter."
I didn't mean to hurt you.
I lost control.
Again.
I knew the risks when I decided to help you.
So...
Was it worth it?
How do you feel?
Different.
A little more myself.
Then we'll continue tomorrow.
What are you talking about?
I turned.
Once.
To break the sire bond.
Turning needs to be painless.
And from what I saw today...
We're still a long way off.
I can't put myself through that again.
You will.
"Because until you're capable of acting on your own free will,"
I'm not going to let you anywhere near my daughter.
You told me your secret.

-Shhh!
Come on out and talk to us.
Leave me alone!
I vant to be alone!
I want to wallow in... ...whatever it is that ponies are supposed to wallow in!
Do ponies wallow in pity?
"Oh, listen to me, I don't even know what I'm supposed to wallow in!"
I'M SO PATHETlC!
Now what do we do?
Panic?
That's your answer for everything!
"Well, we can't just leave Rarity like this."
She'll become a crazy cat lady!
She only has one cat.
Give her time.
Exile...
I guess technically I'd have to move away to live in exile.
Here it is.
That's right.

Everyone has their own problems.
- He's not sick or something I hope?

But he's not in good spirit either.
Don't worry you.
Look...
"He will be out soon, anyway."
The toughest part is over.
How do we know that?
The other man's case is a different one.
There's something about this place.
It fills me with hopelessness.
"No, don't say that, Sami Amca."
Try to think good things and good things will happen.
Kuzey will be free after the first trial and we all welcome him.
He will be with you in your nikah.

Four years later, in 999, the Holy Roman Emperor Otto III gave this district to his sister Adelheid, who was an abbess in Quedlinburg."
"In the center of this area, the ""provincia Gera"", a town with the same name was established. Another document, which is from the year 1237, said for the first time that there was a town called Gera. In this town, the abbesses of Quedlinburg had some officials which were called the ""Vögte"" of Gera. These officials were the ancestors of the counts and princes of Reuß, which reigned in Gera for many years, until the year 1918."

"Apatite is a group of phosphate minerals with high concentrations of OH−, F−, Cl− or ions, respectively, in the crystal."
Apatite is characteristic of biological systems. It is one of a few minerals produced and used by biological micro-environmental systems. It hardness defines 5 on the Mohs scale. Hydroxyapatite is the main component of tooth enamel and bone mineral.
"Much bone material is in a relatively rare form of apatite. In this form most of the OH groups are absent, and there are many carbonate and acid phosphate substitutions."
"Fluorapatite (or fluoroapatite) is more resistant to acid attack than is hydroxyapatite. In the mid-20th century it was discovered that communities whose water supply naturally contained fluorine had lower rates of dental caries. Fluoridated water allows exchange in the teeth of fluoride ions for hydroxyl groups in apatite. Similarly, toothpaste often includes a source of fluoride anions (e.g. sodium fluoride, sodium monofluorophosphate)."

Dimensional analysis
"Dimensional analysis is a method used in chemistry, physics, and other sciences. It is used to convert measurements and to find out something's dimensions. Sometimes it is called factor label method or unit analysis."
"Any math done with numbers must also be done with their unit labels. For example, when dividing 50 miles driven by 2 gallons of gas used, you not only divide 50 by 2 to get a result of 25, you also have to divide ""miles"" by ""gallons"", which gives the unit ""miles/gallon"" or ""miles per gallon"". The final answer is ""25 miles per gallon""."
"Looking at the unit labels can help in choosing what to do with the numbers. For example, to convert 2.3 miles to some number of meters, use the equation ""1609.34 meters equals one mile"" or 1609.34 meters per mile. Using division, the unit labels will be miles/meters/mile, which ends up as miles2/meter, which is not just the meters. With multiplication, the unit labels will be miles × meters/mile. The miles will cancel, leaving just meters."

Planning for Operation Diadem.
"Both sides realised that no result could be achieved until the spring. The Germans built a new defence line, the Caesar C line. The Allies planned an attack in May. This would include attacking the Gustav Line, which was called Operation ""Diadem""."
"In March, the 2nd Italian SS ""Vendetta"" Battalion and 29th Italian SS Rifle Battalion were sent to fight against the Allied forces at the Anzio/Nettuno beach.

The improvements James Watt had introduced made coal a cheap source of energy. As a consequence, Watt's steam engine was more popular, and its use was more widespread. So even though each steam engine used less coal, the demand for coal increased, as there were more steam engines."

The Mormons tried to set up a settlement at Warren, a site just south of Warsaw. In 1841 Willard Richards moved to Warsaw to oversee the settlement of Warren, but due to the public response to writings by Sharp and other problems, the Mormon settlement was abandoned in 1842. In October 1844, a great gathering was announced in Warsaw. Although it claimed to be a ""wolf hunt,"" people knew that the ""wolves"" to be hunted were the Mormons. When Governor Thomas Ford heard about it, he sent militia troops to disperse the gathering. Most Mormons left the area for Utah in 1846."
"The city has a well-preserved downtown with a number of remaining historic businesses. Founded by German immigrants, the Warsaw Brewery opened in 1861 and operated for more than 100 years, ending production in 1971. The facility was renovated and reopened in 2006 as a bar and restaurant."

"The letters č, š, ž and dž are like the English sounds in ""ch""in, ""sh""in, vi""s""ion and ""j""uice."
"The letters ď, ľ, ň, and ť are called “soft consonants” and are pronounced with the blade of the tongue at the roof of the mouth."
"The letters c, dz and j are also soft, like ""ts"" in ba""ts"", ""ds"" in ro""ds"", and ""y"" in ""y""es."
"Signs over a vowel show that the vowel is pronounced long: á, é, í, ó, ý ú. A long vowel is never followed in the next syllable by a short vowel."

"The accent is always on the first syllable of the word. That is different from Russian, for example, in which the stress can be anywhere."

Grammar.
"The grammar is similar to Russian, but there are some differences. Slovak, unlike Russian, has a separate word for “to be”:"
"Unlike English, Slovak does not have articles (such as “the” and “a”)."

And fabled wealth no more doth seem
The idle fancy of a dream — Australia!

"From sunny plain and woodland steep,"
And love and joy bright vigils keep;
Where the glad voice of childish glee
Is mingling with the melody
Of nature's hidden minstrelsy — Australia!
"There is a land where, floating free,"
"From mountain-top to girdling sea,"
A proud flag waves exultingly;
"And FREEDOM'S sons the banner bear,"
"No shackled slave can breathe the air,"
Fairest of Britain's daughters fair — Australia!&lt;/poem&gt;

"These examples above show that the difference between language and dialect is often hard to define, even for linguists, or people who study languages as their job."
"When a speaker of one language can understand what a speaker of another language is saying but not the other way around, it is called asymmetric intelligibility. An example of of this is Portuguese and Spanish. While Portuguese speakers say they can understand Spanish without major problems, Spanish speakers, on the other hand, have a very difficult time understanding Portuguese speakers. This situation is actually quite common across languages."

Is that right?
"Yeah,"
"I wasn't, I mean, I've seen his other movies,"
and I just think he's pretty good.
Yeah.
"But, uh, this movie,"
I'm convinced now he can act.
Uh-huh.
How's his karate?
"Oh, his, his, his karate is pretty good."
I think in this one it wasn't so good.
"I generally, um,"
"movies like that scare me, though."
"I'd be just fine without them, because, you know, kids come running out wanting to beat each other up."
"Well, well they do,"
they get
Fighting.
"I remember when we used to go to see, well I remember when GRAND PRIX came out when I was a kid, and some other movies like that."
We wanted to jump in the cars and race.
Right.
And I suspect today what they see is bound to be what they want to do when they get out of it.
"and,"
"Yeah,"
that's easy.
"I always like to have that, too."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Everybody seems to like that, too."
"I know,"
I don't think I've ever met anyone that didn't.
"No,"
everybody likes that.
Yeah.
"And, then, uh, if you have a nice big roast that you can throw in the oven, then you can put your potatoes and carrots or whatever else all in there, you know. Especially if a pork roast."
"Oh, yeah."
"That's what I love, with my"
"I like it, too."
"I do, too."
"And, uh, other than that, in fact, I'm just thinking of what next weekend when the Super Bowl's on"
Uh-huh.
I've asked a couple people to come over
"and I just, uh, had been thinking what to have for that"
Yeah.
"Well, have you had any good ideas yet?"
No
not yet
"Oh, okay."
"No,"
"and I, you know, I don't want to have to come away from the T V."
I want something that I can just take them and serve them while they're sitting in front of the T V.
Yeah.
"You know, so, I'll think of something, just that we can munch on over there, you know."
Yeah.
uh-huh.
"So, which I've been doing."
"Well, that's a good way to, to make a little extra money."
Uh-huh.
"Well, this is another way that I'm making a little extra money"
"so that was, you know, nice that I tripped over this opportunity"
and you're actually my first call.
"Oh, really?"
Yeah.
Oh.
"I had not, uh, done"
"I, I guess today  today's my first day that I could  even do it."
"Well, have you called?"
Oh.
"Oh, it is?"
"Yeah,"
"you beat me to the punch, here"
"Oh, well, that, that's nice you know."
"I, I was about to call to get, to see if I could get on with somebody,"
so
Uh-huh.
so that was great.
Yeah.
Well I guess that's about all I can talk to about budgets.
"When I was working, I, uh, bought a bond a month out of my, you know,"
they automatically took it out of my  out of my payroll.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"I take, have some money taken it and put in a Four Oh One K,"
"So, what sort of car are you interested in getting next?"
"Well, actually, I love the car I have."
I have a Chrysler LeBaron convertible.
"Okay,"
"well, that's good, because I didn't like Oklahoma that well"
"Okay,"
so what kind of luck you been having with buying and returning products?
"Uh, not too bad really."
"Uh, I had a razor that I got from Christmas that I just, I really didn't want it,"
but I got it anyway
"and, uh, it was a Braun"
and they were real good about taking it back.
"It wasn't a problem at all,"
"so, uh, I was able to get that back pretty easily."
Uh-huh.
"But, uh, I don't know,"
I really haven't returned a whole lot lately.
Have you?
I haven't had to.
"It's, uh, the,"
"every so often,"
"I mean, I, I, I'm almost pushing it myself."
Maybe I'll buy a shirt from G I Joe's
and it shrinks too much
"and say, well, I should have known better,"
"I mean, I bought it from G I Joe's"
Um.
and it was probably made in China by slaves.
Right
"But, uh, they, uh,"
"most of the time pretty careful shopping anyway, I get pretty good stuff."
Yeah.
"I think that, uh, aside from the fact all markets being internationalized"
Right
"like,"
"and it has not, really. Which is a bit of a disappointment."
"But it is very warm here, which is typical for this part of the, time of the year."
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
How about
"I think you are, I think you are earlier than we are, as a rule, aren't you?"
"Your, your, your growing Summer starts a lot earlier than ours."
"It starts in, uh, March as a rule."
Uh-huh.
"See that is quite a bit,"
we are just beginning.
"People are, have got their gardens in, a lot of them now."
We could still have a frost.
"Really,"
this late?
Uh-huh.
Could you have snow?
"Uh, probably not."
"But we have had, we have had a frost as late as, as in June."
"Oh, well, we do not have that problem"
Early June.
"So, but we have also had nice weather. An unusually, uh, nice Spring."
It is almost like an early Summer for us.
"Oh, that is nice."
Uh-huh.
"We could use a little more rain, I believe."
"Uh, well, we will be glad, I will be glad to give you some of ours"
Uh
"Usually we get it in, in great quantities in April and May."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
And then it stops for three months.
Right.
"It's just, it's, it's ridiculous."
"She, She's an emotional victim"
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
"it, it's terrible, you know"
"and,"
"And, you know, the, like you say, the cops are out doing the work day by day have got to have a lot of frustration when they see all their work, basically go out the window."
Yeah.
"Oh, that,"
"oh, man, I, I couldn't be a cop for that, for that very reason, you know, because they do."
"The, the criminal gets right back out"
"and, you know, the cop's just got to go back and, and do his thing all over again, because so many of the crimes are, are done by repeat offenders."
"Yes,"
they are.
"It's,"
"Well, that's about five minutes,"
"so unless you've got something else, well,"
Yeah.
No
It's a pleasure talking with you.
"All right,"
"Ron, we'll see you later."
"Okeydoke,"
good-bye.
Bye-bye.
Okay.
Tell me about your home.
"Well, it's an older home."
It was made back in the early sixties.
It's a pier beam house.
Huh-uh.
Is that right.
Have you heard of it?
"I've, I've seen the ads for it,"
but I'm not real sure what it's about.
"Yeah, um,"
"I actually hadn't heard anything about it,"
"and some friends called up and said do you want to go see this movie,"
"and, and they said it starred, um, Meryl Streep and Mel Brooks,"
at first they told me.
Yeah.
"And I thought, what a strange combination,"
Mel Brooks and Meryl Streep.
That is a strange combination.
"Well, actually, it starred, that, that it's actually Albert Brooks,"
so it's lot better.
Mel Brooks you probably know.
Yeah.
"I know,"
"so it, it was a strange combination."
But it turned out to be a very cute movie.
"I mean, the whole premise is that they go out"
"and, and they die"
"Oh, yeah."
"and they have to,"
Both of them.
Right.
"Both of them are dead,"
"and they happen to meet in this, this town, um, this, this sort of city where you're set up."
"You know, they go"
and they decide if you can move up to the next level.
Oh.
"I don't know if you've ever read Jonathan Livingston Seagull,"
I'm Jennifer.
And where are you from?
Pennsylvania.
"Oh, nice,"
"I'm from Dallas, Texas."
"Oh, really?"
"Yeah,"
"so,"
"Oh, that's neat."
"Well, did you understand what this was for, you know, what it was for, what we,"
"Uh, television shows?"
Yeah
"Sure,"
that sounds good.
Okay
"I, I don't watch too many,"
but we can try it.
Okay.
Are you ready to start?
Sure am.
"Okay,"
just a minute
"Okay,"
I guess we're recording now.
"Yeah,"
okay.
What are your favorite television shows?
"Well, I don't really watch too many T V shows other than, uh, occasionally I'll, I'll turn on DONAHUE because it comes on in the morning when I seem to be getting ready around here."
"Oh, really?"
"And, uh, so if, if there's no one else around, you know, it's just me and I have a chance to listen to something, I'll turn that on, but, uh, just for the, for the conversation factor, I think,"
"but, and then I think I enjoy when I catch it, I don't even know what night it's on, but DESIGNING WOMEN sometimes,"
"Oh, I love that show."
"I just, I don't I think that I perhaps would let them have the boat or something,"
I'd make some quick arrangements
That's true.
and I've told so many stories about the snakes
Uh-huh.
"you know, when they pull in, there's a snake instead of a fish, and things like that"
Yeah.
"I'm just,"
Oh.
"I don't know,"
Yeah.
What's the largest fish you ever caught?
"Uh, gosh,"
"I think it was only like three and a half pounds,"
and for me that's big.
"That's why I'm saying I love to go fishing because I've never caught anything really, really big."
"Uh, so, because it's always been, you know, in the, on a lake, and, uh,"
I know they have bigger fish than that
"but, you know, three and a half pounds, and that was, huge for me,"
"Oh, on a lake,"
yeah.
"On a like that's not a bad size fish. *listen; transcript should probably read ""lake"" not ""like"""
"yeah,"
that's a good size fish
I would be impressed
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"So, uh, but"
"yeah,"
I'd love to go catch like the Marlins or whatever in the deep sea fishing.
I've never done that.
Uh-huh.
"and, and he really,"
"I don't know,"
"he, he's kind of a Dustin Hoffman fan anyway."
But he but before he saw the movie he was like disappointed that Dustin Hoffman would do this
"I'm like, oh, come on."
Just think of what a phenomenal actor Dustin Hoffman is.
Yeah.
"He will do that, to research it and to be able to mimic a person, uh, uh, with the kinds of problems that he had."
And to make it believable.
Yes.
"I mean I was, I was believing it,"
I don't know about any body else
"but I was, it was great."
"Well, I'm sure everybody that saw it was believing it right along with them."
He did great.
"Well it's just, uh, been delightful talking with you."
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
you take care up there
"and, uh, let's hear it for the summertime."
"Absolutely,"
"I'm ready for it,"
but they're predicting some more snow for our direction.
"No,"
oh no.
"Oh well, take care."
Take care now.
"Bye, bye."
"Bye, bye."
Where do you get most of your news?
"I watch the MACNEIL LEHRER news hour,"
and I subscribe to the paper on the weekends.
"I, uh, know the name"
but I haven't been there.
"Uh, that's an old established, uh, restaurant."
I used to go there when I was in college.
Uh-huh.
Where did you go to college?
"Uh, I went to the Naval Academy."
"Oh, the U S ,  Naval Academy?"
"And we used to,  we use to go up there on, uh, for football games sometimes. And have some liberty."
Uh-huh.
"And,"
"yeah,"
"we would go over there to, uh,"
"pretty sure it was original, Original Book Binders"
"I think it was,"
yes.
I'll be darn.
I haven't been back there in years.
"Well, we're, we're supposed to be talking about dinning out,"
"but I'll just make one comment that, uh, I just retired from Penn State,"
"and, uh, all my work has been in research for the Navy"
Okay.
What area?
Underwater acoustics.
Is that right?
"Did you have any dealings with the, uh, underwater sound reference laboratory in Orlando, Florida?"
"I have dealt with nearly all of the, all of the research laboratories that the country has."
"Yes, sir."
"My dad worked there for years, and years."
Uh-huh.
"That's that's, uh, that's where I grew up was down in Orlando."
"So,"
Do you have it there?
I've I think I've seen it around.
"Yes, sir."
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"Well, I love Mexican food myself."
"Oh, do you?"
Yeah.
But you go ahead now
"Oh, we, we do too."
"We, uh, we enjoy Mexican food."
I'm just not impressed with the quality of it.
"It's just primarily the price that's, uh, satisfying at this point."
"But the kids,  seem to enjoy it."
Is that right?
Uh-huh.
"Uh, and, uh, let's see."
"We've, uh, just recently discovered a super restaurant down here"
"but it's, uh, not part of a chain"
it's just an individually owned seafood restaurant.
"But the first one we've been to that, uh, I don't think there was anything on the menu, that, that any of us had"
"that was, uh, not just really super."
It's nice to find a place like that.
"Oh, boy that is wonderful."
Yeah.
"Well, I, I agree with you on that."
And I was really a seafood addict myself.
"I, I love crab meat in particular."
Um.
"I, uh, I can almost live on, on seafood and almost live on the crab meat if I had to."
"Oh, boy."
"Have you ever been to, uh, what is it, Original Book Binders in Philadelphia?"
Uh-huh.
and everybody else in my area worked first shift
Uh-huh.
and our shifts overlapped
Uh-huh.
"so I would come in,"
"and there would be people sitting at my desk, working,"
"and I'm wondering, you know, um, what is this,"
"it's my vitamins,"
"I wonder, what is, you know, yeah, what is,"
"why are they working at my desk,"
and can I have it back.
Yeah.
"Can I have it back soon, maybe."
"Then you start missing stuff,"
and.
"Oh, yeah,"
"no mommy is going to take the vitamins,"
"I'm sorry,"
I have
That's okay.
"See that would, that would make me really mad,"
"because you can always tell when someone's touched your stuff,"
"just because,"
"I mean, I know I have everything like a certain way"
and you know how it looks and everything.
"Oh, yeah."
"Well, you know how you left it the day before."
Uh-huh. child_talking
"That would bother me, definitely."
"Oh, yeah,"
"so, that's, child_talking"
"and I was just like, we've got to quit this."
And she's like no I don't want her to starve.
But I don't want to make her eat something she doesn't want to eat
"Oh, shoot."
"My mom would be like, uh eat it or don't eat anything."
Eat this or <laughter>.
That's right.
"So, I can see the concerns on what different people want."
Yeah.
"Because some,"
"I mean, you know, if I was setting up a daycare, there would be so many needs you would have to customize your service to."
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Cause some parents won't put up anything. Where others would.
"I think,"
"yeah,"
"I think the best way to go would just be to, to be able to do it out of your basement."
Uh-huh.
"And just have like at the most, like ten kids."
And all from maybe people that you know type of thing.
No.
Instead of trying actually to set up a daycare where you don't know the people coming in and ...
That's true.
"I, I'd love to do it."
But I just don't trust people now.
There's too many lawsuits.
Yeah.
"I just, I think it's a bigger risk than ..."
More than what it's worth?
Yeah.
Yeah.
It would scare me.
and they put him on the scale
and he's up to ninety four now.
Oh.
"But he's not a real, he's not a real tall, uh, dog for a Golden Retriever."
"He's kind of stocky, shorter and stockier."
Um.
"But,"
Is he good with family?
He is.
"It's, uh, just me and my wife"
"and, uh, he's kind of our temporary substitute for having kids."
We treat him like our kid right now so he's spoiled rotten.
"Yeah,"
I can understand that
"Because I,"
Get away with that a little bit more with pets than you can with kids
Uh-huh.
How about you?
"Well, we have a cat who's also about four years old."
Oh.
"And he's our spoiled child right now, too"
Uh-huh.
And he also sheds a lot.
Yeah.
"But, we, uh, we hope to get a Golden Retriever someday."
"But we figure we'll get the kids and then the, the dog"
That's probably a good idea.
They're good though.
"Uh, have you ever had a Retriever before?"
"No,"
but my husband had one when he was growing up.
"Because I, I find that they're good around other animals like cats and other dogs."
So you do spend less time then?
Yeah
"because they don't want to know, they almost don't want to know us."
They want to be with their friends.
How old are your kids?
Are they married or what?
"Uh, yes,"
"I have, uh, two married, two and then two almost married"
"and the other two, I'm not sure."
"Well, Two two, two, uh, uh, for sure are single."
"Oh, boy, you have a lot of kids."
"Yeah,"
"we have, between the spouse and myself we have six."
"Oh, well, that's kind of nice, though."
"You you shouldn't be lonesome on a holiday, huh?"
Because I came with a split family
"and she had,"
"Well, no,"
there is so much of them are gone
and they're doing their own things
"and and a lot of times they, they've got, you know, uh when the holidays,"
"Well, that's true."
"They have to see their other parent, I guess too."
Yeah
"and sometimes they want to do their own thing,"
so sometimes it's just spouse and me.
I know.
"And, and you know what?"
What?
Sometimes that's okay.
I know
"Because,"
and the they like it all right.
Yeah.
"And, um, then sometimes we do something,"
"it has to be fast because they're on their way to school,"
"we do like Eggo waffles and stuff like that,"
but.
"Oh, uh-huh,"
yeah.
"Yeah,"
"so, I try to, uh,"
and sometimes we do eggs if I get up early enough to do that.
"I used to do them in the microwave,"
but they don't like that.
"Oh, do they get rubbery,"
"or,"
Um.
I've never tried it.
It it depends.
If you let them cook too long then they'll turn a little bit gray.
Uh-huh.
You can tell if they've gone to long because they'll turn a little bit gray
"and they will be a little harder,"
and I don't like that.
Yeah.
"So you have to just let it cook a little bit less than what it says in, if you have a microwave book,"
"but you cook it a little bit less and then let it sit with a, like a plate over the top."
Oh.
And let it steam.
Uh-huh.
"And then, and then stir it up."
Huh.
"Yeah,"

"Sevier was born in 1896 in Madison Parish, Louisiana, a son of the former Roxie Roberta Allen and James Douglas Sevier, Sr., a native of Port Gibson, in Claiborne County in southwestern Mississippi. His parents moved to Madison Parish in 1880, where his father became a planter. Sevier attended local segregated schools for his lower education. He graduated in 1917 from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge."
"His father's family were descended from John Sevier, a veteran of the American Revolution, and pioneer and first governor of Tennessee. He was the namesake of Sevierville in Sevier County in eastern Tennessee. His line became prominent in northeastern Louisiana. One of Henry's cousins was Andrew L. Sevier, who served as a Louisiana State Senator with repeated reelection, from 1932 until his death in office in 1962."
"During World War I, Henry Sevier served as a second lieutenant in the United States Army. He was wounded sixteen times in France, and received the Purple Heart and the Silver Star medals."
"After the war, in 1918 Sevier married the former Retta Brooks (1899-1992) of Shreveport in northwestern Louisiana. The couple had three children: Carolyn S. Yerger (1921-1997), who married Rufus Taft Yerger, Sr. (1914-1973); Roberta Sevier Gandy (1924-2006), who married Robert Wyly Gandy, Jr. (1915-1987), and Henry Clay Sevier, Jr. (born c. 1926), who became an attorney and a partner in his father's law firm for a time. He later moved to Covington in St. Tammany Parish."
"Sevier and his wife went to New York City, where he completed postgraduate work at Columbia University in 1921. He graduated from the Louisiana State University Law Center, and they settled in Tallulah."
"There Sevier entered into practice with Jefferson B. Snyder of Tallulah, the political boss of the delta parishes in northeastern Louisiana. Snyder wielded power for more than 40 years as the regional district attorney, from 1904 to 1948."
"Sevier decided to enter politics. A member of the Democratic Party, in 1936 Sevier was elected to the Louisiana House from Madison Parish to succeed fellow Democrat, Mason Spencer of Tallulah. Spencer was the husband of his Sevier cousin, Rosa Vertner Sevier Spencer (1891-1978)."
"Sevier was elected a few months after the assassination of Governor Huey Pierce Long, Jr.. At the time, there was much voter sympathy for the pro-Long faction. The staunchly anti-Long Mason Spencer had earlier announced that he would run for governor, but he withdrew before the election. Richard Leche of New Orleans, the choice of the Long faction, won the election uncontested."
"After his law partner Snyder died in 1951, Sevier formed the Sevier, Yerger, and Sevier law firm in Tallulah. (His son Henry became an attorney and his partner in the firm for a period of time.) The senior Sevier was also president of the Tallulah State Bank and Trust Company. Given these additional responsibilities, and having served eight terms in the state house, he chose not to run again after his term ending in 1952."
"Like Snyder, Sevier was active in the Democratic State Central Committee. He was the national committeeman during the first administration of Governor Jimmie Davis. Afterward he was selected as the state Democratic Party chairman under Governor Earl Kemp Long."

= = = Mitzi Hoag = = =
"Margaret Myrtle ""Mitzi"" Hoag (September 25, 1932 – February 26, 2019) was an American actress. Over the course of her career, she appeared in more than 73 different TV shows and movies. Notable among these are recurring roles in ""We'll Get By"", ""Bonanza"", ""Here Come the Brides"", and ""The Partridge Family""."
"Hoag was raised in North Olmsted, Ohio, near Cleveland, where she was born. Her father, John C. Hoag, was a supervisor for the A&P store chain. She graduated from John Marshall High School in 1949. A straight-A student and head majorette of the marching band, she appeared in numerous high school stage productions, already using the nickname ""Mitzi"". After high school, Hoag attended Shimer College, then located in Mount Carroll, Illinois, completing her degree in two years under the radically flexible University of Chicago curriculum of Robert Maynard Hutchins. She chose Shimer for its small classes and the opportunity for horseback riding. Because Shimer was then closely affiliated with the University of Chicago, she is sometimes reported as having graduated from there."
"When Hoag graduated from Shimer at age 19 in 1952, she was one of the first five Shimer students to receive the bachelor's degree. She was the only woman in the graduating class. She earned a bachelor of arts in general education, and became a certified teacher, but her experiences with drama at Shimer turned her towards an acting career. After leaving Shimer, Hoag studied drama at the graduate level at Case Western Reserve University for two years."
"In the mid-1950s, Hoag moved to New York, where she continued her study of acting with Herbert Berghof. She was cast in multiple off-Broadway shows, but these were all cancelled due to funding problems. Finally, she starred in the title role of the 1958 off-Broadway hit ""Heloise"", an adaptation by James Forsyth of the story of Heloise and Abelard. The play, which won considerable critical acclaim, was produced primarily by erstwhile actors and staffers of Case Western's Eldred Theatre."
"Hoag subsequently went to Hollywood, on her mother's advice. There she married Stephen Wolfson, who had a bit part in ""Heloise"", and later became a teacher. They had a daughter together, but subsequently divorced."
"In Hollywood, Hoag at first worked as a stage actress. She parlayed a successful stage performance as Annie Sullivan in ""The Miracle Worker"" into screen roles, starting with a role in the movie ""Tammy and the Doctor"", and continuing with numerous TV appearances."
"In the late 1960s, Hoag had a recurring role in ""Here Come the Brides"" in the late 1960s. In addition, from 1966 to 1972, she appeared frequently in the TV show ""Bonanza"" as Alice Brenner. In 1976, she appeared in the drama ""Family"" as Clara Briault. During this period, she also appeared in several movies, including ""Play It as It Lays"", ""Pieces of Dreams"", and ""Devil's Angels""."
"She also played Natalie Green's adoptive mother on ""The Facts of Life"", a role she played through all 9 seasons."
"Hoag's first and only starring role in a TV series came in 1975, when she appeared as the mother Liz Platt in the CBS sitcom ""We'll Get By"", starring opposite Paul Sorvino. A family sitcom, the show was created by Alan Alda, and modeled after his own domestic life. The show ran to twelve episodes, filmed in front of a live studio audience. Originally scheduled for September 1974, the show did not air until March 1975, in a time slot facing ""Chico and the Man"", one of NBC's most popular programs. It was not renewed."

When dashing forward at full speed, the vessels sprayed water high in the air, earning the nickname ""the fountains"" from Finnish sailors."
"On 1 October 1941 ""Sisu"", together with ""Nuoli"", was patrolling east of Gogland when it came across a large, stationary Soviet minesweeper of the ""Fugas"" class.

= = = 8-demicubic honeycomb = = =
"The 8-demicubic honeycomb, or demiocteractic honeycomb is a uniform space-filling tessellation (or honeycomb) in Euclidean 8-space. It is constructed as an alternation of the regular 8-cubic honeycomb."
"It is composed of two different types of facets. The 8-cubes become alternated into 8-demicubes h{4,3,3,3,3,3,3} and the alternated vertices create 8-orthoplex {3,3,3,3,3,3,4} facets ."
"The vertex arrangement of the 8-demicubic honeycomb is the D lattice. The 112 vertices of the rectified 8-orthoplex vertex figure of the ""8-demicubic honeycomb"" reflect the kissing number 112 of this lattice. The best known is 240, from the E lattice and the 5 honeycomb."
formula_1 contains formula_2 as a subgroup of index 270. Both formula_1 and formula_2 can be seen as affine extensions of formula_5 from different nodes:
"The D lattice (also called D) can be constructed by the union of two D8 lattices. This packing is only a lattice for even dimensions. The kissing number is 240. (2 for n<8, 240 for n=8, and 2n(n-1) for n>8). It is identical to the E8 lattice. At 8-dimensions, the 240 contacts contain both the 2=128 from lower dimension contact progression (2), and 16*7=112 from higher dimensions (2n(n-1))."
"The D lattice (also called D and C) can be constructed by the union of all four ""D8 lattices"": It is also the 7-dimensional body centered cubic, the union of two 7-cube honeycombs in dual positions."
"The kissing number of the D lattice is 16 (""2n"" for n≥5). and its Voronoi tessellation is a quadrirectified 8-cubic honeycomb, , containing all trirectified 8-orthoplex Voronoi cell, ."
There are three uniform construction symmetries of this tessellation. Each symmetry can be represented by arrangements of different colors on the 256 8-demicube facets around each vertex.
= = = St. Catharine Academy = = =
"St. Catharine High School is an all-girls, private, Roman Catholic high school in the Bronx, New York. It is located within the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York."
"The Sisters of Mercy, founded by Mother Catherine McAuley in Dublin, Ireland, opened an academy in the Washington Heights section of New York City in September 1889. The classes included were grades 1 through 12. At that time, the first academy resembled the large estates which surrounded it. Toward the end of the 19th century as registration increased, the Sisters erected a new building across the street at 539 West 152nd Street. In 1900 the University of the State of New York granted a Regents charter to the school."
The rapid growth of the area and the great increase in enrollment showed the inadequacy of the accommodations. The elementary grades in the academy were discontinued and these classrooms were used for high school students.
"Construction of the Air Station was undertaken in 1936 with funds provided by the Federal Public Works Administration. The M.H. Golden Co. was the contractor. The area had to be dredged from the bay and filled and brought up to grade level. Long piles were driven in the soil at the building sites for stabilization. The contract called for one hangar with lean-to, a mess hall, a barracks building, two aprons, a runway to the field, and a small wooden seaplane ramp. During and prior to this time a Coast Guard Air Detachment was maintained on Lindbergh Field in one-half of a commercial hangar. This detachment was led by Elmer F. Stone after May 21, 1935. Stone is one of Coast Guard Aviation's most colorful figures."
"In April 1937, the Air Station was commissioned. The first commanding officer was LT S.C. Linholm, who later became Commander of Eleventh Coast Guard District. There had, however, been an Air Patrol Detachment active in San Diego between 1934 and 1937. At the time this was the only Coast Guard air base in California."
"Coast Guard Air Station San Diego saw no radical changes as a result of the declaration of war in 1941. The unit continued to watch and report the activities of fishing boats in the area, to provide assistance in cases of distress, and to provide transportation by air for other government departments. Air Sea Rescue operations were given primary focus from October 1943 on. Between January 1 and December 1, 1944, a total of 124 aircraft went down in waters covered by this unit. Of the 201 pilots and crewmen involved, 137 were saved, 59 were killed outright by mid-air collisions or impact with the water, two are missing, and three who might have been saved were lost because of improper equipment or the failure to locate them promptly."
"In June 1972 a major rebuilding plan was proposed. On January 26, 1983, a ceremony was held signaling the completion of the project."
"In April 1997, the Port of San Diego began a master plan for San Diego International Airport. The goal of the plan is to provide incremental, cost-effective improvements to SDIA to meet the region's near-term demand for air service while a long-term regional air transportation strategy is developed in collaboration with the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) and other transportation agencies."

"Constantine ""Gene"" Mako ( ; January 24, 1916 – June 14, 2013) was an American tennis player and art gallery owner. He was born in Budapest, capital of Hungary. He won four Grand Slam doubles titles in the 1930s. Mako was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, Rhode Island, in 1973."
"His father, Bartholomew Mako (), graduated from the Budapest Academy of Fine Arts in 1914. He started to work as a draftsman for his mentor Viktor Madarász. He was an avid soccer player himself. He fought in World War I. After the war, he left Hungary with his wife, Georgina Elizabeth Farkas Mako () and only son, traveling first to Italy, then stopping for three years in Buenos Aires, Argentina, before settling in Los Angeles, California. There he created works for public places like churches, libraries and post offices. Gene attended to the Glendale High School and the University of Southern California although he was offered a Hungarian University Scholarship in the meantime. He quit before graduation."
"In 1934 he won the NCAA championships in singles and the doubles (with Phillip Caslin) while playing for the University of Southern California where he lettered at USC for three years (1934-36-37). He also won the boys' singles event at the U.S. National Championships in 1932 and 1934 and the boys' doubles in 1932, 1933 and 1934."
"Mako was especially successful as a doubles player with his partner and friend Don Budge. They competed in seven Grand Slam finals, four of which they won."
"In 1936 Gene Mako and Alice Marble won the finals at the US Mixed Doubles Championships against Sarah Palfrey and Don Budge (6:3 and 6:2). They won the Newport Casino Invitational Tournament three consecutive times, from 1936 to 1938."
"From 1935 to 1938 Mako was a member of the United States Davis Cup team and played in eight ties. The US team won the Davis Cup in 1937, defeating the United Kingdom in the final at Wimbledon, and again in 1938 in the final against Australia at the Germantown Cricket Club in Philadelphia. As a Davis Cup player he compiled a record of six wins and three losses."
"Mako was in the U.S. Top Ten in 1937 and 1938 (reaching as high as No. 3), and was ranked World No. 8 by A. Wallis Myers of The Daily Telegraph in 1938. That year he reached the U.S. final at Forest Hills versus his double partner, Don Budge, who was in pursuit of the first Grand Slam. Unseeded, Mako reached his only major singles final on victories over sixth-seed Frank Kovacs and the third and first foreign seeds, Franjo Punčec and John Bromwich."
"In 1939 he was suspended and banned from playing for breaching the amateur rules. He and Don Budge allegedly accepted a sum of 20A£ for an exhibition match in Australia, which was against amateurism. Afterwards he continued to play tennis at that time during the Second World War while serving in the Navy. He also played professional basketball while stationed in Norfolk, Virginia."
In 1973 Mako was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame. In 1999 he was elected to the University of Southern California (USC) Athletic Hall of Fame.
"He possessed strong serve and powerful smashes but due to several injuries in his career, he had to give up his power game. He preferred a volleying style, which he perfected with quickness, good angle selection and pacing paired with strategy."
"Apart from being a sportsman, Mako composed music in his early 20s. He's the author of two songs, namely ""Lovely as Spring"" and ""What Did You Dream Last Night?"". He also starred in the 1938 musical ""Happy Landing"" and the 1941 war comedy ""Caught in the Draft"", although he remained uncredited in both movies. Mako married actress Laura Mae Church in Manhattan in 1941. A month later, World War II broke out, and he joined the United States Navy. After this, he worked in a broadcasting studio. After his retirement, he designed tennis courts. His wife worked as an interior designer. He was involved in wrestling and was hired as a coach at the California Institute of Technology while also coaching the basketball team. He owned Gene Mako Galleries in Los Angeles, California. He also published a book about his father titled ""Bartholomew Mako: A Hungarian Master, 1890-1970"". In the final decade of his life, he taught art to up-and-coming artists. He died in 2013 at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, aged 97, of pneumonia."

A slice knot is a type of mathematical knot.
"In knot theory, a ""knot"" means an embedded circle in the 3-sphere"
and that the 3-sphere can be thought of as the boundary of the four-dimensional ball
"A knot formula_3 is slice if it bounds a nicely embedded 2-dimensional disk ""D"" in the 4-ball."
"What is meant by ""nicely embedded"" depends on the context, and there are different terms for different kinds of slice knots. If ""D"" is smoothly embedded in ""B"", then ""K"" is said to be smoothly slice. If ""D"" is only locally flat (which is weaker), then ""K"" is said to be topologically slice."
The following is a list of all slice knots with 10 or fewer crossings; it was compiled using the Knot Atlas:
"6, formula_4, formula_5, formula_6, formula_7, formula_8, formula_9, formula_10, formula_11, formula_12, formula_13, formula_14, formula_15, formula_16, formula_17, formula_18, formula_19, formula_20, formula_21, formula_22 and formula_23."
Every ribbon knot is smoothly slice.
An old question of Fox asks whether every slice knot is actually a ribbon knot.
The signature of a slice knot is zero.
The Alexander polynomial of a slice knot factors as a product formula_24 where formula_25 is some integral Laurent polynomial. This is known as the Fox–Milnor condition.

Kong Jie (; born 25 November 1982) is a Chinese professional Go player.
"Kong Jie turned professional in 1994 at the age of 12. He was promoted to 7-dan after eight years in 2001. In 2004 he was sent into the Teda Cup as China's representative against Lee Chang-ho and Yoda Norimoto. Kong Jie is China's 29th professional 9-dan, doing so by being runner-up in the 13th Samsung Cup, and entering the finals of the Asian TV Cup for the first time. In 2009, Kong Jie achieved a major international breakthrough by winning the Asian TV Cup—defeating Korea's top three players of Lee Sedol, Lee Chang-ho and Kang Dongyun respectively. His win marked the end of several years of poor personal international results. Later in the year, Kong Jie followed up by reaching the semi-finals of the 14th Samsung Cup and won the title by defeating his two compatriots Gu Li and Qiu Jun."
"In 2010, Kong Jie passed the preliminary rounds of the 14th LG Cup to face former champion Lee Chang-ho in the finals. Kong won the match 2–0 and also the tournament. Later in the year, Kong Jie successfully defended his Asian TV Cup, defeating Korea's Lee Chang-ho and Japan's Yuki Satoshi. He followed that with another big win over a red hot Lee Sedol, to win the 23rd Fujitsu Cup. He arguably cemented his status as the 2010 world's strongest Go player. In 2011, Kong overcame compatriot Meng Tailing to again reach the LG Cup Final, but was unable to defend his title against another compatriot, Piao Wenyao, thus allowing the latter to win his first world title and be promoted to 9-dan professional on the merit of winning a world championship."
"This was the last international final Kong played in. Within the next few years, with the rise of new 1990s generation professionals and the increased competition at the international level, only Gu Li and Lee Sedol would continue to have high tournament placings in big international tournaments. During the 15th Samsung Cup, Kong defeated a soon to be wedded Lee Chang-Ho before succumbing to Kim Ji-Seok in the quarterfinals. The match, with Kong playing Black, turned out to be a crucial ""fight to the death"" of both sides' dragons, but Kong miscalculated a combination by Kim on move 150, and on move 202, resigned, thus failing to defend his crown."
Kong Jie is considered to be an expert at life and death problems. In China he is known as the King of Tsumego (King Kong).
"King's latest record is another solo effort, released independently, and features King on a broad range of instruments, including cello, drums, keyboard, bass, and guitar. In addition to playing all the instruments, King engineered and produced the record. His Myspace page announced the title of the new album as ""Humilitas Occidit Superbiam"", and it was subsequently released digitally in November 2009."
"Justin has admitted to have spent ""more than his means"" on his gear. The following list includes some of his acoustic guitars, as well as the electric guitars he has owned and performed with."
"Justin first approached Mike Doolin, an innovative luthier with an excellent reputation, to build a double-neck steel-string guitar. Justin wanted a guitar with two identical DADGAD-tuned necks to expand on his unique two-handed tapping style. The challenge was to design an instrument that could handle 340 pounds of string tension and yet still be acoustically responsive. The instrument features many of Doolin's innovations, including a pinless bridge, and adjustable neck angles. Doolin and King chose an instrument with a modified jumbo-style body, cocobolo (rosewood) back and sides, and a redwood top. The redwood is incredibly strong and stable, while at the same time being dynamic and possessing a rich acoustic tone. They also decided on using B-Band acoustic pickups, which are known for their excellent fidelity. The result is an unprecedented instrument, completely unique, with a wonderful tone. This can be seen on the song ""Knock on Wood"" and ""Crown"" (unofficial title)."

"Eaton Chapel is a private chapel to the north of Eaton Hall in Eaton Park, near the village of Eccleston, Cheshire, England. It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building."
"Building of the chapel commenced in 1869, soon after the estate was inherited by Hugh Grosvenor, the 3rd Marquess of Westminster, in conjunction with a major rebuilding of the hall. Grosvenor became the 1st Duke of Westminster in 1874. He appointed Alfred Waterhouse as architect and the building was completed in 1884. When the Waterhouse hall was demolished in 1963, the chapel was retained."
"The chapel is built in buff sandstone with a grey slate roof. Internally the stone is in pink and buff bands. Its plan consists of a five-bay nave that is continuous with a three-bay chancel. The chancel terminates with a three-sided apse containing the altar. The chapel is oriented with the altar at the west end. The last bay at the east end constitutes a narthex (ante-chapel) with a gallery. On the south of the chapel is a tower which is free-standing, but joined to the chapel at the lower two storeys, and by a bridge above. At the southeast corner is a staircase turret. On the south side of the nave and in the apse are two-light windows and at the east end behind the gallery is a four-light window. The tower has six stages and contains tall lancet bell-openings. Above these is the clock stage, corbelled out from the shaft of the tower and surmounted by pinnacles at each corner. On each side is a clock face made from vitreous enamel; each clock face is in diameter. Over this is a spire decorated with gables and pinnacles. The staircase turret is surmounted by a spire."
"The narthex at the east end has a groin vaulted oak roof, and is paved with black marble and with encaustic tiles. A stone screen leads into the nave. This also has a groin vaulted roof, but built in stone. Between the nave and the chancel is a low alabaster screen. A continuation of this screen leads to the pulpit: this is also constructed in alabaster with Devonshire marble columns. The reredos and the font are also made in alabaster. The benches in the nave and chancel are in walnut and have carved ends. In the chancel is a recumbent effigy in alabaster of Constance, 1st Duchess of Westminster, by Joseph Boehm. For the effigy, Boehm worked from plaster casts of the face and hands taken after her death."
"The stained glass in the windows of the south side of the nave and the apse, and the mosaics in the blank on the north side of the nave were designed by Frederic Shields. These were commissioned in 1876 and made by Heaton, Butler and Bayne. The two-manual organ is in an alcove on the south side of the chancel. It was built in 1870–71 by Charles Whitley of Chester and is still in good working order. The clock tower contains a carillon of 28 bells which were cast by Chavalier Severian Van Aerschodt of Louvain; it plays 31 tunes. The clock was manufactured by Gillet's of Croydon."
"The chapel continues to be the private chapel of the Grosvenor family and is used for family christenings, confirmations and memorial services. Each December it is made available for up to eight charities to arrange carol concerts. The chapel is also open to the general public on three annual open days."

"Bellanger was a favourite model of the sculptor Albert-Ernest Carrier-Belleuse, who represented her as an allegory of spring in an elegant terracotta bust in which is today in the Musée Carnavalet in Paris."
"In a painting by Édouard Manet in 1863, Olympia, the artist endeavoured to evoke an odalisque, who receives a bouquet of flowers brought by her maid. According to Phyllis A. Floyd's study, ""The Puzzle of Olympia"", he gave the painting the features of Marguerite Bellanger."
"In June 1863, while on a carriage ride in Saint-Cloud Park, Emperor Napoleon III spotted Bellanger sheltering from the rain beneath a tree. Napoleon was bewitched by his new encounter."
"Marguerite Bellanger become the mistress of the Emperor. Soon, with the knowledge of all including the Empress Eugénie, she followed him on private and official trips."
"Amongst his numerous presents, the Emperor gave her two houses, one at 57 rue des Vignes, Passy, the other at Saint-Cloud, in the park of Montretout, which had a back door to the gardens of the castle."
"In February 1864, Marguerite Bellanger gave birth to a son; whom she named Charles Jules Auguste François Marie Leboeuf."
"After the birth, Bellanger retired for a while to rue de Launay in Villebernier and received a pension. In November 1864, the Emperor offered ""Margot"" the castle of Villeneuve-sous-Dammartin, near Meaux. The Emperor also gave the child a boarding house and the castle of Mouchy, in the Oise, which he had bought very discreetly some time before. Bellanger became usufructuary of the property."
"Always seductive, Bellanger still attracted men when she settled in Villeneuve-sous-Dammartin at the end of 1864. Among her lovers were General de Lignières and, according to some sources, Léon Gambetta."
"She was the subject of caricatures and gossip. Paul Hadol, in his series of caricatures on the ""Imperial Menagerie"", portrayed her as a cat."
"Her affair with the emperor continued during the Franco-Prussian War, and even during his captivity in Westphalia. In 1873, when the emperor died in exile in England, she travelled to England to mourn her 'dear lord'."
"At the fall of the Empire, she again traveled to England and married William Louis Kulbach, a British army officer. The presence of the couple William Kulbach and Marguerite Bellanger is recorded in Monchy-Saint-Éloi (Oise), France in the census of 1872. Bellanger gave her age as 30 years, whereas according to the data in her biography, she was 33 or 34."
"She lived the rest of her life as a member of the upper class, devoting herself to charity and good works."
"Marguerite Bellanger died at the age of 48 on 23 November 1886 after contracting a cold during a walk in the park of the castle at Villeneuve-sous-Dammartin. According to the declaration of death, her husband lived in Pau. The religious ceremony took place on 27 November at the church of Saint-Pierre-de-Chaillot and she was interred in Montparnasse Cemetery."
"Her brother Jules, who served as a gardener, benefited from her estate. He built a beautiful house in Brain-sur-Allonnes, which is now the town hall."
"Her only son, Charles Leboeuf, made a career as an officer and died without issue on 11 December 1941. He was buried with his mother."
"Bellanger's character appears in Christian-Jaque's film Nana (1955), in which her character is performed by Nicole Riche."
"Marguerite Bellanger has been associated with a chocolate specialty: a praline was created to honour her. A chocolatier from Saumur designed, with the help of archivists of the city of Saumur, a specialty ""The Marguerite""."
"The coat of arms of Marguerite Bellanger is reproduced on the chocolates: a daisy with a heart of silver and gold petals. The praline ""with four spices"" (cloves, cinnamon, pepper and nutmeg) echos the qualities that the second Empire sought to give her: a varnish of heart, a spicy charm and an imperial dress."

"João Oliveira dos Santos (born 15 January 1933) better known as Mestre João Grande, is a Grão-Mestre (Grand Master) of the Afro-Brazilian martial art of capoeira angola who has contributed to the spread of this art throughout the world. He was a student of the ""father of Angola"", Mestre Pastinha, and has an academy in New York City."
"Mestre João Grande was born in the village of Itagi in the south of the Brazilian state of Bahia. As a child he worked alongside his family in the fields. At the age of 10 he saw ""corta capim"" for the first time. This is a movement performed by crouching down, extending one leg in front and swinging it around in a circle, hopping over it with the other leg. Fascinated, he asked what it was called and was told that it was ""the Dance of the Nagos"" — a dance of the African descendants in the city of Salvador. The Yoruba of Southwest Nigeria had a major cultural influence in Salvador, which was considered the Black Rome of Brazil. But the dance was actually of Central African origin— it was Capoeira. João didn't learn the correct name of the movement until many years later, but it changed his life forever. At the age of ten he left home in search of ""the Dance of the Nagos""."
"Ten years later, he ended up in Brazil, the birthplace of capoeira as we know it, where he saw a proper capoeira roda for the first time. Present were mestres Menino Gordo, João Pequeno, who was there with his first teacher, Mestre Barbosa, and Cobrinha Verde, one of the most skillful players of that era."
"João Grande asked Mestre Barbosa if he could study and Mestre Barbosa sent him to João Pequeno, who later became his closest associate in capoeira. João Pequeno sent him to Mestre Pastinha who had a famous academy in the Cardeal Pequeno neighborhood of Brotas. João Grande requested permission to join his academy, and Pastinha accepted João as a student at the age of twenty, relatively late in capoeira life. While studying, João Grande worked as a longshoreman, playing after work or on his few days off."
"Mestre João Grande eventually became such an acclaimed capoeirista that when Carybé, a painter famous for his documentation of African Culture in Bahia, chose to do studies of capoeira he chose João Grande as a model."
"João Grande and João Pequeno are featured in numerous films of capoeira including one in which they demonstrate the knife techniques of the art. In 1966 João Grande travelled to Senegal with Mestre Pastinha to demonstrate capoeira at the first World Festival of Black Arts in Dakar. He was awarded his Diploma of capoeira from Pastinha in 1968 making him a full-fledged master of capoeira Angola. He subsequently toured Europe and the Middle East with Viva Bahia, a pioneering group that performed Afro-Brazilian folk arts such as capoeira, samba, maculelê, candomblé and puxada da rede."
"Eventually Pastinha's academy fell on hard times. Pastinha, was asked by the government to vacate his building for renovations, but the space was never returned to him. Instead it became a restaurant with entertainment, now called SENAC. Pastinha died broke and bitter about his treatment, but never regretted living the life of a capoeirista."
"João Grande returned when Mestre Moraes and Mestre Cobra Mansa persuaded him to come out of retirement in the mid-1980s. He began to teach with their organization Grupo Capoeira Angola Pelourinho. In 1989 he was invited by Jelon Vieira to tour the United States. The tour was a tremendous success. In 1990 he returned to present capoeira at the National Black Arts Festival in Atlanta, Georgia and at the Schomberg Center for Research for Black Culture in New York City. João Grande decided he liked the US and has been teaching in New York City ever since."
"In 1995 he received a Doctorate of Humane Letters from Upsala College, East Orange, New Jersey. In 2001 he was awarded the National Heritage Fellowship from the NEA, which is one of the most prestigious awards given to practitioners of traditional arts in the US. He has also recorded an audio CD and several DVDs featuring himself and his students, as well as other illustrious figures of capoeira Angola."

Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality Archanes-Asterousia, of which it is a municipal unit. The municipal unit has an area of . Population 5,042 (2011). It is also the archaeological site of an ancient Minoan settlement in central Crete. The discovery of ancient roads leading from Archanes to Juktas, Anemospilia, Xeri Kara and Vathypetro indicate that Archanes was an important hub in the region during Minoan times. Archaeological evidence indicates that ancient Archanes spread out over the same area as the modern town of Archanes."
"In 1912, Xanthoudides noted the importance of Archanes, but Sir Arthur Evans was the first to characterize the site as palatial, declaring that Archanes was likely a Summer Palace for the Knossos kings. Spyridon Marinatos and N. Platon excavated minor areas in the region, but nothing supported Evans' theory. In 1964, Yannis Sakellarakis dug trial trenches at the Tourkoyeitonia site and uncovered the first evidence of a palace site. Since 1966, Archanes has been excavated by the Greek Archaeological Society under the supervision of John Sakellarakis and Efi Sapouna-Sakellarakis."
"In the Minoan era, aqueducts delivered water to Kephala Hill from spring water sources at Archanes, which are also the source of the Kairatos River."
"Troullos is the easternmost site of the Archanes settlement. Tourkoyeitonia, in central Archanes, is the site of its palace, likely built in the Middle Minoan period. Excavations began here in 1964 by J. Sakellarakis. It contains features such as ashlar blocks, poros-stone plaques and blocks, plaster, wood, stucco floor tiles, gypsum, kouskoura slabs, mud bricks, ironstone blocks, schist plaques, blue marble flooring, incurved concave altars, wooden columns and pillars, frescoes and Polytheron doorways. A variety of Porphyrite stone lamps, vases, amphorae, cooking pots, cups, lamps, tools and every-day domestic items such as tweezers have been unearthed at the site. Southwest of Tourkoyeitonia, more of the palace is found. While little remains of the architecture, the walls that are preserved are Middle Minoan III–Late Minoan IA. Linear A tablets and the model of a house were excavated at The Archive along with MMIII-LMIA pottery and several unworked pieces of rock crystal, obsidian and steatite."
"The man-made enclosure of a spring, partially excavated in 1921 by Sir Arthur Evans, was completed by J. Sakellarakis in 1964. The floor is laid with pebbles, and the walls are poros-stone. Evidence indicates that it was built between Middle Minoan IB and Middle Minoan IIIA, destroyed during Late Minoan IA, and then restored and in various use afterward. The reservoir is within the palace grounds."

Two stepped altars are found here, one on a walkway and one on the pavement. There is a painting of a reconstruction of this area in Sakellarakis' ""Crete Archanes"" guidebook on page 49, which does this area more justice than a written description."
"The economy revolves around grape and olive processing and marketing. Both products account for some 96% of its total agricultural products. The Agricultural Cooperative of Archanes, set up in 1931, is one of the oldest in Greece, and consists of 1119 members. A quarter of the wine production is exported to Germany, France and the Netherlands, and the rest of the production is largely marketed domestically.

The Rockets went 27–44 under Albeck to finish the season with a record of 30 wins and 54 losses. They tied the Texas Chaparrals for fourth place in the Western Division (28 games behind the Indiana Pacers) and on April 1, 1971 lost a one-game playoff to the Chaparrals, 115–109, to determine who would advance into the ABA Western Division semifinals. During the season Denver's average home attendance dropped to 4,139 fans per game from 6,281 the year before. One week after the playoff loss, on April 8, 1971, Albeck was replaced by Alex Hannum as Denver's head coach. Hannum resigned as coach of the San Diego Rockets to become the Rockets' head coach, general manager and president. Albeck then became player personnel director for the Rockets."

= = = Norman Dyhrenfurth = = =
"Norman Gunther Dyhrenfurth (Breslau, today Wroclaw, May 7, 1918 – Salzburg, September 24, 2017) was a German-Swiss-American mountaineer and filmmaker. He was the leader of the successful American Mount Everest Expedition of 1963, which placed six climbers on the summit."
"Norman Dyhrenfurth was born in Germany, the son of Himalayan explorers Günter Oskar Dyhrenfurth and Hettie Dyhrenfurth. His mother was of half Jewish ancestry. After the Nazis came to power, they emigrated, first to Austria in 1933, then two years later to Switzerland, where they became citizens. In 1936, Dyhrenfurth's parents were awarded a gold medal for alpinism at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. He emigrated to the United States in 1937. His service in the United States Army enabled him to gain joint U.S.-Swiss citizenship. He was the founder of the Motion Picture Division of the Department of Theater Arts at UCLA, but resigned that position in 1952. In 1954, he was a Fulbright scholar in Italy."
"Dyhrenfurth first came to the attention of the mountaineering community in the United States in 1939, when he completed some challenging climbs in the Grand Tetons. He was a participant in the 1952 Swiss Mount Everest Expedition. In 1960, he was cameraman for the Swiss expedition to Dhaulagiri, and after that climb, approached the government of Nepal about obtaining a permit for an American expedition to climb Mount Everest. He learned that a permit had already been granted to another American climber, William Hackett. Although Dyhrenfurth tried to combine his efforts with Hackett's, that expedition failed to gain funding and never took place. Another application resulted in India being selected for an attempt to climb Everest, but Dyhrenfurth persevered and tried again."
"Dyhrenfurth received a permit from the Nepalese authorities on May 10, 1961, for an American expedition to climb Mount Everest in the spring of 1963. He recruited a team of climbers that included Jake Breitenbach, Jim Whittaker, Willi Unsoeld, Lute Jerstad, Tom Hornbein, Dave Dingman and Barry Bishop. William Siri was the deputy team leader. Al Auten was the radio operator, and Gil Roberts was the team doctor. Sherpa Nawang Gombu was also part of the team."
"On March 23, 1963, Breitenbach was killed in the collapse of a serac in the Khumbu Icefall just above Everest Base Camp. The members of the expedition decided to proceed. Dyhrenfurth's style of leadership being democratic and team-oriented, he called a meeting, discussed the tragedy, let everyone speak, and when the decision was made to continue, the team remained intact. Dyhrenfurth's leadership style included a ""commitment to consensus"", and he was considered by those who have studied the expedition a ""huge asset to the team""."
"On May 1, Whittaker and Gombu reached the summit of Mount Everest by the South Col route used by the successful British expedition of 1953."
"On May 22, Unsoeld and Hornbein completed the first ascent of the West Ridge, descending by the South Col, thus completing the first traverse of Everest. That same day, Bishop and Jerstad reached the summit by the South Col route. The two pairs of climbers met up high on the mountain, and made their descent in the gathering darkness. From midnight until 4:00 am, they bivouacked high on the mountain, without sleeping bags, tents or bottled oxygen. All survived, though Unsoeld and Bishop suffered from frostbite, resulting in the amputation of toes."

= = = Delta (TV series) = = =
"Delta is an American sitcom starring Delta Burke that aired on ABC from September 15, 1992 to August 25, 1993. It was a new starring vehicle for Burke, as her return to television following her dismissal from the CBS sitcom ""Designing Women"" in the spring of 1991."
"Burke portrays Delta Bishop, a young woman with dreams of writing and singing country music. She became a hairstylist at Mona's House of Hair, married Charlie Bishop and thought she had found happiness. After eight years of marriage, she became restless: she was eager to follow in the footsteps of her childhood idol, Patsy Cline, and become a country music star. She quits her job, leaves her husband and friends behind, and travels to Nashville, Tennessee. There, she finds an apartment over the garage of a home owned by her cousin, Lavonne Overton (Gigi Rice), and her husband, Buck (Bill Engvall). She also finds a job waiting tables at The Green Lantern, a local bar that hosts an amateur night which she believes that if she could sing her songs there, it could jumpstart her career."
"Burke, most popular for her role as Suzanne Sugarbaker on ""Designing Women"", reportedly utilized her own singing talents for the role of Bishop, and dyed her familiar brunette hair blonde to play the role. The theme song was ""Climb That Mountain High"" by Reba McEntire which was not a charted single; the tune was featured on Reba's 1990 MCA album ""Rumor Has It""."
"The sitcom premiered September 15, 1992, to healthy ratings following ""Roseanne"". It then moved to Thursday nights opposite FOX's ""The Simpsons"", and ratings began to sink. It was pulled from the schedule in December 1992 and returned to ABC the following spring 1993 for six episodes before finally being canceled. In an attempt to infuse ratings, Burke brought her brunette hair back that spring (even refilming the opening credits to correspond with the change in hair color), in the sake of familiarity, but it did little to save it."

= = = Dusty Fletcher = = =
"Clinton ""Dusty"" Fletcher (July 8, 1900 – March 15, 1954) was an African-American vaudeville performer, who was best known for the comedy routine which became a hit record in 1947, ""Open the Door, Richard""."
He had one daughter Helen Fletcher with original Cotton Club Dancer Sadie Mae Fletcher. He had two granddaughters Jacqueline and Amber.
"Born in El Dorado, Arkansas, Fletcher had refined his act over at least twenty years in vaudeville before the 1940s. He would come on stage dressed in rags, acting drunk, muttering and complaining about trying to find his way home. He would then bring out a ladder, and try to set it up so he could get in through a window. Every so often he would crash sprawling on the floor while shouting ""Open the Door, Richard !""."
"In 1946, bandleader Jack McVea fashioned Fletcher's routine into the lyrics of a song, which he recorded with his band. McVea's record became a big hit, and Fletcher, by now semi-retired, was found living in South Carolina by Herb Abramson of National Records. He made his own recording of the song, using McVea's arrangement, which made number 3 on US ""Billboard"" R&B chart. The song was also covered by many others including Count Basie, Louis Jordan, and Pigmeat Markham."
"National Records began a lawsuit to claim Fletcher's royalties as the originator of the routine which led to McVea's hit. However, a blackface vaudeville comedian, John ""Spider Bruce"" Mason then claimed that Fletcher had originally stolen the routine from him in the 1920s. Eventually, McVea, Fletcher and Mason were all co-credited with writing McVea's version."
"Fletcher is credited with originating the ""Here come de Judge"" line used on the television comedy show, ""Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In""."
"The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) publicly attacked the song, particularly Fletcher's version, for making light of public drunkenness and playing on the stereotype of black men as shiftless and ignorant."
"Fletcher continued to perform the routine, particularly at the Apollo Theatre in New York, until shortly before his death."

"August 20 also saw the release of the HMV-exclusive single My Baby Left Me, which is also available on CD and 10"" vinyl format. This reached #19 in the UK."
"As well as the box set, a 2-disc compilation album of Presley's work was also released. The album reached No. 1 in the UK and Germany, Presley's first No. 1 album in the latter.

"Colby Buzzell (born July 17, 1976 in California) is an American author, blogger and former United States Army soldier."
"Buzzell grew up in San Ramon, California and enlisted in the United States Army at the age of 26. Prior to joining the U.S. Army he described his life as engaging in a lot of drinking, drug use, dead-end jobs and a minor criminal record. He was very optimistic about his Army service and was determined to follow the Army recruiting slogan of ""Be All That You Can Be"". He joined the service as an infantryman and spent 2003 - 2004 in Iraq, assigned to a Stryker Brigade Combat Team. In his book he expresses a great deal of enthusiasm about the benefits of wheels over traditional treaded armor in urban settings."
"It was in Iraq that Buzzell began publishing a blog under the title ""CBFTW"", ""Colby Buzzel Fuck The War"", as a replacement for his habitual journaling back in the States. The blog gained popularity quickly, because as an anonymous blogger, Buzzell was able to share more lucid experiences than an embedded journalist, and he was also able to share a bit more of the truth than the Army was able to."
"Buzzell's blog gained recognition for its realistic portrayal of gripping first hand accounts of the war in Iraq. This 'milblog' won praise as “an unfiltered, often ferocious expression of his boots-on-the-ground view of the Iraq war"""
"Colby published a book on his experiences entitled, """" combining narrative, blog entries, and emails that evolved from his blog over time. The book received good reviews and has been recommended for public libraries."
"In 2004, Buzzell was profiled in ""Esquire""'s ""Best and Brightest"" issue and has since contributed regularly. In 2007, Buzzell received the 2007 Lulu Blooker Prize for """"."
"In 2008, Buzzell was re-called for active duty. After he arrived at his post, he was examined by the medical staff at Fort Benning, and marked ""not deployable"" due to post-traumatic stress disorder."
"In 2011, Buzzell published the book """", under ""HarperCollins"" about coping with his post traumatic stress disorder by taking a road trip to no where, all the while thinking about his newborn son, wife, and recently deceased mother."

"Husain goes on to say that """"What I did not know at school was that Sarwar was a business management lecturer, not a scholar of religion. And he was an activist in the organisations that he mentioned Muslim Brotherhood and Jamat-e-Islami.

In my school, a Jamat-e-Islami activist named Abdul Rabb represented the MET and awarded us trophies and medals for our performance in MET exams. Ostensibly it all seemed harmless, but the personnel all belonged to Jamat-e-Islami front organisations in Britain.

"Norcot is an area of the suburb of Tilehurst in the town of Reading, in the English county of Berkshire. It is also an electoral ward of the Borough of Reading."
"Norcot ward is the far eastern sector of the Reading borough portion of Tilehurst. As a commonly used suburban area, Norcot centres on Norcot Road and the upper Oxford Road on Norcot Hill. It is electorally partly in Norcot ward and partly in Kentwood to its west. All these areas form a mixture of suburban and urban parts of West Reading. The original hamlet was near the junction of Norcot Road and Romany Lane and was largely made up of Norcot Farm in the north-east of old Tilehurst parish. The name means 'North Cottage' and has a southern neighbour Southcote, below Tilehurst church and manor."
"The Norcot Water Tower, built at the end of the 19th century, is somewhat older than the more prominent Tilehurst Water Tower. It is 50ft high, a Grade II listed building and since 2002 has been converted into a luxury apartment. Norcot School was built in 1906. In its lifetime, it was both a senior and a junior school. It closed in 1989. Like much of Tilehurst, Norcot Hill was used for the extraction of clay for brickmaking. In the 1920s, S. E. Collier's transported the clay via overhead cables to their main site in the Dee Road area of Tilehurst. St George's Church, Reading was built on the north-eastern edge of Norcot in 1886, largely to service the soldiers of the nearby Brock Barracks. Norcot Mission Church was started in 1929 to serve the new Norcot council estate. It started in a hut on land rented from the Pulsometer Engineering Works. The church moved to a permanent building in Brockley Close in 1972. The post office is on the Oxford Road."
"The ward of Norcot is west of the town centre and is bordered by Kentwood (the far western ward), Battle (the inner western ward), Southcote and Tilehurst wards."
"As with all wards, apart from smaller Mapledurham, it elects three councillors to Reading Borough Council. Elections since 2004 are held by thirds, with elections in three years out of four."

(Vallabhaneni Janardhan) is malicious. Here, their Head Constable (P. L. Narayana) endears Accha Rao's amiable nature, gives him shelter and his daughter Seeta (Kanaka) loves Accha Rao. Meanwhile, a new scheme commences in the town by a company to sell household goods at the lowest prices. The company agent Peter (Sai Kumar) collects huge amounts as advance from the public. Thereupon, the Company turns fraudulent and the Proprietor's son tries to escape with the money when Peter restricts his way. In that quarrel, accidentally, he dies in the hands of Peter when S.I. takes him into custody and tortures terribly. Just as, Accha Rao shows his solace which Peter exploits and absconds. So to protect Accha Rao, Head Constable takes the guilt. Right now, to redeem himself, Accha Rao moves to nab Peter along with Seeta. At present, the district S.P. (Kota Shankar Rao) instructs S.I. to present Accha Rao & Peter before him. Parallelly, the Company Proprietor (M. S. Gopinath) bids the S.I. to slay them out. In that process, Accha Rao meets his mother (Radha Kumari) and learns that Peter's wife (Sailaja) is terminally ill. Be concerned, Accha Rao looks after them, even finds whereabouts of Peter and unites him with his wife. Thereafter, Peter surrenders himself to Police. Simultaneously, Accha Rao goes into the clutches of the Company Proprietor. Both of them try to slaughter Accha Rao & Peter, but Accha Rao breaks out by eliminating the blackguard and rushes towards Peter. By that time, S.I. encounters Peter and tries to kill Accha Rao too. Fortuitously, the S.P. witnesses it and knocks out the S.I. Finally, Accha Rao is promoted as S.I. and the movie ends on a happy note with the marriage of Accha Rao & Seeta."

= = = Printer's sample stamp = = =
"A printer's sample stamp is a label produced by a printer resembling a stamp, but with no postal or other validity. Often it will include the name of the printer and demonstrate their printing capabilities. The stamps are not intended for use and are therefore to be distinguished from test stamps, though both test stamps and printer's sample stamps are dummy stamps in the broadest sense of that term."
"The R.M. Phillips Collection at the British Postal Museum and Archive contains a number of sample stamps produced by De La Rue before 1900, bearing their name and demonstrating their printing abilities for the British Post Office."
"Waterlow & Sons produced many small sheetlets of sample stamps in the same design as genuine stamps produced for their customers, but with the colours changed and overprinted diagonally ""Waterlow & Sons Ltd. Specimen"". The stamps in these sheetlets were also punched with a small hole in the corner to prevent their postal or revenue use and the sheetlets were displayed at the 1910 Brussels Exhibition. Clive Akerman comments in ""The Presentation of Revenue Stamps: Taxes and Duties in South America"", that the stamps were produced from obsolete dies."
"The ""Prince Consort Essay"" was a printer's sample stamp created in 1851 as an example of the surface printed stamps that Henry Archer proposed to print and perforate under contract with the British government at a lower price than the current printing firm of Perkins Bacon. The Prince Consort stamps were provided by the artist Robert Edward Branston, from an engraving executed by Samuel William Reynolds."
"Although commonly known as an essay, the stamp was not really an essay as it was never intended that a postage stamp be produced based on the design, nor was it an un-adopted design. It is more accurately described as a printer's sample stamp."
"The concept has been used worldwide with modern sample stamps from printers in Switzerland and the Netherlands, amongst other countries, commonly seen in philatelic circles."

"Richards was born in rural Adair County, Kentucky, and played basketball for one year at Adair County High School. He was recruited to play baseball at Western by Coach E. A. Diddle (better known as the basketball coach). Diddle got Richards into officiating high school basketball. After graduation, Richards was hired as head basketball coach at Auburn High School. He went from there to Glasgow High, where he coached the Scotties to a state championship in 1968."
"Richards returned to Western as an assistant the following year, when an opening occurred on John Oldham's staff after Gene Rhodes left to coach the Kentucky Colonels of the American Basketball Association. When Oldham left the sidelines to become athletic director, Richards became head coach for the 1971-1972 season."

Jurby () is one of the seventeen parishes of the Isle of Man.
"It is located in the north-west of the island (part of the traditional ""North Side"" division) in the sheading of Michael."
"For the purposes of local government, the whole of the historic parish forms a single parish district with Commissioners."
The Captain of the Parish (since 1999) is John James Quayle.
"Jurby parish is part of the Ayre & Michael constituency, which elects two Members to the House of Keys. Before 2016 it was in the Michael constituency."
"The Isle of Man census of 2016 returned a parish population of 776, a decrease of 2.7% from the figure of 797 in 2011."
"The parish of Jurby, which lies on the north-western coast of the island, borders those of Andreas to the east, Lezayre to the south-east, and Ballaugh to the south. It is low-lying overall: the highest elevations are some coastal dunes with a height of up to 39 metres."
"There is an industrial park on the old RAF Jurby Airfield, but otherwise the district is almost entirely agricultural. Apart from the Jurby airfield buildings, there are no significant settlements in the parish."
Jurby Airfield was originally used as a Royal Air Force training base in World War II. During the 1950s it was used as a training camp for Officer cadets on short term commissions in the RAF. The course lasted three months. Part of the airfield is now used as an industrial and retail estate. The old runways and taxiways now form the Jurby motorcycle race track.
"The grassland surrounding the airfield harbours many wildflowers, as the land has never been ploughed. Skylarks can be heard in summer when there are no races on. A large part of the airfield therefore has statutory protection under the Wildlife Act 1990 as an Area of Special Scientific Importance."
"A museum dedicated to transport in the island, the Jurby Transport Museum, is housed in an old aircraft hangar."
"Another museum nearby, the Isle of Man Motor Museum, was officially opened by the Lieutenant Governor on 22 May 2015."
"A tiny 8th century chapel dedicated to St Cecilia (the patron saint of music), was Jurby's first recorded church. St Cecilia's Day on 22 November was the parish festival day. There are several Viking carved crosses and gravestones within the church. Medieval objects have occasionally been excavated when new graves were prepared in the church grounds."
In medieval times the church was part of the Whithorn diocese in SW Scotland. This caused some political trouble when the English and Scots were at war; the Bishop invited the Scottish clergy of Jurby to visit him and was criticised by English authorities for fraternising with the enemy.
"The present St. Patrick's Church, Jurby was built during the war with help of RAF Jurby. There are a number of war graves, for British, Commonwealth and Polish servicemen. They died mostly from aircraft training accidents."
"The church is set on a slight headland on the coast and there are views south to Peel, north to Scotland, and inland across the rural north of the island, towards the hills."
The Isle of Man Prison operated by the Isle of Man Prison Service is located at Jurby.
Jurby was historically subdivided into five treens:

= = = Walsh convention = = =
Walsh is a convention used in the card game of bridge in response to an opening bid of 1. The convention has its origins in the Walsh System developed by Richard Walsh.
"In general, the Walsh convention is not used in four-card major systems such as Acol, but may be employed in some five-card major systems; especially those that use a prepared club, rather than better minor. The opening bid of 1 will therefore have shown either clubs or a balanced hand."
"When responder is too weak to force to game diamond suits are bypassed in favour of major suits, regardless of the length of the diamond suit. For example, holding , the response to the opening bid of 1 would be 1 rather than the normal 1."
"Continuations vary according to other details of the system being played. If Checkback Stayman is being played, then the auction 1 – 1; 1NT – 2 would show this hand and end the auction. If New minor forcing is being used, then 3 is used as the sign off bid instead."
"When the values to force to game are held, the procedure is abandoned, and suits are bid in the normal order. Responders reverse from diamonds into a major thus becomes game forcing. So, holding , the auction starts 1 – 1; 1NT – 2."
"The main purpose of the convention is to avoid missing major suit fits when opener has something akin to a weak notrump, and would rebid 1NT over the normal 1 response. The major suit fit is likely to provide a safer resting place when the hands are weak, as well as potentially scoring better (a concern perhaps only at matchpoints)."
It is a form of Canapé and thus the responses of 1 and 1 to a 1 opener are alertable in the UK under EBU regulations.

Spanish, Irish , German and British visitors are catered for, and the resort has a relaxed atmosphere in contrast to the lively resort of Magaluf on the west coast of the island. Sa Coma is more family oriented, and evening entertainment centres on hotels, rather than in bars or clubs."
"Some of the shops in Sa Coma also cater for tourists, with many products in the supermarkets being imported from tourists' home countries. In addition to the duty-free and sport shops, there are 'Perfumerías' (perfume shops) and a Carrefour hypermarket within Sa Coma town (previously owned by Eroski)."

"Dr. Shrinker was a segment during the first season of the ABC network's ""The Krofft Supershow"" in 1976."
"Dr. Shrinker (Jay Robinson) is a mad scientist who creates a shrink ray that can miniaturise anything. Three young adults — Brad Fulton (Ted Eccles), B.J. Masterson (Susan Lawrence) and her brother Gordie Masterson (Jeff MacKay) — crash land their airplane on an island. As they make their way to the only house on the island, they meet Dr. Shrinker and his assistant, Hugo (Billy Barty). Dr. Shrinker, in an effort to prove that his shrinking ray works, shrinks the three people down to tall. The remainder of the series was different efforts by the 'Shrinkies' to return to normal size, while Dr. Shrinker and Hugo want to catch the trio so that they will have physical proof that the ray works for whatever world power wants to buy it. Dr. Shrinker also implied that he would give the unnamed buyer the Shrinkies as a free bonus. However, in one episode, Dr. Shrinker's plan was to sell the shrink ray to the highest bidder, and the second highest bidder would receive the Shrinkies."
"Each episode was basically the same. As Dr. Shrinker himself said in one episode...""I chase the Shrinkies. I catch the Shrinkies. The Shrinkies escape. It's a vicious cycle, and it's driving me mad!"""
"The concept was very likely inspired by the 1940 film ""Dr. Cyclops"" in which a scientist working in the South American jungle uses his radiation experiments to shrink a group of fellow scientists to prevent them from discovering his secret work."
"""Dr. Shrinker"" lasted only one season on the ""Krofft Supershow"". During the second season, it was dropped (as was the superhero segment ""Electra Woman and Dyna Girl"").

"In the UK, a Pupil Referral Unit (PRU) (previously known as Pupil Re-integration Unit by some Local Education Authorities) is an alternative education provision which is specifically organised to provide education for children who aren't able to attend school and may not otherwise receive suitable education.

Each LEA has a duty under section 19 of the Education Act 1996 to provide suitable education for children of compulsory school age who cannot attend school. Placing pupils in PRUs is just one of the ways in which local authorities can ensure that they can comply with this duty. PRUs are a mixture of public units and privately managed companies.
"There are currently over 421 PRUs in England. Between 2002 and 2003, 17,523 pupils attended PRUs at some point. Although PRUs do not have to provide a full National Curriculum, they should offer a basic curriculum which includes English, mathematics, the sciences, PSHE and ICT."
"A PRU is treated the same as any other type of school, subject to the same inspections from Ofsted. Since September 2010, some PRUs are referred to as ""Short Stay Schools"", although the government still broadly refer to them as PRUs or Alternative Provision (APs)."

Despite losing a third of their games in the first stage, finishing in 4th position out of ten teams in their group, Naft Al-Wasat just about managed to qualify for the final stage, after wins against the likes of Erbil and Al-Zawraa; this itself was considered a big success for the young team. In the second stage, the team surprised everyone by defeating Al Shorta SC (the defending champions and one of the strongest contenders for the league championship) twice.
