"` Yes , I shall only bring a fairy story for my dowry , ' said he , and so they parted ."
But the princess gave him a sabre set with gold pieces which he could use .
"Then he flew away , bought himself a new dressing-gown , and sat down in the wood and began to make up a story , for it had to be ready by Saturday , and that was no easy matter ."
When he had it ready it was Saturday .
"The sultan , the sultana , and the whole court were at tea with the princess ."
He was most graciously received .
` Will you tell us a story ? '
said the sultana ; ` one that is thoughtful and instructive ? '
"` But something that we can laugh at , ' said the sultan ."
"` Oh , certainly , ' he replied , and began : ` Now , listen attentively ."
"There was once a box of matches which lay between a tinder-box and an old iron pot , and they told the story of their youth . '"
`` We used to be on the green fir-boughs .
"Every morning and evening we had diamond-tea , which was the dew , and the whole day long we had sunshine , and the little birds used to tell us stories ."
"We were very rich , because the other trees only dressed in summer , but we had green dresses in summer and in winter ."
"Then the woodcutter came , and our family was split up ."
We have now the task of making light for the lowest people .
That is why we grand people are in the kitchen . '' '
"`` My fate was quite different , '' said the iron pot , near which the matches lay . '"
"`` Since I came into the world I have been many times scoured , and have cooked much ."
My only pleasure is to have a good chat with my companions when I am lying nice and clean in my place after dinner . '' '
"`` Now you are talking too fast , '' spluttered the fire . '"
"`` Yes , let us decide who is the grandest ! ''"
said the matches . '
"`` No , I do n't like talking about myself , '' said the pot . '"
`` Let us arrange an evening 's entertainment .
I will tell the story of my life . '
`` On the Baltic by the Danish shore - '' ` What a beautiful beginning ! ''
said all the plates .
`` That 's a story that will please us all . ''
` And the end was just as good as the beginning .
All the plates clattered for joy . '
"`` Now I will dance , '' said the tongs , and she danced ."
"`` Why , what can you do ? ''"
asked Madge forlornly .
Miss Susan squared her shoulders and looked amused .
`` You 'll see .
I know old John Ellis better than he knows himself .
He is the most contrary man the Lord ever made .
I went to school with him .
"I learned how to manage him then , and I have n't forgotten how ."
I 'm going straight up to interview him . ''
`` Are you sure that will do any good ? ''
said Madge doubtfully .
"`` If you go to him and take Burton 's and my part , wo n't it only make him worse ? ''"
"`` Madge , dear , '' said Miss Susan , busily twisting her scanty , iron-grey hair up into a hard little knob at the back of her head before Madge 's glass , `` you just wait ."
"I 'm not young , and I 'm not pretty , and I 'm not in love , but I 've more gumption than you and Burton have or ever will have ."
You keep your eyes open and see if you can learn something .
You 'll need it if you go up to live with old John Ellis . ''
"Burton had returned to the turnip field , but old John Ellis was taking his ease with a rampant political newspaper on the cool verandah of his house ."
"Looking up from a bitter editorial to chuckle over a cutting sarcasm contained therein , he saw a tall , angular figure coming up the lane with aggressiveness written large in every fold and flutter of shawl and skirt ."
"`` Old Susan Oliver , as sure as a gun , '' said old John with another chuckle ."
`` She looks mad clean through .
I suppose she 's coming here to blow me up for refusing to let Burton take that girl of hers .
"She 's been angling and scheming for it for years , but she will find who she has to deal with ."
"Come on , Miss Susan . ''"
John Ellis laid down his paper and stood up with a sarcastic smile .
Miss Susan reached the steps and skimmed undauntedly up them .
She did indeed look angry and disturbed .
Without any preliminary greeting she burst out into a tirade that simply took away her complacent foe 's breath .
"`` Look here , John Ellis , I want to know what this means ."
"I 've discovered that that young upstart of a son of yours , who ought to be in short trousers yet , has been courting my niece , Madge Oliver , all summer ."
He has had the impudence to tell me that he wants to marry her .
"I wo n't have it , I tell you , and you can tell your son so ."
Marry my niece indeed !
"When I left the man , I worked for a couple of weeks with a farmer , but I thrashed his boy , and then the old man thrashed me , and I ran off again and walked here . ''"
`` All the way ? ''
"`` Yes , the man did n't pay me , and I would n't ask for it ."
"Took it out in beating the boy , '' and Dan laughed , yet looked ashamed , as he glanced at his ragged clothes and dirty hands ."
`` How did you live ?
"It was a long , long tramp for a boy like you . ''"
"`` Oh , I got on well enough , till I hurt my foot ."
"Folks gave me things to eat , and I slept in barns and tramped by day ."
"I got lost trying to make a short cut , or I 'd have been here sooner . ''"
"`` But if you did not mean to come in and stay with us , what were you going to do ? ''"
"`` I thought I 'd like to see Teddy again , and you ; and then I was going back to my old work in the city , only I was so tired I went to sleep on the hay ."
"I 'd have been gone in the morning , if you had n't found me . ''"
`` Are you sorry I did ? ''
"and Mrs. Jo looked at him with a half merry , half reproachful look , as she knelt down to look at his wounded foot ."
"The color came up into Dan 's face , and he kept his eyes fixed on his plate , as he said very low , `` No , ma'am , I 'm glad , I wanted to stay , but I was afraid you -- '' He did not finish , for Mrs. Bhaer interrupted him by an exclamation of pity , as she saw his foot , for it was seriously hurt ."
`` When did you do it ? ''
`` Three days ago . ''
`` And you have walked on it in this state ? ''
"`` I had a stick , and I washed it at every brook I came to , and one woman gave me a rag to put on it . ''"
"`` Mr. Bhaer must see and dress it at once , '' and Mrs. Jo hastened into the next room , leaving the door ajar behind her , so that Dan heard all that passed ."
"`` Fritz , the boy has come back . ''"
`` Who ?
Dan ? ''
"`` Yes , Teddy saw him at the window , and he called to him , but he went away and hid behind the hay-cocks on the lawn ."
"I found him there just now fast asleep , and half dead with weariness and pain ."
"He ran away from Page a month ago , and has been making his way to us ever since ."
"He pretends that he did not mean to let us see him , but go on to the city , and his old work , after a look at us ."
"It is evident , however , that the hope of being taken in has led him here through every thing , and there he is waiting to know if you will forgive and take him back . ''"
`` Did he say so ? ''
"`` His eyes did , and when I waked him , he said , like a lost child , ` Mother Bhaer , I 've come home . '"
"I had n't the heart to scold him , and just took him in like a poor little black sheep come back to the fold ."
"I may keep him , Fritz ? ''"
"They were not only new trousers , but they were the first he had ever had with braid on them , and he had to bite his lip to prevent the tears coming ."
"Of course Mrs. Darling brushed him , but he began to talk again about its being a mistake to have a dog for a nurse ."
"` George , Nana is a treasure . '"
"` No doubt , but I have an uneasy feeling at times that she looks upon the children as puppies . '"
"` Oh no , dear one , I feel sure she knows they have souls . ' '"
"I wonder , ' Mr. Darling said thoughtfully , ' I wonder . '"
"It was an opportunity , his wife felt , for telling him about the boy ."
"At first he pooh-poohed the story , but he became thoughtful when she showed him the shadow ."
"` It is nobody I know , ' he said , examining it carefully , ` but he does look a scoundrel . '"
"` We were still discussing it , you remember , ' says Mr. Darling , ` when Nana came in with Michael 's medicine ."
"You will never carry the bottle in your mouth again , Nana , and it is all my fault ."
"Strong man though he was , there is no doubt that he had behaved rather foolishly over the medicine ."
"If he had a weakness , it was for thinking that all his life he had taken medicine boldly ; and so now , when Michael dodged the spoon in Nana 's mouth , he had said reprovingly , ` Be a man , Michael . '"
"` Wo n't ; wo n't , ' Michael cried naughtily ."
"Mrs. Darling left the room to get a chocolate for him , and Mr. Darling thought this showed want of firmness ."
"` Mother , do n't pamper him , ' he called after her ."
"` Michael , when I was your age I took medicine without a murmur ."
"I said `` Thank you , kind parents , for giving me bottles to make me well . '' '"
"He really thought this was true , and Wendy , who was now in her night-gown , believed it also , and she said , to encourage Michael , ` That medicine you sometimes take , father , is much nastier , is n't it ? '"
"` Ever so much nastier , ` Mr. Darling said bravely , ` and I would take it now as an example to you , Michael , if I had n't lost the bottle . '"
He had not exactly lost it ; he had climbed in the dead of night to the top of the wardrobe and hidden it there .
"What he did not know was that the faithful Liza had found it , and put it back on his wash-stand . '"
"I know where it is , father , ' Wendy cried , always glad to be of service ."
"` I 'll bring it , ' and she was off before he could stop her ."
Immediately his spirits sank in the strangest way .
"` John , ' he said , shuddering , ` it 's most beastly stuff ."
"It 's that nasty , sticky , sweet kind . '"
"` It will soon be over , father , ' John said cheerily , and then in rushed Wendy with the medicine in a glass . '"
"I have been as quick as I could , ' she panted ."
"` You have been wonderfully quick , ' her father retorted , with a vindictive politeness that was quite thrown away upon her ."
"` Michael first , ' he said doggedly ."
"` Father first , ' said Michael , who was of a suspicious nature . '"
`` And then Susan gave up .
` We can not save him !
"Oh , if your father was here -- look at him , the poor little fellow !"
I know not what to do . '
`` I looked at Jims and I thought he was dying .
"Susan was holding him up in his crib to give him a better chance for breath , but it did n't seem as if he could breathe at all ."
"My little war-baby , with his dear ways and sweet roguish face , was choking to death before my very eyes , and I could n't help him ."
I threw down the hot poultice I had ready in despair .
Of what use was it ?
"Jims was dying , and it was my fault -- I had n't been careful enough !"
`` Just then -- at eleven o'clock at night -- the door bell rang .
Such a ring -- it pealed all over the house above the roar of the storm .
Susan could n't go -- she dared not lay Jims down -- so I rushed downstairs .
In the hall I paused just a minute -- I was suddenly overcome by an absurd dread .
I thought of a weird story Gertrude had told me once .
An aunt of hers was alone in a house one night with her sick husband .
She heard a knock at the door .
"And when she went and opened it there was nothing there -- nothing that could be seen , at least ."
"But when she opened the door a deadly cold wind blew in and seemed to sweep past her right up the stairs , although it was a calm , warm summer night outside ."
Immediately she heard a cry .
She ran upstairs -- and her husband was dead .
"And she always believed , so Gertrude said , that when she opened that door she let Death in ."
`` It was so ridiculous of me to feel so frightened .
"But I was distracted and worn out , and I simply felt for a moment that I dared not open the door -- that death was waiting outside ."
Then I remembered that I had no time to waste -- must not be so foolish -- I sprang forward and opened the door .
`` Certainly a cold wind did blow in and filled the hall with a whirl of snow .
"But there on the threshold stood a form of flesh and blood -- Mary Vance , coated from head to foot with snow -- and she brought Life , not Death , with her , though I did n't know that then ."
I just stared at her . '' '
"I have n't been turned out , ' grinned Mary , as she stepped in and shut the door . '"
I came up to Carter Flagg 's two days ago and I 've been stormed-stayed there ever since .
"But old Abbie Flagg got on my nerves at last , and tonight I just made up my mind to come up here ."
"I thought I could wade this far , but I can tell you it was as much as a bargain ."
"She could run faster than Anne , who was hampered by her clinging and drenched skirt , and soon overtook her ."
Behind them they left a trail that would break Mr. Harrison 's heart when he should see it .
"`` Anne , for mercy 's sake , stop , '' panted poor Diana ."
`` I 'm right out of breath and you are wet to the skin . ''
"`` I must ... get ... that cow ... out ... before ... Mr. Harrison ... sees her , '' gasped Anne ."
`` I do n't ... care ... if I 'm ... drowned ... if we ... can ... only ... do that . ''
But the Jersey cow appeared to see no good reason for being hustled out of her luscious browsing ground .
No sooner had the two breathless girls got near her than she turned and bolted squarely for the opposite corner of the field .
"`` Head her off , '' screamed Anne ."
"`` Run , Diana , run . ''"
Diana did run .
"Anne tried to , and the wicked Jersey went around the field as if she were possessed ."
"Privately , Diana thought she was ."
It was fully ten minutes before they headed her off and drove her through the corner gap into the Cuthbert lane .
There is no denying that Anne was in anything but an angelic temper at that precise moment .
"Nor did it soothe her in the least to behold a buggy halted just outside the lane , wherein sat Mr. Shearer of Carmody and his son , both of whom wore a broad smile ."
"`` I guess you 'd better have sold me that cow when I wanted to buy her last week , Anne , '' chuckled Mr. Shearer ."
"`` I 'll sell her to you now , if you want her , '' said her flushed and disheveled owner ."
`` You may have her this very minute . ''
`` Done .
"I 'll give you twenty for her as I offered before , and Jim here can drive her right over to Carmody ."
She 'll go to town with the rest of the shipment this evening .
Mr. Reed of Brighton wants a Jersey cow . ''
"Five minutes later Jim Shearer and the Jersey cow were marching up the road , and impulsive Anne was driving along the Green Gables lane with her twenty dollars ."
`` What will Marilla say ? ''
asked Diana .
"`` Oh , she wo n't care ."
Dolly was my own cow and it is n't likely she 'd bring more than twenty dollars at the auction .
"But oh dear , if Mr. Harrison sees that grain he will know she has been in again , and after my giving him my word of honor that I 'd never let it happen !"
"Well , it has taught me a lesson not to give my word of honor about cows ."
A cow that could jump over or break through our milk-pen fence could n't be trusted anywhere . ''
"Marilla had gone down to Mrs. Lynde 's , and when she returned knew all about Dolly 's sale and transfer , for Mrs. Lynde had seen most of the transaction from her window and guessed the rest ."
Also that there were very few birds in winter .
"` Of course they might want your clothes , ' he had to admit rather falteringly ."
She was somewhat indignant at this .
"` They are always thinking of their nests , ' he said apologetically , ` and there are some bits of you ' -- he stroked the fur on her pelisse -- ` that would excite them very much . '"
"` They sha n't have my fur , ' she said sharply ."
"` No , ' he said , still fondling it , however , ` no ."
"O Maimie , ' he said rapturously , ` do you know why I love you ?"
It is because you are like a beautiful nest . '
Somehow this made her uneasy . '
"I think you are speaking more like a bird than a boy now , ' she said , holding back , and indeed he was even looking rather like a bird ."
"` After all , ' she said , ` you are only a Betwixt-and-Between . '"
"But it hurt him so much that she immediately added , ` It must be a delicious thing to be . '"
"` Come and be one , then , dear Maimie , ' he implored her , and they set off for the boat , for it was now very near Open-Gate time ."
"` And you are not a bit like a nest , ' he whispered to please her ."
"` But I think it is rather nice to be like one , ' she said in a woman 's contradictory way ."
"` And , Peter , dear , though I ca n't give them my fur , I would n't mind their building in it ."
Fancy a nest in my neck with little spotty eggs in it !
"O Peter , how perfectly lovely ! '"
"-LSB- Illustration : Building the house for Maimie -RSB- But as they drew near the Serpentine , she shivered a little , and said , ` Of course I shall go and see mother often , quite often ."
"It is not as if I was saying good-bye for ever to mother , it is not in the least like that . '"
"` Oh no , ' answered Peter , but in his heart he knew it was very like that , and he would have told her so had he not been in a quaking fear of losing her ."
"He was so fond of her , he felt he could not live without her ."
"` She will forget her mother in time , and be happy with me , ' he kept saying to himself , and he hurried her on , giving her thimbles by the way ."
"But even when she had seen the boat and exclaimed ecstatically over its loveliness , she still talked tremblingly about her mother ."
"` You know quite well , Peter , do n't you , ' she said , ` that I would n't come unless I knew for certain I could go back to mother whenever I want to ?"
"Peter , say it . '"
"He said it , but he could no longer look her in the face ."
"` If you are sure your mother will always want you , ' he added rather sourly ."
` The idea of mother 's not always wanting me ! '
"Maimie cried , and her face glistened ."
"` If she does n't bar you out , ' said Peter huskily ."
"` The door , ' replied Maimie , ` will always , always be open , and mother will always be waiting at it for me . '"
Then they both dried their tears and went to work at the preparations for moving .
"`` Since we must go let us go as soon as we can and have it over , '' said poor Anne with bitter resignation ."
"`` You know you will like that lovely old place at the Glen after you have lived in it long enough to have dear memories woven about it , '' said Leslie ."
"`` Friends will come there , as they have come here -- happiness will glorify it for you ."
"Now , it 's just a house to you -- but the years will make it a home . ''"
Anne and Leslie had another cry the next week when they shortened Little Jem .
Anne felt the tragedy of it until evening when in his long nightie she found her own dear baby again .
"`` But it will be rompers next -- and then trousers -- and in no time he will be grown-up , '' she sighed ."
"`` Well , you would not want him to stay a baby always , Mrs. Doctor , dear , would you ? ''"
said Susan .
"`` Bless his innocent heart , he looks too sweet for anything in his little short dresses , with his dear feet sticking out ."
"And think of the save in the ironing , Mrs. Doctor , dear . ''"
"`` Anne , I have just had a letter from Owen , '' said Leslie , entering with a bright face ."
"`` And , oh !"
I have such good news .
He writes me that he is going to buy this place from the church trustees and keep it to spend our summer vacations in .
"Anne , are you not glad ? ''"
"`` Oh , Leslie , ` glad ' is n't the word for it !"
It seems almost too good to be true .
"I sha 'n' t feel half so badly now that I know this dear spot will never be desecrated by a vandal tribe , or left to tumble down in decay ."
"Why , it 's lovely !"
It 's lovely ! ''
One October morning Anne wakened to the realisation that she had slept for the last time under the roof of her little house .
The day was too busy to indulge regret and when evening came the house was stripped and bare .
Anne and Gilbert were alone in it to say farewell .
Leslie and Susan and Little Jem had gone to the Glen with the last load of furniture .
The sunset light streamed in through the curtainless windows .
"`` It has all such a heart-broken , reproachful look , has n't it ? ''"
said Anne .
"`` Oh , I shall be so homesick at the Glen tonight ! ''"
"`` We have been very happy here , have n't we , Anne-girl ? ''"
"said Gilbert , his voice full of feeling ."
Could anything be more exciting or more useful ?
"So he put it in his pocket , and ran quickly away out of the mountain by a little door which had been left open ."
When he got home his parents asked him what he had been doing and where he had got the fine clothes he wore .
"` Oh , I earned them myself , ' answered he ."
"` You never earned them in this short time , ' said his father ."
` Be off with you ; I wo n't keep you here .
I will have no thieves in my house ! '
"` Well I only came to help you , ' replied the boy sulkily ."
"` Now I 'll be off , as you wish ; but to-morrow morning when you rise you will see a great dog at the door ."
"Do not drive it away , but take it to the castle and sell it to the duke , and they will give you ten dollars for it ; only you must bring the strap you lead it with , back to the house . '"
Sure enough the next day the dog was standing at the door waiting to be let in .
"The old man was rather afraid of getting into trouble , but his wife urged him to sell the dog as the boy had bidden him , so he took it up to the castle and sold it to the duke for ten dollars ."
"But he did not forget to take off the strap with which he had led the animal , and to carry it home ."
When he got there old Kirsten met him at the door .
"` Well , Peder , and have you sold the dog ? '"
asked she .
"` Yes , Kirsten ; and I have brought back ten dollars , as the boy told us , ' answered Peder ."
` Ay !
but that 's fine ! '
said his wife .
"` Now you see what one gets by doing as one is bid ; if it had not been for me you would have driven the dog away again , and we should have lost the money ."
"After all , I always know what is best . '"
` Nonsense ! '
said her husband ; ` women always think they know best .
I should have sold the dog just the same whatever you had told me .
"Put the money away in a safe place , and do n't talk so much . '"
"The next day Hans came again ; but though everything had turned out as he had foretold , he found that his father was still not quite satisfied ."
` Be off with you ! '
"said he , ` you 'll get us into trouble . ' '"
"I have n't helped you enough yet , ' replied the boy ."
"` To-morrow there will come a great fat cow , as big as the house ."
Take it to the king 's palace and you 'll get as much as a thousand dollars for it .
`` A bell ! ''
"said Dick , sitting up ."
"`` Can we be , then , so near to Holywood ? ''"
"A little after , the bell clanged again , but this time somewhat nearer hand ; and from that time forth , and still drawing nearer and nearer , it continued to sound brokenly abroad in the silence of the morning ."
"`` Nay , what should this betoken ? ''"
"said Dick , who was now broad awake ."
"`` It is some one walking , '' returned Matcham , and `` the bell tolleth ever as he moves . ''"
"`` I see that well , '' said Dick ."
`` But wherefore ?
What maketh he in Tunstall Woods ?
"Jack , '' he added , `` laugh at me an ye will , but I like not the hollow sound of it . ''"
"`` Nay , '' said Matcham , with a shiver , `` it hath a doleful note ."
"An the day were not come '' -- But just then the bell , quickening its pace , began to ring thick and hurried , and then it gave a single hammering jangle , and was silent for a space ."
"`` It is as though the bearer had run for a pater-noster while , and then leaped the river , '' Dick observed ."
"`` And now beginneth he again to pace soberly forward , '' added Matcham ."
"`` Nay , '' returned Dick -- `` nay , not so soberly , Jack ."
'T is a man that walketh you right speedily .
"'T is a man in some fear of his life , or about some hurried business ."
See ye not how swift the beating draweth near ? ''
"`` It is now close by , '' said Matcham ."
"They were now on the edge of the pit ; and as the pit itself was on a certain eminence , they commanded a view over the greater proportion of the clearing , up to the thick woods that closed it in ."
"The daylight , which was very clear and grey , showed them a riband of white footpath wandering among the gorse ."
"It passed some hundred yards from the pit , and ran the whole length of the clearing , east and west ."
"By the line of its course , Dick judged it should lead more or less directly to the Moat House ."
"Upon this path , stepping forth from the margin of the wood , a white figure now appeared ."
"It paused a little , and seemed to look about ; and then , at a slow pace , and bent almost double , it began to draw near across the heath ."
At every step the bell clanked .
"Face , it had none ; a white hood , not even pierced with eye-holes , veiled the head ; and as the creature moved , it seemed to feel its way with the tapping of a stick ."
"Fear fell upon the lads , as cold as death ."
`` A leper ! ''
"said Dick , hoarsely ."
"`` His touch is death , '' said Matcham ."
They go on with their recollections .
"` It was then that I rushed in like a tornado , was n't it ? '"
"Mr. Darling would say , scorning himself ; and indeed he had been like a tornado ."
Perhaps there was some excuse for him .
"He , too , had been dressing for the party , and all had gone well with him until he came to his tie ."
"It is an astounding thing to have to tell , but this man , though he knew about stocks and shares , had no real mastery of his tie ."
"Sometimes the thing yielded to him without a contest , but there were occasions when it would have been better for the house if he had swallowed his pride and used a made-up tie ."
This was such an occasion .
He came rushing into the nursery with the crumpled little brute of a tie in his hand .
"` Why , what is the matter , father dear ? '"
` Matter ! '
he yelled ; he really yelled .
"` This tie , it will not tie . '"
He became dangerously sarcastic .
` Not round my neck !
Round the bed-post !
"Oh yes , twenty times have I made it up round the bed-post , but round my neck , no !"
Oh dear no !
begs to be excused ! '
"He thought Mrs. Darling was not sufficiently impressed , and he went on sternly , ' I warn you of this , mother , that unless this tie is round my neck we do n't go out to dinner to-night , and if I do n't go out to dinner to-night , I never go to the office again , and if I do n't go to the office again , you and I starve , and our children will be flung into the streets . '"
Even then Mrs. Darling was placid .
"` Let me try , dear , ' she said , and indeed that was what he had come to ask her to do ; and with her nice cool hands she tied his tie for him , while the children stood around to see their fate decided ."
"Some men would have resented her being able to do it so easily , but Mr. Darling was far too fine a nature for that ; he thanked her carelessly , at once forgot his rage , and in another moment was dancing round the room with Michael on his back ."
` How wildly we romped ! '
"says Mrs. Darling now , recalling it ."
` Our last romp ! '
Mr. Darling groaned . '
"O George , do you remember Michael suddenly said to me , `` How did you get to know me , mother ? '' ' '"
I remember ! '
"` They were rather sweet , do n't you think , George ? '"
"` And they were ours , ours , and now they are gone . '"
"The romp had ended with the appearance of Nana , and most unluckily Mr. Darling collided against her , covering his trousers with hairs ."
* * * * * When Katherine had been at Harbour Hill for a week she wondered how upon earth she was going to put in the remaining seven .
"Harbour Hill was noted for its beauty , but not every woman can live by scenery alone ."
"`` Aunt Elizabeth , '' said Katherine one day , `` does anybody ever die in Harbour Hill ?"
Because it does n't seem to me it would be any change for them if they did . ''
Aunt Elizabeth 's only reply to this was a shocked look .
"To pass the time Katherine took to collecting seaweeds , and this involved long tramps along the shore ."
On one of these occasions she met with an adventure .
The place was a remote spot far up the shore .
"Katherine had taken off her shoes and stockings , tucked up her skirt , rolled her sleeves high above her dimpled elbows , and was deep in the absorbing process of fishing up seaweeds off a craggy headland ."
"She looked anything but dignified while so employed , but under the circumstances dignity did not matter ."
"Presently she heard a shout from the shore and , turning around in dismay , she beheld a man on the rocks behind her ."
He was evidently shouting at her .
What on earth could the creature want ?
"`` Come in , '' he called , gesticulating wildly ."
`` You 'll be in the bottomless pit in another moment if you do n't look out . ''
"`` He certainly must be a lunatic , '' said Katherine to herself , `` or else he 's drunk ."
What am I to do ? ''
"`` Come in , I tell you , '' insisted the stranger ."
`` What in the world do you mean by wading out to such a place ?
"Why , it 's madness . ''"
Katherine 's indignation got the better of her fear .
"`` I do not think I am trespassing , '' she called back as icily as possible ."
The stranger did not seem to be snubbed at all .
He came down to the very edge of the rocks where Katherine could see him plainly .
He was dressed in a somewhat well-worn grey suit and wore spectacles .
"He did not look like a lunatic , and he did not seem to be drunk ."
"`` I implore you to come in , '' he said earnestly ."
`` You must be standing on the very brink of the bottomless pit . ''
"He is certainly off his balance , thought Katherine ."
He must be some revivalist who has gone insane on one point .
I suppose I 'd better go in .
He looks quite capable of wading out here after me if I do n't .
"said I. `` Your money too , '' says Alan , with a groan ."
`` Ye shouldnae have given it me .
I 'm daft when I get to the cartes . ''
`` Hoot-toot !
hoot-toot ! ''
said Cluny .
`` It was all daffing ; it 's all nonsense .
"Of course you 'll have your money back again , and the double of it , if ye 'll make so free with me ."
It would be a singular thing for me to keep it .
It 's not to be supposed that I would be any hindrance to gentlemen in your situation ; that would be a singular thing ! ''
"cries he , and began to pull gold out of his pocket with a mighty red face ."
"Alan said nothing , only looked on the ground ."
"`` Will you step to the door with me , sir ? ''"
"said I. Cluny said he would be very glad , and followed me readily enough , but he looked flustered and put out ."
"`` And now , sir , '' says I , `` I must first acknowledge your generosity . ''"
`` Nonsensical nonsense ! ''
cries Cluny .
`` Where 's the generosity ?
"This is just a most unfortunate affair ; but what would ye have me do -- boxed up in this bee-skep of a cage of mine -- but just set my friends to the cartes , when I can get them ?"
"And if they lose , of course , it 's not to be supposed -- '' And here he came to a pause ."
"`` Yes , '' said I , `` if they lose , you give them back their money ; and if they win , they carry away yours in their pouches !"
"I have said before that I grant your generosity ; but to me , sir , it 's a very painful thing to be placed in this position . ''"
"There was a little silence , in which Cluny seemed always as if he was about to speak , but said nothing ."
All the time he grew redder and redder in the face .
"`` I am a young man , '' said I , `` and I ask your advice ."
Advise me as you would your son .
"My friend fairly lost his money , after having fairly gained a far greater sum of yours ; can I accept it back again ?"
Would that be the right part for me to play ?
"Whatever I do , you can see for yourself it must be hard upon a man of any pride . ''"
"`` It 's rather hard on me , too , Mr. Balfour , '' said Cluny , `` and ye give me very much the look of a man that has entrapped poor people to their hurt ."
"I wouldnae have my friends come to any house of mine to accept affronts ; no , '' he cried , with a sudden heat of anger , `` nor yet to give them ! ''"
"`` And so you see , sir , '' said I , `` there is something to be said upon my side ; and this gambling is a very poor employ for gentlefolks ."
"`` Nothing more -- at least , nothing about you ."
The rest was about myself -- I did not mind it -- much .
But I was so sorry to think that I had done you harm .
It is not too late to undo it .
You must not come here any more .
Then they will forget . ''
`` Perhaps -- but I should not forget .
It 's a little too late for me .
"Lynde , you must not let this venomous letter come between us ."
"I love you , dear -- I 've loved you ever since I met you and I want you for my wife . ''"
"Alan had not intended to say that just then , but the words came to his lips in spite of himself ."
She looked so sad and appealing and weary that he wanted to have the right to comfort and protect her .
She turned her eyes full upon him with no hint of maidenly shyness or shrinking in them .
"Instead , they were full of a blank , incredulous horror that swallowed up every other feeling ."
There was no mistaking their expression and it struck an icy chill to Alan 's heart .
He had certainly not expected a too ready response on her part -- he knew that even if she cared for him he might find it a matter of time to win her avowal of it -- but he certainly had not expected to see such evident abject dismay as her blanched face betrayed .
She put up her hand as if warding a blow .
"`` Do n't -- do n't , '' she gasped ."
`` You must not say that -- you must never say it .
"Oh , I never dreamed of this ."
"If I had thought it possible you could -- love me , I would never have been friends with you ."
"Oh , I 've made a terrible mistake . ''"
"She wrung her hands piteously together , looking like a soul in torment ."
Alan could not bear to see her pain .
"`` Do n't feel such distress , '' he implored ."
"`` I suppose I 've spoken too abruptly -- but I 'll be so patient , dear , if you 'll only try to care for me a little ."
"Ca n't you , dear ? ''"
"`` I ca n't marry you , '' said Lynde desperately ."
She leaned against a slim white bole of a young birch behind her and looked at him wretchedly .
`` Wo n't you please go away and forget me ? ''
"`` I ca n't forget you , '' Alan said , smiling a little in spite of his suffering ."
`` You are the only woman I can ever love -- and I ca n't give you up unless I have to .
"But when she came out again Susan was sitting on the veranda , loosening her bonnet strings with the air of one who meant to stay where she was for some time ."
`` Have you got your baby to sleep ? ''
she asked kindly .
Your baby !
"Really , Susan might have more tact ."
"`` Yes , '' said Rilla shortly ."
"Susan laid her parcels on the reed table , as one determined to do her duty ."
She was very tired but she must help Rilla out .
"Here was Kenneth Ford who had come to call on the family and they were all unfortunately out , and `` the poor child '' had had to entertain him alone ."
But Susan had come to her rescue -- Susan would do her part no matter how tired she was .
"`` Dear me , how you have grown up , '' she said , looking at Ken 's six feet of khaki uniform without the least awe ."
"Susan had grown used to khaki now , and at sixty-four even a lieutenant 's uniform is just clothes and nothing else ."
`` It is an amazing thing how fast children do grow up .
"Rilla here , now , is almost fifteen . ''"
"`` I 'm going on seventeen , Susan , '' cried Rilla almost passionately ."
She was a whole month past sixteen .
It was intolerable of Susan .
"`` It seems just the other day that you were all babies , '' said Susan , ignoring Rilla 's protest ."
"`` You were really the prettiest baby I ever saw , Ken , though your mother had an awful time trying to cure you of sucking your thumb ."
Do you remember the day I spanked you ? ''
"`` No , '' said Ken ."
"`` Oh well , I suppose you would be too young -- you were only about four and you were here with your mother and you insisted on teasing Nan until she cried ."
"I had tried several ways of stopping you but none availed , and I saw that a spanking was the only thing that would serve ."
So I picked you up and laid you across my knee and lambasted you well .
You howled at the top of your voice but you left Nan alone after that . ''
Rilla was writhing .
Had n't Susan any realization that she was addressing an officer of the Canadian Army ?
Apparently she had not .
"Oh , what would Ken think ?"
"`` I suppose you do not remember the time your mother spanked you either , '' continued Susan , who seemed to be bent on reviving tender reminiscences that evening ."
"`` I shall never , no never , forget it ."
"She was up here one night with you when you were about three , and you and Walter were playing out in the kitchen yard with a kitten ."
"`` That wo n't do with me , my man , '' interrupted the captain ."
"`` We know exactly what you meant to do , and we do n't care , for now , you see , you ca n't do it . ''"
And the captain looked at him calmly and proceeded to fill a pipe .
`` If Abe Gray -- '' Silver broke out .
`` Avast there ! ''
cried Mr. Smollett .
"`` Gray told me nothing , and I asked him nothing ; and what 's more , I would see you and him and this whole island blown clean out of the water into blazes first ."
"So there 's my mind for you , my man , on that . ''"
This little whiff of temper seemed to cool Silver down .
"He had been growing nettled before , but now he pulled himself together ."
"`` Like enough , '' said he ."
"`` I would set no limits to what gentlemen might consider shipshape , or might not , as the case were ."
"And seein ' as how you are about to take a pipe , cap'n , I 'll make so free as do likewise . ''"
"And he filled a pipe and lighted it ; and the two men sat silently smoking for quite a while , now looking each other in the face , now stopping their tobacco , now leaning forward to spit ."
It was as good as the play to see them .
"`` Now , '' resumed Silver , `` here it is ."
"You give us the chart to get the treasure by , and drop shooting poor seamen and stoving of their heads in while asleep ."
"You do that , and we 'll offer you a choice ."
"Either you come aboard along of us , once the treasure shipped , and then I 'll give you my affy-davy , upon my word of honour , to clap you somewhere safe ashore ."
"Or if that ai n't to your fancy , some of my hands being rough and having old scores on account of hazing , then you can stay here , you can ."
"We 'll divide stores with you , man for man ; and I 'll give my affy-davy , as before to speak the first ship I sight , and send 'em here to pick you up ."
"Now , you 'll own that 's talking ."
"Handsomer you could n't look to get , now you ."
"And I hope '' -- raising his voice -- `` that all hands in this here block house will overhaul my words , for what is spoke to one is spoke to all . ''"
Captain Smollett rose from his seat and knocked out the ashes of his pipe in the palm of his left hand .
`` Is that all ? ''
he asked .
"`` Every last word , by thunder ! ''"
answered John .
"`` Refuse that , and you 've seen the last of me but musket-balls . ''"
"`` Very good , '' said the captain ."
`` Now you 'll hear me .
`` Will you do as I tell you then ? ''
"`` Yes , I will . ''"
`` Then get Joe on the long-distance at once and tell him to bring out a license and ring tonight . ''
"`` Oh , I could n't , '' wailed the aghast Miranda , `` it -- it would be so -- so indelicate . ''"
Rilla shut her little white teeth together with a snap .
"`` Heaven grant me patience , '' she said under her breath ."
"`` I 'll do it then , '' she said aloud , `` and meanwhile , you go home and make what preparations you can ."
When I ` phone down to you to come up and help me sew come at once . ''
"As soon as Miranda , pallid , scared , but desperately resolved , had gone , Rilla flew to the telephone and put in a long-distance call for Charlottetown ."
"She got through with such surprising quickness that she was convinced Providence approved of her undertaking , but it was a good hour before she could get in touch with Joe Milgrave at his camp ."
"Meanwhile , she paced impatiently about , and prayed that when she did get Joe there would be no listeners on the line to carry news to Whiskers-on-the-moon ."
"`` Is that you , Joe ?"
"Rilla Blythe is speaking -- Rilla -- Rilla -- oh , never mind ."
Listen to this .
"Before you come home tonight get a marriage license -- a marriage license -- yes , a marriage license -- and a wedding-ring ."
Did you get that ?
And will you do it ?
"Very well , be sure you do it -- it is your only chance . ''"
Flushed with triumph -- for her only fear was that she might not be able to locate Joe in time -- Rilla rang the Pryor ring .
This time she had not such good luck for she drew Whiskers-on-the-moon .
`` Is that Miranda ?
Oh -- Mr. Pryor !
"Well , Mr. Pryor , will you kindly ask Miranda if she can come up this afternoon and help me with some sewing ."
"It is very important , or I would not trouble her ."
Oh -- thank you . ''
"Mr. Pryor had consented somewhat grumpily , but he had consented -- he did not want to offend Dr. Blythe , and he knew that if he refused to allow Miranda to do any Red Cross work public opinion would make the Glen too hot for comfort ."
"Rilla went out to the kitchen , shut all the doors with a mysterious expression which alarmed Susan , and then said solemnly , `` Susan can you make a wedding-cake this afternoon ? ''"
`` A wedding-cake ! ''
Susan stared .
"Rilla had , without any warning , brought her a war-baby once upon a time ."
"Was she now , with equal suddenness , going to produce a husband ?"
"`` Yes , a wedding-cake -- a scrumptious wedding-cake , Susan -- a beautiful , plummy , eggy , citron-peely wedding-cake ."
"`` Nay , it is the way of England ."
What would ye have ? ''
the earl demanded .
"`` But ye are unjust to the knight of Tunstall ; and as faith goes , in this unfaithful generation , he hath of late been honourably true to us of Lancaster ."
Even in our last reverses he stood firm . ''
"`` An it pleased you , then , '' said Dick , `` to cast your eye upon this letter , ye might somewhat change your thought of him ; '' and he handed to the earl Sir Daniel 's letter to Lord Wensleydale ."
"The effect upon the earl 's countenance was instant ; he lowered like an angry lion , and his hand , with a sudden movement , clutched at his dagger ."
`` Ye have read this also ? ''
he asked .
"`` Even so , '' said Dick ."
`` It is your lordship 's own estate he offers to Lord Wensleydale ? ''
"`` It is my own estate , even as ye say ! ''"
returned the earl .
`` I am your bedesman for this letter .
It hath shown me a fox 's hole .
"Command me , Master Shelton ; I will not be backward in gratitude , and to begin with , York or Lancaster , true man or thief , I do now set you at freedom ."
"Go , a Mary 's name !"
"But judge it right that I retain and hang your fellow , Lawless ."
"The crime hath been most open , and it were fitting that some open punishment should follow . ''"
"`` My lord , I make it my first suit to you to spare him also , '' pleaded Dick ."
"`` It is an old , condemned rogue , thief , and vagabond , Master Shelton , '' said the earl ."
`` He hath been gallows-ripe this score of years .
"And , whether for one thing or another , whether to-morrow or the day after , where is the great choice ? ''"
"`` Yet , my lord , it was through love to me that he came hither , '' answered Dick , `` and I were churlish and thankless to desert him . ''"
"`` Master Shelton , ye are troublesome , '' replied the earl , severely ."
`` It is an evil way to prosper in this world .
"Howbeit , and to be quit of your importunity , I will once more humour you ."
"Go , then , together ; but go warily , and get swiftly out of Shoreby town ."
For this Sir Daniel -LRB- whom may the saints confound ! -RRB-
thirsteth most greedily to have your blood . ''
"`` My lord , I do now offer you in words my gratitude , trusting at some brief date to pay you some of it in service , '' replied Dick , as he turned from the apartment ."
"CHAPTER VI -- ARBLASTER AGAIN When Dick and Lawless were suffered to steal , by a back way , out of the house where Lord Risingham held his garrison , the evening had already come ."
"`` Oh , if Susan and you are both banded together against me ! ''"
said Anne helplessly .
"One day the glorious news came that the Canadians had taken Courcelette and Martenpuich , with many prisoners and guns ."
Susan ran up the flag and said it was plain to be seen that Haig knew what soldiers to pick for a hard job .
The others dared not feel exultant .
Who knew what price had been paid ?
"Rilla woke that morning when the dawn was beginning to break and went to her window to look out , her thick creamy eyelids heavy with sleep ."
Just at dawn the world looks as it never looks at any other time .
The air was cold with dew and the orchard and grove and Rainbow Valley were full of mystery and wonder .
Over the eastern hill were golden deeps and silvery-pink shallows .
"There was no wind , and Rilla heard distinctly a dog howling in a melancholy way down in the direction of the station ."
Was it Dog Monday ?
"And if it were , why was he howling like that ?"
Rilla shivered ; the sound had something boding and grievous in it .
"She remembered that Miss Oliver said once , when they were coming home in the darkness and heard a dog howl , `` When a dog cries like that the Angel of Death is passing . ''"
Rilla listened with a curdling fear at her heart .
It was Dog Monday -- she felt sure of it .
Whose dirge was he howling -- to whose spirit was he sending that anguished greeting and farewell ?
Rilla went back to bed but she could not sleep .
All day she watched and waited in a dread of which she did not speak to anyone .
"She went down to see Dog Monday and the station-master said , `` That dog of yours howled from midnight to sunrise something weird ."
I dunno what got into him .
I got up once and went out and hollered at him but he paid no ` tention to me .
"He was sitting all alone in the moonlight out there at the end of the platform , and every few minutes the poor lonely little beggar 'd lift his nose and howl as if his heart was breaking ."
He never did it afore -- always slept in his kennel real quiet and canny from train to train .
But he sure had something on his mind last night . ''
Dog Monday was lying in his kennel .
He wagged his tail and licked Rilla 's hand .
But he would not touch the food she brought for him .
"`` I 'm afraid he 's sick , '' she said anxiously ."
She hated to go away and leave him .
But no bad news came that day -- nor the next -- nor the next .
"`` There is no sense in believing a thing just because you 'd like to believe it , Susan Baker ."
The British have lost millions of men at the Somme and how far have they got ?
"Look facts in the face , Susan Baker , look facts in the face . ''"
`` They are wearing the Germans out and so long as that happens it does not matter whether it is done a few miles east or a few miles west .
"I am not , '' admitted Susan in tremendous humility , `` I am not a military expert , Sophia Crawford , but even I can see that , and so could you if you were not determined to take a gloomy view of everything ."
The Huns have not got all the cleverness in the world .
"Have you not heard the story of Alistair MacCallum 's son Roderick , from the Upper Glen ?"
He is a prisoner in Germany and his mother got a letter from him last week .
"He wrote that he was being very kindly treated and that all the prisoners had plenty of food and so on , till you would have supposed everything was lovely ."
"But when he signed his name , right in between Roderick and MacCallum , he wrote two Gaelic words that meant ` all lies ' and the German censor did not understand Gaelic and thought it was all part of Roddy 's name ."
"So he let it pass , never dreaming how he was diddled ."
"Well , I am going to leave the war to Haig for the rest of the day and make a frosting for my chocolate cake ."
And when it is made I shall put it on the top shelf .
The last one I made I left it on the lower shelf and little Kitchener sneaked in and clawed all the icing off and ate it .
We had company for tea that night and when I went to get my cake what a sight did I behold ! ''
`` Has that pore orphan 's father never been heerd from yet ? ''
asked Cousin Sophia .
"`` Yes , I had a letter from him in July , '' said Rilla ."
"`` He said that when he got word of his wife 's death and of my taking the baby -- Mr. Meredith wrote him , you know -- he wrote right away , but as he never got any answer he had begun to think his letter must have been lost . ''"
"`` It took him two years to begin to think it , '' said Susan scornfully ."
`` Some people think very slow .
"Jim Anderson has not got a scratch , for all he has been two years in the trenches ."
"A fool for luck , as the old proverb says . ''"
"`` He wrote very nicely about Jims and said he 'd like to see him , '' said Rilla ."
"`` So I wrote and told him all about the wee man , and sent him snapshots ."
Jims will be two years old next week and he is a perfect duck . ''
"`` You did n't used to be very fond of babies , '' said Cousin Sophia ."
"`` I 'm not a bit fonder of babies in the abstract than ever I was , '' said Rilla , frankly ."
"`` But I do love Jims , and I 'm afraid I was n't really half as glad as I should have been when Jim Anderson 's letter proved that he was safe and sound . ''"
`` You was n't hoping the man would be killed ! ''
cried Cousin Sophia in horrified accents .
`` No -- no -- no !
Subject : ` Is summer or winter best fun ? '
A lively pow-wow .
About evenly divided .
J. Flint fined five cents for disrespect to the Chair .
A collection of forty cents taken up to pay for breaking a pane of glass during a free fight of the members on the door-step .
"E. Devlin was chosen Secretary for the coming year , and a new book contributed by the Chairman . ''"
`` That 's all . ''
`` Is there any other business before the meeting ? ''
"asked Frank , as the reader closed the old book with a slam and shoved the new one across the table ."
"Ed rose , and glancing about him with an appealing look , said , as if sure his proposition would not be well received , `` I wish to propose the name of a new member ."
"Bob Walker wants to join , and I think we ought to let him ."
"He is trying to behave well , and I am sure we could help him ."
Ca n't we ? ''
"All the boys looked sober , and Joe , otherwise Brickbat , said , bluntly , `` I wo n't ."
"He 's a bad lot , and we do n't want any such here ."
Let him go with chaps of his own sort . ''
`` That is just what I want to keep him from !
"He 's a good-hearted boy enough , only no one looks after him ; so he gets into scrapes , as we should , if we were in his place , I dare say ."
"He wants to come here , and would be so proud if he was let in , I know he 'd behave ."
"Come now , let 's give him a chance , '' and Ed looked at Gus and Frank , sure that if they stood by him he should carry his point ."
"But Gus shook his head , as if doubtful of the wisdom of the plan , and Frank said gravely : `` You know we made the rule that the number should never be over eight , and we can not break it . ''"
`` You need n't .
"I ca n't be here half the time , so I will resign and let Bob have my place , '' began Ed , but he was silenced by shouts of `` No , no , you sha n't ! ''"
`` We wo n't let you off ! ''
"`` Club would go to smash , if you back out ! ''"
"`` Let him have my place ; I 'm the youngest , and you wo n't miss me , '' cried Jack , bound to stand by Ed at all costs ."
"`` We might do that , '' said Frank , who did object to small boys , though willing to admit this particular one ."
"`` Better make a new rule to have ten members , and admit both Bob and Tom Grant , '' said Ralph , whereat Grif grinned and Joe scowled , for one lad liked Merry 's big brother and the other did not ."
`` That 's a good idea !
"Put it to vote , '' said Gus , too kind-hearted to shut the door on any one ."
"`` First I want to ask if all you fellows are ready to stand by Bob , out of the club as well as in , for it wo n't do much good to be kind to him here and cut him at school and in the street , '' said Ed , heartily in earnest about the matter ."
`` I will ! ''
"There was a pause , then a cry of surprise , and then a voice shouting from the house , `` Bill 's dead . ''"
But the blind man swore at them again for their delay .
"`` Search him , some of you shirking lubbers , and the rest of you aloft and get the chest , '' he cried ."
"I could hear their feet rattling up our old stairs , so that the house must have shook with it ."
"Promptly afterwards , fresh sounds of astonishment arose ; the window of the captain 's room was thrown open with a slam and a jingle of broken glass , and a man leaned out into the moonlight , head and shoulders , and addressed the blind beggar on the road below him ."
"`` Pew , '' he cried , `` they 've been before us ."
Someone 's turned the chest out alow and aloft . ''
`` Is it there ? ''
roared Pew .
`` The money 's there . ''
The blind man cursed the money .
"`` Flint 's fist , I mean , '' he cried ."
"`` We do n't see it here nohow , '' returned the man ."
"`` Here , you below there , is it on Bill ? ''"
cried the blind man again .
"At that another fellow , probably him who had remained below to search the captain 's body , came to the door of the inn ."
"`` Bill 's been overhauled a ` ready , '' said he ; `` nothin ' left . ''"
`` It 's these people of the inn -- it 's that boy .
I wish I had put his eyes out ! ''
"cried the blind man , Pew ."
`` There were no time ago -- they had the door bolted when I tried it .
"Scatter , lads , and find 'em . ''"
"`` Sure enough , they left their glim here , '' said the fellow from the window ."
`` Scatter and find 'em !
Rout the house out ! ''
"reiterated Pew , striking with his stick upon the road ."
"Then there followed a great to-do through all our old inn , heavy feet pounding to and fro , furniture thrown over , doors kicked in , until the very rocks re-echoed and the men came out again , one after another , on the road and declared that we were nowhere to be found ."
"And just the same whistle that had alarmed my mother and myself over the dead captain 's money was once more clearly audible through the night , but this time twice repeated ."
"I had thought it to be the blind man 's trumpet , so to speak , summoning his crew to the assault , but I now found that it was a signal from the hillside towards the hamlet , and from its effect upon the buccaneers , a signal to warn them of approaching danger ."
"`` There 's Dirk again , '' said one ."
`` Twice !
"We 'll have to budge , mates . ''"
All the Turks jumped so high that their slippers flew above their heads ; such a splendid glitter they had never seen before .
Now they could quite well understand that it was the god of the Turks himself who was to marry the princess .
"As soon as the young merchant came down again into the wood with his trunk he thought , ` Now I will just go into the town to see how the show has taken . '"
And it was quite natural that he should want to do this .
Oh !
what stories the people had to tell !
"Each one whom he asked had seen it differently , but they had all found it beautiful . '"
"I saw the Turkish god himself , ' said one ."
"` He had eyes like glittering stars , and a beard like foaming water . '"
"` He flew away in a cloak of fire , ' said another ."
"They were splendid things that he heard , and the next day was to be his wedding day ."
Then he went back into the wood to sit in his trunk ; but what had become of it ?
The trunk had been burnt .
"A spark of the fireworks had set it alight , and the trunk was in ashes ."
"He could no longer fly , and could never reach his bride ."
She stood the whole day long on the roof and waited ; perhaps she is waiting there still .
But he wandered through the world and told stories ; though they are not so merry as the one he told about the matches .
The Snow-man Translated from the German of Hans Andersen .
` How astonishingly cold it is !
My body is cracking all over ! '
said the Snow-man .
` The wind is really cutting one 's very life out !
And how that fiery thing up there glares ! '
"He meant the sun , which was just setting ."
"` It sha 'n' t make me blink , though , and I shall keep quite cool and collected . '"
"Instead of eyes he had two large three-cornered pieces of slate in his head ; his mouth consisted of an old rake , so that he had teeth as well ."
"He was born amidst the shouts and laughter of the boys , and greeted by the jingling bells and cracking whips of the sledges ."
"The sun went down , the full moon rose , large , round , clear and beautiful , in the dark blue sky ."
` There it is again on the other side ! '
"said the Snow-man , by which he meant the sun was appearing again . '"
I have become quite accustomed to its glaring .
"I hope it will hang there and shine , so that I may be able to see myself ."
`` What is the matter ? ''
"asked Gilbert , who had arrived at the open kitchen door just in time to hear the sigh ."
"Anne colored , and thrust her writing out of sight under some school compositions ."
`` Nothing very dreadful .
"I was just trying to write out some of my thoughts , as Professor Hamilton advised me , but I could n't get them to please me ."
They seem so still and foolish directly they 're written down on white paper with black ink .
"Fancies are like shadows ... you ca n't cage them , they 're such wayward , dancing things ."
But perhaps I 'll learn the secret some day if I keep on trying .
"I have n't a great many spare moments , you know ."
"By the time I finish correcting school exercises and compositions , I do n't always feel like writing any of my own . ''"
"`` You are getting on splendidly in school , Anne ."
"All the children like you , '' said Gilbert , sitting down on the stone step ."
"`` No , not all ."
Anthony Pye does n't and WO N'T like me .
"What is worse , he does n't respect me ... no , he does n't ."
He simply holds me in contempt and I do n't mind confessing to you that it worries me miserably .
"It is n't that he is so very bad ... he is only rather mischievous , but no worse than some of the others ."
He seldom disobeys me ; but he obeys with a scornful air of toleration as if it was n't worthwhile disputing the point or he would ... and it has a bad effect on the others .
I 've tried every way to win him but I 'm beginning to fear I never shall .
"I want to , for he 's rather a cute little lad , if he IS a Pye , and I could like him if he 'd let me . ''"
`` Probably it 's merely the effect of what he hears at home . ''
`` Not altogether .
Anthony is an independent little chap and makes up his own mind about things .
He has always gone to men before and he says girl teachers are no good .
"Well , we 'll see what patience and kindness will do ."
I like overcoming difficulties and teaching is really very interesting work .
Paul Irving makes up for all that is lacking in the others .
"That child is a perfect darling , Gilbert , and a genius into the bargain ."
"I 'm persuaded the world will hear of him some day , '' concluded Anne in a tone of conviction ."
"`` I like teaching , too , '' said Gilbert ."
"`` It 's good training , for one thing ."
"Why , Anne , I 've learned more in the weeks I 've been teaching the young ideas of White Sands than I learned in all the years I went to school myself ."
"A whistle sounded thrice , and then again twice ."
It was repeated from another quarter .
"The woods on either side became full of the sound of people bursting through the underwood ; and a bewildered deer ran out into the open , stood for a second on three feet , with nose in air , and then plunged again into the thicket ."
"Selden still ran , bounding ; ever and again an arrow followed him , but still would miss ."
It began to appear as if he might escape .
"Dick had his bow armed , ready to support him ; even Matcham , forgetful of his interest , took sides at heart for the poor fugitive ; and both lads glowed and trembled in the ardour of their hearts ."
"He was within fifty yards of them , when an arrow struck him and he fell ."
"He was up again , indeed , upon the instant ; but now he ran staggering , and , like a blind man , turned aside from his direction ."
Dick leaped to his feet and waved to him .
`` Here ! ''
he cried .
`` This way !
here is help !
"Nay , run , fellow -- run ! ''"
"But just then a second arrow struck Selden in the shoulder , between the plates of his brigandine , and , piercing through his jack , brought him , like a stone , to earth ."
"`` O , the poor heart ! ''"
"cried Matcham , with clasped hands ."
"And Dick stood petrified upon the hill , a mark for archery ."
"Ten to one he had speedily been shot -- for the foresters were furious with themselves , and taken unawares by Dick 's appearance in the rear of their position -- but instantly , out of a quarter of the wood surprisingly near to the two lads , a stentorian voice arose , the voice of Ellis Duckworth ."
`` Hold ! ''
it roared .
`` Shoot not !
Take him alive !
It is young Shelton -- Harry 's son . ''
"And immediately after a shrill whistle sounded several times , and was again taken up and repeated farther off ."
"The whistle , it appeared , was John Amend-All 's battle trumpet , by which he published his directions ."
"`` Ah , foul fortune ! ''"
cried Dick .
`` We are undone .
"Swiftly , Jack , come swiftly ! ''"
And the pair turned and ran back through the open pine clump that covered the summit of the hill .
"CHAPTER VI -- TO THE DAY 'S END It was , indeed , high time for them to run ."
"cried the boys as she bounced in among them with the announcement , `` I 'm going to stay . ''"
`` Hooray ! ''
"bawled Tommy from the wall on which he was perched , for Nan was a kindred spirit , and he foresaw `` larks '' in the future ."
"`` I can bat ; let me play , '' said Nan , who could turn her hand to any thing , and did not mind hard knocks ."
"`` We ai n't playing now , and our side beat without you . ''"
"`` I can beat you in running , any way , '' returned Nan , falling back on her strong point ."
`` Can she ? ''
asked Nat of Jack .
"`` She runs very well for a girl , '' answered Jack , who looked down upon Nan with condescending approval ."
`` Will you try ? ''
"said Nan , longing to display her powers ."
"`` It 's too hot , '' and Tommy languished against the wall as if quite exhausted ."
`` What 's the matter with Stuffy ? ''
"asked Nan , whose quick eyes were roving from face to face ."
"`` Ball hurt his hand ; he howls at every thing , '' answered Jack scornfully ."
"`` I do n't , I never cry , no matter how I 'm hurt ; it 's babyish , '' said Nan , loftily ."
`` Pooh !
"I could make you cry in two minutes , '' returned Stuffy , rousing up ."
`` See if you can . ''
"`` Go and pick that bunch of nettles , then , '' and Stuffy pointed to a sturdy specimen of that prickly plant growing by the wall ."
"Nan instantly `` grasped the nettle , '' pulled it up , and held it with a defiant gesture , in spite of the almost unbearable sting ."
"`` Good for you , '' cried the boys , quick to acknowledge courage even in one of the weaker sex ."
"More nettled than she was , Stuffy determined to get a cry out of her somehow , and he said tauntingly , `` You are used to poking your hands into every thing , so that is n't fair ."
"Now go and bump your head real hard against the barn , and see if you do n't howl then . ''"
"`` Do n't do it , '' said Nat , who hated cruelty ."
"But Nan was off , and running straight at the barn , she gave her head a blow that knocked her flat , and sounded like a battering-ram ."
"Dizzy , but undaunted , she staggered up , saying stoutly , though her face was drawn with pain , `` That hurt , but I do n't cry . ''"
"`` Do it again , '' said Stuffy angrily ; and Nan would have done it , but Nat held her ; and Tommy , forgetting the heat , flew at Stuffy like a little game-cock , roaring out , `` Stop it , or I 'll throw you over the barn ! ''"
and so shook and hustled poor Stuffy that for a minute he did not know whether he was on his head or his heels .
"`` She told me to , '' was all he could say , when Tommy let him alone ."
"`` Never mind if she did ; it is awfully mean to hurt a little girl , '' said Demi , reproachfully ."
`` Ho !
Smee had listened with growing admiration .
"` It 's the wickedest , prettiest policy ever I heard of , ' he cried , and in their exultation they danced and sang : ` Avast , belay , when I appear , By fear they 're overtook ; Nought 's left upon your bones when you Have shaken claws with Cook . '"
"They began the verse , but they never finished it , for another sound broke in and stilled them ."
"It was at first such a tiny sound that a leaf might have fallen on it and smothered it , but as it came nearer it was more distinct ."
Tick tick tick tick .
"Hook stood shuddering , one foot in the air ."
"` The crocodile , ' he gasped , and bounded away , followed by his bo ` sun ."
It was indeed the crocodile .
"It had passed the redskins , who were now on the trail of the other pirates ."
It oozed on after Hook .
"Once more the boys emerged into the open ; but the dangers of the night were not yet over , for presently Nibs rushed breathless into their midst , pursued by a pack of wolves ."
The tongues of the pursuers were hanging out ; the baying of them was horrible .
"` Save me , save me ! '"
"cried Nibs , falling on the ground ."
"` But what can we do , what can we do ? '"
It was a high compliment to Peter that at that dire moment their thoughts turned to him .
` What would Peter do ? '
they cried simultaneously .
"Almost in the same breath they added , ` Peter would look at them through his legs . '"
"And then , ` Let us do what Peter would do . '"
"It is quite the most successful way of defying wolves , and as one boy they bent and looked through their legs ."
"The next moment is the long one ; but victory came quickly , for as the boys advanced upon them in this terrible attitude , the wolves dropped their tails and fled ."
"Now Nibs rose from the ground , and the others thought that his staring eyes still saw the wolves ."
But it was not wolves he saw . '
"I have seen a wonderfuller thing , ' he cried , as they gathered round him eagerly . '"
A great white bird .
It is flying this way . '
"` What kind of a bird , do you think ? ' '"
"I do n't know , ' Nibs said , awestruck , ` but it looks so weary , and as it flies it moans , `` Poor Wendy . '' '"
` Poor Wendy ? ' '
"I remember , ' said Slightly instantly , ` there are birds called Wendies . '"
"` See , it comes , ' cried Curly , pointing to Wendy in the heavens ."
"Finally Mr. Barry shook his head , with a relieved air ."
`` She ca n't be down there .
"It 's a mighty curious thing where she could have got to , though ."
"Look here , young man , are you sure you 've no idea where your sister is ? ''"
"`` I 've told you a dozen times that I have n't , '' said Davy , with an injured air ."
`` Maybe a tramp come and stole her . ''
"`` Nonsense , '' said Marilla sharply , relieved from her horrible fear of the well ."
"`` Anne , do you suppose she could have strayed over to Mr. Harrison 's ?"
She has always been talking about his parrot ever since that time you took her over . ''
"`` I ca n't believe Dora would venture so far alone but I 'll go over and see , '' said Anne ."
Nobody was looking at Davy just then or it would have been seen that a very decided change came over his face .
"He quietly slipped off the gate and ran , as fast as his fat legs could carry him , to the barn ."
Anne hastened across the fields to the Harrison establishment in no very hopeful frame of mind .
"The house was locked , the window shades were down , and there was no sign of anything living about the place ."
She stood on the veranda and called Dora loudly .
"Ginger , in the kitchen behind her , shrieked and swore with sudden fierceness ; but between his outbursts Anne heard a plaintive cry from the little building in the yard which served Mr. Harrison as a toolhouse ."
"Anne flew to the door , unhasped it , and caught up a small mortal with a tearstained face who was sitting forlornly on an upturned nail keg ."
"`` Oh , Dora , Dora , what a fright you have given us !"
How came you to be here ? ''
"`` Davy and I came over to see Ginger , '' sobbed Dora , `` but we could n't see him after all , only Davy made him swear by kicking the door ."
And then Davy brought me here and run out and shut the door ; and I could n't get out .
"I cried and cried , I was frightened , and oh , I 'm so hungry and cold ; and I thought you 'd never come , Anne . ''"
`` Davy ? ''
But Anne could say no more .
She carried Dora home with a heavy heart .
Her joy at finding the child safe and sound was drowned out in the pain caused by Davy 's behavior .
The freak of shutting Dora up might easily have been pardoned .
But Davy had told falsehoods ... downright coldblooded falsehoods about it .
That was the ugly fact and Anne could not shut her eyes to it .
She could have sat down and cried with sheer disappointment .
She had grown to love Davy dearly ... how dearly she had not known until this minute ... and it hurt her unbearably to discover that he was guilty of deliberate falsehood .
Marilla listened to Anne 's tale in a silence that boded no good Davy-ward ; Mr. Barry laughed and advised that Davy be summarily dealt with .
"I had heard the word , and I knew it stood for a horrible kind of punishment common enough among the buccaneers , in which the offender is put ashore with a little powder and shot and left behind on some desolate and distant island ."
"`` Marooned three years agone , '' he continued , `` and lived on goats since then , and berries , and oysters ."
"Wherever a man is , says I , a man can do for himself ."
"But , mate , my heart is sore for Christian diet ."
"You might n't happen to have a piece of cheese about you , now ?"
No ?
"Well , many 's the long night I 've dreamed of cheese -- toasted , mostly -- and woke up again , and here I were . ''"
"`` If ever I can get aboard again , '' said I , `` you shall have cheese by the stone . ''"
"All this time he had been feeling the stuff of my jacket , smoothing my hands , looking at my boots , and generally , in the intervals of his speech , showing a childish pleasure in the presence of a fellow creature ."
But at my last words he perked up into a kind of startled slyness .
"`` If ever you can get aboard again , says you ? ''"
he repeated .
"`` Why , now , who 's to hinder you ? ''"
"`` Not you , I know , '' was my reply ."
"`` And right you was , '' he cried ."
"`` Now you -- what do you call yourself , mate ? ''"
"`` Jim , '' I told him ."
"`` Jim , Jim , '' says he , quite pleased apparently ."
"`` Well , now , Jim , I 've lived that rough as you 'd be ashamed to hear of ."
"Now , for instance , you would n't think I had had a pious mother -- to look at me ? ''"
he asked .
"`` Why , no , not in particular , '' I answered ."
"`` Ah , well , '' said he , `` but I had -- remarkable pious ."
"And I was a civil , pious boy , and could rattle off my catechism that fast , as you could n't tell one word from another ."
"And here 's what it come to , Jim , and it begun with chuck-farthen on the blessed grave-stones !"
"That 's what it begun with , but it went further 'n that ; and so my mother told me , and predicked the whole , she did , the pious woman !"
But it were Providence that put me here .
"I 've thought it all out in this here lonely island , and I 'm back on piety ."
"You do n't catch me tasting rum so much , but just a thimbleful for luck , of course , the first chance I have ."
"I 'm bound I 'll be good , and I see the way to ."
"And , Jim '' -- looking all round him and lowering his voice to a whisper -- `` I 'm rich . ''"
"I now felt sure that the poor fellow had gone crazy in his solitude , and I suppose I must have shown the feeling in my face , for he repeated the statement hotly : `` Rich !"
`` The first week in June was another dreadful one .
"The Austrians seemed just on the point of overrunning Italy : and then came the first awful news of the Battle of Jutland , which the Germans claimed as a great victory ."
Susan was the only one who carried on .
"` You need never tell me that the Kaiser has defeated the British Navy , ' she said , with a contemptuous sniff ."
` It is all a German lie and that you may tie to . '
"And when a couple of days later we found out that she was right and that it had been a British victory instead of a British defeat , we had to put up with a great many ' I told you so 's , ' but we endured them very comfortably ."
`` It took Kitchener 's death to finish Susan .
For the first time I saw her down and out .
We all felt the shock of it but Susan plumbed the depths of despair .
The news came at night by ` phone but Susan would n't believe it until she saw the Enterprise headline the next day .
"She did not cry or faint or go into hysterics ; but she forgot to put salt in the soup , and that is something Susan never did in my recollection ."
"Mother and Miss Oliver and I cried but Susan looked at us in stony sarcasm and said , ` The Kaiser and his six sons are all alive and thriving ."
So the world is not left wholly desolate .
"Why cry , Mrs. Dr. dear ? '"
"Susan continued in this stony , hopeless condition for twenty-four hours , and then Cousin Sophia appeared and began to condole with her . ''"
"` This is terrible news , ai n't it , Susan ?"
We might as well prepare for the worst for it is bound to come .
"You said once -- and well do I remember the words , Susan Baker -- that you had complete confidence in God and Kitchener ."
"Ah well , Susan Baker , there is only God left now . '"
`` Whereat Cousin Sophia put her handkerchief to her eyes pathetically as if the world were indeed in terrible straits .
"As for Susan , Cousin Sophia was the salvation of her ."
She came to life with a jerk . ''
"` Sophia Crawford , hold your peace ! '"
she said sternly .
` You may be an idiot but you need not be an irreverent idiot .
It is no more than decent to be weeping and wailing because the Almighty is the sole stay of the Allies now .
"As for Kitchener , his death is a great loss and I do not dispute it ."
But the outcome of this war does not depend on one man 's life and now that the Russians are coming on again you will soon see a change for the better . '
`` Susan said this so energetically that she convinced herself and cheered up immediately .
But Cousin Sophia shook her head . ''
"` Albert 's wife wants to call the baby after Brusiloff , ' she said , ` but I told her to wait and see what becomes of him first ."
Them Russians has such a habit of petering out . '
"` Please , sir , ' Peter explained , ' a lady lies very ill . '"
"She was lying at their feet , but Slightly had the sense not to see her ."
"` Tut , tut , tut , ' he said , ` where does she lie ? '"
` In yonder glade . ' '
"I will put a glass thing in her mouth , ' said Slightly ; and he made-believe to do it , while Peter waited ."
It was an anxious moment when the glass thing was withdrawn .
` How is she ? '
inquired Peter .
"` Tut , tut , tut , ' said Slightly , ` this has cured her . ' '"
"I am glad , ' Peter cried . '"
"I will call again in the evening , ' Slightly said ; ` give her beef tea out of a cup with a spout to it ' ; but after he had returned the hat to John he blew big breaths , which was his habit on escaping from a difficulty ."
In the meantime the wood had been alive with the sound of axes ; almost everything needed for a cosy dwelling already lay at Wendy 's feet .
"` If only we knew , ' said one , ` the kind of house she likes best . '"
"` Peter , ' shouted another , ` she is moving in her sleep . '"
"` Her mouth opens , ' cried a third , looking respectfully into it ."
"` Oh , lovely ! '"
"` Perhaps she is going to sing in her sleep , ' said Peter ."
"` Wendy , sing the kind of house you would like to have . '"
"Immediately , without opening her eyes , Wendy began to sing : ' I wish I had a pretty house , The littlest ever seen , With funny little red walls And roof of mossy green . '"
"They gurgled with joy at this , for by the greatest good luck the branches they had brought were sticky with red sap , and all the ground was carpeted with moss ."
"As they rattled up the little house they broke into song themselves : ` We 've built the little walls and roof And made a lovely door , So tell us , mother Wendy , What are you wanting more ? '"
"To this she answered rather greedily : ` Oh , really next I think I 'll have Gay windows all about , With roses peeping in , you know , And babies peeping out . '"
"With a blow of their fists they made windows , and large yellow leaves were the blinds ."
But roses -- ?
"` Roses , ' cried Peter sternly ."
Quickly they made-believe to grow the loveliest roses up the walls .
Babies ?
"To prevent Peter ordering babies they hurried into song again : ` We 've made the roses peeping out , The babes are at the door , We can not make ourselves , you know , ` Cos we 've been made before . '"
"Peter , seeing this to be a good idea , at once pretended that it was his own ."
"The house was quite beautiful , and no doubt Wendy was very cosy within , though , of course , they could no longer see her ."
"Peter strode up and down , ordering finishing touches ."
Nothing escaped his eagle eye .
"It were no help to me , good boy ."
But yet I thank you . ''
"The night had now fallen , and under the trees they could no longer read each other 's face ."
"`` I will go some little way with you , '' said Dick ."
`` The night is dark .
"I would fain leave you on a path , at least ."
"My mind misgiveth me , y ' are likely to be lost . ''"
"Without any more words , he began to walk forward , and the other once more followed him ."
The blackness grew thicker and thicker .
"Only here and there , in open places , they saw the sky , dotted with small stars ."
"In the distance , the noise of the rout of the Lancastrian army still continued to be faintly audible ; but with every step they left it farther in the rear ."
At the end of half an hour of silent progress they came forth upon a broad patch of heathy open .
"It glimmered in the light of the stars , shaggy with fern and islanded with clumps of yew ."
And here they paused and looked upon each other .
`` Y ' are weary ? ''
Dick said .
"`` Nay , I am so weary , '' answered Matcham , `` that methinks I could lie down and die . ''"
"`` I hear the chiding of a river , '' returned Dick ."
"`` Let us go so far forth , for I am sore athirst . ''"
"The ground sloped down gently ; and , sure enough , in the bottom , they found a little murmuring river , running among willows ."
"Here they threw themselves down together by the brink ; and putting their mouths to the level of a starry pool , they drank their fill ."
"`` Dick , '' said Matcham , `` it may not be ."
I can no more . ''
"`` I saw a pit as we came down , '' said Dick ."
`` Let us lie down therein and sleep . ''
"`` Nay , but with all my heart ! ''"
cried Matcham .
"The pit was sandy and dry ; a shock of brambles hung upon one hedge , and made a partial shelter ; and there the two lads lay down , keeping close together for the sake of warmth , their quarrel all forgotten ."
"And soon sleep fell upon them like a cloud , and under the dew and stars they rested peacefully ."
"CHAPTER VII -- THE HOODED FACE They awoke in the grey of the morning ; the birds were not yet in full song , but twittered here and there among the woods ; the sun was not yet up , but the eastern sky was barred with solemn colours ."
"Half starved and over-weary as they were , they lay without moving , sunk in a delightful lassitude ."
"And as they thus lay , the clang of a bell fell suddenly upon their ears ."
And he pinched me again in the most confidential manner .
"`` Then , '' he continued , `` then you 'll up , and you 'll say this : Gunn is a good man -LRB- you 'll say -RRB- , and he puts a precious sight more confidence -- a precious sight , mind that -- in a gen ` leman born than in these gen ` leman of fortune , having been one hisself . ''"
"`` Well , '' I said , `` I do n't understand one word that you 've been saying ."
But that 's neither here nor there ; for how am I to get on board ? ''
"`` Ah , '' said he , `` that 's the hitch , for sure ."
"Well , there 's my boat , that I made with my two hands ."
I keep her under the white rock .
"If the worst come to the worst , we might try that after dark ."
Hi ! ''
he broke out .
`` What 's that ? ''
"For just then , although the sun had still an hour or two to run , all the echoes of the island awoke and bellowed to the thunder of a cannon ."
`` They have begun to fight ! ''
I cried .
`` Follow me . ''
"And I began to run towards the anchorage , my terrors all forgotten , while close at my side the marooned man in his goatskins trotted easily and lightly ."
"`` Left , left , '' says he ; `` keep to your left hand , mate Jim !"
Under the trees with you !
Theer 's where I killed my first goat .
They do n't come down here now ; they 're all mastheaded on them mountings for the fear of Benjamin Gunn .
Ah !
"And there 's the cetemery '' -- cemetery , he must have meant ."
`` You see the mounds ?
"I come here and prayed , nows and thens , when I thought maybe a Sunday would be about doo ."
"It were n't quite a chapel , but it seemed more solemn like ; and then , says you , Ben Gunn was short-handed -- no chapling , nor so much as a Bible and a flag , you says . ''"
"So he kept talking as I ran , neither expecting nor receiving any answer ."
The cannon-shot was followed after a considerable interval by a volley of small arms .
"Another pause , and then , not a quarter of a mile in front of me , I beheld the Union Jack flutter in the air above a wood ."
PART FOUR -- The Stockade 16 Narrative Continued by the Doctor : How the Ship Was Abandoned IT was about half past one -- three bells in the sea phrase -- that the two boats went ashore from the HISPANIOLA .
"The captain , the squire , and I were talking matters over in the cabin ."
"Had there been a breath of wind , we should have fallen on the six mutineers who were left aboard with us , slipped our cable , and away to sea ."
"But the wind was wanting ; and to complete our helplessness , down came Hunter with the news that Jim Hawkins had slipped into a boat and was gone ashore with the rest ."
"`` Now here , '' he cried , `` on my right hand , I swear to avenge it !"
"If that I fail , if that I spill not ten men 's souls for each , may this hand wither from my body !"
"I broke this Duckworth like a rush ; I beggared him to his door ; I burned the thatch above his head ; I drove him from this country ; and now , cometh he back to beard me ?"
"Nay , but , Duckworth , this time it shall go bitter hard ! ''"
"He was silent for some time , his face working ."
`` Eat ! ''
"he cried , suddenly ."
"`` And you here , '' he added to Matcham , `` swear me an oath to follow straight to the Moat House . ''"
"`` I will pledge mine honour , '' replied Matcham ."
`` What make I with your honour ? ''
cried the knight .
`` Swear me upon your mother 's welfare ! ''
"Matcham gave the required oath ; and Sir Daniel re-adjusted the hood over his face , and prepared his bell and staff ."
To see him once more in that appalling travesty somewhat revived the horror of his two companions .
But the knight was soon upon his feet .
"`` Eat with despatch , '' he said , `` and follow me yarely to mine house . ''"
"And with that he set forth again into the woods ; and presently after the bell began to sound , numbering his steps , and the two lads sat by their untasted meal , and heard it die slowly away up hill into the distance ."
`` And so ye go to Tunstall ? ''
Dick inquired .
"`` Yea , verily , '' said Matcham , `` when needs must !"
I am braver behind Sir Daniel 's back than to his face . ''
"They ate hastily , and set forth along the path through the airy upper levels of the forest , where great beeches stood apart among green lawns , and the birds and squirrels made merry on the boughs ."
"Two hours later , they began to descend upon the other side , and already , among the tree-tops , saw before them the red walls and roofs of Tunstall House ."
"`` Here , '' said Matcham , pausing , `` ye shall take your leave of your friend Jack , whom y ' are to see no more ."
"Come , Dick , forgive him what he did amiss , as he , for his part , cheerfully and lovingly forgiveth you . ''"
`` And wherefore so ? ''
asked Dick .
"`` An we both go to Tunstall , I shall see you yet again , I trow , and that right often . ''"
"`` Ye 'll never again see poor Jack Matcham , '' replied the other , `` that was so fearful and burthensome , and yet plucked you from the river ; ye 'll not see him more , Dick , by mine honour ! ''"
"He held his arms open , and the lads embraced and kissed ."
"`` And , Dick , '' continued Matcham , `` my spirit bodeth ill ."
"Y ' are now to see a new Sir Daniel ; for heretofore hath all prospered in his hands exceedingly , and fortune followed him ; but now , methinks , when his fate hath come upon him , and he runs the adventure of his life , he will prove but a foul lord to both of us ."
"`` Redheaded snippet , '' quoted Ginger in a tone of profound contempt ."
"At this point Mr. Harrison arose and , with an expression that would have struck terror into any bird but a parrot , carried Ginger 's cage into an adjoining room and shut the door ."
"Ginger shrieked , swore , and otherwise conducted himself in keeping with his reputation , but finding himself left alone , relapsed into sulky silence ."
"`` Excuse me and go on , '' said Mr. Harrison , sitting down again ."
`` My brother the sailor never taught that bird any manners . ''
`` I went home and after tea I went out to the milking pen .
"Mr. Harrison , '' ... Anne leaned forward , clasping her hands with her old childish gesture , while her big gray eyes gazed imploringly into Mr. Harrison 's embarrassed face ... `` I found my cow still shut up in the pen ."
It was YOUR cow I had sold to Mr. Shearer . ''
"`` Bless my soul , '' exclaimed Mr. Harrison , in blank amazement at this unlooked-for conclusion ."
`` What a VERY extraordinary thing ! ''
"`` Oh , it is n't in the least extraordinary that I should be getting myself and other people into scrapes , '' said Anne mournfully ."
`` I 'm noted for that .
You might suppose I 'd have grown out of it by this time ... I 'll be seventeen next March ... but it seems that I have n't .
"Mr. Harrison , is it too much to hope that you 'll forgive me ?"
"I 'm afraid it 's too late to get your cow back , but here is the money for her ... or you can have mine in exchange if you 'd rather ."
She 's a very good cow .
And I ca n't express how sorry I am for it all . ''
"`` Tut , tut , '' said Mr. Harrison briskly , `` do n't say another word about it , miss ."
It 's of no consequence ... no consequence whatever .
Accidents will happen .
"I 'm too hasty myself sometimes , miss ... far too hasty ."
But I ca n't help speaking out just what I think and folks must take me as they find me .
"If that cow had been in my cabbages now ... but never mind , she was n't , so it 's all right ."
"I think I 'd rather have your cow in exchange , since you want to be rid of her . ''"
"`` Oh , thank you , Mr. Harrison ."
I 'm so glad you are not vexed .
I was afraid you would be . ''
"`` And I suppose you were scared to death to come here and tell me , after the fuss I made yesterday , hey ?"
"But you must n't mind me , I 'm a terrible outspoken old fellow , that 's all ... awful apt to tell the truth , no matter if it is a bit plain . ''"
"`` So is Mrs. Lynde , '' said Anne , before she could prevent herself ."
`` Who ?
Mrs. Lynde ?
"He gave his hat to Liza , who took it scornfully ; for she had no imagination , and was quite incapable of understanding the motives of such a man ."
"Outside , the crowd who had accompanied the cab home were still cheering , and he was naturally not unmoved ."
"`` Listen to them , '' he said ; `` it is very gratifying . ''"
"`` Lots of little boys , '' sneered Liza ."
"`` There were several adults to-day , '' he assured her with a faint flush ; but when she tossed her head he had not a word of reproof for her ."
Social success had not spoilt him ; it had made him sweeter .
"For some time he sat with his head out of the kennel , talking with Mrs. Darling of this success , and pressing her hand reassuringly when she said she hoped his head would not be turned by it ."
"`` But if I had been a weak man , '' he said ."
"`` Good heavens , if I had been a weak man ! ''"
"`` And , George , '' she said timidly , `` you are as full of remorse as ever , are n't you ? ''"
"`` Full of remorse as ever , dearest !"
See my punishment : living in a kennel . ''
"`` But it is punishment , is n't it , George ?"
You are sure you are not enjoying it ? ''
`` My love ! ''
"You may be sure she begged his pardon ; and then , feeling drowsy , he curled round in the kennel ."
"`` Wo n't you play me to sleep , '' he asked , `` on the nursery piano ? ''"
"and as she was crossing to the day-nursery he added thoughtlessly , `` And shut that window ."
I feel a draught . ''
"`` O George , never ask me to do that ."
"The window must always be left open for them , always , always . ''"
"Now it was his turn to beg her pardon ; and she went into the day-nursery and played , and soon he was asleep ; and while he slept , Wendy and John and Michael flew into the room ."
Oh no .
"We have written it so , because that was the charming arrangement planned by them before we left the ship ; but something must have happened since then , for it is not they who have flown in , it is Peter and Tinker Bell ."
Peter 's first words tell all .
"`` Quick Tink , '' he whispered , `` close the window ; bar it !"
That 's right .
Now you and I must get away by the door ; and when Wendy comes she will think her mother has barred her out ; and she will have to go back with me . ''
"Now I understand what had hitherto puzzled me , why when Peter had exterminated the pirates he did not return to the island and leave Tink to escort the children to the mainland ."
This trick had been in his head all the time .
Instead of feeling that he was behaving badly he danced with glee ; then he peeped into the day-nursery to see who was playing .
"He whispered to Tink , `` It 's Wendy 's mother !"
"When a mate brings a slip on his cable -- one as knows me , I mean -- it wo n't be in the same world with old John ."
"There was some that was feared of Pew , and some that was feared of Flint ; but Flint his own self was feared of me ."
"Feared he was , and proud ."
"They was the roughest crew afloat , was Flint 's ; the devil himself would have been feared to go to sea with them ."
"Well now , I tell you , I 'm not a boasting man , and you seen yourself how easy I keep company , but when I was quartermaster , LAMBS was n't the word for Flint 's old buccaneers ."
"Ah , you may be sure of yourself in old John 's ship . ''"
"`` Well , I tell you now , '' replied the lad , `` I did n't half a quarter like the job till I had this talk with you , John ; but there 's my hand on it now . ''"
"`` And a brave lad you were , and smart too , '' answered Silver , shaking hands so heartily that all the barrel shook , `` and a finer figurehead for a gentleman of fortune I never clapped my eyes on . ''"
By this time I had begun to understand the meaning of their terms .
"By a `` gentleman of fortune '' they plainly meant neither more nor less than a common pirate , and the little scene that I had overheard was the last act in the corruption of one of the honest hands -- perhaps of the last one left aboard ."
"But on this point I was soon to be relieved , for Silver giving a little whistle , a third man strolled up and sat down by the party ."
"`` Dick 's square , '' said Silver ."
"`` Oh , I know 'd Dick was square , '' returned the voice of the coxswain , Israel Hands ."
"`` He 's no fool , is Dick . ''"
And he turned his quid and spat .
"`` But look here , '' he went on , `` here 's what I want to know , Barbecue : how long are we a-going to stand off and on like a blessed bumboat ?"
"I 've had a ` most enough o ' Cap'n Smollett ; he 's hazed me long enough , by thunder !"
"I want to go into that cabin , I do ."
"I want their pickles and wines , and that . ''"
"`` Israel , '' said Silver , `` your head ai n't much account , nor ever was ."
"But you 're able to hear , I reckon ; leastways , your ears is big enough ."
"Now , here 's what I say : you 'll berth forward , and you 'll live hard , and you 'll speak soft , and you 'll keep sober till I give the word ; and you may lay to that , my son . ''"
"`` Well , I do n't say no , do I ? ''"
growled the coxswain .
"`` What I say is , when ?"
That 's what I say . ''
`` When !
By the powers ! ''
cried Silver .
"`` Well now , if you want to know , I 'll tell you when ."
"The last moment I can manage , and that 's when ."
"Here 's a first-rate seaman , Cap'n Smollett , sails the blessed ship for us ."
"`` It 's as sweet as yourself , dear child , '' she said tenderly ."
`` And it will be a joy to me all through the lonely winter days .
"You 've found out the best meaning of Christmas giving , have n't you , dear ? ''"
"`` Yes , thanks to you , Aunt Emmy , '' said Clorinda softly ."
"Cyrilla 's Inspiration It was a rainy Saturday afternoon and all the boarders at Mrs. Plunkett 's were feeling dull and stupid , especially the Normal School girls on the third floor , Cyrilla Blair and Carol Hart and Mary Newton , who were known as The Trio , and shared the big front room together ."
"They were sitting in that front room , scowling out at the weather ."
"At least , Carol and Mary were scowling ."
"Cyrilla never scowled ; she was sitting curled up on her bed with her Greek grammar , and she smiled at the rain and her grumbling chums as cheerfully as possible ."
"`` For pity 's sake , Cyrilla , put that grammar away , '' moaned Mary ."
"`` There is something positively uncanny about a girl who can study Greek on Saturday afternoons -- at least , this early in the term . ''"
"`` I 'm not really studying , '' said Cyrilla , tossing the book away ."
`` I 'm only pretending to .
I 'm really just as bored and lonesome as you are .
But what else is there to do ?
We ca n't stir outside the door ; we 've nothing to read ; we ca n't make candy since Mrs. Plunkett has forbidden us to use the oil stove in our room ; we 'll probably quarrel all round if we sit here in idleness ; so I 've been trying to brush up my Greek verbs by way of keeping out of mischief .
Have you any better employment to offer me ? ''
"`` If it were only a mild drizzle we might go around and see the Patterson girls , '' sighed Carol ."
`` But there is no venturing out in such a downpour .
"Cyrilla , you are supposed to be the brainiest one of us ."
"Prove your claim to such pre-eminence by thinking of some brand-new amusement , especially suited to rainy afternoons ."
That will be putting your grey matter to better use than squandering it on Greek verbs out of study limits . ''
"`` If only I 'd got a letter from home today , '' said Mary , who seemed determined to persist in gloom ."
`` I would n't mind the weather .
Letters are such cheery things : -- especially the letters my sister writes .
They 're so full of fun and nice little news .
The reading of one cheers me up for the day .
"Cyrilla Blair , what is the matter ?"
You nearly frightened me to death ! ''
"Cyrilla had bounded from her bed to the centre of the floor , waving her Greek grammar wildly in the air ."
"`` Girls , I have an inspiration ! ''"
she exclaimed .
`` Good !
"`` Ye shall have no hurt , upon the rood !"
Stand !
"Back out , Hugh Ferryman . ''"
Dick cried a taunting answer .
"`` Nay , then , ye shall go afoot , '' returned the man ; and he let drive an arrow ."
"The horse , struck by the shaft , lashed out in agony and terror ; the boat capsized , and the next moment all were struggling in the eddies of the river ."
"When Dick came up , he was within a yard of the bank ; and before his eyes were clear , his hand had closed on something firm and strong that instantly began to drag him forward ."
"It was the riding-rod , that Matcham , crawling forth upon an overhanging willow , had opportunely thrust into his grasp ."
`` By the mass ! ''
"cried Dick , as he was helped ashore , `` that makes a life I owe you ."
I swim like a cannon-ball . ''
And he turned instantly towards the island .
"Midway over , Hugh Ferryman was swimming with his upturned boat , while John-a-Fenne , furious at the ill-fortune of his shot , bawled to him to hurry ."
"`` Come , Jack , '' said Shelton , `` run for it !"
"Ere Hugh can hale his barge across , or the pair of 'em can get it righted , we may be out of cry . ''"
"And adding example to his words , he began to run , dodging among the willows , and in marshy places leaping from tussock to tussock ."
"He had no time to look for his direction ; all he could do was to turn his back upon the river , and put all his heart to running ."
"Presently , however , the ground began to rise , which showed him he was still in the right way , and soon after they came forth upon a slope of solid turf , where elms began to mingle with the willows ."
"But here Matcham , who had been dragging far into the rear , threw himself fairly down ."
"`` Leave me , Dick ! ''"
"he cried , pantingly ; `` I can no more . ''"
"Dick turned , and came back to where his companion lay ."
"`` Nay , Jack , leave thee ! ''"
he cried .
"`` That were a knave 's trick , to be sure , when ye risked a shot and a ducking , ay , and a drowning too , to save my life ."
"Drowning , in sooth ; for why I did not pull you in along with me , the saints alone can tell ! ''"
"`` Nay , '' said Matcham , `` I would ` a ' saved us both , good Dick , for I can swim . ''"
`` Can ye so ? ''
"cried Dick , with open eyes ."
It was the one manly accomplishment of which he was himself incapable .
"In the order of the things that he admired , next to having killed a man in single fight came swimming ."
"`` Well , '' he said , `` here is a lesson to despise no man ."
"He was a tall , broad-shouldered man of forty , and looking no younger , with dark grey eyes and a tanned , clean-cut face , clean-shaven save for a drooping moustache ."
"Jeffrey Miller was considered a handsome man , and Bayside people had periodical fits of wondering why he had never married ."
"They pitied him for the lonely life he must lead alone there at the Valley Farm , with only a deaf old housekeeper as a companion , for it did not occur to the Bayside people in general that a couple of shaggy dogs could be called companions , and they did not know that books make very excellent comrades for people who know how to treat them ."
"One of Jeffrey 's dogs was with him now -- the oldest one , with white breast and paws and a tawny coat ."
"He was so old that he was half-blind and rather deaf , but , with one exception , he was the dearest of living creatures to Jeffrey Miller , for Sara Stuart had given him the sprawly , chubby little pup years ago ."
They came down the hill together .
"A group of men were standing on the bridge in the hollow , discussing Colonel Stuart 's funeral of the day before ."
Jeffrey caught Sara 's name and paused on the outskirts of the group to listen .
"Sometimes he thought that if he were lying dead under six feet of turf and Sara Stuart 's name were pronounced above him , his heart would give a bound of life ."
"`` Yes , the old kunnel 's gone at last , '' Christopher Jackson was saying ."
"`` He took his time dyin ' , that 's sartain ."
"Must be a kind of relief for Sara -- she 's had to wait on him , hand and foot , for years ."
But no doubt she 'll feel pretty lonesome .
Wonder what she 'll do ? ''
`` Is there any particular reason for her to do anything ? ''
asked Alec Churchill .
"`` Well , she 'll have to leave Pinehurst ."
"The estate 's entailed and goes to her cousin , Charles Stuart . ''"
There were exclamations of surprise from the other men on hearing this .
"Jeffrey drew nearer , absently patting his dog 's head ."
He had not known it either .
"`` Oh , yes , '' said Christopher , enjoying all the importance of exclusive information ."
`` I thought everybody knew that .
Pinehurst goes to the oldest male heir .
The old kunnel felt it keen that he had n't a son .
"Of course , there 's plenty of money and Sara 'll get that ."
But I guess she 'll feel pretty bad at leaving her old home .
"Sara ai n't as young as she used to be , neither ."
Let me see -- she must be thirty-eight .
"Well , she 's left pretty lonesome . ''"
"`` Maybe she 'll stay on at Pinehurst , '' said Job Crowe ."
`` It 'd only be right for her cousin to give her a home there . ''
"""Now, I'm coming to gobble you up,"" said the Troll."
"""Oh, no! don't take me, wait a little till the big billy-goat Gruff comes, he's much bigger."""
"""Very well! be off with you,"" said the Troll."
But just then up came the big billy-goat Gruff.
"""TRIP, TRAP! TRIP, TRAP! TRIP, TRAP!"" went the bridge, for the billy-goat was so heavy that the bridge creaked and groaned under him."
"""WHO'S THAT tramping over my bridge?"" roared the Troll."
"""IT'S I! THE BIG BILLY-GOAT GRUFF,"" said the billy-goat, who had an ugly hoarse voice of his own."
"""Now, I'm coming to gobble you up,"" roared the Troll."
"""Well, come along! I've got two spears,             And I'll poke your eyeballs out at your ears;             I've got besides two curling-stones,             And I'll crush you to bits, body and bones."""
"That was what the big billy-goat said; and so he flew at the Troll and poked his eyes out with his horns, and crushed him to bits, body and bones, and tossed him out into the burn, and after that he went up to the hill-side. There the billy-goats got so fat they were scarce able to walk home again; and if the fat hasn't fallen off them, why they're still fat; and so:"
"Snip, snap, snout,                         This tale's told out."
THE THREE PRINCESSES IN THE BLUE MOUNTAIN
"There were once upon a time a King and Queen who had no children, and they took it so much to heart that they hardly ever had a happy moment. One day the King stood in the portico and looked out over the big meadows and all that was his. But he felt he could have no enjoyment out of it all, since he did not know what would become of it after his time. As he stood there pondering, an old beggar woman came up to him and asked him for a trifle in heaven's name. She greeted him and curtsied, and asked what ailed the King, since he looked so sad."
"""You can't do anything to help me, my good woman,"" said the King; ""it's no use telling you."""
"""I am not so sure about that,"" said the beggar woman. ""Very little is wanted when luck is in the way. The King is thinking that he has no heir to his crown and kingdom, but he need not mourn on that account,"""
"she said. ""The Queen shall have three daughters, but great care must be taken that they do not come out under the open heavens before they are all fifteen years old; otherwise a snowdrift will come and carry them away."""
"When the time came the Queen had a beautiful baby girl; the year after she had another, and the third year she also had a girl."
"The King and Queen were glad beyond all measure; but although the King was very happy, he did not forget to set a watch at the Palace door, so that the Princesses should not get out."
"As they grew up they became both fair and beautiful, and all went well with them in every way. Their only sorrow was that they were not allowed to go out and play like other children. For all they begged and prayed their parents, and for all they besought the sentinel, it was of no avail; go out they must not before they were fifteen years old, all of them."
"So one day, not long before the fifteenth birthday of the youngest Princess, the King and the Queen were out driving, and the Princesses were standing at the window and looking out. The sun was shining, and everything looked so green and beautiful that they felt that they must go out, happen what might. So they begged and entreated and urged the sentinel, all three of them, that he should let them down into the garden. ""He could see for himself how warm and pleasant it was; no snowy weather could come on such a day."" Well, he didn't think it looked much like it either, and if they must go they had better go, the soldier said; but it must only be for a minute, and he himself would go with them and look after them."
"When they got down into the garden they ran up and down, and filled their laps with flowers and green leaves, the prettiest they could find. At last they could manage no more, but just as they were going indoors they caught sight of a large rose at the other end of the garden. It was many times prettier than any they had gathered, so they must have that also. But just as they bent down to take the rose a big dense snowdrift came and carried them away."
"There was great mourning over the whole country, and the King made known from all the churches that any one who could save the Princesses should have half the kingdom and his golden crown and whichever princess he liked to choose."
"You can well understand there were plenty who wanted to gain half the kingdom, and a princess into the bargain; so there were people of both high and low degree who set out for all parts of the country. But there was no one who could find the Princesses, or even get any tidings of them."
"When all the grand and rich people in the country had had their turn, a captain and a lieutenant came to the Palace, and wanted to try their luck. The King fitted them out both with silver and gold, and wished them success on their journey."
"Then came a soldier, who lived with his mother in a little cottage some way from the Palace. He had dreamt one night that he also was trying to find the Princesses. When the morning came he still remembered what he had dreamt, and told his mother about it."
"""Some witchery must have got hold of you,"" said the woman, ""but you must dream the same thing three nights running, else there is nothing in it."" And the next two nights the same thing happened; he had the same dream, and he felt he must go. So he washed himself and put on his uniform, and went into the kitchen at the Palace. It was the day after the captain and the lieutenant had set out."
"""You had better go home again,"" said the King, ""the Princesses are beyond your reach, I should say; and besides, I have spent so much money on outfits that I have nothing left to-day. You had better come back another time."""
"""If I go, I must go to-day,"" said the soldier. ""Money I do not want; I only need a drop in my flask and some food in my wallet,"" he said; ""but it must be a good walletful as much meat and bacon as I can carry."""
"Yes, that he might have if that was all he wanted."
"So he set off, and he had not gone many miles before he overtook the captain and the lieutenant."
"""Where are you going?"" asked the captain, when he saw the man in uniform."
"""All one to me,"" said the lad, ""I'd be just as glad to hear he had four heads beside; I'd like to see what kind of fellow he is. As for going, I won't go at all. I've done no harm; but meat you must get me, for I'm almost starved to death."""
"When Halvor had eaten his fill, the Princess told him to try if he could brandish the sword that hung against the wall; no, he couldn't brandish it, he couldn't even lift it up."
"""Oh!"" said the Princess, ""now you must go and take a pull of that flask that hangs by its side; that's what the Troll does every time he goes out to use the sword."""
"So Halvor took a pull, and in the twinkling of an eye he could brandish the sword like nothing; and now he thought it high time the Troll came; and lo! just then up came the Troll puffing and blowing. Halvor jumped behind the door."
"""HUTETU,"" said the Troll, as he put his head in at the door, ""what a smell of Christian man's blood!"""
"""Aye,"" said Halvor, ""you'll soon know that to your cost,"" and with that he hewed off all his heads."
"Now the Princess was so glad that she was free, she both danced and sang, but then all at once she called her sisters to mind, and so she said:"
"""Would my sisters were free too!"""
"""Where are they?"" asked Halvor."
"Well, she told him all about it; one was taken away by a Troll to his Castle which lay fifty miles off, and the other by another Troll to his Castle which was fifty miles further still."
"""But now,"" she said, ""you must first help me to get this ugly carcass out of the house."""
"Yes, Halvor was so strong he swept everything away, and made it all clean and tidy in no time. So they had a good and happy time of it, and next morning he set off at peep of grey dawn; he could take no rest by the way, but ran and walked the whole day. When he first saw the Castle he got a little afraid; it was far grander than the first, but here too there wasn't a living soul to be seen. So Halvor went into the kitchen, and didn't stop there either, but went straight further on into the house."
"""Nay, nay,"" called out the Princess, ""dare Christian folk come hither? I don't know I'm sure how long it is since I came here, but in all that time I haven't seen a Christian man. 'Twere best you saw how to get away as fast as you came; for here lives a Troll who has six heads."""
"""I shan't go,"" said Halvor, ""if he has six heads besides."""
"""He'll take you up and swallow you down alive,"" said the Princess."
"But it was no good, Halvor wouldn't go; he wasn't at all afraid of the Troll, but meat and drink he must have, for he was half starved after his long journey. Well, he got as much of that as he wished, but then the Princess wanted him to be off again."
"""No,"" said Halvor, ""I won't go, I've done no harm, and I've nothing to be afraid about."""
"""He won't stay to ask that,"" said the Princess, ""for he'll take you without law or leave; but as you won't go, just try if you can brandish that sword yonder, which the Troll wields in war."""
"He couldn't brandish it, and then the Princess said he must take a pull at the flask which hung by its side, and when he had done that he could brandish it."
"Just then back came the Troll, and he was both stout and big, so that he had to go sideways to get through the door. When the Troll got his first head in he called out:"
"""HUTETU, what a smell of Christian man's blood!"""
"But that very moment Halvor hewed off his first head, and so on all the rest as they popped in. The Princess was overjoyed, but just then she came to think of her sisters, and wished out loud they were free. Halvor thought that might easily be done, and wanted to be off at once; but first he had to help the Princess to get the Troll's carcass out of the way, and so he could only set out next morning."
"It was a long way to the Castle, and he had to walk fast and run hard to reach it in time; but about nightfall he saw the Castle, which was far finer and grander than either of the others. This time he wasn't the least afraid, but walked straight through the kitchen, and into the Castle. There sat a Princess who was so pretty, there was no end to her loveliness. She too like the others told him there hadn't been Christian folk there ever since she came thither, and bade him go away again, else the Troll would swallow him alive, and do you know, she said, he has nine heads."
"""Aye, aye,"" said Halvor, ""if he had nine other heads, and nine other heads still, I won't go away,"" and so he stood fast before the stove."
"The Princess kept on begging him so prettily to go away, lest the Troll should gobble him up, but Halvor said:"
"""Let him come as soon as he likes."""
"So she gave him the Troll's sword, and bade him take a pull at the flask, that he might be able to brandish and wield it."
Just then back came the Troll puffing and blowing and tearing along.
"He was far bigger and stouter than the other two, and he too had to go on one side to get through the door. So when he got his first head in, he said as the others had said:"
"""HUTETU, what a smell of Christian man's blood!"""
"That very moment Halvor hewed off the first head and then all the rest; but the last was the toughest of them all, and it was the hardest bit of work Halvor had to do, to get it hewn off, although he knew very well he had strength enough to do it."
"So all the Princesses came together to that Castle, which was called Soria Moria Castle, and they were glad and happy as they had never been in all their lives before, and they all were fond of Halvor and Halvor of them, and he might choose the one he liked best for his bride; but the youngest was fondest of him of all the three."
"What tangles they did get into! Each little Rabbit had four legs, two short ones in front, and two long ones behind to help him take long jumps from one place to another. So, you see, there were twenty-eight legs there, pushing, catching in the hay, kicking, and sometimes just waving in the air when their tiny owners chanced to roll over on their backs and couldn't get right side up again. Then Mamma Rabbit would come and poke them this way and that, never hurting any of them, but getting the nest in order."
"""It is a great deal of work to pick up after children,"" she would say with a tired little sigh, ""but it will not be long before they have homes of their own and are doing the same thing."""
"Mamma Rabbit was quite right when she said that, for all of their people set up housekeeping when very young, and then the cares of life begin."
"One fine morning when the children were alone in their burrow, the biggest little Rabbit had a queer feeling in his face, below and in front of his long ears, and above his eager little nose. It almost scared him at first, for he had never before felt anything at all like it. Then he guessed what it meant. There were two bunchy places on his face, that Mamma Rabbit had told him were eyes. ""When you are older,"""
"she had said to him, ""these eyes will open, and then you will see."" For the Rabbit children are always blind when they are babies."
"When his mother told him that, the biggest little Rabbit had said, ""What do you mean when you say I shall 'see'? Is it anything like eating?"""
"And Mamma Rabbit said, ""No, you cannot taste things until you touch them, but you can see them when they are far away."""
"""Then it is like smelling,"" said the biggest little Rabbit."
"""No, it is not like smelling, either, for there are many things, like stones, which one cannot smell and yet can see."""
"""Then it surely is like hearing,"" said the biggest little Rabbit."
"""Oh dear!"" exclaimed his mother, who was tired of having questions asked which could not be answered. ""It is not a bit like hearing. You could never hear a black cloud coming across the sky, but you could see it if you were outside your burrow. Nobody can make you understand what seeing is until your eyes are open, and then you will find out for yourself without asking."""
"This made the biggest little Rabbit lie still for a while, and then he said: ""What is a black cloud, and why does it come across the sky? And what is the sky, and why does it let the cloud come? And what is "" But he did not get any answer, for his mother ran out of the burrow as fast as she could."
"And now his eyes were surely opening and he should see! His tiny heart thumped hard with excitement, and he rubbed his face with his forepaws to make his eyes open faster. Ah! There it was; something round and bright at the other end of the burrow, and some queer, slender things were waving across it. He wondered if it were good to eat, but he dared not crawl toward it to see. He did not know that the round, bright thing was just a bit of sky which he saw through the end of the burrow, and that the slender, waving ones were the branches of a dead tree tossing in the wind. Then he looked at his brothers and sisters as they lay beside him. He would not have known what they were if he had not felt of them at the same time."
"""I can see!"" he cried. ""I can see everything that there is to see! I'm ahead of you! Don't you wish that you could see, too?"""
"That was not a very kind thing to say, but in a minute more his brothers and sisters had reason to be glad that they couldn't see. Even while he was speaking and looking toward the light, he saw a brown head with two round eyes look in at him, and then a great creature that he thought must surely be a dog ran in toward him. How frightened he was then! He pushed his nose in among his blind brothers and sisters and tried to hide himself among them. He thought something dreadful was about to happen."
"""I wish Mamma Rabbit would come,"" he squeaked, shutting his eyes as closely as he could. ""I wish Mamma Rabbit would come."""
"""Why, here I am,"" she answered. ""What are you afraid of?"""
"The biggest little Rabbit opened his eyes, and there was the creature who had frightened him so, and it was his own mother! You can imagine how glad she was to see that one of her children had his eyes open."
"""I will call in some of my Rabbit friends,"" she said, ""and let you see them, if you will promise not to be afraid."""
"The next day four of the other little Rabbits had their eyes open, and the day after that they all could see each other and the shining piece of sky at the end of the burrow. It was not so very long afterward that the Rabbit family went out to dine in the forest, and this was the first time that the children had seen their father. Often when their mother left them alone in the burrow she had pulled grass and leaves over the opening to hide it from him, for Rabbit fathers do not love their children until they are old enough to go out into the great world, and it would never do for them to know where their babies are kept. Then their father taught them how to gnaw tough bark to wear their teeth down, for Rabbits' teeth grow all the time, and if they were to eat only soft food, their teeth would get too long. He taught them, too, how to move their ears in the right way for keen hearing, and told them that when chased they must run for the burrow or the nearest thicket. ""Then crouch down on some leaves that are the color of your fur,"" he said, ""and you may not be seen at all."""
"""Why should we run?"" said the biggest little Rabbit."
"""Because you might be caught if you didn't."""
"""What might catch us?"" asked the biggest little Rabbit."
"""Oh, a Hawk, perhaps, or a Weasel."""
"""What does a Hawk look like?"""
"""Like a great bird floating in the sky,"" said Papa Rabbit. ""Now, don't ask me a single question more."""
"""Does a Hawk look like that bird above us?"" asked the biggest little Rabbit."
"His father gave one look upward. ""Yes!"" he said. ""Run!"""
"And just as the Hawk swooped down toward the ground, he saw nine white-tipped tails disappear into a burrow near by."
THE LITTLE BAT WHO WOULDN'T GO TO BED
"""Come,"" said Mamma Bat, flying toward her home in the cave, ""it is time that you children went to bed. The eastern sky is growing bright, and I can see the fleecy clouds blush rosy red as the sun looks at them."""
Cromwell and his Ironsides
"When Charles I came to the throne of England, it was soon seen that he was as bad a king as his father James I had been."
"He did not care at all for the good of his country and his people, but thought only of his own pleasure. He took away men's money and lands, and if they offended him he took their lives too."
"Englishmen would not bear this unjust treatment for long, and soon a war began between the king and the people, who were determined to be free."
"At first the king and his men were victorious everywhere, for they were all used to horses and arms, and fought so well and so bravely that the people could not stand against them. But at last a great leader arose among the people. This leader, who was called Oliver Cromwell, was a rough man, but he was just, good, and honest."
"He saw at once that the people would never gain the victory over the brave gentlemen-soldiers of King Charles, unless they had obedient and well-trained men to fight for them. So he chose a band of plain, hard-working men who feared God, and loved duty and right, and he spent all his money in fitting them with arms and horses, and in training them sternly, until they became the finest soldiers the world has ever known."
"Cromwell called his men his ""lovely company"", and others called them ""Ironsides"", for they were strong and firm as iron, and were never beaten. It was these brave, sober, obedient soldiers who at last defeated the king's army, and won freedom for the people of England."
The Spanish Armada
"The Armada was a great fleet which the King of Spain sent to attack England, in the days of Queen Elizabeth. There were more than a hundred ships, so large and high that they looked like towers on the sea; and they came sailing along arranged in the shape of a big half-moon."
"The great English admiral, Sir Francis Drake, was playing at bowls when messengers came hurrying to tell him that the Armada was approaching. He quietly finished his game, and then set sail to fight the Spaniards. His fleet was not so large as the Armada, and the ships were small, but they were light and fast. They met the Armada in the English Channel, and sailed round it, attacking any ship that dropped out of line, and speeding away before the clumsy Spanish vessels could seize them. In this way they did much harm to the enemy. Then, one night, when it was dark, and the Spanish vessels were lying quietly at anchor, Admiral Drake sent eight blazing fire-ships into their midst. In great fear, the Spaniards cut their anchor-ropes, and sailed out to the open sea, and the English ships followed, firing upon them as they fled. For two days the English chased the flying Spaniards. Then their powder and shot failed, and a storm arose; so they had to go back. The Armada sailed on, hoping to escape, but the wild tempest tossed many of the great vessels on the rocks and cliffs of the coast, and dashed them to pieces. Only a few, broken and battered, with starving and weary men on board, ever reached Spain again. And so England was saved."
The Defence of Lathom House
"Lathom House is an old English castle. When the war broke out between King Charles I and his people, the Earl of Derby, who was the master of this castle, went away to fight for the king. He left the Countess at home with her children, with a small band of armed men to guard her and the castle. One day an army of the people's soldiers came to the castle, and the leader of the army sent word to the Countess that she must give up the castle at once."
"Well, in she came."
"""Can you wash this shirt clean, lassie you?"" said he."
"""I don't know,"" she said, ""but I think I can."""
"And almost before she had taken it and dipped it in the water, it was as white as driven snow, and whiter still."
"""Yes; you are the lassie for me,"" said the Prince."
"At that the old hag flew into such a rage, she burst on the spot, and the Princess with the long nose after her, and the whole pack of Trolls after her at least I've never heard a word about them since."
"As for the Prince and Princess, they set free all the poor Christian folk who had been carried off and shut up there; and they took with them all the silver and gold, and flitted away as far as they could from the Castle that lay East of the Sun and West of the Moon."
THE BLUE BELT
"Once on a time there was an old beggar-woman, who had gone out to beg."
"She had a little lad with her, and when she had got her bag full she struck across the hills towards her own home. So when they had gone a bit up the hill-side, they came upon a little Blue Belt which lay where two paths met, and the lad asked his mother's leave to pick it up."
"""No,"" said she, ""maybe there's witchcraft in it;"" and so with threats she forced him to follow her. But when they had gone a bit further, the lad said he must turn aside a moment out of the road; and meanwhile his mother sat down on a tree-stump. But the lad was a long time gone, for as soon as he got so far into the wood that the old dame could not see him, he ran off to where the Belt lay, took it up, tied it round his waist, and lo! he felt as strong as if he could lift the whole hill. When he got back, the old dame was in a great rage, and wanted to know what he had been doing all that while. ""You don't care how much time you waste, and yet you know the night is drawing on, and we must cross the hill before it is dark!"" So on they tramped; but when they had got about half-way, the old dame grew weary, and said she must rest under a bush."
"""Dear mother,"" said the lad, ""mayn't I just go up to the top of this high crag while you rest, and try if I can't see some sign of folk hereabouts?"""
Yes! he might do that; so when he had got to the top he saw a light shining from the north. So he ran down and told his mother.
"""We must get on, mother; we are near a house, for I see a bright light shining quite close to us in the north."" Then she rose and shouldered her bag, and set off to see; but they hadn't gone far, before there stood a steep spur of the hill, right across their path."
"""Just as I thought!"" said the old dame, ""now we can't go a step farther; a pretty bed we shall have here!"""
"But the lad took the bag under one arm, and his mother under the other, and ran straight up the steep crag with them."
"""Now, don't you see? Don't you see that we are close to a house? Don't you see that bright light?"""
"But the old dame said those were no Christian folk, but Trolls, for she was at home in all that forest far and near, and knew there was not a living soul in it, until you were well over the ridge and had come down on the other side. But they went on, and in a little while they came to a great house which was all painted red."
"""What's the good?"" said the old dame. ""We daren't go in, for here the Trolls live."""
"""Don't say so; we must go in. There must be men where the lights shine so,"" said the lad. So in he went, and his mother after him, but he had scarce opened the door before she swooned away, for there she saw a great stout man, at least twenty feet high, sitting on the bench."
"""Good evening, grandfather!"" said the lad."
"""Well, here I've sat three hundred years,"" said the man who sat on the bench, ""and no one has ever come and called me grandfather before."""
"Then the lad sat down by the man's side, and began to talk to him as if they had been old friends."
"""But what's come over your mother?"" said the man, after they had chatted a while. ""I think she swooned away; you had better look after her."""
"So the lad went and took hold of the old dame, and dragged her up the hall along the floor. That brought her to herself, and she kicked and scratched, and flung herself about, and at last sat down upon a heap of firewood in the corner; but she was so frightened that she scarce dared to look one in the face."
"After a while, the lad asked if they could spend the night there."
"""Yes, to be sure,"" said the man."
"So they went on talking again, but the lad soon got hungry, and wanted to know if they could get food as well as lodging."
"""Of course,"" said the man, ""that might be got too."" And after he had sat a while longer, he rose up and threw six loads of dry pitch-pine on the fire. This made the old hag still more afraid."
"""Oh! now he's going to roast us alive,"" she said, in the corner where she sat."
"And when the wood had burned down to glowing embers, up got the man and strode out of his house."
"When Mr. Red Squirrel first came to the forest, he knew nothing of the way in which they do, and he afterward said that learning forest manners was even harder than running away from his old home. You see, Mr. Red Squirrel was born in the forest, but was carried away from there when he was only a baby. From that time until he was grown, he had never set claw upon a tree, and all he could see of the world he had seen by peeping through the bars of a cage. His cousins in the forest learned to frisk along the fence-tops and to jump from one swaying branch to another, but when this poor little fellow longed for a scamper he could only run around and around in a wire wheel that hummed as it turned, and this made him very dizzy."
"He used to wonder if there were nothing better in life, for he had been taken from his woodland home when he was too young to remember about it."
"One day he saw another Squirrel outside, a dainty little one who looked as though she had never a sad thought. That made him care more than ever to be free, and when he curled down in his cotton nest that night he dreamed about her, and that they were eating acorns together in a tall oak tree."
"The next day Mr. Red Squirrel pretended to be sick. He would not run in the wheel or taste the food in his cage. When his master came to look at him, he moaned pitifully and would not move one leg. His master thought that the leg was broken, and took limp little Mr. Red Squirrel in his hand to the window to see what was the matter. The window was up, and when he saw his chance, Mr. Red Squirrel leaped into the open air and was away to the forest. His poor legs were weak from living in such a small cage, but how he ran! His heart thumped wildly under the soft fur of his chest, and his breath came in quick gasps, and still he ran, leaping, scrambling, and sometimes falling, but always nearer the great green trees of his birthplace."
"At last he was safe and sat trembling on the lowest branch of a beech-tree. The forest was a new world to him and he asked many questions of a fat, old Gray Squirrel. The Gray Squirrel was one of those people who know a great deal and think that they know a great, great deal, and want others to think so too. He was so very knowing and important that, although he answered all of Mr. Red Squirrel's questions, he really did not tell him any of the things which he most wanted to know, and this is the way in which they talked:"
"""What is the name of this place?"" asked Mr. Red Squirrel."
"""This? Why this is the forest, of course,"" answered the Gray Squirrel."
"""We have no other name for it. It is possible that there are other forests in the world, but they cannot be so fine as this, so we call ours 'the forest.'"""
"""Are there pleasant neighbors here?"" asked Mr. Red Squirrel."
"""Very good, very good. My wife and I do not call on many of them, but still they are good enough people, I think."""
"""Then why don't you call?"""
"""Why? Why? Because they are not in our set. It would never do."" And the Gray Squirrel sat up very straight indeed."
"""Who is that gliding fellow on the ground below?"" asked the newcomer."
"""Is he one of your friends?"""
"""That? That is the Rattlesnake. We never speak to each other. There has always been trouble between our families."""
"""Who lives in that hollow tree yonder?"""
"""Sh, sh! That is where the Great Horned Owl has his home. He is asleep now and must not be awakened, for Squirrels and Owls cannot be friendly."""
"""Why not?"""
"""Because. It has always been so."""
"""And who is that bird just laying an egg in her nest above us?"""
"""Speak softly, please. That is the Cowbird, and it is not her nest. You will get into trouble if you talk such things aloud. She can't help it."
"She has to lay her eggs in other birds' nests, but they don't like it."""
"Mr. Red Squirrel tried very hard to find out the reason for this, but there are always some things for which no reason can be given; and there are many questions which can never be answered, even if one were to ask, ""Why? why? why?"" all day long. So Mr. Red Squirrel, being a wise little fellow, stopped asking, and thought by using his eyes and ears he would in time learn all that he needed to know. He had good eyes and keen ears, and he learned very fast without making many mistakes. He had a very happy life among the forest people, and perhaps that was one reason. He learned not to say things which made his friends feel badly, and he did not ask needless questions. And after all, you know, it would have been very foolish to ask questions which nobody could answer, and worse than foolish to ask about matters which he could find out for himself."
"It is in the forest as in the world outside. We can know that many things are, but we never know why they are."
WHY MR GREAT HORNED OWL HATCHED THE EGGS
"If the Rattlesnake is the king of the forest in the daytime, the Great Horned Owl is the king at night. Indeed, he is much the more powerful of the two, for he is king of air and earth alike and can go wherever he wishes, while the snake can only rule over those who live near the ground or who are so careless as to come to him there."
"There was but one pair of Great Horned Owls in the forest, and they lived in the deepest shade, having their great clumsy nest in the hollow of a tall tree. You might have walked past it a hundred times and never have guessed that any Owls lived there, if you did not notice the round pellets of bone and hair on the grass. They are such hungry fellows that they swallow their food with the bones in it. Then their tough little stomachs go to work, rolling all the pieces of bone and hair into balls and sending them back to be cast out of the Owls' mouths to the ground."
"The Great Horned Owl was a very large bird. His whole body was covered with brown, dull yellow, and white feathers. Even his feet and legs were covered, and all that you could see besides were his black claws and his black hooked bill. Yes, at night you could see his eyes, too, and they were wonderful great eyes that could see in the dark, but they were shut in the daytime when he was resting. His wife, who was the queen of the forest at night, looked exactly like him, only she was larger than he. And that is the way among Owls, the wife is always larger than her husband."
"Every night when the sun had gone down, the Great Horned Owl and his wife would come out of their hollow tree and sit blinking on a branch near by, waiting until it got dark enough for them to see quite plainly."
"As the light faded, the little black spots in their eyes would grow bigger and bigger, and then off they would go on their great soft, noiseless wings, hunting in the grass and among the branches for the supper which they called breakfast."
"Mrs. Owl could not be gone very long at a time, for there were two large round white eggs in the nest which must not get cold. Her husband was on the wing most of the night, and he often flew home with some tender morsel for her. He was really a kind-hearted fellow, although you could never have made the small birds think so. Sometimes his wife would sigh and tell how tired she was of sitting still, and how glad she would be when the eggs were hatched and she could go more with him. When she began to speak of that, the Great Horned Owl would get ready for another flight and go off saying: ""It is too bad. I am so sorry for you. But then, one would never have young Owlets if one didn't stick to the nest."" He was always proud of his children, and he thought himself a very good husband. Perhaps he was; still he had never taken his place on the nest while his wife went hunting."
"He had a good mind to try it. There was nobody to watch him, and he crept up the trunk of a fallen tree which leaned over against its neighbors. It was a foolish thing to do, and he knew it, but young Rabbits are too full of mischief to always be wise."
"""I will hold my hind legs very still,"" he thought, ""and flap my forelegs for wings."" With that he jumped off and came crashing down upon the dry leaves. He felt weak and dizzy, and as he picked himself up and looked around he hoped that nobody had seen him. ""It may be a great deal of fun to fly,"" he said, ""but it is no fun alighting from your flight unless you have real feather wings. It is too bumpy when you fly with your legs."""
"At this minute he heard an old Gobbler call out, and saw the flock of Turkeys coming toward him. ""Wake up! Wake up!"" he cried to the Ground Hog. But the Ground Hog never moved."
"Still the Turkeys came nearer. The Rabbit could see that the fat old ones were getting ahead of the others, and that here and there a young or weak Turkey had to drop into the river and swim, because his wings were tired. They got so near that he could see the queer little tufts of wiry feathers which the Gobblers wear hanging from their breast, and could see the swaying scarlet wattles under their beaks. He called again to the Ground Hog, and getting no answer, poked him three times with his head."
"The Ground Hog turned over, stretched, yawned, moved his jaws a few times as though he dreamed of eating fresh spring grass, and then fell asleep once more. After that the Rabbit left him alone."
"The first to alight were the Gobblers, and they began at once to strut and chatter. Next came the mother Turkeys and their young, and last of all came the weak ones who swam across. It was a fine sight to see them come in. The swimmers spread their tails, folded their wings tightly, stretched their necks, and struck out swiftly and strongly with their feet."
"The young Rabbit could hear a group of mothers talking together. ""The Gobblers are growing quite fond of the children,"" said one."
"""Yes,"" said another; ""my husband told me yesterday that he was very proud of our little ones."""
"""Well, it is the season for them to begin to walk together,"" said the first speaker; ""but I never in my life had such a time as I had this spring. I thought my husband would break every egg I laid."""
"""I had a hard time too,"" said the other. ""None of my eggs were broken, but after my chicks were hatched I had to hurry them out of their father's sight a dozen times a day."""
"""It is very trying,"" said a third mother Turkey with a sigh; ""but that is always the way with the Gobblers. I suppose the dear fellows can't help it;"" and she looked lovingly over at her husband as he strutted around with his friends. You would not have believed if you had seen her fond looks, and heard her husband's tender ""Gobble,"" that they had hardly spoken to each other all summer. To be sure, it was not now as it had been in the springtime. Then he would have beaten any other Gobbler who came near her, he loved her so; still, the Rabbit could see as he watched them that when he found some very large and fine acorns, this Gobbler would not eat them all, but called his wife to come and share with him; and he knew that they were happy together in their own Turkey way of being happy."
At this minute the Ground Hog opened his eyes and staggered to his feet.
"The loud talking had awakened him. He did not look very dignified just now. His fur was rumpled, and he blinked often from sleepiness. There was a dry leaf caught on one of his ears, too, that made him look very odd. The Rabbit wanted to laugh, but he did not dare to do so. The Ground Hog walked toward the Gobblers, and raised himself on his haunches."
"""Good-evening, good-evening,"" said he (it was really morning, you know). ""We are very glad to welcome you to the forest. Make yourselves perfectly at home. The grass is not so tender as it was a while ago, yet I think that you will find good feeding,"" and he waved his paws politely."
"""Thank-you, thank-you!"" answered the Gobblers, while the mothers and young Turkeys came crowding up to look at the Ground Hog. ""We came for the acorns and nuts. We shall certainly enjoy ourselves."""
"""That is right,"" said the Ground Hog heartily. ""We have a very fine forest here. You will pardon me for remarking it. The Pond People have a saying that is very true: 'It's a mighty poor Frog that won't croak for his own puddle.' And my grandfather used to say that if a Ground Hog didn't love his own home he was a very poor Hog indeed. Good-night, my friends, good-night."" And he trotted happily away, followed by the Rabbit."
"When he was gone, the Turkeys said: ""How very kind of him!"" and ""What fine manners!"" And the young Rabbit thought to himself: ""It is queer. He was sleepy and his fur was rumpled, and that leaf bobbed around his ear when he talked. He said 'evening' instead of 'morning,' and spoke as though Turkeys came here to eat grass. And yet they all liked him, and were pleased by what he said."""
You see the young Rabbit had not yet learned that the power of fine manners is more than that of looks; and that people could not think of the Ground Hog's mistakes in speaking because they knew his kindness of heart.
THE TRAVELLERS GO SOUTH
"One night a maple tree, the very one under which Mr. Red Squirrel sat when he first came to the forest, dreamed of her winter resting-time, and when she awakened early in the morning she found that her leaves were turning yellow. They were not all brightly colored, but on each was an edging, or a tip, or a splash of gold. You may be sure that the Forest People noticed it at once."
"""I told you so,"" chirruped a Robin to her mate. ""The Orioles went long ago, and the Bobolinks start to-day. We must think about our trip to the South."" When she said this, she hopped restlessly from twig to twig with an air of being exceedingly busy."
"Her husband did not answer, but began to arrange his new coat of feathers. Perhaps he was used to her fussy ways and thought it just as well to keep still. He knew that none of the Robins would start South until the weather became much colder, and he did not think it necessary to talk about it yet. Perhaps, too, Mr. Robin was a trifle contrary and was all the more slow and quiet because his wife was uneasy. In that case one could hardly blame her for talking over the family plans with the neighbors."
"Later in the day, a Bobolink came up from the marsh to say good-by. He had on his travelling suit of striped brown, and you would never have known him for the same gay fellow who during the spring and early summer wore black and buff and sang so heartily and sweetly. Now he did not sing at all, and slipped silently from bush to bush, only speaking when he had to. He was a good fellow and everyone disliked to have him go."
"Mrs. Cowbird came up while they were talking. Now that she did not care to lay any more eggs, the other birds were quite friendly with her. They began to talk over the summer that was past, and said how finely the young birds were coming on. ""By the way,"" said she, in the most careless manner possible, ""I ought to have a few children round here somewhere."
"Can anybody tell me where they are?"""
"Mrs. Goldfinch looked at her husband and he looked at the sky. The Warblers and the Vireos, who had known about the strange egg in the Goldfinches' nest, had already left for the winter, and there seemed to be no use in telling their secret now or quarrelling over what was past."
"Some of the other birds might have told Mrs. Cowbird a few things, but they also kept still."
"""It is a shame,"" she said. ""I never laid a finer lot of eggs in my life, and I was very careful where I put them. I wish I knew how many there were, but I forgot to count. I have been watching and watching for my little birds to join our flock; I was sure I should know them if I saw them. Mothers have such fine feelings, you know, in regard to their children."" (As though she had any right to say that!)"
"The Mourning Doves were there with their young son and daughter, and you could see by looking at them that they were an affectionate family. ""We shall be the last to go South,"" they cooed. ""We always mean to come North in the very early spring and stay as late as possible. This year we came much later than usual, but it could not be helped."" They had spoken so before, and rather sadly. It was said that they could tell a sorrowful story if they would; but they did not wish to sadden others by it, and bore their troubles together bravely and lovingly."
"""How do the new feathers work?"" asked a Crow, flying up at this minute and looking blacker than ever in his fall coat. Then all the birds began to talk about dress. As soon as their broods were raised, you know, their feathers had begun to drop out, and they had kept on moulting until all of the old ones were gone and the new ones on. When birds are moulting they never feel well, and when it is over they are both happy and proud."
"""I changed later than usual this year,"" said the Crow, ""and I feel that I have the very latest fashions."" This was a joke which he must have picked up among the Barnyard People, and nobody knows where they got it. Fashions never change in the Forest."
"In the white lily bloom, Brave boy, is thy tomb.”"
"When the two heard that, they were frightened to death, and ran away in great haste. When the King came home they told him that the Queen had been delivered of a dog. Then the King said, “What God does, is well done!” But a fisherman who dwelt near the water fished the little boy out again while he was still alive, and as his wife had no children, they reared him. When a year had gone by, the King again went away, and the Queen had another little boy, whom the false sisters likewise took and threw into the water. Then up flew a little bird again and sang,"
"“To thy death art thou sped, Until God’s word be said."
"In the white lily bloom, Brave boy, is thy tomb.”"
"And when the King came back, they told him that the Queen had once more given birth to a dog, and he again said, “What God does, is well done.”"
"The fisherman, however, fished this one also out of the water, and reared him."
"Then the King again journeyed forth, and the Queen had a little girl, whom also the false sisters threw into the water. Then again a little bird flew up on high and sang,"
“To thy death art thou sped Until God’s word be said.
"In the white lily bloom, Bonny girl, is thy tomb.”"
"And when the King came home they told him that the Queen had been delivered of a cat. Then the King grew angry, and ordered his wife to be cast into prison, and therein was she shut up for many long years."
"In the meantime the children had grown up. Then eldest once went out with some other boys to fish, but the other boys would not have him with them, and said, “Go thy way, foundling.”"
"Hereupon he was much troubled, and asked the old fisherman if that was true? The fisherman told him that once when he was fishing he had drawn him out of the water. So the boy said he would go forth and seek his father. The fisherman, however, entreated him to stay, but he would not let himself be hindered, and at last the fisherman consented. Then the boy went on his way and walked for many days, and at last he came to a great piece of water by the side of which stood an old woman fishing."
"“Good day, mother,” said the boy."
"“Many thanks,” said she."
“Thou wilt fish long enough before thou catchest anything.”
“And thou wilt seek long enough before thou findest thy father. How wilt thou get over the water?” said the woman.
“God knows.”
"Then the old woman took him up on her back and carried him through it, and he sought for a long time, but could not find his father."
"When a year had gone by, the second boy set out to seek his brother. He came to the water, and all fared with him just as with his brother. And now there was no one at home but the daughter, and she mourned for her brothers so much that at last she also begged the fisherman to let her set forth, for she wished to go in search of her brothers. Then she likewise came to the great piece of water, and she said to the old woman, “Good day, mother.”"
"“Many thanks,” replied the old woman."
"“May God help you with your fishing,” said the maiden. When the old woman heard that, she became quite friendly, and carried her over the water, gave her a wand, and said to her, “Go, my daughter, ever onwards by this road, and when you come to a great black dog, you must pass it silently and boldly, without either laughing or looking at it. Then you will come to a great high castle, on the threshold of which you must let the wand fall, and go straight through the castle, and out again on the other side. There you will see an old fountain out of which a large tree has grown, whereon hangs a bird in a cage which you must take down. Take likewise a glass of water out of the fountain, and with these two things go back by the same way. Pick up the wand again from the threshold and take it with you, and when you again pass by the dog, strike him in the face with it, but be sure that you hit him, and then just come back here to me.” The maiden found everything exactly as the old woman had said, and on her way back she found her two brothers who had sought each other over half the world. They went together to the place where the black dog was lying on the road; she struck it in the face, and it turned into a handsome prince who went with them to the river. There the old woman was still standing. She rejoiced much to see them again, and carried them all over the water, and then she too went away, for now she was freed. The others, however, went to the old fisherman, and all were glad that they had found each other again, but they hung the bird on the wall."
"But the second son could not settle at home, and took his cross-bow and went a-hunting. When he was tired he took his flute, and made music."
"The King was hunting too, and heard that and went thither, and when he met the youth, he said, “Who has given thee leave to hunt here?”"
"“Oh, no one.”"
"“To whom dost thou belong, then?”"
“I am the fisherman’s son.”
“But he has no children.”
"“If thou wilt not believe, come with me.”"
"That the King did, and questioned the fisherman, who told everything to him, and the little bird on the wall began to sing,"
"“The mother sits alone There in the prison small, O King of royal blood, These are thy children all."
"The sisters twain so false, They wrought the children woe, There in the waters deep Where the fishermen come and go.”"
"Then they were all terrified, and the King took the bird, the fisherman and the three children back with him to the castle, and ordered the prison to be opened and brought his wife out again. She had, however, grown quite ill and weak. Then the daughter gave her some of the water of the fountain to drink, and she became strong and healthy. But the two false sisters were burnt, and the daughter married the prince."
The Fairy Flower
And she held the little Rabbit close in her arms and flew with him into the wood.
"It was light now, for the moon had risen. All the forest was beautiful, and the fronds of the bracken shone like frosted silver. In the open glade between the tree-trunks the wild rabbits danced with their shadows on the velvet grass, but when they saw the Fairy they all stopped dancing and stood round in a ring to stare at her."
"""I've brought you a new playfellow,"" the Fairy said. ""You must be very kind to him and teach him all he needs to know in Rabbit-land, for he is going to live with you for ever and ever!"""
And she kissed the little Rabbit again and put him down on the grass.
"""Run and play, little Rabbit!"" she said."
But the little Rabbit sat quite still for a moment and never moved.
"For when he saw all the wild rabbits dancing around him he suddenly remembered about his hind legs, and he didn't want them to see that he was made all in one piece. He did not know that when the Fairy kissed him that last time she had changed him altogether. And he might have sat there a long time, too shy to move, if just then something hadn't tickled his nose, and before he thought what he was doing he lifted his hind toe to scratch it."
"And he found that he actually had hind legs! Instead of dingy velveteen he had brown fur, soft and shiny, his ears twitched by themselves, and his whiskers were so long that they brushed the grass."
"He gave one leap and the joy of using those hind legs was so great that he went springing about the turf on them, jumping sideways and whirling round as the others did, and he grew so excited that when at last he did stop to look for the Fairy she had gone."
"He was a Real Rabbit at last, at home with the other rabbits."
At Last! At Last!
"Autumn passed and Winter, and in the Spring, when the days grew warm and sunny, the Boy went out to play in the wood behind the house. And while he was playing, two rabbits crept out from the bracken and peeped at him. One of them was brown all over, but the other had strange markings under his fur, as though long ago he had been spotted, and the spots still showed through. And about his little soft nose and his round black eyes there was something familiar, so that the Boy thought to himself:"
"""Why, he looks just like my old Bunny that was lost when I had scarlet fever!"""
"But he never knew that it really was his own Bunny, come back to look at the child who had first helped him to be Real."
The Book of DRAGONS
I. The Book of Beasts
"He happened to be building a Palace when the news came, and he left all the bricks kicking about the floor for Nurse to clear up but then the news was rather remarkable news. You see, there was a knock at the front door and voices talking downstairs, and Lionel thought it was the man come to see about the gas, which had not been allowed to be lighted since the day when Lionel made a swing by tying his skipping rope to the gas bracket."
"And then, quite suddenly, Nurse came in and said, ""Master Lionel, dear, they've come to fetch you to go and be King."""
"Then she made haste to change his smock and to wash his face and hands and brush his hair, and all the time she was doing it Lionel kept wriggling and fidgeting and saying, ""Oh, don't, Nurse,"" and, ""I'm sure my ears are quite clean,"" or, ""Never mind my hair, it's all right,"" and, ""That'll do."""
"""You're going on as if you was going to be an eel instead of a King,"""
said Nurse.
"The minute Nurse let go for a moment Lionel bolted off without waiting for his clean handkerchief, and in the drawing room there were two very grave-looking gentlemen in red robes with fur, and gold coronets with velvet sticking up out of the middle like the cream in the very expensive jam tarts."
"They bowed low to Lionel, and the gravest one said: ""Sire, your great-great-great-great-great-grandfather, the King of this country, is dead, and now you have got to come and be King."""
"""Yes, please, sir,"" said Lionel, ""when does it begin?"""
"""You will be crowned this afternoon,"" said the grave gentleman who was not quite so grave-looking as the other."
"""Would you like me to bring Nurse, or what time would you like me to be fetched, and hadn't I better put on my velvet suit with the lace collar?"" said Lionel, who had often been out to tea."
"""Your Nurse will be removed to the Palace later. No, never mind about changing your suit; the Royal robes will cover all that up."""
"The grave gentlemen led the way to a coach with eight white horses, which was drawn up in front of the house where Lionel lived. It was No."
"7, on the left-hand side of the street as you go up."
"He told her--he told her all he knew. She listened, horror-stricken,"
regarding him with open mouth and streaming eyes.
"“And what do you think is my duty?” asked John, abruptly."
Miss Lindon shook her head. “I 'm sure I don't know what to advise
"you, dear. I 'll try to find out some kind Christian people who want a"
servant.”
"“I don't want any kind Christian people at all,” said John. “I'm going"
to make up in ease and happiness for all the wrongs that humanity has
"inflicted on her. I am going to adopt her, educate her, fill her up with"
the good things of life.”
"“That's very fine of you, John,” said Miss Lindon. “Some people are"
as fond of their adopted children as of their own. I remember Miss
"Engleshaw adopted a little child. She was four, if I remember right,"
and she used to dress her so prettily. I used to go and help her choose
frocks. Really they were quite expensive. Now I come to think of
"it, John, I could help you that way with little Unity. I don't think"
gentlemen have much experience in choosing little girls' frocks. How old
is she?”
"“Nearly sixteen,” said John."
"“That's rather old,” said Miss Lindon, from whose mind this new interest"
seemed to have driven the tragic side of the question. “It's a pity you
could n't have begun when she was four.”
"“It is,” said John."
"“Only if you had begun with her at four, you would n't be wanting to"
"Nick rose high above the other sounds of the night, calling,"
"""Min-Minnie-Girl, let us in!"" she hurriedly brushed past him and yelled"
through the door:
"""What do you want?"""
Again Johnson's hand went up imperatively.
"""Don't let him come in!"" he whispered."
"But even then she heard not his warning, but silently, tremulously"
"listened to Sonora, who shouted through the door: ""Say, Girl, you all"
"right?"" And not until her answering voice had called back her assurance"
that she was safe did she turn to the man at her side and whisper in a
voice that showed plainly her agitation and fear:
"""Jack Rance is there! If he was to see you here--he's that jealous I'd"
"be afraid--"" She checked her words and quickly put her ear close to the"
"door, the voices outside having become louder and more distinct."
"Presently she spun round on her heel and announced excitedly: ""Ashby's"
"there, too!"" And again she put her ear to the door."
"""Ashby!"" The exclamation fell from Johnson's lips before he was aware of"
it. It was impossible to deceive himself any longer--the posse had
tracked him!
"""We want to come in, Girl!"" suddenly rang out from the well-known voice"
of Nick.
"""But you can't come in!"" shouted back the Girl above the noise of the"
"storm; then, taking advantage of a particularly loud howl of the blast,"
"she turned to Johnson and inquired: ""What will I say? What reason will I"
the other end of the eyot.
"'I shall sleep,' Steve said drowsily."
"The insects were beginning to hum. The horses stood huddled together,"
swishing their long tails.
'You think they won't track us?' I asked.
"'Certain,' he said. 'There are six hundred yards of mud and water,"
"eel-holes, and willow shoots between us and the road.'"
The Waldgrave assented mechanically; it seemed so to me too. And
"by-and-by, worn out with the night's work, I fell asleep, and slept, I"
"suppose, for a good many hours, with the sun and shade passing slowly"
"across my face, and the bees droning in my ears, and the mellow warmth"
of the summer day soaking into my bones. When I awoke I lay for a time
"revelling in lazy enjoyment. The oily plop of a water-rat, as it dived"
"from a stump, or the scream of a distant jay, alone broke the laden"
silence. I looked at the sun. It lay south-west. It was three o'clock
then.
[Illustration: We were alone.... I whispered in her ear ...]
"A light touch fell on my knee. I started, looked down, and for a"
"moment stared in sleepy wonder. A tiny bunch of blue flowers, such as"
"I could see growing in a dozen places on the edge of the island, lay"
"on it, tied up with a thread of purple silk. I started up on my elbow,"
"and--there, close beside me, with her cheeks full of colour, and the"
"sunshine finding golden threads in her dark hair, sat Marie, toying"

Crane tossed the paper aside listlessly and picked up the second one:

DISASTER.
"The third paper featured an internationally syndicated columnist, famous"
for his biting wit:
*       *       *       *       *
Senator Crane today launched a one-man campaign to make America
space-conscious. If there was any Madison Avenue thinking behind the
launching it was certainly lower Madison Avenue.
In order to make his point--exactly what this was confused a vast
roomful of newspapermen--the Senator invented a race of creatures called
"androids. These androids, it seems, look exactly like Tom Smith down the"
block except that they'd just as soon cut your throat as not.
We fear the Senator must have been watching the wrong television
"shows--knives yet, ugh!--possibly _Jim Bowie_, because there wasn't a"
ray gun nor a disintegrator in his whole bag of exhibits.
"All in all, it would appear that the project was pointed toward making"
the people Senator Crane-conscious rather than aiming their attention at
"She was not to see me again, for I asked permission of the queen to"
"withdraw, and immediately left the ball."
"While I was crossing the park on my way back to Whitehall, the wind"
moaned and groaned--it did not breathe. The stars did not twinkle--they
glared. The nightingales did not sing--they screamed. And the roses were
odorless. Perhaps all this change to gloom was within me rather than
"without, but it existed just the same, and I went home and to bed, hating"
"all the world save Bettina, whom I vowed for the hundredth time never to"
see again.
"The next day at noon De Grammont came to my closet, where I had waited"
for him all morning.
"""Welcome to you, dear count!"" I cried, leading him by the hand to a"
chair.
"""Perhaps you will not so warmly welcome me,"" he returned, ""when you learn"
"my errand."""
"""I already know your errand, Count Grammont, and it makes you doubly"
"welcome,"" I answered, drawing a chair for myself and sitting down in"
front of him.
"""Ah, that is of good,"" he returned, rubbing his hands. ""You already know"
"the purpose of my visit?"""
"""Yes, I do, my dear count, but any purpose would delight me which brings"
"the pleasure of your company."""
"""Ah, it is said like a civilized man,"" he returned, complimenting"
"It was a grief to Dick to part from his master; but he saw the need, and"
he loved the horse only second to Grey himself.
"""I will do your behest, master.  Nay, I want no money; I have plenty for"
all my needs.  I too have made some modest wealth here in this great
"city. Only tell me where I may find you, and I will be gone, and do what"
"can be done for the poor beast."""

"Grey Dumaresq, having settled matters with his servant, and adjusted the"
"disarray of his own dress and person, turned towards a group of men who"
"were standing round Lord Sandford, making believe to laugh and jest, but"
showing some vague symptoms of uneasiness as they cast sidelong glances
in the direction of their erstwhile comrade.
"Grey walked straight up to Lord Sandford, and looked him full in the"

"recover his balance, but the room was in rotation, his vision playing"
tricks.
"The one thing he did see was Vera Karanova standing over him, a blurred"
"image his mind tried vainly to correct. Her face was faltering, the"
indistinct outlines of a desert mirage. Was she real or was he merely
dreaming?
". . . Now the room was growing serene, a slow-motion phantasmagoria of"
"pastel colors and soft, muted sounds. He tried to reach out, but there"
"was nothing. Instead he heard faint music, dulcet beckoning tones. The"
"world had entered another dimension, a seamless void. He wanted to be"
"part of its emptiness, to swathe himself in the cascade of oblivion"
"lifting him up. A perfect repose was drifting through him, a wave of"
darkness. He heard his own breathing as he was buoyed into a blood-red
"mist. He was floating, on a journey he had long waited to take, to a"
"place far, far away. . . ."

Eva. Where was she?
"He popped erect and surveyed the room. It was traditional Jap anese,"
"the standard four-and-a-half tatami in size, bare and Spartan. A"
classic.
But the music. It seemed to be coming through the walls.
The walls. They all looked to be rice paper. He clambered up and headed
for the fusuma with the double-ax logo. He tested it and realized that
the paper was actually painted steel. And it was locked. The room was
secure as a vault.
"But across, opposite the _tokonoma_, was another set of sliding doors."
"As he turned to walk over, he noticed he was wearing _tabi_, light"
"cotton stockings split at the toe, and he was clad in a blue-patterned"
"_yukata_  robe, cinched at the waist. He'd been stripped and re-"
dressed.
"This door was real, and he shoved it open. A suite of rooms lay beyond,"
"and there on a second futon, still in a drugged sleep, lay Eva. He"
"moved across, bent down, and shook her. She jerked away, her dreaming"
"disrupted, and turned over, but she didn't come out of it."
"""Wake up."" He shook her again. ""The party just got moved. Wait'll you"
"get a load of the decor."""
"""What . . ."" She rolled back and cracked open her bloodshot eyes. Then"
she rose on one elbow and gazed around the room. It was appointed
"identically to his, with only the hanging scroll in the _tokonoma_"
"different, hers being an angular, three-level landscape. ""My God."""
"grunted: ""It's been in two days!"""
By the time they reached the _Arabella_ Sidney's remorse was yielding
"to a spark of indignation. Lav needn't be _quite_ so mad for, after"
"all, it had been his own precious Mr. Dugald who had thrown her and"
Pola so constantly together! And if Lav had not hidden himself away he
most certainly would have been included in all the plans. It was not
fair in Lav to act so cross.
"""I know you came out to read, Lav, and I've some thinking to do, so I'm"
"going up in the bow and leave you quite to yourself,"" Sidney said as"
"they boarded the _Arabella_, and if in her tone there was something of"
"Mart's tartness, it may be forgiven for Sidney had been punished enough."
"""I don't care if you hang 'round,"" Lav conceded. ""It's too hot to read,"
"anyways. I thought maybe there'd be a breeze out here. What's that?"""
For he had suddenly spied an object lying on the deck close to the rail
as though it had dropped there from someone's pocket.
"At almost the same moment Sidney spied it, too. Both darted for it."
Lavender reached it first and picked it up and examined it with
frowning eyes.
"""It's a knife!"" cried Sidney, at his elbow."
"""Sure it's a knife. Anybody can see that. What I want to know--"""
"""Let me look at it. Isn't it Mr. Dugald's?"""
"""No, it isn't Mr. Dugald's. He hasn't been out here for a week. And"
"that knife wasn't here yesterday for I'd a' seen it."""
"He started to walk with long strides through the sad, empty streets."
"He went toward the river and met Kennedy, who was coming back, he told"
"him, from the studio of a sculptor friend of his."
“You look like desolation. What has happened to you?”
"“Nothing, but I am in a perfectly hellish humour.”"
“I am melancholy too. It must be the weather. Let’s take a walk.”
"They went along the bank of the Tiber. Full of clay, more turbid than"
"ever, and very high between the white embankments hemming it in, the"
river looked like a big sewer.
“This is not the ‘coeruleus Tibris’ that Virgil speaks of in the
"Aeneld, which presented itself to Aeneas in the form of an ancient man"
"with his head crowned with roses,” said Kennedy."
"“No. This is a horrible river,” Cæsar opined."
"They followed the shore, passed the Castel Sant’ Angelo and the bridge"
with the statues.
"From the embankment, to the right, they could now see narrow lanes, sunk"
"almost below the level of the river. On the other bank a new, white"
edifice towered in the rain.
"They went as far as the Piazza d’Armi, and then came back at nightfall"
to Rome. The rain was gradually ceasing and the sky looked less
threatening. A file of greenish gaslights followed the river-wall and
then crossed over the bridge.
"The moment she sat me down and walked slowly around me, I knew I was"
"in for it. ""I've been reading up on Venusian geography in the ship's"
"library,"" I told her in a hurry."
"""No doubt,"" she said drily. She shook her night-black hair out. ""But"
you aren't going to tell me that you read about _dunging_ in the ship's
library. The books there have been censored by a government agent of
Earth against the possibility that they might be read by susceptible
young male minds like yours. She would not have allowed--this Terran
"Agent--"""
"""Paddlefoot,"" I sneered."
"Sis sat down hard in our zoom-air chair. ""Now that's a term,"" she said"
"carefully, ""that is used only by Venusian riffraff."""
"""They're not!"""
"""Not what?"""
"""Riffraff,"" I had to answer, knowing I was getting in deeper all the"
time and not being able to help it. I mustn't give Mr. Brown away!
"""They're trappers and farmers, pioneers and explorers, who're building"
"Venus. And it takes a real man to build on a hot, hungry hell like"
"Venus."""
"""Does it, now?"" she said, looking at me as if I were beginning to grow"
"a second pair of ears. ""Tell me more."""
"""You can't have meek, law-abiding, women-ruled men when you start"
civilization on a new planet. You've got to have men who aren't afraid
to make their own law if necessary--with their own guns. That's where
But here the Rogan leader turned impatiently away. Greca had been
translating sentence by sentence. Now the tall one barked out a few
syllables in a squeaky voice.
"""He says he knows you are lying,"" sighed Greca. ""For if you on Earth"
have tubes more effective than theirs why weren't you equipped with
"them on your expedition here to the red kingdom?"""
"Brand bit his lips. ""Check,"" he muttered. ""The brute has a brain in"
"that ugly head."""
*       *       *       *       *
The Rogan leader spoke for a long time then; and at each singsong
"word, Greca quivered as though lashed by a whip. At length she turned"
to Brand.
"""He has been telling what his hordes can do, answering your boasts"
with boasts of his own. His words are awful! I won't tell you all he
said. I will only say that he is convinced his shock-tubes are
"superior to any Earth arms, and that he states he will now illustrate"
their power to you to quell your insolence. I don't know what he means
"by that...."""
But she and the Earthmen were soon to find out.
The Rogan leader stepped to the window and arrogantly beckoned Brand
and Dex to join him there. They did; and the leader gazed out and down
as though searching for something.
He pointed. The two Earthmen followed his leveled arm with their eyes

first couples to get married in Undersea. He looked thoughtful when I
told him how Sis and I had been born there and spent half our childhood

with their father were they. He hung a swing for them between the two
"rowan trees in the field, taking care to pack plenty of rag under the rope"
so as not to injure the tree.
He also had a talk with Paul; there were rumors that he was intending to

he seemed even more hurt that the manufacturer should have paid a visit to

a case of a woman of her caliber gone wrong.
“But you must have read of the famous Moulton diamonds?”
"“Yes,” said Craig, blankly, as if it were all news to him."
“Schloss has them—or at least had them. The jewels she wore at the
"opera this winter were paste, I understand.”"
“Does Moulton play?” he asked.
"“I think so—but not here, naturally. In a way, I suppose, it is his"
fault. They all do it. The example of one drives on another.”
"Instantly there flashed over my mind a host of possibilities. Perhaps,"
"after all, Winters had been right. Schloss had taken this way to make"
sure of the jewels so that she could not redeem them. Suddenly another
"explanation crowded that out. Had Mrs. Moulton robbed the safe herself,"
"or hired some one else to do it for her, and had that person gone back"
on her?
Then a horrid possibility occurred to me. Whatever Antoinette Moulton
"may have been and done, some one must have her in his power. What a"
situation for the woman! My sympathy went out to her in her supreme
"struggle. Even if it had been a real robbery, Schloss might easily"
recover from it. But for her every event spelled ruin and seemed only
to be bringing that ruin closer.
"We left Winters, still watching on the trail of Schloss, and went on"
uptown to the laboratory.
"""And what did they say, Lav? Oh, tell me quick!"""
"""I could only get scraps of it. I didn't dare look, I didn't dare move."
But one fellow called the other Jed. I heard 'em say something about
'risk' and a 'stranger from Boston asking too many questions 'round
"Rockman's to be healthy,' and Jed Starrow--I'm dead sure it was his"
"voice--said, sort of blustering like, 'Let them search the _Puritan_!"
They won't find anything on her _now_!' And the other fellow answered
"him: 'There's too much in this, Jed, to take any chances.' That's what"
"they said, Sid, and then they went on."""
"""Oh, Lav, they're pirates!"""
"""Well, not exactly pirates, but they're up to _something_ that's sure."
Maybe they're rum-runners. There's a lot of that going on. I thought
"you were crazy, but I guess you weren't."""
Sidney's lips trembled with eagerness. As long as Lavender knew what he
knew she felt that she would be justified in telling him what Cap'n
Davies had told her.
"""It isn't rum--Lav,"" she whispered, ""It's _diamonds_!"""
"""Diamonds! Oh, go on, where did you get that stuff?"""
"""It's diamonds, Lav."" Then Sidney solemnly repeated what the old"
"Captain had told her concerning the letter and the reward. ""He asked me"
"not to tell a soul, but you're different because you know. And he said"
that the reward would be posted everywhere in two weeks at least and
"it's that long now. Everyone will know soon."""

The butler touched him upon his shirt-sleeve in dignified despair:
"“Gentlemen,” said he--“this is not decent. I repeat--it is not honest.”"
"“Go hon!” said Rippley, punching the old man in the ribs with his"
"elbow, and working away at the fixing of his throat-beard. “Look here,"
"Fluffy,” he called hurriedly--“you and Doome _must_ run this pompous"
old dolt downstairs and shoot him into the cellar--and lock him in.
Quick! or the people will be arriving.... I hear carriage-wheels.”
Robbins and Doome seized the shocked old man and hurried his protesting
stiff being out of the room and down the stairs.
"Rippley followed them to the top of the stairs, making up his disguise"
as he went:
"“Look here, boys,” he called down in a hoarse whisper--“if the old"
fool will swear not to move away from the hall door until we release
him you needn’t put him in the cellar.... What?... Eh?... He says he
surrenders? That’s all right then. Now back with you--quick! or the
guests will be here--or Pangbutt himself.”
There was a loud ring at the door-bell.
Rippley skipped back to the cabinet: and from the cabinet he ran to
Andrew Blotte:
"“Blotte, old boy,” said he, pulling a red wig over the gloomy man’s"
head and combing the lank red hair down the sides of his pale
face--“you must look after the cloak-room and change the tickets and
"""Grapple the days to come!"" he said. ""Let Scripture and ethics rot! My"
"men are at your command! Let them ride by stream and forest, moor and"
"mere! Let them ride in quest of your lost one, ride like the wind!"""
Francesco looked at the duke through a mist of tears.
"""You know?"" he faltered."
"""For this I came!"" replied the duke, extending his hand. ""You will"
find her whom your heart seeks. Like a golden dawn shall she rise out
"of the past. Blow your horn! Let us not tarry!"""
CHAPTER VIII
THE ANCHORESS OF NARNI
Six days had passed. Once more the sun had tossed night from the sky
and kindled hope in the hymning east. The bleak wilderness barriered
by sea and crag had mellowed into the golden silence of the autumnal
woods. The very trees seemed tongued with prophetic flame. The world
leaped radiant out of the dawn.
"Through the reddened woods rode Francesco, the Duke of Spoleto silent"
"by his side. Gloom still reigned on the pale, haggard face and there"
was no lustre in the eyes that challenged ever the lurking shade of
Death. Six nights and six days had the quest been baffled. Near and
far armor glimmered in the reddened sanctuaries of the woods. Not a
and Anti-vivisectionists and Vegetarians and other miserable
"Little-Englanders, denounced him as a Turk, an assassin, a"
"seventeenth-century Spanish _conquistador_ of the bloodiest type, and"
"held him up to popular execration, and recalled him, and put him on a"
beggarly pension years before he had reached his age limit. He could
tell them stories which seemed (and in truth deserved to be) incredible.
"“John,” said Lady Blount, “has heard all this a thousand times,”--as"
"indeed he had,--“and must be sick to death of it. He is not going out to"
Australia as governor-general.”
"“Who said he was, my dear?” said Sir Oliver."
"“If you did n't imply it, you were talking nonsense, Oliver,” Lady"
Blount retorted.
"“Anyhow, Oliver, do you think John is taking a wise step?” Herold"
hastily interposed.
"“I do,” said he; “a very wise step.”"
"“I don't agree with you at all,” said Lady Blount, with a snap of"
finality.
"“Your remark, my dear,” replied Sir Oliver, “does not impress me in the"
least. When did you ever agree with me?”
"“Never, my dear Oliver,” said Lady Blount, with the facial smile of"
the secretly hostile fencer. “And I thank Heaven for it. I may not be a
"brilliant woman, but I am endowed with common sense.”"
"Sir Oliver looked at her for a moment, with lips parted, as if to"
"“Powder,” answered the Canon. “She has been using her puff too freely.”"
"“She has been putting it on with a _muff_,” cried Yvonne."
He laughed. Yvonne had such a triumphant air in delivering herself of
little witticisms.
"A magnificently dressed woman, in a great feathered hat and low-dress,"
"with diamonds gleaming at her neck, passed by. “You are right, I fear,"
"about the two worlds,” said the Canon."
“Are n’t there crowds of them? I like to look at them because they wear
such beautiful things. And they fit so. And then to rub shoulders with
"them makes one feel so delightfully wicked. You know, I knew a girl"
once--she went in for that life of her own accord and she was awfully
happy. Really. Is n’t it odd?”
"“My dear Yvonne!” said the Canon, somewhat shocked, “I sincerely trust"
"you did not continue the acquaintance, afterwards.”"
"“Oh, no,” she replied, sagely. “It would not have done for me at all."
A lone woman can’t be too careful. But I used to hear about her from my
dressmaker.”
Her point of view was not exactly the Canon’s. But further discussion
"was stopped by the arrival of the Wilmingtons, who carried off Yvonne"
"to the dancing-room. The Canon, drawing the line at his own appearance"
"there, strolled back contentedly to the hotel to finish the evening over"
a book.
Two mornings afterwards Yvonne was walking by herself along the _digue_.
"They were to leave for Switzerland the next day, and she determined to"
"""I'll do anything you say,"" promised Pola. ""I'm so curious that I'm"
"fairly bursting."""
"""I don't care, but you'll have to take off your shoes and stockings,"""
"muttered Lav, scarcely looking at Pola."
"""Oh, I'll do that! I'll do _anything_!"" Pola flopped upon the beach and"
"commenced removing her sport shoes. ""And I won't even ask any questions"
"until you're ready to tell me."" Rising, her small feet pink against the"
"sand, she saluted Lav with mock solemnity."
"""There, Captain Lavender Green, I'm at your command."""
Her pretty acquiescence won the girls at once. If any doubt assailed
"them as to the prudence of letting Pola go, their admiration for Pola's"
gameness stilled it. Sidney rolled Pola's shoes and stockings and her
own in her sweater and hid them behind some logs. Then the little party
waded out to the dory and embarked.
"""We're going to the _Arabella_,"" Sidney whispered to Pola. She felt"
"Pola shiver, but the girl made no protest. ""We have to go 'round this"
"way so's no one can see us from the harbor. Sh--h!"""
"Silently they boarded the old hull, Lavender last. With the line from"
the dory in his hand the boy considered.
"""If anyone comes up and sees the dory they'll know someone's aboard."""
"""That's true. What'll we do?"" whispered Sidney, anxiously."
"""We can set her adrift. It's an old tub anyway."""
"Whereupon, Johnson went over to the window and put his face close to"
hers on the frosted panes; a great sea of white snow met his gaze!
"""This means--"" he said, turning away from the window and meeting her"
"glance--""surely it doesn't mean that I can't leave Cloudy to-night?"""
"""It means you can't get off the mountain to-night,"" calmly answered the"
Girl.
"""Good Lord!"" fell from the man's lips."
"""You can't leave this room to-night,"" went on the Girl, decidedly. ""Why,"
you couldn't find your way three feet from this door--you a stranger!
"You don't know the trail anyway unless you can see it."""
"""But I can't stay here?"" incredulously."
"""Why not? Why, that's all right! The boys'll come up an' dig us out"
"to-morrow or day after. There's plenty o' wood an' you can have my bed."""
"And with no more ado than that, the Girl went over to the bed to remove"
the covers and make it ready for his occupancy.
"""I wouldn't think of taking that,"" protested the man, stoutly, while his"
face clouded over.
The Girl felt a thrill at the note of regard in his voice and hastened
to explain:
"""I never use it cold nights; I always roll up in my rug in front of the"
"fire."" All of a sudden she broke out into a merry little laugh. ""Jest"
"think of it stormin' all this time an' we didn't know it!"""
DOSE.--Same as that for whisky.
SPIRITUS JUNIPERI COMPOSITUS--COMPOUND SPIRIT OF JUNIPER
"DERIVATION.--Oil of juniper, 8; oil of caraway, 1; oil of fennel, 1;"
"alcohol, 1,400; water to make 2,000."
Compound spirit of juniper is similar to gin in its therapeutic action.
Contains about 15 per cent more alcohol. Gin is made by distillation of
fermented malt and juniper berries. Gin differs from the other alcoholic
preparations therapeutically in being more diuretic.
DOSE.--Same as that for whisky.
RUM (not official)
Rum is made from a fermented solution of molasses by distillation. It
"contains, by weight, from 40 to 50 per cent of absolute alcohol. Rum"
does not differ physiologically from alcohol. There is no authoritative
Latin name for rum.
DOSE.--Same as that for whisky.
VINUM ALBUM--WHITE WINE
DERIVATION.--An alcoholic liquid made by fermenting the juice of fresh
"grapes, the fruit of Vitis vinifera, free from seeds, stems and skins."
"PROPERTIES.--A pale amber or straw-colored liquid, having a pleasant"
fraught with significance. Lavender took the precaution to beach the
dory at an abandoned wharf near Sunset Lane.
"""Just as well not to show ourselves 'round Rockman's."""
"""When can we go out to the _Arabella_?"""
"""Not 'till four o'clock. We can go out to swim just like we always do."
Even if they see us they won't think it's funny for us to do that.
"They'd think it funnier if we didn't."""
"Sidney admitted the truth of this, but wondered how she could live"
until four o'clock!
"As they walked up Sunset Lane Sidney reminded Lavender that, because of"
"their promise, they ought to tell Mart. But when they stopped at the"
Calkins' house they found that Mart had already gone to Gert Bartow's.
"""Oh, dear,"" sighed Sidney, with an added pang of remorse."
At four o'clock Sidney and Lavender went out to the _Arabella_ to swim
as they had done always before Pola's coming. Except for a brightness
"in Sidney's eyes, an alertness about her whole body, and the occasional"
significant glances that passed between them they both appeared quite
normal. Lav talked casually of the heat of the day.
"""Gee, the water'll feel great. This is the hottest day we've had yet."""
"""I can't wait to get in."" Most certainly Jed Starrow, had he been"
"listening, could not have guessed how closely Nemesis pressed upon his"

"him as though going to the other side of the gallery, but walked slowly"
when I approached him and the two worthy villains. I was rewarded by
hearing his Majesty say:--
"""Odds fish! But you made a mess of it! You got the wrong woman! Who in"
"the devil's name did you pick up?"""
"I could not stop to hear the rest of this interesting conversation, but"
"two days later I heard from Rochester, who had it from Wentworth, that"
the following occurred:--
"""We thought we had her,"" answered Berkeley, nodding towards Frances, ""but"
"the woman wore a full vizard and was wrapped in furs to her ears, so that"
"we did not see her face."""
"""Do you suppose we could have made a mistake?"" asked Wentworth."
"""You surely did,"" answered the king. ""She has established an alibi. At"
"what hour did you leave Baynard's Castle?"""
"""Near one o'clock,"" returned Berkeley."
"""One o'clock! She was playing cards with the duchess till four,"""
"exclaimed the king, impatiently. ""You picked up the wrong woman. But"
"""No, by God, you'll not introduce her to the king! I'll explode the whole"
"affair, and Dunkirk may go to the devil before you shall introduce Betty"
"to the king,"" I answered."
"""Yet you are willing that I should meddle in the dangerous affair?"
"Evidently you love her more than you love me?"""
"""Only a few hundred million times more,"" I answered sullenly."
"""Is it that way with you, my dear brother?"" she asked, coming to me as I"
"stood gazing out the window, seeing nothing save Bettina's face. Frances"
"put her hand on my shoulder and said coaxingly: ""Forgive me. No harm"
"shall come to her through me."""
"Of course I was sorry that I had allowed myself to become angry, and at"
once made my apology as well as I could.
"""Let us go to see Betty, anyway,"" said Frances. And I assenting, she went"
"to fetch her cloak, hat, and vizard."
"But when she returned, I had changed my mind and declined to go, telling"
Frances that I must see Bettina no more.
"""Why?"" asked Frances."
"""Because I would not win a love from her which I cannot accept."""
"""Baron Ned, there are few men who would be so considerate."""

When the luncheon hour drew near there came a slight lull in the
uproar.
Maxwell stood by his desk with his hands full of telegrams and
"memoranda, with a fountain pen over his right ear and his hair hanging"
"in disorderly strings over his forehead. His window was open, for the"
beloved janitress Spring had turned on a little warmth through the
waking registers of the earth.
And through the window came a wandering—perhaps a lost—odour—a
"delicate, sweet odour of lilac that fixed the broker for a moment"
"immovable. For this odour belonged to Miss Leslie; it was her own, and"
hers only.
"The odour brought her vividly, almost tangibly before him. The world of"
finance dwindled suddenly to a speck. And she was in the next
room—twenty steps away.
"“By George, I’ll do it now,” said Maxwell, half aloud. “I’ll ask her"
now. I wonder I didn’t do it long ago.”
He dashed into the inner office with the haste of a short trying to
cover. He charged upon the desk of the stenographer.
"She looked up at him with a smile. A soft pink crept over her cheek,"
and her eyes were kind and frank. Maxwell leaned one elbow on her desk.
He still clutched fluttering papers with both hands and the pen was
above his ear.
"“Miss Leslie,” he began hurriedly, “I have but a moment to spare. I"
"Colonel Carmichael thrust her behind him, and an instant later she"
heard the report of his revolver. There was no answering volley. A
"dark, scantily-clad figure sprang through the trees, waving one hand"
as though in imperative appeal.
"""Don't fire--don't fire! It's me!"""
"The Colonel's still smoking revolver sank, and the supposed native"
"swayed toward him, only to sink a few yards farther on to the ground."
Carmichael ran to his side and lifted the fainting head against his
shoulder.
"""Good God, Geoffries! Don't say I've hit you! How on earth was I to"
"know!"""
"""That's all right, Colonel. Only winded--don't you know--never hurried"
so much in life. Have been in the midst of the beggars--just managed
"to slip through. O Lor', give me something to drink, will you?"""
Colonel Carmichael put his flask to the parched and broken lips.
"""Thanks, that's better. We got your message, and are coming on like"
fun. The regiment's only an hour off. You never saw Saunders in such a
"fluster--it's his first big job, you know."" He took another deep"
"draft, and wiped his mouth with the corner of his ragged tunic. ""I"
"say--don't look at me, Miss Lois. I'm not fit to be seen."" He laughed"
"hoarsely. ""These clothes weren't made in Bond Street, and Webb assured"
"me that the fewer I had the more genuine I looked. I say, Colonel,"
"this is a lively business!"""
Colonel Carmichael nodded as he helped the gasping and exhausted man
into the bungalow.
"“No, indeed,” the Englishman proclaimed."
Cæsar and Kennedy disagreed about everything.
"Susanna discussed her plans, and constantly referred to Paul Bourget’s"
"novel _Cosmopolis_, which had obviously influenced her in her"
inclination for Catholicism.
“Are there many Jewish ladies who aspire to be baptized and become
"Catholics, as Bourget says?” asked Susanna."
“Bah!” exclaimed Cæsar.
“You do not believe that either?”
"“No, it strikes me as a piece of naïvety in this good soul of a"
"novelist. To become a Catholic, I don’t believe requires more than some"
few pesetas.”
"“You are detestable, as a Cardinal’s nephew.”"
“I mean that I don’t perceive that there are any obstacles to prevent
"anybody from becoming a Catholic, as there are to prevent his becoming"
"rich. What a high ambition, to aspire to be a Catholic! While nobody"
anywhere does anything but laugh at Catholics; and it has become an
axiom: ‘A Catholic country is a country bound for certain ruin.’”
Kennedy burst out laughing.
"Susanna said that she had no real faith, but that she did have a great"
"enthusiasm for churches and for choirs, for the smell of incense and"
"want you to know. I tried to keep it from you, Everard! Don’t look at me"
like that?”
Her voice ended in a note of fright. For the Canon’s face had grown
ashen and wore an expression of incredulous horror. He shook her from
him.
“Do you mean that this is true? That you met your first husband this
morning?”
"“Yes,” said she, with quivering lips. Question and answer were too"
categorical for misunderstanding. For a moment he struggled against the
overwhelming.
"“Are you in your right senses, Yvonne? Do you understand what I asked"
you? Your first husband is still alive and you saw him to-day?”
"“Yes,” said Yvonne again. “Didn’t you know when you came in?”"
"“I did n’t know,” he repeated almost mechanically."
"The blow crushed him for a while. He stood quite rigid, drawing"
"quick breaths, with his eyes fixed upon her. And she remained still,"
"half-sitting on the edge of the bed, numb with a vague prescience of"
"catastrophe, and a dim, uncomprehended intuition of the earthquake and"
wreck in the man’s soul. The silence grew appalling. She broke it with a
faltering whisper.

"In 1703 was one of the crew of the brigantine _Charles_, eighty tons,"

"Marblehead the crew mutinied, locked the captain in his cabin, and elected"

She sat bolt upright and rubbed her eyes. Then she flung out her arms
with a low glad cry that was half sob.

"Trude held her long and close, stroking the shorn head, murmuring"
soothing words. Finally Sidney wriggled from her.

"quickly? How long have I been asleep? Oh, Lavender--is he--is he--"""

"will it be?"""
"Vance studied him. ""A lot depends on what happens to Eva."""
"""The fate of Dr. Borodin depends largely on your decision. So perhaps I"
"should give you some time to think it over."" He leaned back. ""Or"
"perhaps some inducement."""
Vance didn't know what he meant. At first. Then he turned and looked
behind him. There waiting on the stony walkway of the garden were three
"of Tanzan Mino's personal _kobun_, two of whom he recognized from"
"London. The CEO's instructions to them were in rapid-fire Japanese, but"
he needed no translation as they moved forward.
"“Do you actually ask me such a question, honestly?”"
"“God knows I do,” she replied pitifully."
“And you would have gone on living with me--I not being your husband?”
"“But you are my husband,” cried Yvonne, “nothing could ever alter that.”"
"“But good God! it does alter it,” cried the Canon in a voice of anguish,"
breaking the iron bonds he had placed on his passion. “Neither in the
eyes of God nor of man are you my wife. You have no right to bear my
name. After this hour I have no right to enter this room. Every caress
"I gave you would be sin. Don’t you understand it, child? Don’t you"
"understand that this has brought ruin into our lives, the horror of"
loneliness and separation?”
“Separation?” said Yvonne.
She rose slowly from her seat on the bed and stared at him aghast.
The twilight in the room deepened; the shadow of a wall opposite the
window fell darker. Their faces and Yvonne’s bare neck and arms gleamed
white in the gloom. They had spoken with many silences; for how long
neither knew.
"“Yes,” replied the Canon in his harder tones, recovering himself “It"
means all that.”
“I am to go--not to live with you any more?”
“Could you imagine our past relations could continue?”
without Martyanoff because he could not play honestly. After cheating
"several times, he openly confessed:"
"""I cannot play without cheating ... it is a habit of mine."""
"""Habits do get the better of you,"" assented Deacon Taras.  ""I always"
"used to beat my wife every Sunday after Mass, and when she died I"
cannot describe how extremely dull I felt every Sunday.  I lived
"through one Sunday--it was dreadful, the second I still controlled"
"myself, the third Sunday I struck my Asok....  She was angry and"
threatened to summon me.  Just imagine if she had done so!  On the
"fourth Sunday, I beat her just as if she were my own wife!  After that"
"I gave her ten roubles, and beat her according to my own rules till I"
"married again!"" ..."
"""You are lying, Deacon!  How could you marry a second time?"""
interrupted Abyedok.
"""Ay, just so...  She looked after my house...."""
"""Did you have any children?"" asked the teacher."
"""Five of them....  One was drowned ... the oldest ... he was an amusing"
boy!  Two died of diphtheria ...  One of the daughters married a
student and went with him to Siberia.  The other went to the University
"of St. Petersburg and died there ... of consumption they say. Ye--es,"
"there were five of them.... Ecclesiastics are prolific, you know.""  He"
"began explaining why this was so, and they laughed till they nearly"
"burst at his tales. When the laughter stopped, Aleksei Maksimovitch"
Simtsoff remembered that he too had once had a daughter.
"""Her name was Lidka ... she was very stout ...""  More than this he did"
"""You say that all I must do in the meantime is to sign some papers,"" she"
"interrupted. ""You say you won't ask me to marry you right away. Will you"
"wait--a year?"""
"""A year! I couldn't, Sallie!"" he cried, and her pale lips drooped"
piteously again.
"""How long, then?"" she asked in a whisper. ""Six months?"""
"He had made up his mind to be generous, and he felt that he had not"
"failed in his intention as he answered, ""Three months, and not a day"
"longer, Sallie."""
"She sat still and silent for a while, considering that, and then, ""All"
"right, Jasper,"" she agreed. ""Take me safe home, and I'll marry you three"
months from the day we get there--if we're both alive when the time
"comes."""
He turned away from her for a moment. He had won all he wanted in the
"meantime, and he could scarcely contain himself. When he presently held"
"out a hand to her, she took it, to bind that bargain."
"""And you won't have any cause to regret it, Sallie,"" he assured her, his"
voice somewhat hoarse in spite of his effort to speak quite naturally.
"""So now, as soon as you're ready, we'll all go ashore together, and--"""
"""I'll be ready in twenty minutes,"" she told him, clasping her hands at"
"her heart, her eyes very eager. ""And, Jasper--you must let me take"
"Ambrizette with me."""

whole landscape called by a flash of lightning out of the dark night. It
"is all there, every bit of it, good and evil, pleasure and pain, sin and"

A man cannot escape from his life even in death. In our acts of to-day
"we are determining what our death will be; if we have lived well, we"
"shall die well; and if not, then not. As a man lives so shall he die, is"
the teaching of Buddhism as of other creeds.
"So what Buddhism has to offer to the dying believer is this, that if he"
"live according to its tenets he will die happily, and that in the life"
"that he will next enter upon he will be less and less troubled by sin,"
"less and less wedded to the lust of life, until sometime, far away, he"
"shall gain the great Deliverance. He shall have perfect Peace, perfect"
"rest, perfect happiness, he and his, in that heaven where his teacher"
went before him long ago.
"And if we should say that this Deliverance from life, this Great Peace,"
"is Death, what matter, if it be indeed Peace?"

"In February, 1686, Ringrose with one hundred men took the town of Santiago"
"in Mexico, but while returning with the plunder to their ship were caught"
"by the Spaniards in an ambush, and Ringrose was killed."
Ringrose never attained any rank among the buccaneers beyond occasionally
"being put in charge of a boat or a small company on shore, but as a"
recorder of the doings of his companions he proved both careful and
"painstaking. Dampier had a great regard for him, and in his book he"
"writes: ""My ingenious friend Ringrose had no mind to this voyage, but was"
"necessitated to engage in it or starve."""
"The title of Ringrose's book, first published in 1685, is ""The Dangerous"

"ROACH, PETER."
"When Captain Quelch was captured with his crew, Roach escaped near the"
Cape by Snake Island. He was afterwards captured and thrown into the gaol
"at Salem. Tried for piracy at the Star Tavern at Boston, and on June 30th,"
"1704, was hanged. At the place of execution Roach disappointed the"
"onlooking crowd, as, instead of the expected and hoped-for repentant"
"speech, ""he seemed little concerned, and said but little or nothing at"
"all."""
"ROB, ALEXANDER."
"'North,' he whispered."
"After that they were nothing to me, but I went with the rest. Our lair"
"was in some rocks overhanging the road. By the time we looked over,"
"the horsemen were below us, and we could see nothing of them; though"
"the sullen tramp of their horses, and the jingle of bit and spur,"
reached us clearly. Presently they came into sight again on the road
"beyond, riding steadily away with their backs to us."
'That is not General Tzerclas?' my lady muttered anxiously.
'Nor any of his people!' Steve said with an oath.
"That led me to look more closely, and I saw in a moment something that"
lifted me out of my moodiness. I sprang on the rock against which I
was leaning and shouted long and loudly.
"'Himmel!' Steve cried, seizing me by the ankle. 'Are you mad, man?'"
"But I only shouted again, and waved my cap frantically. Then I slipped"
"down, sobered. 'They see us,' I cried. 'They are Leuchtenstein's"
"riders. And Count Hugo is with them. You are safe, my lady.'"
"She turned white and red, and I saw her clutch at the rock to keep"
herself on her feet. 'Are you sure?' she said. The troop had halted
and were wheeling slowly and in perfect order.
"'Quite sure, my lady,' I answered, with a touch of bitterness in my"
tone. Why had not this happened yesterday or the day before? Then my
girl would have been saved. Now it came too late! Too late! No wonder
I felt bitterly about it.
The general shrugged his shoulders and laughed grimly. 'Why not?' he
"said. 'What are waiting-women and the like made for, if not to be"
bribed--or slapped?'
She hated him for that sly hit--if never before; but she controlled
herself. She would throw the burden on him.
"He read the thought, and it led him to change his tone. There was a"
"gloomy fire in his eyes, and smouldering passion in his voice, when he"
spoke again.
"'Well, Countess,' he said, 'I am here for your answer.'"
'To what?'
"'To the question I asked you some time ago,' he rejoined, dwelling on"
her with sullen eyes. 'I asked you to be my wife. Your answer?'
"'Prythee!' she said proudly, 'this is a strange way of wooing.'"
"'It is not of my choice that I woo in company,' he answered, shrugging"
his shoulders. 'My answer; that is all I want--and you.'
"'Then you shall have the first, and not the last,' she exclaimed on a"
"sudden impulse. 'No, no--a hundred times no! If you do not see that by"
"pressing me now,' she continued impetuously, 'when I am alone,"
"friendless, and unprotected, you insult me, you should see it, and I"
do.'
"For a moment there was silence. Then he laughed; but his voice,"
"notwithstanding his mastery over it and in spite of that laugh, shook"
"with rage and resentment. 'As I expected,' he said. 'I knew last night"
"same meaning to her ear: ""You have helped to do this--this is your"
"work."""
"""No help will come,"" Mrs. Carmichael said, shaking her head at the"
"darkness. ""When a whole province rises as this has done, it takes"
"months to organize a sufficient force, and we shan't last out many"
days. I wonder what people in England are saying. How well I can see
"them over their breakfast cups! Oh, dear, I mustn't think of breakfast"
"cups, or I shall lose my nerve."" She laughed under her breath, and"
there was a long silence.
"Presently the door of the bungalow opened, letting in a stream of"
"moonlight. It was closed instantly, and soft footfalls came over the"
boarded floor.
"""Who is it?"" Mrs. Carmichael whispered."
"""I--Lois,"" was the answer. The new-comer crept down by Beatrice's side"
"and leaned her head against the warm shoulder. ""I am so tired,"" she"
"said faintly. ""I have been with Archibald. He has been moaning so. Mr."
"Berry says he is afraid mortification has set in. It is terrible."""
"""Poor little woman!"" Beatrice put her arm about the slender figure and"
"drew her closer. ""Lay your head on my lap and sleep a little. You can"
"do no good just now."""
"""Thank you. I will, if you don't mind. You will wake me if anything"
"happens, won't you?"""
"""Yes, I promise."" It gave Beatrice a sense of comfort to have Lois"
"near her. Very gently she passed her hand over the aching forehead,"
and presently Lois fell into a sleep of absolute exhaustion.
adorably red. There was a new and brilliant light in her eye; and after
"one curiously comprehensive glance at the company, she turned about to"
"look for her companion, La Giralda, who presently cantered up on a"
"lumbering Estramenian gelding. La Giralda sat astride as before, her"
"lower limbs, so far as these were apparent, being closely clad in"
"leather, a loose skirt over them preserving in part the appearance of"
sex.
Rollo was dumb with sheer astonishment. He could only gaze at the
"flushed cheek, the tingling electric glances, the air completely"
unconscious and innocent of the girl before him.
"""Concha!"" he cried aloud. ""Concha--what do you here? I thought--I"
"imagined you were safe at the Convent of the Holy Innocents!"""
"And from behind Sergeant Cardono marked his cheek, alternately paling"
"and reddening, his stammering tongue and altered demeanour, with the"
utmost satisfaction.
"""Good--good,"" he muttered under his breath to El Sarria; ""he will make a"
true general yet. The saints be praised for this weakness! If only he
"were fonder of his dinner all might yet be well!"""
CHAPTER XXV
THE MISSION OF THE SEÑORITA CONCHA
"""I too have a mission, I would have you know,"" said Concha, a dangerous"
"preparations for the night. He was about to make some remark, however,"
when to his well-attuned ears there came the sound of approaching
footsteps. In an instant he was standing in the parting made by the
"curtains, his face eager, animated, tense."
"""What's that?"" he whispered."
"""That's snow slidin',"" the Girl informed him without the slightest trace"
of anxiety in her voice.
"""God bless you, Girl,"" he murmured, and retreated back of the curtains."
"It was only an instant before he was back again with: ""Why, there is"
"something out there--sounded like people calling,"" he again whispered."
"""That's only the wind,"" she said, adding as she drew her robe tightly"
"about her: ""Gettin' cold, ain't it?"""
"But, notwithstanding her assurances, Johnson did not feel secure, and it"
was with many misgivings that he now directed his footsteps towards the
bed behind the curtains.
"""Good-night!"" he said uneasily."
"""Good-night!"" unconsciously returned the Girl in the same tone."
Taking off her slippers the Girl now put on a pair of moccasins and
"quietly went over to her bed, where she knelt down and made a silent"
prayer.
"""Good-night!"" presently came from a little voice in the rug."
"""Good-night!"" answered the man now settled in the centre of the"
and said to the eating-house keeper:
"""Egor Terentievitch Vaviloff?  Are you he?"""
"""I am,"" answered the sergeant, leaning on the bar with both arms as if"
intending to jump over it.
"""I have some business with you,"" said Petunikoff."
"""Delighted.  Please come this way to my private room."""
"They went in and sat down, the guest on the couch and his host on the"
chair opposite to him.  In one corner a lamp was burning before a
"gigantic icon, and on the wall at the other side there were several oil"
"lamps.  They were well kept and shone as if they were new.  The room,"
"which contained a number of boxes and a variety of furniture, smelt of"
"tobacco, sour cabbage, and olive oil.  Petunikoff looked around him and"
"made a face.  Vaviloff looked at the icon, and then they looked"
"simultaneously at one another, and both seemed to be favourably"
"impressed.  Petunikoff liked Vaviloff's frankly thievish eyes, and"
"Vaviloff was pleased with the open, cold, determined face of"
"Petunikoff, with its large cheeks and white teeth."
"""Of course you already know me, and I presume you guess what I am going"
"to say to you,"" began Petunikoff."
"""About the lawsuit? ... I presume?"" remarked the ex-sergeant,"
respectfully.
"""Exactly!  I am glad to see that you are not beating about the bush,"
"but going straight to the point like a business man,"" said Petunikoff,"
encouragingly.
“It must be such an adventure. It must make you hold your breath and
your heart beat.”
John wondered grimly whether a certain doer of wickedness had felt this
"ecstatic rapture. She, too, must have seen the gray dawn, but creeping"
through prison-bars into her cell. God of Inscrutability! Was it
"possible that these two co-watchers of the dawn, both so dominant in his"
"life, were of the same race of beings? If the one was a woman born of"
"woman, what in the name of mystery was Stellamaris?"
"“Don't look so grave, Great High Belovedest,” she said, squeezing a"
finger. “I only spoke in fun. It must really be horrid to be wicked.
When I was little I had a book about Cruel Frederick--I think it
"belonged to grandmama. It had awful pictures, and there were rhymes--"
"He tore the wings off little flies,"
And then poked out their little eyes.
And there was a picture of his doing so. I used to think him a
detestable boy. It made me unhappy and kept me awake when I was quite
"small, but now I know it's all nonsense. People don't do such things, do"
they?”
"Risca twisted his glum face into a smile, remembering the Unwritten Law."
"“Of course not, Stellamaris,” said he. “Cruel Frederick is just as much"
"of a mythical personage as the Giant Fee-fo-fum, who said:"
"I smell the blood of an Englishman,"
"And be he alive or be he dead,"
He made his way down through an ascending stream of newly-arrived
"guests, with some difficulty, just as Ffolliott, seeing Sir Tankerton"
"Wollup hesitate at the door, went up to the great man mincingly, and"
said affectedly:
"“Oh, I say, Sir Tankerton--d’you know, I feel such an awful ass--but"
they told me it was a fancy-dress affair.”
"Sir Tankerton, staring with bloodshot eyes of ruffled dignity at the"
"thing before him, sniffed."
“Go away!” he said testily.
Ffolliott went away.
"As the pompous millionaire stood irresolute at the doorway, an"
"absent-minded snuffy little old gentleman shuffled up to his elbow,"
followed at a couple of paces by a little faded old lady of withered
"prehistoric design, and, touching him on the sleeve inquiringly, said:"
"“My good man--before you announce our names, will you tell me which is"
the host? I have never seen my host before--in fact----”
"“Poof--poof!” squealed Sir Tankerton Wollup, and strutted into the room."
“Dear me!” The little old gentleman turned to his little old lady; and
added in a confidential undertone:
“A most extraordinary person--a most extraordinary _house_!... But I
"have always heard, my dear, that Bohemia was a strange country.... In"
"fact, Charlotte, it’s _rather_ thrilling, is it not?”"
aid. The thought of either was unendurable. I hated him—yet was
dependent on him.
"“To-night I met him, in his empty apartment, alone. I knew that he had"
"what was left of his money with him, that everything was packed up. I"
went prepared. I would not elope. My plan was no less than to make him
pay the balance on the necklace that he had lost—or to murder him.
"“I carried a new pistol in my muff, one which Lynn had just bought. I"
don’t know how I did it. I was desperate.
"“He told me he loved me, that Lynn did not, never had—that Lynn had"
"married me only to show off his wealth and diamonds, to give him a"
social! position—that I was merely a—a piece of property—a dummy.
“He tried to kiss me. It was revolting. I struggled away from him.
"“And in the struggle, the revolver fell from my muff and exploded on"
the floor.
“At once he was aflame with suspicion.
"“‘So—it’s murder you want!’ he shouted. ‘Well, murder it shall be!’"
“I saw death in his eye as he seized my arm. I was defenseless now. The
old passion came over him. Before he killed—he—would have his way with
me.
“I screamed. With a wild effort I twisted away from him.
"“He raised his hand to strike me, I saw his eyes, glassy. Then he sank"
back—fell to the floor—dead of apoplexy—dead of his furious emotions.
XXI
"The accident became widely known. Newspapermen came from the city, and"
Solem had to pilot them up the mountain and show them the spot where it
"had taken place. If the body had not been removed at once, they would have"
"written about that, too."
Children and ignoramuses might be inclined to think it foolish that Solem
"should be taken from the work in the fields at harvest time, but must not"
the business of the tourist resort go before all else?
"""Solem, tourists!"" someone called to him. And Solem left his work. A flock"
"of reporters surrounded him, asked him questions, made him take them to"
"the mountains, to the river. A phrase was coined at the farm for Solem's"
absences:
"""Solem's with death."""
"But Solem was by no means with death; on the contrary, he was in the very"
"midst of life, enjoying himself, thriving. Once again he was an important"
"personage, listened to by strangers, doling out information. Nor did his"
"audience now consist of ladies only--indeed, no; this was something new, a"
"change; these were keen, alert gentlemen from the city."
"To me, Solem said:"
"""Funny the accident should have happened just when the scratch on my nail"
"has grown out, isn't it?"""
all. 'And your gold chain is gone. I believe you have nothing but the
"frock you stand up in. Why, then, should I marry you?'"
"I felt her heart give a great leap under my hand, and a shiver ran"
"through her. But she did not raise her head, and I, who had thought to"
"tease her into looking at me, had to put back her little face till it"
gazed into mine.
'Why?' I said; 'why?'--drawing her closer and closer to me.
Then the colour came into her face like the sunlight itself. 'Because
"you love me,' she whispered, shutting her eyes."
And I did not gainsay her.
CHAPTER XXIV.
MISSING!
"We lay in the osier bed two whole days and a night, during which time"
"two at least of us were not unhappy, in spite of peril and hardship."
"We left it at last, only because our meagre provision gave out, and we"
"must move or starve. We felt far from sure that the danger was over,"
"for Steve, who spent the second day in a thick bush near the road, saw"
"two troops of horse go by; and others, we believed, passed in the"
night. But we had no choice. The neighbourhood was bleak and bare.
"Such small homesteads as existed had been eaten up, and lay abandoned."
"If we had felt inclined to venture out for food, none was to be had."
"""This idea is hopelessly haywire,"" Wilson said unhappily."
"""It sure is,"" said Space-Tech Maury Allison. ""But everything is, at"
"first."""
"""You hope to make something out of it?"""
"""We hope,"" replied Allison. ""We can't be sure."""
"""But surely this pile of junk has been tested before?"""
Allison nodded.
"""Any results?"""
"""Some. We've had as much as five minutes of constant operation out of"
"it."""
"As he spoke, the hemisphere over their heads flashed a full bright"
"green, then went black. A bell tinkled somewhere and a couple of techs"
dropped their tools and headed for the back room on the double. A
couple of others stood up from their work and lit cigarettes because
their instruments had gone dead. Some of the rest continued to nurse
their particular circuits because that section was still running.
[Illustration: The dome became a riot of flaming green.]
"After scanning the operation to see which section had gone blooey,"
"Allison went on. ""We've never tested this outfit under anything"
but ideal conditions. We've had spacecraft sent out to specified
"distances, fired up the gizmo and found fragments of response right"
"where there should be a response."""
Sidney he admired the girl's gameness though he was beginning to wish
they had not let her come.
"""How long do you think we'll have to wait? And what if no one comes?"""
"""We'll have to wait until most morning anyway before the tide is out."
"And if no one comes tonight we'll have to come out again, that's all."
"We're not in this business for any fun!"""
"""Oh--h!"" sighed Pola, clinging closer to Sidney."
The wind howled over their heads with increasing velocity and Sidney
thought involuntarily of the snugness of Miss Letty's buggy. Miss Letty
was probably almost to Truro now. And Aunt Achsa thought she was with
her!
"""Is--is the boat tied tight?"" asked Pola; and Lav assured her that it"
"was. ""The wind could get a lot worse and you'd be as safe out here as"
"in your bed at home."""
"After a long while Mart muttered, ""What's that?"" The others leaned"
forward in the blackness of the cabin. They had all felt rather than
heard a soft thud as though something had touched the side of the boat.
And in a few moments heavy footsteps came straight toward the fo'castle.
"""Oh, will they come _here_?"" breathed Pola, shaking. And for answer"
Sidney caught Pola's arm with a warning clutch.
For an instant it seemed that the footsteps must descend to the cabin.
"But at the companionway they halted. A voice came, heavy and thick."
"""I tell you it ain't safe to take it off now. They got a man on"
out. I have no more idea than you have.”
It could not have been more than twenty minutes later when Mrs. Moulton
"emerged rather hurriedly, and drove away."
While we had been waiting I had observed a man on the other side of the
"street who seemed unduly interested in the Recherche, too, for he had"
"walked up and down the block no less than six times. Kennedy saw him,"
"and as he made no effort to follow Mrs. Moulton, Kennedy did not do so"
either. In fact a little quick glance which she had given at our cab
had raised a fear that she might have discovered that she was being
followed.
Kennedy and I paid off our cabman and sauntered into the Recherche in
the most debonair manner we could assume.
"“Now, son, we’ll go up,” he said to the boy who, remembering us, and"
now not at all clear in his mind that he might not have seen us before
"that, whisked us to the tenth floor."
"“Let me see,” said Kennedy, “it’s number one hundred and—er——”"
"“Three,” prompted the boy."
He pressed the buzzer and a neatly dressed colored maid responded.
"“I had an appointment here with Mrs. Moulton this morning,” remarked"
Kennedy.
"“She has just gone,” replied the maid, off her guard."
"“And was to meet Mr. Schloss here in half an hour,” he added quickly."
"There was no one about, and a few children's faces at a window suddenly"
"disappeared. Everything here was small and poor, though only the barn was"
of peat; the house was a timbered fisherman's home. As I entered the
"house, I saw that though it was as poor within as without, the floor was"
clean and covered with pine twigs. There were many children here. The
mother was busy cooking something over the fire.
"I was offered a chair, and sitting down, began to chat with a couple of"
"small boys. As I was in no hurry and asked for nothing, the woman said:"
"""I expect you want a boat?"""
"""A boat?"" I said in my turn, for I had not come by boat on my last visit;"
I had walked instead over fjelds and valleys many miles from the sea.
"""Yes, why not?"" I said. ""But where does it go?"""
"""I thought you wanted a boat to go to the trading center,"" she replied,"
"""because that's where the steamer stops. We've rowed over lots of people"
"this year."""
Great changes here; the motor traffic in Stordalen must have completely
altered all the other traffic since my last visit ten months ago.
"""Where can I stop for a few days?"" I asked."
"""At the trading center, the other side of the islands. Or there's Eilert"
and Olaus; they're both on this side. You could go there; they've got big
"houses."""
"She showed me the two places on this side of the water, close to the"
"shore, and I proceeded thither."

"out safely, and are still waiting after eight days, we might as well"
"expect to be collected soon."""
"Charles Andrews said, from behind him, ""At a hundred dollars an hour,"
"Norton?"""
"Norton turned around angrily. ""So it's the hundred clams per,"" he"
"snapped back. ""That's damned poor payment for having to live with the"
"likes of you in a space can this cramped."""
"Andrews eyed the pilot with distaste. ""Tell me,"" he said smoothly,"
"""did my last effort on the pedal generator go for power storage, or"
for a couple of gallons of hot water for that shave and shower you've
"enjoyed?"""
"Norton stretched and stood up. ""I figured that having a clean face"
"might help morale,"" he said pointedly."
"""You're a cheap, chiseling--"""
"""Easy, Andrews! Easy. There's a lady present. Besides, I might forget"
"my easy-going nature and take a swing at you."""
"of veal, and he’s got a cute little round bald spot on the top of his"
head. And he wants to be dignified and speaks his words impressively.
"Say, Ned,” the boy continued, “I wouldn’t mind having that fellow get"
into some kind of a mixup out here!”
“Oh Lord! Oh Lord! Oh Lord!” cried the voice from the forest.
"“That’s Gilroy, all right enough!” Ned declared. “Why don’t you go down"
"and see what he wants, Jimmie?” he added."
"“Aw, he ain’t talking to me!” cried the boy."
"“Then I presume I’ll have to go,” Ned said, rising from his seat in"
front of the barrier. “Perhaps he’s been stung by a bee.”
"“He didn’t get crippled in his shrieker,” Jimmie suggested."
Ned stepped into the cave and secured an automatic revolver to replace
"the one taken from him at the old mission, and also passed one to"
Jimmie. Then the two hastened into the forest in the direction of the
sounds.
"The call for help continued to come, although the voice of the man came"
hoarser at every call. When the boys finally came close enough to
"distinguish words spoken in low tones, they heard a warning."
“Shoot!” he cried. “There’s a lot of bears under this tree!”
"Although convulsed with laughter, the boys moved more cautiously after"
this. At last they came to the pine from which the voice proceeded.
"There was a rustle in the thicket as they advanced, and they saw a black"
object shambling away.
"On the beach all the villagers are astir. The women, who have put on"
"their new grass petticoats (sevata'i) specially made for this occasion,"
enter the water and approach the canoes to unload them. No special
greetings pass between them and their husbands. They are interested
"in the food brought from Dobu, more especially in the sago."
People from other villages assemble also in great numbers to greet the
incoming party. Those who have supplied their friends or relatives
"with provisions for their journey, receive now sago, betel-nuts and"
coco-nuts in repayment. Some of the welcoming crowd have come in order
to make Kula. Even from the distant districts of Luba and Kiriwina
"natives will travel to Sinaketa, having a fair idea of the date of"
the arrival of the Kula party from Dobu. The expedition will be talked
"over, the yield counted, the recent history of the important valuables"
described. But this stage leads us already into the subject of inland
"Kula, which will form the subject of one of the following chapters."
CHAPTER XVI
THE RETURN VISIT OF THE DOBUANS TO SINAKETA
I
interpret it.
"Steve rode by me, and his face too was moody. I suppose that we should"
all of us have thanked God the peril was past. But my lady rode in
another part with Count Leuchtenstein and the Waldgrave; and Steve
"yearned, I fancy, for the old days of trouble and equality, when there"
was no one to come between us.
"I saw Count Hugo that night. He sent for me to his quarters at Hesel,"
and told me frankly that he would have let me go back had he thought
good could come of it.
"'But it would have been looking for a needle in a bundle of hay, my"
"friend,' he continued. 'Tzerclas' men would have picked you up, or the"
"peasants killed you for a soldier, and in a month perhaps the girl"
"would have returned safe and sound, to find you dead.'"
"'My lord!' I cried passionately, 'she saved your child. It was to her"
as her own!'
"'I know it,' he answered with gravity, which of itself rebuked me."
'And where is my child?'
I shook my head.
'Yet I do not give up my work and the task God and the times have
"given me, and go out looking for it!' he answered severely. 'Leaving"
"Scot, and Swede, and Pole, and Switzer to divide my country. For"
"shame! You have your work too, and it lies by your lady's side. See to"
"it that you do it. For the rest I have scouts out, who know the"
country; if I learn anything through them you shall hear it. And now
"of another matter. How long has the Waldgrave been like this, my"
"name is Villiers. Mr. Alwyn is my guest,--but he is at present very"
"much occupied,--and unless your business is extremely urgent..."""
"""Certainly it is urgent""--said the lady decisively.. ""otherwise I"
"should not have come. And so you are NOT Mr. Alwyn! Well, I thought you"
"couldn't be! Now then, will you have the kindness to tell Mr. Alwyn I"
"am here?"""
"By this time Villiers had recovered his customary self-possession, and"
he met her commanding glance with a somewhat defiant coolness.
"""I am not aware to whom I have the honor of speaking,"" he said"
"frigidly. ""Perhaps you will oblige me with your name?"""
"""My name doesn't in the least matter,"" she replied calmly--""though I"
will tell you afterward if you wish. But you don't seem to understand
"I..._I_ am 'Tiger-Lily'!"""
The situation was becoming ludicrous. Villiers felt strongly disposed
to laugh.
"""I'm afraid I am very ignorant!""--he said, with a humorous sparkle in"
"his blue eyes,--""But really I am quite in the dark as to your meaning."
"Will you explain?"""
"The lady's nose grew deeper of tint, and the look she shot at him had"
quite a killing vindictiveness. With evident difficulty she forced a
smile.
"""Oh, you MUST have heard of me!""--she declared, with a ponderous"
"attempt at playfulness--""You read the papers, don't you?"""
red glow illumined the sky.
"The two men looked at each other, grimly, soberly."
"""We're here,"" said Dex, flexing the muscles of his powerful arms."
"""We are,"" said Brand, patting the gun in his holster."
The rapid dusk of the giant planet began to close in on them. The thin
"sunlight darkened; and with its lowering, the red spot of Jupiter"
"glared more luridly ahead of them. Silently the two men gazed at it,"
and wondered what it held.
"They shot the space ship toward it, and halted a few hundred miles"
"away. Watery white light from the satellites, ""that jitter around in"
"the sky like a bunch of damned waterbugs,"" as Dex put it, was now the"
sole illumination.
"They hung motionless in their space shell, to wait through the"
five-hour Jovian night for the succeeding five hours of daylight to
"illumine a slow cruise over the red area that, in less than a year,"
had swallowed up three of Earth's space ships. And ever as they
"waited, dozing a little, speculating as to the nature of the danger"
"they faced, the peep, peep of the radio shrilled in their ears to tell"
them that there was still a connection--though a very tenuous
one--with their mother planet.
*       *       *       *       *
"""Red spot ten miles away,"" said Brand in the transmitter. ""We're"
"approaching it slowly."""
“There’s Gilroy’s flock of bears!” Jimmie shouted.
"“And a little bit of a black bear at that,” Ned laughed. “If Gilroy had"
"made an ugly face at him, he’d have run away!”"
The tree into which the fat confidential clerk had climbed was not a
"large one. In fact, it was swaying dangerously under his weight. As he"
"moved his position at sight of the black back of the bear, the slender"
upshoot to which he clung gave way and he came clattering down through
the few lower branches.
“Oh my! oh my! oh my!” he shouted. “I never should have come into this
blasted country! I shall be eaten alive!”
"Instead of rushing to Gilroy’s assistance, his rescuers, boy-like, sat"
down on the mat of pine needles which strewed the ground and roared with
laughter. Gilroy eyed them angrily without attempting to rise to his
feet. His rage only made the scene more amusing.
“Why didn’t you shoot him?” he demanded at length.
“Shoot him?” repeated Jimmie. “That bear is a great deal more frightened
"than you are. At the rate of speed he’s now going, he’ll strike the"
arctic circle at exactly four-fifteen tomorrow morning!”
"“He chased me up the tree,” whined Gilroy. “He nipped at my heels as I"
"left the ground, and I heard his teeth grinding together in the most"
frightful manner. I’ll never get over this!”
“I guess he would have climbed the tree after you in about another
"minute,” Jimmie declared, with a sly wink at Ned. “You see, it’s just"
Thus spoke the brave who was born and reared in the wigwams of the
tribe of the Manhattans.
"The girl, after leaving her entertainer, sped swiftly cross-town until"
"she arrived at a handsome and sedate mansion two squares to the east,"
facing on that avenue which is the highway of Mammon and the auxiliary
gods. Here she entered hurriedly and ascended to a room where a
handsome young lady in an elaborate house dress was looking anxiously
out the window.
"“Oh, you madcap!” exclaimed the elder girl, when the other entered."
“When will you quit frightening us this way? It is two hours since you
ran out in that rag of an old dress and Marie’s hat. Mamma has been so
"alarmed. She sent Louis in the auto to try to find you. You are a bad,"
thoughtless Puss.”
"The elder girl touched a button, and a maid came in a moment."
"“Marie, tell mamma that Miss Marian has returned.”"
"“Don’t scold, sister. I only ran down to Mme. Theo’s to tell her to use"
mauve insertion instead of pink. My costume and Marie’s hat were just
"what I needed. Every one thought I was a shopgirl, I am sure.”"
"“Dinner is over, dear; you stayed so late.”"
“I know. I slipped on the sidewalk and turned my ankle. I could not
"walk, so I hobbled into a restaurant and sat there until I was better."
That is why I was so long.”
"The two girls sat in the window seat, looking out at the lights and the"
"""Oh, that's all right,"" said Larsen, carelessly. ""Him and me used to"
"fish together."" And as if this were a sufficient explanation, he turned"
"back to his conversation, leaving Emerson to proceed on his way,"
"vaguely displeased at the episode, yet reflecting that heretofore he"
had never had occasion to doubt Larsen's loyalty.
"He found Cherry at home, and, flinging himself into one of her"
"easy-chairs, relieved his mind of the day's occurrences."
"""Marsh is building those traps purely out of spite,"" she declared,"
"indignantly, when he had finished. ""He doesn't need any more fish--he"
"has plenty of traps farther up the river."""
"""To be sure! It looks as if we might have to depend upon the"
"gill-netters."""
"""We will know before long. If the fish strike in where George expects,"
"Marsh will be out a pretty penny."""
"""And if they don't strike in where George expects, we will be out all"
"the expense of building that trap."""
"""Exactly! It's a fascinating business, isn't it? It's a business in"
which the unexpected is forever happening. But the stakes are high
"and--I know you will succeed."""
"Boyd smiled at her comforting assurance, her belief in him was always"
stimulating.
"""By-the-way,"" she continued, ""have you heard the historic story about"
"the pink salmon?"""
that did not feel--a happy world!
She had not long to wait before he tapped on the drawing-room window.
She got up from the tea-table to let him in.  Why do faces gazing in
"through glass from darkness always look hungry--searching, appealing for"
what you have and they have not?  And while she was undoing the latch she
thought: 'What am I going to say?  I feel nothing!'  The ardour of his
"gaze, voice, hands seemed to her so false as to be almost comic; even"
more comically false his look of disappointment when she said:
"""Please take care; I'm still brittle!""  Then she sat down again and"
asked:
"""Will you have some tea?"""
"""Tea!  I have you back, and you ask me if I will have tea Gyp!  Do you"
know what I have felt like all this time?  No; you don't know. You know
"nothing of me--do you?"""
A smile of sheer irony formed on her lips--without her knowing it was
there.  She said:
"""Have you had a good time at Count Rosek's?""  And, without her will,"
"against her will, the words slipped out: ""I'm afraid you've missed the"
"music-room!"""
His stare wavered; he began to walk up and down.
"""Missed!  Missed everything!  I have been very miserable, Gyp. You've no"
"idea how miserable.  Yes, miserable, miserable, miserable!""  With each"
"repetition of that word, his voice grew gayer.  And kneeling down in"
"front of her, he stretched his long arms round her till they met behind"
blow he could.
"""I know some people are very ready to be at his feet,"" he said, with a"
sneering smile.
His shaft hit the mark. Alicia flushed and sat speechless. A glance at
Lady Eynesford's face told him the scene had lasted too long: he rose
"and took his leave, paying Alicia the homage of a bow, but not seeking"
"her hand. She took no notice of his salute, and Lady Eynesford only"
"gasped ""Good-bye."""
The two sat silent for some moments after he had gone; then Lady
"Eynesford remarked,"
"""Were you mad, Alicia? See what you laid yourself open to! Oh, of course"
"a gentleman wouldn't have said it, but you yourself didn't treat him as"
"if he was a gentleman. Really, I can make a great deal of allowance for"
"him. Your manner was inexcusable."""
Alicia did not attempt to defend herself.
"""You are out of temper,"" continued her sister-in-law, ""and you choose to"
hit the first person within reach; if you can do that you care nothing
for my dignity or your own self-respect. You parade your--your interest
"in this man----"""
"""I shall never speak to him again."""
"""I'm glad to hear it, and, if you come into my drawing-room, I will"
"thank you to behave yourself properly and be civil to my guests,"" and"
Lady Eynesford walked out of the room.
"That added the last straw. She took two steps to the table, and"
"sitting down blindly, covered her face with her hands. Her shoulders"
"began to tremble, her head sank lower and lower on the table. Her"
pride was gone.
'Heaven help us!' she whispered in a passion of grief. 'Heaven help
"us, for there is no help here!'"
"'That is better,' he said, eyeing her coldly. 'We shall soon come to"
terms now.'
In his exultation he went a step nearer to her. He was about to touch
"her--to lay his hand on her hair, believing his evil victory won, when"
suddenly two dark figures rose like shadows behind her chair. He
"recoiled, dropping his hand. In a moment a pistol barrel was thrust"
into his face. He fell back another step.
'One word and you are a dead man!' a stern voice hissed in his ear.
"Then he saw another barrel gleam in the lamplight, and he stood still."
"'What is this?' he said, looking from one to the other, his voice"
trembling with rage.
'Justice!' the same speaker answered harshly. 'But stand still and be
"silent, and you shall have your life. Give the alarm, and you die,"
"general, though we die the next minute. Sit down in that chair.'"
"He hesitated. But the two shining barrels converging on his head, the"
"two grim faces behind them, were convincing; in a moment he obeyed."
"""Mart!"" she cried. ""It's _not_ Jed Starrow! It's--it's--Cap'n Phin"
"Davies! And that means that--_Lav_--_made_--_it_!"" And happy tears ran"
down her cheeks.
Under the skilled guidance of the man at its wheel the _Sally_ soon
came alongside of the _Arabella_. Cap'n Davies promptly boarded the
schooner and the next instant Sidney was in his arms.
"""All I'll say is praise be to God!"" the old mariner muttered. ""And now"
I cal'late you and your mates here are 'bout ready to abandon your
"cruisin'--"""
"""Lav, is he--all right?"" demanded Sidney, still clinging to Cap'n Phin."
"""Well, he jest about made port and how he is now I can't say for I"
didn't waste any time shippin' in the _Sally_. Lucky for us it was
"lyin' there at Rockman's. Give us a hand, Saunders, while we load on"
"this cargo of distress!"" A roughness in the old man's voice betrayed"
that the big heart was not as light as he would have the girls think.
For hours they had searched the bay with only their knowledge of tides
and winds to guide them; more than once the others had been ready to
"abandon the search as futile, but the Captain had held them stubbornly"
to it.
Pola needed no urging but leaped into the _Sally_ and sank to its
bottom with a long gasp of relief. Sidney and Mart were about to follow
her example when a word from Cap'n Davies held Sidney.
"""We'll let a government boat pick up the _Arabella_. We'll take no"
"chances tryin' to tow her in with the _Sally_."" And then Sidney thought"
of the treasure.
"A door opened, and through it (though dimly) Rollo could see the great"
"waterfall glimmering and above the stars, chill over the snowy shoulder"
"of Peñalara. He could not make out who had opened the door, but there"
was enough light to discern that a lady wrapped in a mantilla went out
"first. Then followed another, stouter and of shorter stature, apparently"
carrying a burden. Then the whole doorway was obscured by the tall
figure of a man.
"""Muñoz himself, by Heaven!"" thought Rollo."
"And with a leap he was after him, in his headlong course dashing to the"
ground some other unseen person who confronted him in the hall.
In a moment more he had caught the tall man by the collar and swung him
impetuously round back within the doorway.
"""Move one sole inch and your blood be on your own head!"" he muttered."
"And the captive feeling Rollo's steel cold at his throat, remained"
prudently silent. Not so the lady without. She uttered a cry which rang
about the silent château.
"""Muñoz! My husband! Fernando, where art thou? Oh, they have slain him,"
"and I only am to blame!"""
"She turned about and rushed back to the door, which she was about to"
"enter, when a cry far more sudden and terrible rang out behind her."
"""_They have killed the Princess! Some one hath slain my darling!_"""
"At the word Rollo abandoned the man whom he was holding down, and with"
"shouts of ""Cardono!"" ""El Sarria!"" ""To me! They are upon us!"" he flung"
"such Regulations as may from Time to Time be made, by order in Council,"
as to the Custody and Disposal of Money so paid.

"Finally, however, the nature of the battle changed. The tallest of the"

weaving tall bodies surrounding the two opened and became a U. The
"creatures in the curve of the U raised their shock-tubes and, with"
"none of their own kind behind the victims to share in its discharge,"
released whatever power it was that lurked in them.
The shock was terrific. Without the glass and metal of the ship to
"protect them, out in the open and defenceless, Brand and Dex got some"
indication of its real power.
"Writhing and twitching, feeling as though pierced by millions of red"
"hot needles, they went down. A swarm of pipe-like bodies smothered"
"them, and the fight was over."

"“No,” he said, with an asperity directed towards the disinvited guest."
“We shall dine alone to-night.”
"But his tone made Yvonne’s heart give a great throb, and she turned to"
him quickly.
“Has anything happened?”
"“A great deal,” said the Canon."
"Where he stood in the dusk of the doorway, the shadow accentuated the"
stern lines of his face and deepened the sombreness of his glance. His
brows were bent in perplexities of repugnance. It was horrible to demand
"of her such explanations. To Yvonne’s scared fancy, his brows seemed"
bent in accusation. That was the pity of it. For a few seconds they
"looked at one another, the Canon severely, Yvonne in throbbing suspense."
“What?” she asked at length.
"He paused for a moment, then threw his hat and the crumpled Visitors’"
List on to the table and plunged into the heart of things--but not
before Yvonne had glanced at the paper with a sudden pang of intuition.

"""Because I did not know,"" I answered, hardly able to believe the truth."
"But we had important business before us, and I knew that we should"
"prepare for it before Lilly came in. So George, Bettina, Frances, and"
I went to a window at the far end of the room to hold a consultation.
"""Since I did not recognize you, perhaps Lilly will not,"" I suggested. ""I"
"trust the Doctor, but perhaps we had better leave him under the"
impression that you are Monsieur l'Abbé du Boise and give no intimation
"of the truth."""
"""I had not hoped that my disguise would deceive you, Baron Ned,"" said"
"George, ""but since it has, it is just as well that we leave Lilly in the"
"dark if we can."""
"""But he will know. The stars will tell him,"" suggested Bettina, opening"
her eyes very wide.
"""The stars will tell him what he is paid to hear,"" I remarked. Then"
"turning to Frances, I asked, ""How is it that you were able to recognize"
"him?"""
"""By his eyes!"" exclaimed Frances and Bettina in concert."
"""That gives me a valuable hint,"" said George, hastily adjusting his"
"colored spectacles. ""Now, how about it?"""
"As he walked, he thought again about the new rumor he'd heard in the"
commissary at lunch. Gossip kept the Soviet staff going--an instinct
from the old days--but this one just might be true. Some lower-level
staffers even claimed they'd seen him. The Chief.
Word was Tanzan Mino himself--none other than the CEO of the Daedalus
"Corporation--had flown in this morning, together with his personal"
bodyguards and aides. The story was he wanted hands-on control of the
"first hypersonic test flight, wanted to be calling the shots in Flight"
Control when _Daedalus I _made history.
Finally. The Big Man has decided to show his face.
"""Yuri Andreevich, just a minute. Slow down."""
He recognized the voice immediately and glanced around to see Nikolai
"Vasilevich Grishkov, the portly Soviet chief mechanic, just emerging"
from the West Quadrant. His bushy eyebrows hung like a pair of Siberian
musk-ox horns above his gleaming dark eyes.
"""Have you seen her?"" Grishkov was shuffling toward him."
"""Seen who?"" He examined the mechanic's spotless white coveralls. Jesus!"
"Even the support crews on this project were all sanitized, high-tech."
"""The new woman. _Kracevia, moi droog. Ochen kracevia_. Beautiful beyond"
"words. And she is important. You can tell just by looking."""
"""Nikolai, there's never been a woman in this facility."" He laughed and"
"continued on toward Security. ""It's worse than a goddam troop ship."
"You've finally started hallucinating from lack of _pezdyonka_."""
"""Ha, ha, ha, ha!"" laughed the other sprout."
"Yes, truly, they had acquired dashing ways among their sporting"
acquaintances.
"It rained for three weeks; then came two fine days, and then rain again"
"for a fortnight. The sun was not to be seen, the sky was invisible, the"
mountain tops had disappeared; we saw nothing but rain. The roofs at the
Tore Peak resort began to leak more and more.
"The hay that still lay spread on the ground was black and rotting, and the"
stacks had gone moldy.
The cotters had got their hay indoors during the patient spell. They had
"carried it, man, woman, and child, on their backs."
The men from Bergen and Mrs. Brede with her children have left for home.
The little girls curtsied and thanked me for taking them walking in the
hills and telling them stories. The house is empty now. Associate Master
"Höy and Mrs. Molie were the last to go; they left last week, traveling"
"separately, though both were going to the same small town."
He went by way of the village--a very roundabout route--while she crossed
"the field. It is very quiet now, but Miss Torsen is still here."
Why do I not leave? Don't know. Why ask? I'm here. Have you ever heard
"anyone ask: ""How much is a northern light?"" Hold your tongue."
Where should I go if I did leave? Do you imagine I want to go to the town
"again? Or do you think I'm longing for my old hut and the winter, and"
Madame? I'm not longing for any specific place; I am simply longing.
and the miracle of children’s being born from their mothers. The other
miracles I do not believe in. What for? They are so insignificant beside
the works of Nature!”
"“He is a pagan,” Kennedy again stated."
_YOUNG PAINTERS_
"They were chatting, when three young lads came into the tavern, all"
"three having the air of artists, black clothes, soft hats, flowing"
"cravats, long hair, and pipes. “Two of them are fellow-countrymen of"
"yours,” Kennedy told Cæsar."
"“They are Spanish painters,” the old man added. “The other is a sculptor"
"who has been in the Argentine, and he talks Spanish too.”"
The three entered and sat down at the same table and were introduced to
"Cæsar. Everybody chattered. Buonacossi, the Italian, was a real type."
"Of very low stature, he had a giant’s torso and strong little legs. His"
"head was like a woe-begone eagle, his nose hooked, thin, and reddish,"
"eyes round, and hair black."
"Buonacossi proved to be gay, exuberant, changeable, and full of"
vehemence.
"He explained his artistic ideas with picturesque warmth, mingling them"
with blasphemies and curses. Things struck him as the best or the worst
in the world. For him there doubtless were no middle terms.
"One of the two Spaniards was serious, grave, jaundiced, sour-visaged,"
"""Oh, well...."" she said. ""No, let's not tonight,"" she added suddenly;"
"""some other time. Yes? In a few days? We'll talk about it tomorrow. Good"
"night."""
"For the first time it struck me: she wants to rouse you, too, settled man"
though you are; she wants to make you as mad as the others! That's what
she's after!
"And now I remember, before the lawyer arrived, when there was Tradesman"
"Batt--I remember how during his first few days here, she would give me a"
"kind word or a look that was quite out of the picture, and as unmistakable"
"as her pride would permit. No, she had no objections to seeing old age"
wriggle. And listen to this: before this she had been intent to show a
"well-behaved indifference to sex, but that was finished; was she not at"
"this moment resisting only faintly, and raising definite hopes? ""Not"
"tonight, but some other time,"" she had said. Yes, a half-refusal, a mere"
"postponement, that I was meant to hear. She was corrupt, but she was also"
"cunning, with the cunning of a madman. So corrupt."
"Dear child, Pharaoh laughs before his pyramids; standing before his"
"pyramids he laughs. He would laugh at me, too."

Next day we three remaining guests were sitting in the living room. The
lady and the actor read one book; I read another.
"""Will you,"" she says to him, ""do me a great favor?"""
"""With pleasure."""
"""Take it easy,"" said Wilson, half-smiling."
"""Well, sir, we've been getting a lot of interference."""
Wilson looked up at the flickering dome. He merely nodded.
"""Well, sir--er--I was wondering if you could issue some--er--order to"
have the other ships move away? I'm sure we could find those lifeships
"if the rest of space were clear. But you've got three hundred--"""
"Wilson stared the youngster down coldly. ""Somewhere out there,"" he said"
"sourly, ""are two lifeships in which men, and a woman, are waiting for"
us to come and collect 'em. I'm combing space almost inch by inch. I
can hardly give up my squadron for a half-finished flash in the dome
"like this, can I?"""
"""No sir--ah--I suppose not."""
"""Then you live with the responses tossed back by my squadron. It'll be"
"good training for you. Er--get the hell out of my way!"""
The junior tech melted out of sight and went back to his control panel.
Weston came over within the hour. Ted Wilson explained the situation
and told Hugh to set up and measure the coordinates with respect to
the stellar centers. Then he told him to send a space scooter out to
investigate that spot.
Wilson went back to his own flagship wondering whether that fancy
infrawave detector would turn out to be anything. An untried doodad.
But now and then--
"RAYNER, CAPTAIN."
"In a letter to the Lords of Trade, dated from Philadelphia, February 28th,"
"1701, William Penn mentions that several of Captain Kidd's men had settled"
as planters in Carolina with Rayner as their captain.
"RAYNOR, WILLIAM."
One of Captain John Quelch's crew. Tried at Boston in 1704.
"READ, CAPTAIN."
Commanded a brigantine which had its headquarters at Madagascar. Rescued
the pirate Thomas White. Read died at sea.
"READ, MARY. Woman pirate."
Born in London of obscure parentage; all that is known for certain is that
"her mother was a ""young and airy widow."" Mary was brought up as a boy, and"
at the age of 13 was engaged as a footboy to wait on a French lady. Having
"a roving spirit, Mary ran away and entered herself on board a man-of-war."
"Deserting a few years later, she enlisted in a regiment of foot and fought"
"in Flanders, showing on all occasions great bravery, but quitted the"
service to enlist in a regiment of horse. Her particular comrade in this
"regiment was a Fleming, with whom she fell in love and disclosed to him"
"the secret of her sex. She now dressed as a woman, and the two troopers"
"were married, ""which made a great noise,"" and several of her officers"
attended the nuptials. She and her husband got their discharge and kept an
"eating house or ordinary, the Three Horseshoes, near the Castle of Breda."
"We went down into the road on foot, a little party of nine--four women"
"and five men. The horsemen, as they came up, looked at us in wonder."
"Our clothes, even my lady's, were dyed with mud and torn in a score of"
"places. We had not washed for days, and our faces were lean with"
famine. Some of the women were shoeless and had their hair about their
"ears, while Steve was bare-headed and bare-armed, and looked so huge a"
ruffian the stocks must have yawned for him anywhere. They drew up and
"gazed at us, and then Count Hugo came riding down the column and saw"
us.
"My lady went forward a step. 'Count Leuchtenstein,' she said, her"
"voice breaking; she had only seen him once, and then under the mask of"
"a plain name. But he was safety, honour, life now, and I think that"
she could have kissed him. I think for a little she could have fallen
into his arms.
"'Countess!' he said, as he sprang from his horse in wonder. 'Is it"
really you? Gott im Himmel! These are strange times. Waldgrave! Your
pardon. Ach! Have you come on foot?'
"'Not I. But these brave men have,' my lady answered, tears in her"
voice.
He looked at Steve and grunted. Then he looked at me and his eyes
lightened. 'Are these all your party?' he said hurriedly.
"'All,' my lady answered in a low voice. He did not ask farther, but he"
"sighed, and I knew that he had looked for his child. 'I came north"
"upon a reconnaissance, and was about to turn,' he said. 'I am thankful"
that I did not turn before. Is Tzerclas in pursuit of you?'
men.
*       *       *       *       *
"Brand stared sympathetically at her. ""They treat them very badly?"" he"
asked gently.
"""Terribly! Terribly!"" said Greca, shuddering again."
"""But you seem quite privileged,"" he could not help saying."
"She shook her dainty head pathetically. ""I am of high rank among my"
"people. I am a priestess of our religion, which is the religion of The"
"Great White One who rules all the sky everywhere. The Rogans"" (it was"
the best translation Brand could make of her mental term for the slimy
"tall things that held them captive) ""--the Rogans hold my fate over"
"the heads of my race. Should they rebel, I would be thrown to the"
monster in the pen. Of course the Rogans could crush any revolt with
"their terrible tubes, but they do not want to kill their slaves if"
they can help it. They find it more effective to hold their
"priestesses in hostage."""
Brand turned from personal history to more vital subjects.
"""Why,"" he asked Greca, ""are the shining red squares of metal laid"
"everywhere over this empire of the Rogans?"""
"""To make things light,"" was the reply. ""When the Rogans first came to"
"this mighty sphere, they could hardly move. Things are so heavy here,"
somehow. So their first thought was to drive my enslaved people to the
casting and laying of the metal squares and the metal beams that
"connect them, in order to make things weigh less."""
“What is it?” I asked eagerly.
"“A burglar’s microphone,” he answered, hastily looking over the"
contents of the safe. “The microphone is now used by burglars for
"picking combination locks. When you turn the lock, a slight sound is"
made when the proper number comes opposite the working point. It can be
"heard sometimes by a sensitive ear, although it is imperceptible to"
most persons. But by using a microphone it is an easy matter to hear
the sounds which allow of opening the lock.”
He had taken a yellow chamois bag out of the safe and opened it.
Inside sparkled the famous Moulton diamonds. He held them up—in all
their wicked brilliancy. No one spoke.
"Then he took another yellow bag, more dirty and worn than the first. As"
"he opened it, Mrs. Moulton could restrain herself no longer."
“The replica!” she cried. “The replica!”
"Without a word, Craig handed the real necklace to her. Then he slipped"
the paste jewels into the newer of the bags and restored both it and
"the empty one to their places, banged shut the door of the safe, and"
replaced the wooden screen.
"“Quick!” he said to her, “you have still a minute to get away."
Hurry—anywhere—away—only away!”
"The look of gratitude that came over her face, as she understood the"
full meaning of it was such as I had never seen before.
Lavender pulled up alongside of the _Arabella_ and deliberately made
the boat fast.
"""We got to act as though we haven't found the knife, y'see,"" he warned."
"""As though we were going just swimming."""
In her eagerness to board the _Arabella_ Sidney stumbled. Lavender had
to clutch her to keep her from tumbling into the water.
"""Oh!"" They both cried in one sound as they clambered to the deck--for"
the knife was gone!
"""Well, _that_ means they'd been on the _Arabella_. Jed Starrow dropped"
"that knife and he missed it and came back to look for it!"""
"""Lav, I believe they've hidden their treasure on the _Arabella_!"""
Sidney still reverted to the more romantic terms of buccaneering.
"""Let's look for it now!"""
"""With 'em watching maybe from the _Puritan_? I guess not. We got to go"
"ahead and swim the way we always do, Sid. Don't let's even appear to be"
"talking about anything. Come on, I'll beat you in!"""
For the space of the few minutes while the water closed about her with
delicious coolness Sidney forgot everything in an intoxication of
delight. Presently she came back to the _Arabella_ and climbed aboard
"with a sigh of utter content. ""Thank goodness _I_ haven't any"
"complexes,"" she laughed, shaking the salt drops from her bobbed head."
"""And now what?"""
Lavender pulled on the light sweater he had worn over his bathing suit.
"“What kind of a lady was Miss Sprowls—in looks, I mean?”"
"“Why, black-haired, sir, short, and stout, with a comical face. They"
left a week ago Tuesday.”
“And before they occupied it?”
"“Why, there was a single gentleman connected with the draying business."
He left owing me a week. Before him was Missis Crowder and her two
"children, that stayed four months; and back of them was old Mr. Doyle,"
whose sons paid for him. He kept the room six months. That goes back a
"year, sir, and further I do not remember.”"
He thanked her and crept back to his room. The room was dead. The
essence that had vivified it was gone. The perfume of mignonette had
"departed. In its place was the old, stale odour of mouldy house"
"furniture, of atmosphere in storage."
"The ebbing of his hope drained his faith. He sat staring at the yellow,"
singing gaslight. Soon he walked to the bed and began to tear the
sheets into strips. With the blade of his knife he drove them tightly
into every crevice around windows and door. When all was snug and taut
"he turned out the light, turned the gas full on again and laid himself"
gratefully upon the bed.
It was Mrs. McCool’s night to go with the can for beer. So she fetched
it and sat with Mrs. Purdy in one of those subterranean retreats where
house-keepers foregather and the worm dieth seldom.
"“I rented out my third floor, back, this evening,” said Mrs. Purdy,"
almost a cry for help. She was growing old and soured and worn by
"perpetual conjugal wranglings. John, her kinsman, counted for a great"
deal in a life none too rich. John and Stella were nearest to her in the
"world--first Stella, naturally, then John. To the woman of over fifty"
the man of under thirty is still a boy. For many years she had nursed
the two together in her heart. And now he was going from her. What
"would she, what would Stella, do without him? Her husband's direct"
interpellation aroused her from her reverie.
"“Julia, what was the name of the chap we met in St. Kitts who had been"
sheep-farming in Queensland?”
They had sailed away from St. Kitts in 1878. Lady Blount reminded
him tartly of the fact while professing her oblivion of the man from
Queensland. They sparred for a few moments. Then she rose wearily and
said she was going to bed. Sir Oliver looked at his watch.
“Nearly twelve. Time for us all to go.”
"“As soon as I' ve written my morning letter to Stellamaris,” said"
Herold.
"“I must write, too,” said Risca."
For it was a rule of the house that every visitor should write
"Stellamaris a note overnight, to be delivered into her hands the first"
thing in the morning. The origin of the rule was wrapped in the mists of
history.
So John Risca sat down at Sir Oliver's study-table in order to indite
his letter to Stellamaris. But for a long time he stared at the white
"paper. He, the practised journalist, who could dash off his thousand"
worth while to add that the next suite was his own.
"""A thousand pardons,"" repeated M. Dubois, very penitently. ""I am too"
stupid! But mademoiselle will perhaps be so gracious as to forgive me
"this time."""
"He bowed to Sallie again and to Slyne, and disappeared, sharply scanning"
the latter's face to the last.
"""Who's that son of a sea-cook?"" snapped Captain Dove, and Mr. Jobling"
looked wanly up out of one eye.
"""A French detective,"" Slyne answered reflectively. But Sallie felt sure"
"that he was afraid of M. Dubois, and wondered why."
"""Well, he has nothing against me that I'm aware of,"" the old man"
"declared. ""And now--what about this wire? Does it mean that some other"
fellow has scooped the pool--and that I've had all my trouble for
"nothing, eh?"" He clenched his fist again and shook it in the lawyer's"
face.
"""No, no,"" gasped Mr. Jobling. ""Don't be so hasty. It makes no difference"
"at all, now that we have Lady Josceline with us. I told you that the"
"American, Carthew, is of no account against her--and how he has ever"
"cropped up again I can't conceive. In any case--"""
"""In any case, you'd better be off to your room and ring for a bit of"
"beefsteak to doctor that eye with,"" Slyne interposed in a tone of"
intense annoyance.
"""And I wish to goodness, Dove!"" he added savagely, ""that you would"
"behave a little more like a reasonable human being and less--"""
"""I do not speak of these men, I am thinking of Judas Petunikoff, who is"
"one of them...."""
"""And you say you have nothing to do with them?"" asks the teacher,"
quietly.
"""But do you think that I do not live?  Aha!  I do live, but I suppose I"
ought not to be angry at the fact that life is desecrated and robbed of
"all freedom by these men."""
"""And they dare to laugh at the kindly anger of the Captain, a man"
"living in retirement?"" says Abyedok, teasingly."
"""Very well!  I agree with you that I am foolish.  Being a creature who"
"was once a man, I ought to blot out from my heart all those feelings"
"that once were mine.  You may be right, but then how could I or any of"
"you defend ourselves if we did away with all these feelings?"""
"""Now then, you are talking sense,"" says the teacher, encouragingly."
"""We want other feelings and other views on life.... We want something"
"new ... because we ourselves are a novelty in this life...."""
"""Doubtless this is most important for us,"" remarks the teacher."
"""Why?"" asks Kanets.  ""Is it not all the same whatever we say or think?"
"We have not got long to live ...  I am forty, you are fifty ... there"
"is no one among us younger than thirty, and even at twenty one cannot"
"live such a life long."""
"""And what kind of novelty are we?"" asked Abyedok, mockingly."
"The boys remained perfectly silent, then, and listened. There seemed to"
"be several men in the chamber below, and two were talking in angry"
"tones. There were plenty of torches below, too, for the red flare and"
the stink of them came into the boys’ hiding place by way of the
fire-niche below. This is what the boys heard:
"“You can see for yourself, Huga,” a voice which Ned recognized as that"
"of Toombs, was saying, “that the boy is not here.”"
“But I am certain I heard footsteps running in this direction when I
stood in the darkness before you men came in!” Huga answered. “He must
be in this chamber somewhere.”
“Look for yourself!” Toombs advised crossly.
“Isn’t there some hiding place in the walls?” asked Huga.
"Ned nudged Jimmie as they heard this, and both moved farther back in the"
hiding place. It will be understood how intently they listened for the
next sentence.
"“You ought to know that,” Toombs answered; “you are supposed to know all"
"about this old mission, while I am fresh from Wall street.”"
“I have never heard of any secret passage or room in this part of the
"excavation,” the half-breed replied."
“Then stop arguing that the boy is here!” roared Toombs.
"Huga made no reply, but the boys heard him poking about in the"
fireplace. Presently a light flashed into the chimney.
"assistance were indispensable; and to others, too numerous to mention,"
who in any way facilitated the completion of the work.
"The book, written during spare moments of a busy pastorate, is sent"
"forth with the prayer that, in spite of errors and imperfections, it may"
inspire all who use it to sing with greater devotion the praises of Him
who loved us and redeemed us.

The patrolman wanted to believe. He most pathetically wanted to believe.
"""Honest?"""
"""It's the God's honest truth. No man could have stood in front of that"
killer and pulled a trigger. He's a master hypnotist. You're all right.
We won't say a word about what happened in here. And you'll have no
"trouble in the future."""
"The patrolman shook his head. ""Still, I gotta do something about it."""
"""Talk to your psychiatrist,"" Taber said. ""In the meantime, keep that"
"crowd out there from spilling in here."""
Taber pushed out through the choked entrance to the areaway and went
back up the street. It was alive with activity now and he passed
unnoticed. No one recognized him as the man who had given chase in the
bloody business that would make headlines that evening in every New York
newspaper.
And yet the radio and TV news commentators gave it no special attention.
It went in along with other items of the day's news as a more or less
routine big-city happening.
"One national-hookup headliner stated: ""In New York City today, a man"
"identified as John Dennis, address unknown, went berserk in a"
"fashionable Upper East Side apartment. Dennis, wielding a knife, killed"
"a man and a woman, and seriously wounded another man before he was cut"
down by police bullets.
"""A jet airliner, down in the North Atlantic today, imperiled the lives"
"uprooting of all your habits,” said he, in a softened voice."
"She smiled. “I can bring them with me,” she said cheerfully. “You won't"
"mind Dandy, will you? He'll soon get used to you. And as for Dickie,”"
"she added, with a touch of wistfulness, “I 'm sure I can find a nice"
home for him.”
John put his arm round her shoulder and gave her the kiss of a shy bear.
"“My good soul,” he cried, “bring fifty million Dickies if you like.” He"
laughed. “There's nothing like the song of birds for the humanizing of
the cockney child.”
"He looked around and beheld the little, gimcrack room with a new vision."
"After all, it was as much an expression of her individuality, and as"
"genuine in the eyes of the high gods, as Herold's exquisitely furnished"
"abode was of Herold's, or the untidy jumble of the room in Fenton Square"
was of his own. And all she had to live upon was a hundred and fifty
"pounds a year, and no artistic instincts or antecedents whatsoever."
“I feel a brute in asking you to give up this little place now that
"you've made it so pretty,” he said."
"Her face brightened at the praise. “It is pretty, is n't it?” Then she"
sighed as her eyes rested fondly on her possessions. “I suppose it would
be too tiny for us all to live here.”
"“I'm afraid it would,” said John. “Besides, we must live in London, on"
account of my work.”
“In London?”
"“We might begin,” replied John, “with more elementary accomplishments.”"
"“I could teach her botany,” said Miss Lindon, pensively. “I got first"
"prize for it at school. I still have the book in a cupboard, and I"
could read it up. And I'm so glad I have kept my two volumes of pressed
"flowers. It's quite easy to learn, I assure you.”"
"“I'm afraid, my dear,” said John, “you 'll first have to teach her to"
"eat and drink like a Christian, and blow her nose, and keep her face"
clean.”
"“Ah, that reminds me. My head's in a maze, and I can't think of"
"everything at once, like some clever people. What kind of soap do"
"gentlemen use? I 'll have to know, so as to supply you with what you"
like.”
"“Any old stuff that will make a lather,” said John, rising."
"“But some soaps are so bad for the skin,” she objected anxiously."
“Vitriol would n't hurt my rhinoceros hide.”
"He laughed, and held out his hand. Further discussion was useless."
Miss Lindon accompanied him to the front gate and watched him stride
down the perky terrace until he disappeared round the corner. Then she
"went slowly into the house and uncovered the canary, who blinked at her"
"in oblique sullenness, and did not respond to her friendly “cheep” and"
the scratching of her finger against the rails of his cage. She turned
"to Dandy, who, snoring loud, was equally unresponsive. Feeling lonely"
"and upset, she rang the bell."
"in slashed clothes, which were parti-coloured, red, yellow, and black."
Some of them carried lances and others swords.
“Why are the guards here dressed differently?” asked Cæsar.
“Because this belongs to the Dominions of the Pope.”
“And what kind of guards are these?”
“These are pontifical Swiss guards.”
"“They look comic-opera enough,” said Cæsar."
"“My dear man, don’t say that. This costume was designed by no one less"
than Michelangelo.”
"“All right. At that time they probably looked very well, but now they"
have a theatrical effect.”
"“It is because you have no veneration. If you were reverential, they"
would look wonderful to you.”
"“Very well, let us wait and see whether reverence will not spring up in"
"me. Now, you go on and explain what there is here.”"
"“This first room, the Hall of Audience, or of the Popes, does not"
"contain anything notable, as you see,” said Kennedy; “the five we are"
"coming to later, have been restored, but are still the same as at the"
time when your countryman Alexander VI was Pope. All five were decorated
"by Pinturicchio and his pupils, and all with reference to the Borgias."
"The Borgias have their history, not well known in all its details, and"
"their legend, which is more extensive and more picturesque. Really, it"
"shall have some of the money,"" said the merchant to himself, ""but not"
"all of it. For he has to thank me for the cat, which I bought for him,"
"and charity begins at home."""
"But while the merchant was thinking these thoughts, such a storm and"
tempest arose that all thought the ship would sink. Then the merchant
realized that there was nothing left for him to do but to promise that
"the boy should have all the money. No sooner had he made his vow, than"
"the weather turned fair, and he had a favoring wind for his journey"
"home. And when he landed, he gave the youth the six hundred dollars and"
his daughter to boot. For now the scullion was as rich as the merchant
"himself and richer, and thereafter he lived in splendor and happiness."
"And he took in his mother and treated her kindly. ""For I do not believe"
"that charity begins at home,"" said the youth."
NOTE
"""The Honest Four-Shilling Piece"" (Asbjörnsen and Moe, N.F.E.,"

THE MAGIC APPLES
Once upon a time there was a lad who was better off than all the others.
He showed me his thumbnail; there was no mark on it.
"The newspaper reporters wrote articles and sent telegrams, not only about"
"the Blue Peak and the dreadful death, but about the locality, and about"
"the Tore Peak resort, that haven for the weary, with its wonderful"
buildings set like jewels in the mountains. What a surprise to come here:
"gargoyles, living room, piano, all the latest books, timber outside ready"
"for new jewels in their setting, altogether a magnificent picture of"
Norway's modern farming.
"Yes, indeed, the newspapermen appreciated it. And they did their"
advertising.
The English arrived.
"""Where is Solem?"" they asked, and ""Where is the Blue Peak?"" they asked."
"""We ought to get the hay in,"" said Josephine and the wife at the farm."
"""There'll be rain, and fifty cartloads are still out!"""
"That was all very well, but ""Where is Solem?"" asked the English. So Solem"
"had to go with them. The two casual laborers began to cart away the hay,"
but then the women had no one to help them rake. Confusion was rife.
Everyone rushed wildly hither and thither because there was no one to lead
them.
"The weather stayed fine overnight; it was patient, slow-moving weather. As"
"soon as the dew dried up, more hay would be brought in, perhaps all the"
"hay. Oh, we should manage all right."
"More English appeared; and ""Solem--the Blue Peak?"" they said. Their"
"""I don't know, dearie. He used to take to spells like that when he was"
little. But lately he's got over them. I followed him once and I found
him out in the sand dunes lying flat on his face cryin' awful--out loud
and beatin' his arms. I let him be. I stole home and I never let on I
knew. When he came back all white lookin' I had a nice cake ready--roll
"jell, his favorite."""
"""Do--do you think he was out in the sand dunes--last night?"""
"""I don't know. He come in about nine o'clock, awful quiet and I didn't"
"ask him anything, but I just set his breakfast before him as though the"
morning wa'n't half over. And then he went off again and I ain't seen
"him sense. I thought mebbe it was these folks of Mr. Dugald's--"""
"""What do you mean, Aunt Achsa?"" But Sidney knew what she meant."

He stopped. A dread vision filled his mind of Earth depopulated by the
"feebly ferocious Rogans, of rank on rank of Earth's vast armies"
falling in stricken rows at the shock of the Rogans' tubes.
"Greca caught the vision. She nodded. ""Yes, that is what would happen"

"are bare-handed, and the Rogans have those damned tubes. Anyway, we"
are on the verge of death at this very moment. What under heaven can

He was silent a moment: and in the silence the steady hum from the
domed building outside came to his ears.

GERTRUDE ATHERTON was born in San Francisco and received her
"early education in California and Kentucky, but her best"
"training was in her grandfather’s library, a collection, it is"
"said, of English masterpieces only, containing no American"
fiction whatever. Yet Mrs. Atherton is as thorough an American
"as a niece, in the third generation, of Benjamin Franklin should"
be.
It seems to have been the English critics who first recognised
"her originality, power, intensity, vividness, and vitality, but"
"from her first book, “What Dreams May Come,” published in 1888,"
her writings have revealed the unusual combination of brains and
"feeling. This gives her work both keen, clever strength and"
"brilliancy of colour, developed through years of hard work, many"
"of which were spent abroad, and reaching their best"
"manifestation in her latest fiction, the one quality in “The"
Conqueror” and the other in “The Splendid Idle Forties.” Both of
"these books go to prove the foresight of Mr. Harold Frederic,"

Lavender's shoulders lifted. Why couldn't someone else save the fair
name of Cape Cod--someone like a crippled boy whom most of the
towns-people looked upon as a loafer?
"""I'd like to catch 'em, myself,"" he said slowly in such a low voice"
that Sidney barely caught the words.
"""Oh, Lav, why not? We have as good a chance as anyone, knowing as much"
"as we do. What'll we do first?"" For Sidney was ready for adventure."
Suddenly Lavender realized that he was gripping the knife in his hand.
He looked down at it.
"""What we ought to do first is to find out how this knife got here."
Let's put it where we found it and go back around the other side of
that schooner so's no one on the _Puritan_'ll see us. Then we can come

"""And then we'd know for sure that someone had been on the _Arabella_."""
"""That's the idea. You get on quickly for a girl, Sid. Come on, now,"
"we'll pull the dory round to the starboard side."""
Sidney caught herself tiptoeing across the deck of the_ Arabella_. In
"her excitement she scarcely breathed. Every move, every act, was"
Suddenly a postmark on one of the letters on the little table at her
elbow caught her eye. Provincetown. Trude caught it up apprehensively.
That letter might be from their Cousin Achsa! She turned it over and
"over, wishing she might open it."
"""Good morning, my dear! I get up with the birds myself and find that"
"you're up before me!"""
"Trude laughed, to cover her anxiety. ""I told Jonathan I'd inspect his"
"new beds this morning."""
"""There, didn't I say you were supplanting me in Jonathan's esteem? But"
he only wants you to admire them and smile at him. He knows you know
"nothing about gardens, even though you are a very wise young woman! Ah,"
"the mail--is there anything there worth looking at before breakfast?"""
"""Two cards, three advertising envelopes and--and two personal letters."""
"Trude held out the two letters, her heart beating in her throat."
Mrs. White glanced at them indifferently. She turned one as though to
"tear open the envelope, then stopped to play with Mitie. Next she gave"
her attention to Pepper who appeared in the door to summon her to
breakfast. And all the time Trude's eyes were beseeching her to open
them--to open _one_ of them quickly.
Trude followed her into the breakfast room and sat down across from
her. After she had eaten her fruit Mrs. White took up the envelope that
was postmarked Provincetown and studied it while Trude waited.

"""New type of ship?"""
"""Well, not a new ship, but some new equipment. The Infrawave Section of"
the Space Department Radiation Laboratory has some experimental gear
"they want to try in actual service."""
"""Experimental gear?"""
"""Sheer experiment, Wilson. It's supposed to be an infrawave detecting"
"and ranging device. It's shown low grade response so far, and it may"
be entirely useless to you. But Radiation feels that even something
"incomplete and erratic may be better than going it blind."""
"Wilson sat up, interested. ""How does it work?"""
"""Darned if I know. It took a whole cruiser class to carry the junk"

the crate took off the advanced techs were still connecting cables and

They laughed.

“Is this the Velázquez portrait?” asked Cæsar.
“This is it.”
Cæsar looked at it carefully. “That man had eaten and drunk well before
"his portrait was painted,” said Cæsar; “his face is congested.”"
"“It is extraordinary!” exclaimed Cortés. “It is something to see, the"
"way this is done. What boldness! Everything is red, the cape, the cap,"
the curtains in the background.... What a man!”
"The German aired his opinions in his own language, and took out a"
notebook and pencil and wrote some notes.
"“What sort of man was this?” asked Cæsar, whom the technical side of"
"painting did not preoccupy, as it did Cortés."
"“They say he was a dull man, who lived under a woman’s domination.”"
"“The great thing is,” murmured Cæsar, “how the painter has left him"
"here alive. It seems as if we had come in here to salute him, and he"
was waiting for us to speak. Those clear eyes are questioning us. It is
curious.”
"“Not curious,” exclaimed Cortés, “but admirable.”"
“For me it is more curious than admirable. There is something brutal in
"this Pope; through his grey beard, which is so thin, you can see his"
"projecting chin. The good gentleman was of a marked prognathism, a type"
"of degeneration, indifference, intellectual torpor, and nevertheless, he"
"reached the top. Perhaps in the Church it’s the same as in water, only"

Again it seemed to Senator Crane that he heard a ripple of mirth--louder
this time. It had to be something to do with the acoustics. Except that
"he was suddenly aware of smiles, too. The next question had to do with"
possible consultation with Russia on the matter of the coming space
invasion.
Senator Crane agreed that such consultation should be made and then
retired hastily into seclusion. A touch of panic hit him. He felt like a
"man who was far out in the water without a boat, with the closest land a"
few hundred feet straight down. Good God! Had he miscalculated? Of
course not. He had only to await the verdict of the nation's top
newspapers before proceeding with the publicity program that might well
make him presidential timber.

nervous. He kept licking his lips and shifting his eyes from Rhoda to
Frank Corson.
"Frank Corson sat quietly, keeping his thoughts to himself. Rhoda crossed"
to the liquor cabinet and poured a double Scotch. She went to the sofa
and sat down a little uncertainly.

ground of conscious virtue. Yet I say an unworthy thing like this:
"""Don't throw yourself away, Miss Torsen!"""

"reply, pale and offended:"
"""Throw myself away?--I don't understand you."""
"But it is possible, too, that Miss Torsen, at heart a fine, proud girl,"

"Askew’s little gloved hands trembled, and he turned white with"
anger--as pale as Montagu Askew allowed himself to turn:
"“It has belonged to my forefathers for seven generations,” he"
said--“and every man of them backed his acts with his sword.”
Noll laughed; shrugged his shoulders:
"“If your acts are hereditary, it is an excuse for you,” he said."
"The following morning, Rupert Greppel and a French cousin called upon"
Noll; and Rupert stiffly asked if he could refer him to two friends.
"“No,” said Noll--Doome was with him--“no--I do not associate with men"
who associate with Lord Montagu Askew.”
"Rupert Greppel paused, dumbfounded:"
"“I do not think you understand,” he said. “Lord Montagu Askew"
challenges you to fight him.”
"“Tell Lord Montagu Askew from me,” said Noll, “that I only brawl with"
men. Good-morning.”
The whisperings at the clubs are said to have hit Lord Montagu Askew
"harder than a pistol-bullet; but Lord Montagu, from lack of experience,"
is not an authority on being hit with pistol-bullets. He never takes
"part in ungentlemanly encounters where people are hit. Indeed, he"
"maintains a wondrous silence, except that he challenged Noll; and the"
jade-handled cane has joined the ancestors.

"After a short rest the boys proceeded south, climbing over jutting"
"spurs, dipping into depressions, and sliding over stony slopes until"
they were almost too tired to take another step.
"“We’ll get used to this in a month or two,” Harry said, sitting plump"
down on a boulder.
"Frank followed the boy’s example, except that he stretched himself at"
"full length, while Jack pushed on a few steps and stood peering over a"
rim of rock which lay directly in their way.
"“Look here, boys!” Jack finally called. “You remember the place in"
"Mexico called the Devil’s Cauldron? Well, this is it!”"
“What have you found now?” demanded Frank sleepily.
"“Here’s a round hole in the mountain,” Jack answered back, “that you"
might hide a city block in. It’s deep and the sides are almost smooth.
"Looks like the pit Kipling gets one of his characters in, only there’s"
rock instead of sand.”
The boys rose to their feet and looked over the ledge.
"“And right there in the bottom,” Harry exclaimed, “is a pool of water so"
clear that it looks like a diamond!”

"looked about him a moment, then taking me by the arm, led me to the Stone"
"Gallery and thence to the garden. I wanted to stop, but he kept his grasp"
"on my arm, repeating now and then the word ""Come"" in whispers, till we"
"reached a lonely spot in St. James Park. There he halted, and though"
"there was not a living creature in sight, he brought his lips to my ear"
"and breathed the name, ""'Sieur George Hamilton."""
"I tried not to show that I was startled, but the quickwitted, sharp-eyed"
"Frenchman read me as though I were an open book, and grasping my hand,"
cried out:--
"""Ah, I knew you could tell me. It is to rejoice! I knew it!"""
"""Tell you what, count?"" I asked."
"""Tell me where your friend and mine is, or if you will not tell me, take"
"to him a letter. I have been trying to find him this fortnight."""
"""I cannot tell you where he is, my dear count--"""

"other day that he was in France."""
"""Of course, of course, he is in France! Not in England at all! Good,"
good! I see you are to be trusted. But I must have your word of honor
"that the letter will be delivered."""

return it to you unopened unless I am convinced beyond a doubt that it
'What is it?' I asked without curiosity.
"'A little boy gave it to me at the door,' he answered. 'I was to ask"
you to be in the street opposite Herr Krapp's half an hour after
sunset this evening.'
I gasped. 'Herr Krapp's!' I exclaimed.
"Steve nodded, looking at me queerly. 'Yes; do you know him?' he said."
"'I do now,' I muttered, gulping down my amazement. But my face was as"
"red as fire, the blood drummed in my ears. I had to turn away to hide"
my emotion. 'What was the boy like?' I asked.
But it seemed that the lad had made off the moment he had done his
"errand, and Steve had not noticed him particularly. 'I called after"
"him to know who sent him,' he added, 'but he had gone too far.'"
"I nodded and mumbled something, and went on into the house. Perhaps I"
"was still a little sore on my girl's account, and resented the easy"
"way in which she had dropped out of others' lives. At any rate, my"
"instinct was to keep the thing to myself. The face at the window, and"
"then this strange assignation, could have only one meaning; but, good"
"or bad, it was for me. And I hugged myself on it, and said nothing"
even to my lady.
"The day seemed long, but at length the evening came, and when the"
"men had gone to drill and the house was quiet, I slipped out. The"
streets were full at this hour of men passing to and fro to their
"drill-stations, and of women who had been out to see the camp, and"
were returning before the gates closed. The bells of many of the

Frances's letter could be rewritten in cipher. We trusted Bettina as we
"trusted ourselves, and when we told her the good news, she clapped her"
"hands for joy, laughing, yet ready to weep, and was as happy as even she"
"could be, which was very happy indeed."
"After we had talked, laughed, and cried a reasonable time in Betty's"
"parlor, Frances handed me her letter, which was a bulky document, well"
taped and waxed.
"""It will require a week for me to translate this,"" I remarked, weighing"
the letter in my hand.
"""What do you mean by translating it?"" she asked in surprise."
"""I must write it out in cipher. Hamilton directed that all letters should"
"be sent in that form,"" I answered, amused at her alarm."
"""No, no!"" she cried, snatching the letter from me, pressing it to her"
"breast and blushing to her ears. ""You shall not see my letter!"""
"""Why?"" I asked."
"""Because,"" she answered."
"""That is no reason,"" I replied. ""Of course you have written nothing that"
"you would not want me or your father to see?"""
"""Well, yes, I have,"" she returned emphatically. ""A great deal. Would you,"

"The door was opened and two of their ugly, towering enemies came in,"
their tubes held conspicuously before them. Behind came another
"figure; and at sight of this one, so plainly not of the race of"
"Jupiter, the Earthmen gasped with wonder."
"They saw a girl who might have come from Earth, save that she was"
taller than most Earth women--of a regal height that reached only an
inch or two below Brand's own six foot one. She was beautifully
"formed, and had wavy dark hair and clear light blue eyes. A sort of"
"sandal covered each small bare foot; and a gauzy tunic, reaching from"
"above the knee to the shoulder, only half shielded her lovely figure."
She was bearing a metal container in which was a mess of stuff
evidently intended as food. The guards halted and stepped aside to let
"her pass into the room. Then they backed out, constantly keeping Dex"
"and Brand covered with the tubes, and closed and barred the door."
The girl smiled graciously at the admiration in the eyes of both the
men--a message needing no inter-planetary interpretation. She
"advanced, and held the metal container toward them."

cypress ceiling.

up.

water at the lens.

"Since you two have taken such an interest in this project, I thought it"
“Yes; that’s true. She is too much of a prize beauty.”
“That is the defect in the Yankee women; they have no character. The

is the one thing that creates the spirituality of the old countries.
"Beyond contradiction American women have intelligence, beauty, energy,"

centuries: character. At times they have very charming impulses. Have
you heard the story about Prince Torlonia’s wife?”
“No.”
"“Well, Torlonia’s present wife was an American girl worth millions, who"
"came with letters to the prince. He took her about Rome, and at the end"
"of some days he said to her, supposing that the beautiful American had"
the intention of marrying: ‘I will introduce some young noblemen to
you’; and she answered: ‘Don’t introduce anybody to me; because you
please me more than anybody’; and she married him.”
“It was a pretty impulse.”

"She went on to explain, whilst the doctors occupied themselves with"
"their gruesome task, and Vivie was being persuaded to take some"
"nourishment, that her great grandfather had been a soldier servant"
who had married a Belgian woman and settled down on the site of this
very shop a hundred years ago. He and his wife had even then
"made a specialty of tea for English tourists. She, his great"
"grand-daughter, had after her marriage to Monsieur Trouessart"
"carried on the business under the old name--Walker, made to look"
Flemish as Walcker.
Vivie when left alone suddenly thought of the money question. She

it from the dirt of the floor. Suddenly something small and gleaming
fell from the folds and rolled upon the floor.
"""I'll be ding-blasted!"" roared Cap'n Phin. Someone swore softly. The"
man Si dropped to his knees. Sidney blinked.
Cap'n Phin seized the silk and unwound it. And among the countless
folds he found a cunningly contrived pocket filled with hundreds of the
priceless gems.
"For a moment no one spoke. The daring of it all, the wealth of the"
"glistening jewels, held each man in the room. Cap'n Phin folded the"
gorgeous silk and passed it to one of the men.
"""I guess this belongs to you in trust for Uncle Sam,"" he said gravely."
"""Our business is with one Jed Starrow."" He turned to Sidney who was"
"trembling violently. ""Now, matie, will you tell these men how you"
"happened to ship aboard the _Arabella_ last night?"""
"Sidney's story tumbled out in quick, eager words and in careful detail."
"The men listened closely. The one who had taken the diamonds ""in trust"
"for Uncle Sam"" made notes in a small black book. When she had finished"
"Cap'n Phin nodded, his face serious."

7. Hymns of the Reformation: The Metrical Psalms.
"While the German people, under the leadership of Luther, were singing"
"chorales set to original religious poems, a large section of"
"Protestantism, under the influence of John Calvin, confined itself to"
"the singing of Psalms. To the French reformer, now preaching at Geneva,"
"hymns were “man-made,” whereas the psalms were the inspired word of God"
"and the only proper vehicle for the praise of God. Calvin, unlike"
"Luther, was not a musician, and at first permitted only unison singing,"
unaccompanied. Part singing and instrumental accompaniment seemed to
"savor of the frivolous and worldly, an opinion which Calvin, however,"
was soon to modify. For two hundred years the Calvinistic churches on
the Continent and in Britain were influenced in their worship song by
"the strict views of Calvin, limiting themselves to the metrical psalms"
and scriptural paraphrases. The German people in the meantime produced a
"rich treasury of original religious lyrics, contributed by some of their"
best poets.

"And, be it remembered, for her the doing had been no light ordering--it"
"was a flagellation of her own nakedness with cruel whips; for, as each"
"change obliterated a footprint of the past, the atmosphere in which the"
boy and man had wrought their career swiftly vanished--the very hint of
an early struggle had departed from the place.
Noll felt how the room must have struck Netherby in the face as he
leaped up the stair and flung open the door to be welcomed to its
old genial comradeship after his journey and absence from his beloved
things.
Noll’s eyes came back from his thoughts to rest on the bent shoulders
of the disconsolate man; and Netherby realized that the other had
digested the situation.
"He sighed sadly, his head in his hands:"
“Poor Julia!” he said--“ she must never know. She has done this during
"our absence--as a surprise. And,” he added grimly: “it was!”"
Noll smiled:
"“But, Netherby, my dear old boy; you must not fret. You are famous,"
man----”
“Oh yes--quite. A duchess has asked me to dinner--without my wife.”
Noll put out the light:
"“Let us sit in the dusk for awhile, Netherby, as we have sat many a day"
and settled the affairs of the state. We have laughed at care here;
your watchfulness. I had full information of King Charles's design upon
"my life from no less a person than Monsieur le Grand himself, who showed"
me the letter asking that I be returned to England.
"""I explained to Monsieur le Grand that the English king sought my life,"
"not because he is in fear of me, but because he thought I stood between"
him and a lady who despises him. While Monsieur le Grand was much in
"sympathy with the English king's grievance, his contempt for Charles,"
"his regard for me, which seems to be sincere, and his longing to possess"
"Dunkirk all induced him to laugh at the request, the nature of which he"
had imparted to no one save me.
"""My account of the lady who despised King Charles's love gave Monsieur le"
"Grand a new idea, and suggested a method of purchasing Dunkirk which he"
hopes will save the heavy cost of bidding against the citizens of London.
I had no hint of what he intended till one day he took me to his closet
and began to question me.
"""'Do you possess the love of the lady who despises King Charles?' he"
asked.
"""'I do, your Majesty,' I answered."
"""'Do you know you possess it?' he asked."
"""'As well as a man who is not a king may know,' I returned."
"""'Tush, tush! Kings are no more certain than other men.'"
"""'I know I possess this woman's love,' I said."
"""'Would she be willing to make a great sacrifice to help you?'"
"Understand?"""
"Viggon Sarri looked from one to the other, grimly. ""You believe I'm"
"wasting time? Is that it?"""
"The two aides answered together, ""Yes!"" and ""Absolutely!"""
"Viggon Sarri said, ""I am still in command of this force. We'll continue"
to observe until I am satisfied. You two officers have one common
idea--that of moving in fast. You have differing ideas of how we are
to move in. Until you can settle your difference and provide me with a
good logical basis for your decision--whichever way--then we'll follow
my plan. And my plan is to move in just as soon as we have enough data
on the character and strength of this race to provide us with the
"correct way to take them."""
"""Then you are going to continue stalling?"" demanded Naylo."
"""Yes, if you wish to call it stalling. Maybe another man might call it"
"planning."""
"""We'll be just wasting time, as I've already said. We have enough stuff"
"to take 'em right now."""
"Viggon Sarri shrugged. ""Yes. We could swoop in and take them like"
"mowing down a wheat field. Tell me, young men, what happens when you"
"mow down a wheat field."""
They looked at him blankly.
"Viggon smiled in a superior manner. ""One of two things, depending upon"
"how you operate. If you mow it down and let it lay, you drop seeds and"
"Four--whom would that come from?"""
"The burly man frowned. ""That would be the physics boys, Opperly's"
"group. Is anything wrong?"""
Jorj did not answer. A bit later he quit taping and began to adjust
"controls, going up on the boom-chair to reach some of them. Eventually"
"he came down and touched a few more, then stood waiting."
"From the great cube came a profound, steady purring. Involuntarily the"
six officials backed off a bit. Somehow it was impossible for a man to

of his lodge of pine boughs. The men of the Duke of Spoleto were
"gathering in on every side, some girding their swords, others"
"tightening their shield-straps, as they came."
The duke ordered a single horn to sound the rally.
"The glade was full of stir and action. Companies were forming up,"
shoulder to shoulder; spears danced and swayed; horses steamed in the
brisk morning air.
"At last the tents sank down, and, as the sun cleared the trees, the"
"armed array rolled out from the woods into a stretch of open land,"
that sloped towards the bold curves of a river.
"On that morning Francesco felt almost happy, as his fingers gripped"
his sword and he cantered along by the side of the duke. The great
heart of the world seemed to beat with his.

free lances.
domineeringly:
“Giovanni Battista!”
“What is it?”
"“That’s enough, that’s enough! I can hear you from here.”"
"“That’s my wife,” said Giovanni Battista, “she doesn’t like me to be"
lacking in respect for plaster saints.” “You are a pagan!” screamed the
"old woman. “You shall see, you shall see what will happen to you.”"
"“What do you expect to have happen to me, darling?”"
"“Leave her alone,” exclaimed the elder son, ill at ease; “you always"
have to be making mother fly into a rage.”
"“No, my boy, no; she is the one who makes me fly into a rage.”"
"“Giovanni Battista is used to living among gods,” said Kennedy, “and he"
despises saints.”
"“No, no,” replied the cast-maker; “some saints are all right. If all"
"the churches had figures by Donatello or Robbia, I would go to church"
"oftener; but to go and look at those statues in the Jesuit churches,"
"those figures with their arms spread and their eyes rolling.... Oh, no!"
I cannot look at such things.”
Cæsar could see that Giovanni Battista expressed himself very well;
but that he was not precisely a star when it came to working. After the
"mould for the bas-relief was cleaned and fixed, the cast-maker invited"
Cæsar and Kennedy to have a glass of wine in a wine-shop near by.

THE WHAT-SHALL-I-DO GIRL
"Or, The Career of Joy Kent"
_By Isabel Woodman Waitt_

postpaid $1.40_
"When Joy Kent finds herself alone in the world, thrown on her own"
"resources, after the death of her father, she looks about her, as do"
"so many young girls, fresh from the public schools, wondering how she"
can support herself and earn a place in the great business world about
"her. Still wondering, she sends a letter to a number of girls she had"
"known in school days, asking that each one tell her just how she had"
"equipped herself for a salary-earning career, and once equipped, how"
she had found it possible to start on that career. In reply come
"letters from the milliner, the stenographer, the librarian, the"
"salesgirl, the newspaper woman, the teacher, the nurse, and from girls"
who had adopted all sorts of vocations as a means of livelihood. Real
"Mr. Myre read the letter; and, as he read, his face became more like"
the hue of badly-made paste.
"He was a long time reading it, Gaston Latour’s sleepy eyes never"
leaving him.
"He burst into a harsh laugh, and flung the letter into the air:"
"“A challenge, eh? ... ha-ha! ho-ho-ho!... Tell your cousin, Monsieur"
"Latour, that the duel is relegated to the limbo of opera-bouffe."
Ho-ho-ho! We do not do these things in England.”
He prepared himself for a flight of oratory.
Gaston Latour nudged the other youth--they bowed solemnly and withdrew.
“Ho-ho! ha-ha-ha!” laughed Quogge Myre.
The following morning Mr. Quilliam O’Flaherty Macloughlin Myre’s name
"was posted in every club in Paris, and struck from the list of those to"
which he had belonged; so it came about that he had to live his day at
cafés.
"And it was as he stood at a table, giving authoritative utterance with"
"loud yawing voice to a group of youths that sat about him, vowing that"
he had determined to shake the dust of Paris from off his splay feet
"and to start a great renaissance of the English drama, when a handsome"
"young woman, sister to Gaston Latour, entered the place, walked"
"straight up to Mr. Myre, and struck him a sounding buffet on the ear"
that sent his hat flying from his head.
"pointed, scriggly hand, ""To my little friend.--E. H.""  Fiorsen drew smoke"
"deep down into his lungs, expelled it slowly, and went to the piano.  He"
"opened it and began to play, staring vacantly before him, the cigarette"
"burned nearly to his lips.  He went on, scarcely knowing what he played."
"At last he stopped, and sat dejected.  A great artist?  Often, nowadays,"
he did not care if he never touched a violin again.  Tired of standing up
"before a sea of dull faces, seeing the blockheads knock their silly hands"
"one against the other!  Sick of the sameness of it all! Besides--besides,"
were his powers beginning to fail?  What was happening to him of late?
"He got up, went into the dining-room, and drank some brandy.  Gyp could"
"not bear his drinking.  Well, she shouldn't be out so much--taking"
music-lessons.  Music-lessons!  Nearly three o'clock.  If he went for
"once and saw what she really did--Went, and offered her his escort home!"
"An attention.  It might please her.  Better, anyway, than waiting here"
until she chose to come in with her face all closed up.  He drank a
little more brandy--ever so little--took his hat and went.  Not far to
"walk, but the sun was hot, and he reached the house feeling rather dizzy."
A maid-servant opened the door to him.
"""I am Mr. Fiorsen.  Mrs. Fiorsen here?"""
"""Yes, sir; will you wait?"""
Why did she look at him like that?  Ugly girl!  How hateful ugly people
"were!  When she was gone, he reopened the door of the waiting-room, and"
listened.
Chopin!  The polonaise in A flat.  Good!  Could that be Gyp?  Very good!
"He moved out, down the passage, drawn on by her playing, and softly"
turned the handle.  The music stopped.  He went in.
"""He isn't even thinking of coming, the wretch! ..."""
"""That means that he does not love me!"" sang Deacon Taras, leaning his"
chin on his hand and casting a humorous glance towards the mountain.
At last Petunikoff appeared.  He came in a respectable cart with his
"son playing the role of groom.  The latter was a red-checked,"
"nice-looking youngster, in a long square-cut overcoat.  He wore smoked"
"eyeglasses.  They tied the horse to an adjoining tree, the son took the"
"measuring instrument out of his pocket and gave it to his father, and"
they began to measure the ground.  Both were silent and worried.
"""Aha!"" shouted the Captain, gleefully."
All those who were in the dosshouse at the moment came out to look at
them and expressed themselves loudly and freely in reference to the
matter.
"""What does the habit of thieving mean?  A man may sometimes make a big"
"mistake when he steals, standing to lose more than he gets,"" said the"
"Captain, causing much laughter among his staff and eliciting various"
murmurs of assent.
"""Take care, you devil!"" shouted Petunikoff, ""lest I have you in the"
"police court for your words!"""
"""You can do nothing to me without witnesses ...  Your son cannot give"
"evidence on your side"" ... the Captain warned him."
"""Look out all the same, you old wretch, you may be found guilty too!"""
"And Petunikoff shook his fist at him. His son, deeply engrossed in his"
man at my time of life! Do you realize that I am twice her age?”
"And he went on, inveighing now against the pitifully human conventions"
"that restrained him from hurting the chit of a child, and now against"
the sorcery with which she contrived to invest the chamber wherein she
dwelt.
"“And at my age, too, when I 've run the whole gamut of human misery,"
the whole discordant thing--_toute la lyre_--when I've finished with the
"blighting illusion that men call life; when, confound it! I 'm thirty.”"
"Sir Oliver, unable to sleep, came into the room in dressing-gown and"
slippers. He looked very fragile and broken.
"“Here 's John,” laughed Herold, “saying that he 's thirty, and an old,"
"withered man, and he 's not thirty. He 's nine-and-twenty.”"
"Sir Oliver looked at John, as only age, with awful wistfulness, can"
"look at youth, and came and laid his hand upon the young man's broad"
shoulders.
"“My lad,” said he, “you've had a bad time; but you 're young. You've"
"the whole of your life before you. Time, my dear boy, is a marvellous"
"solvent of human perplexity. Once in a new world, once in that"
astonishing continent of Australia--”
John threw a half-finished cigar angrily into the fire.
"“I'm not going to the damned continent,” said he."
"As De Grammont was leaving my closet, he paused at the door, and, after a"
"moment's hesitancy, whispered:--"
"""You may expect a letter from France soon. It will come from M. l'Abbé du"
"Boise, who I hope will come soon to London on the business of my king."
"You know him not--M. l'Abbé?"" The eyebrows lifted questioningly. ""No? You"
"soon will know him, yet you will not know him. You and perhaps a lady may"
"help him in his mission. I, too, shall help him, but I, too, know him"
"not. Yet I know him. If he succeed in his mission, he will be rich, he"
"will be powerful. And I? Mon Dieu, my friend! If he succeed, my decree of"
banishment from Paris--it will be to revoke. I may return once more to
bask in the smile of my king. You must not speak; the lady must not
"speak; I must not speak when Monsieur l'Abbé comes, nor before. It is to"
"silence. Stone walls have one ear."""
"""Two, sometimes, count,"" I suggested, laughing."
"""Yes, I should have said one ears! Non, non! I forget this damnable"
"tongue of yours! When I arrive to great interest, it is to talk faster"
"than it is to think, and--"" A shrug of the shoulders finished the"
sentence.
"""Let us speak French hereafter, my dear count,"" I suggested."
"""Mon Dieu, mon Dieu! It is to me more of pain to hear my sweet language"
"murdered than to murder yours,"" answered Grammont, seriously."
"""Ah, but I speak French quite as well as I speak English. Perhaps I shall"
"not murder it,"" I replied."
"""Perhaps? We shall try,"" he said, though with little show of faith."
Travers nodded.
"""I heard you talking, but I wanted to make sure. It has all been my"
fault--every bit of it. It's decent of you not to make me feel it
"more. You are not to blame--her. You know I tempted her, I made her"
"help me. She isn't responsible. At any rate, she made a clean breast"
of it--that's something to her credit. I didn't want to--I never meant
to. I am not the sort that repents. But this last week you have been
"so decent, and Lois such a plucky little soul--she ought to hate"
"me--and perhaps she does--but she has done her best. Nicholson, are"
you listening? Can you hear what I say? It's so damned hard for me to
"talk."""
"""I can hear,"" Nicholson said kindly. ""Don't worry about what can't be"
"helped."" In spite of everything, he pitied the man, and his tone"
showed it.
"Travers lifted himself higher, clinging to the other's shoulder. His"
"voice began to come in rough, uneven jerks."
"""But it can be helped--it must be helped! Don't you see--I came"
between you and Lois purposely. From the first moment you spoke of her
I knew that you loved her--and I wanted her. I never gave your
message. I didn't dare. You are the sort of man a woman cares for--a
"woman like Lois. I couldn't risk it. But now--well, I'm done, and"
"afterward she will be free--"""
Nicholson drew back stiffly.
"""You are talking nonsense,"" he said, in a colder tone. ""No one wants"
"you to die--and in any case, you know very well we have no chance of"
"getting through this alive."""
_LEGEND AND HISTORY_
"Cæsar went out of the cabinet, leaving the German and Cortés seated on"
"the sofa, absorbed in the picture; he looked at various paintings in the"
"gallery, went back, and sat down, beside the artists."
"“This portrait,” he said presently, “is like history by the side of"
"legend. All the other paintings in the gallery are legend, ‘folk-lore,’"
as I believe one calls it. This one is history.”
"“That’s what it is. It is truth,” agreed Cortés."
"“Yes, but there are people who do not like the truth, my friend. I tell"
"you: this is a man of flesh, somewhat enigmatic, like nature herself,"
and with arteries in which blood flows; this is a man who breathes and
"digests, and not merely a pleasant abstraction; you, who understand such"
"things, will tell me that the drawing is perfect, and the colour such"
as it was in reality; but how about the person who doesn’t ask for
reality?”
"“Stendhal, the writer, was affected that way by this picture,” said"
Cortés; “he was shocked at its being hung among masterpieces.”
"“He found it bad, no doubt.”"
“Very bad?”
“Was this Stendhal English?”
"""Ay! But enough to make a garden,"" I returned, as we climbed the narrow"
flight of steps leading to the private entrance to the Old Swan.
"When we paused at the door, Frances said, ""Your garden is at hand."" And"
"when she opened the door, there stood Betty, and I was in Eden. The moist"
"glow of her eyes, the faint blush of her cheeks, the nervous fluttering"
"of her voice, spoke more eloquently than all the tongues of Babel could"
"have spoken, and I could not help comparing her welcome with that which"
Maxy Hamilton had given me at the queen's ball.
"Bettina led us to the parlor, and while we were drinking a cup of tea,"
we had the great pleasure of asking and answering questions of which we
always had a large supply in reserve.
"When it was time to go, Bettina walked down to the Bridge with us. As it"
"was growing dark, Frances suggested that I walk back to the Old Swan with"
"Betty, which I did, she taking my arm of her own accord, and both of us"
"very happy, though we spoke not a word, for fear of saying too much, save"
"""good night"" at the door."
"""Good night at the door!"" God gave its sweetness to youth right out of"
the core of His infinite love.
CHAPTER XII
A PERILOUS EMBASSY
"Four or five days after our visit to Bettina, I met De Grammont at"
sweep of his oar sculling shoreward through the murky night. Over the
"castellated walls of La Cabaña raced low, angry clouds. Was it a storm"
"brewing, or had some supernal madness touched the night?"
"The watch forward called in a guarded voice: ""All right, sir?"" to which"
"I answered, ""All right,"" then went cautiously across deck and crept down"
"the companionway stairs. The cabin was dark so I felt for my stateroom,"
passed in and closed the door. Somehow my fingers could not locate the
"light jet, but what matter? In three minutes I had undressed and was"
fast asleep.
CHAPTER IV
NIRVANA
"A pleasant sense of motion came over me that suggested cradling waves,"
and I was sleepily wondering why we had gone out on a day that portended
"storms, when a tapping at my stateroom door was followed by someone"
whispering:
"""Aren't you ever going to get up, you lazy old dear?"""
It was a girl's voice.
"Gradually and cautiously I drew the sheet about my chin, feeling no"
little confused to have a girl five feet away whispering pet names at me
through a thin partition.
Inserts[42] are almost always printed upon coated paper.
"Laid[42] paper is used in more expensive books, as, from its nature,"
better and more costly stock is required in its making.
THE PRESSWORK
"Books are printed in forms[42] of 4 pages and multiples of 4 pages,"
"depending upon the size of the paper leaf. The usual form is 32 pages,"
so the publisher tries to plan his volume to make approximately even
forms. To print any number of pages over an even form is as expensive
as to print the complete 32 pages.[43]
THE BINDING
"In binding, the questions to be settled include the style of"
"back,--flat, half-round, or round; plain or gilt-top; headband[45]"
"or not; trimmed or uncut edges;[44] kind of cloth,--T pattern,[45]"
"silk,[45] vellum,[45] etc.; color and shade of cloth; location of dies;"
"stamping,--ink, foil, gold or Oriental tissue, etc.; jacket,--glassine,"
"manila, or printed."
THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE BOOK
"THE proper layout for an ordinary volume, arranged in accord with the"
"best usage, is as follows:"
and an uneasy eye.
"“That is the Hungarian violinist Kolozsvar,” said Susanna."
"“Kolozsvar, Kolozsvar!” they heard everybody saying."
“Is he a great virtuoso?” Cæsar asked Kennedy.
"“No, I think not,” answered Kennedy. “It seems that this Hungarian’s"
"speciality is playing the waltzes and folk-songs of his own country,"
which is certainly not anything great; but his successes are not
"obtained with the violin, but among the women. The ladies in London"
"fight for him. His game is to pass himself off as a fallen man,"
"depraved, worn-out. There you have his phraseology.... They see a man to"
"save, to raise up, and convert into a great artist, and almost all of"
them yield to this temptation.”
"“That is comical,” said Cæsar, looking curiously at the fiddler and his"
lady.
"“To a Spaniard,” replied Kennedy, “it is comical; and probably it would"
be to an Italian too; but in England there are many women that have a
"purely imaginative idealism, a romanticism fed on ridiculous novels, and"
"they fall into traps like these, which seem clumsy and grotesque to you"
"here in the South, where people are more clear-sighted and realistic.”"
"Cæsar watched the brave fiddler, who played the role of a man used up,"
to great perfection.
"After tea, Susanna invited them to go up to her rooms, and Laura and her"
brother and Kennedy and Mr. Russell went.
"half the listeners, had known the lady as Mrs. Medland."
"""No,"" said Mr. Medland; ""I lost sight of him."""
"""You did not hear from--from any one about him?"""
"""No."""
He gave the dates when he had last seen Benyon in old days. Asked
whether he had communicated with him between that date and the dead
"man's reappearance, he answered,"
"""Once, about four years ago. I wrote to tell him of that lady's death,"""
"and he pointed again to the picture, and went on to tell the details of"
Benyon's subsequent application to him for a post under Government.
"""You refused it?"" he was asked."
"""Yes, I refused it. I spoke to him once again, when we met on a social"
occasion. We had a sort of dispute then. I never saw him again to speak
"to."""
"""It was all done,"" said Mr. Duncombe, describing the scene, ""in a"
repressed way that was very effective--to a house that knew the
circumstances most effective. And the other fellow--Kilshaw--he gave
"some sport too. The coroner (they told me he was one of Medland's men,"
and I noticed he spared Medland all he could) was inclined to be a bit
"down on Kilshaw. Kilshaw was cool and handy in his answers, but, Lord"
love you! his game came out pretty plain. A monkey! You don't give a man
"a monkey unless there's value received! So people saw, and Mr. Kilshaw"
looked a bit uncomfortable when he caught Medland's eye. He looked at
"him like that,"" and Mr. Duncombe assumed the finest wronged-hero glance"
Before Peters could reply the red-haired man took a single step forward
and faced Bob.
"“I can tell you in two shakes of a lamb’s tail,” he snapped viciously."
"“This river hog o’ yours thinks he kin play the devil with my boom, but"
he’s got another guess comin’. I own this land an’ that sawmill. I got a
right to run my booms out in the river same as anybody else. I ain’t
"lookin’ for trouble, but the first man as tries any monkey business"
"wants to look out, that’s all.”"
"Bainbridge raised his eyebrows, and let his gaze wander leisurely from"
the man’s head to his heels with an expression which brought an added
touch of color to the already flushed cheeks.
“Indeed!” he drawled. “Who are you?”
“Who be I?” retorted the other angrily. “Humph! I don’t see that it
"makes no difference, but my name’s Joyce--John Joyce. An’ I ain’t the"
"kind as backs down an’ takes water, believe me!”"
A singularly irritating smile curved the corners of Bob’s lips. His
"unruffled composure served, as he hoped it might, to increase the rage"
of Mr. Joyce.
“Do you realize that you’re obstructing navigation?” he inquired
suavely.
"“I don’t admit it,” snapped Joyce. “There’s plenty of room for your"
"drive to git past if you had a gang that knew their business, instead of"
a lot o’ greenhorns.”

"Next morning, she found Mr. Wagge with a tall, crape-banded hat in his"
"black-gloved hands, standing in the very centre of her drawing-room.  He"
"was staring into the garden, as if he had been vouchsafed a vision of"
that warm night when the moonlight shed its ghostly glamour on the
"sunflowers, and his daughter had danced out there. She had a perfect view"
"of his thick red neck in its turndown collar, crossed by a black bow over"
"a shiny white shirt.  And, holding out her hand, she said:"
"""How do you do, Mr. Wagge?  It was kind of you to come."""
Mr. Wagge turned.  His pug face wore a downcast expression.

"take your turn. I said to my girl I'd come and see you."""

"""I don't want to say anything harsh about a certain party in your"
"PAINE, CAPTAIN PETER, _alias_ LE PAIN. A French buccaneer."
"He brought into Port Royal in 1684 a merchant ship, _La Trompeuse_."
"Pretending to be the owner, he sold both ship and cargo, which brought"
"about great trouble afterwards between the French and English Governments,"
because he had stolen the ship on the high seas. He was sent from Jamaica
"under arrest to France the same year, to answer for his crimes."
"PAINTER, PETER."
"This Carolina pirate retired and lived at Charleston. In August, 1710, he"
"was recommended for the position of public powder-receiver, but was"
"rejected by the Upper House. ""Mr. Painter Having committed Piracy, and"

"Known to the Jamaicans as ""the vapouring admiral of St. Jago,"" because in"
"July, 1670, he had nailed a piece of canvas to a tree on the Jamaican"
coast with this curious challenge written both in English and Spanish:
"""I, Captain Manuel Rivero Pardal, to the chief of the squadron of"

"She nodded, then stepped over and laid her weapon beside the bundles of"
securities. Vance took one last look at the Smith & Wesson in his own
hand and did the same. Even ex-archaeologists could do arithmetic.
All this time Vera Karanova had said nothing. She merely stood watching
"the proceedings with a detached smile. Finally she spoke. ""Now we can"
"proceed with the counting,"" she said calmly."
"""Maybe you don't fully grasp the situation here, comrade."" Vance stared"
"at her. ""Those gorillas aren't dropping in for tea. We've got to stand"

along. And today she managed to stall us long enough for Mino's boys to
figure out the switch. She's no longer working for T-Directorate; she's
part of Tanzan Mino's operation. All this time she's been working with
them.
"""The negotiable certificates in this room will be delivered to their"

"""Over my dead body."" He found himself thinking it might well be true."
"""No, Mr. Vance, not exactly. Your contribution will be more substantial"

"""I trade only in walls and roofs, for which I pay to the swindling"

"tone.  ""Only those come to me who are not accustomed to comfort and"

off that habit.  You see you are not a gentleman.  What do you eat?
"You eat yourself!"""
"For such speeches, delivered in a strictly business-like manner, and"
"always with smiling eyes, and also for the attention he paid to his"
lodgers the Captain was very popular among the poor of the town.  It
"very often happened that a former client of his would appear, not in"
"rags, but in something more respectable and with a slightly happier"
face.
"""Good-day, your honour, and how do you do?"""
"""Alive, in good health!  Go on."""
"""Don't you know me?"""
"""I did not know you."""

"Sis nodded to herself, waved the door open, and walked out."
"""Let's hope,"" the Captain said. ""Like any father used to say, a man who"
"knows how to handle women, how to get around them without their knowing"
"it, doesn't need to know anything else in this life. I'm plain wasted"
"in space. You can lower your hands now, son."""
We sat down and I explained the blaster to him. He was very interested.
He said all Butt had told him--in the lifeboat when they decided to
use my arrest as a club over Sis--was to keep the safety catch all the
way up against his thumb. I could see he really had been excited about
"carrying a lethal weapon around. He told me that back in the old days,"
"captains--sea captains, that is--actually had the right to keep guns"
in their cabins all the time to put down mutinies and other things our
ancestors did.
"The telewall flickered, and we turned it on. Sis smiled down."
"""Everything's all right, Captain. Come up and marry us, please."""
"""What did you stick him for?"" he asked. ""What was the price?"""
"Sis's full lips went thin and hard, the way Mom's used to. Then she"
"thought better of it and laughed. ""Mr. Brown is going to see that I'm"
"elected sheriff of the Galertan Archipelago."""
"""And I thought she'd settle for a county clerkship!"" the Captain"
muttered as we spun up to the brig.
The doors were open and girls were chattering in every corner. Sis came
up to the Captain to discuss arrangements. I slipped away and found
Simonetta gave her mother what was indispensable for household expenses
and managed the rest herself.
Kennedy retailed this information the first day they went to Giovanni
"Battista Lanza’s house. Cæsar could see Simonetta keeping the books,"
"while the small brother, in a white blouse that came to his heels, was"
"chasing a dog, holding a pipe in his hand by the thick part, as if it"
"were a pistol, the dog barking and hanging on to the blouse, the small"
"boy shrieking and laughing, when Signora Vittoria came bawling out."
"Kennedy presented Simonetta to his friend Cæsar, and she smiled and"
gave her hand.
“Is Signore Giovanni Battista here?” Kennedy asked Signora Vittoria.
"“Yes, he is in the court.” she answered in her gloomy way."
“Is something wrong with your mamma?” said Kennedy to Simonetta.
“Nothing.”
"They went into the court and Giovanni Battista arose, very dignified,"
and bowed to Cæsar. The elder son and the two workmen in white blouses
"and paper caps were busy with water and wires, cleaning a plaster mould"
they had just emptied.
The mould was a big has-relief of the Way of the Cross. Giovanni
Battista permitted himself various jocose remarks about the Way of
"the Cross, which his son and the other two workmen heard with"
great indifference; but while he was still emptying his store of
"anti-Christian irony, the voice of Signora Vittoria was heard, crying"
head.
"""One must learn by experience,"" Petunikoff reassured him, lighting a"
cigarette.
"""Learn ...  It is not that, my dear sir; but don't you see there is no"
freedom?  Don't you see what a life I lead?  I live in fear and
trembling ...  I am refused the freedom so desirable to me in my

the papers.  Sanitary inspectors will be called for ... fines will have

"""But then we will have them turned out if we come to terms with you,"""
promised Petunikoff.
"""What shall we arrange, then?"" asked Vaviloff, sadly and seriously."
"""Tell me your terms."""
"""Well, give me the six hundred mentioned in the claim."""
"""Won't you take a hundred roubles?"" asked the merchant, calmly, looking"
"attentively at his companion, and smiling softly.  ""I will not give you"
"one rouble more,"" ... he added."
"After this, he took out his eye-glasses, and began cleaning them with"
his handkerchief.  Vaviloff looked at him sadly and respectfully.  The
"calm face of Petunikoff, his grey eyes and clear complexion, every line"
of his thickset body betokened self-confidence and a well-balanced

"I sought Frances, and when I told her the substance of George's letter,"
she was almost wild with joy.
"""Am I willing to try?"" she exclaimed, laughing while tears were hanging"
"in her eyes. ""I am not only willing to try, but am determined to succeed."
"Ay, I'd sell England itself in the same cause. Of all the men I have ever"
"known, this king of ours is the greatest dupe. Since the return of the"
"court to Whitehall, he has been growing more importunate every day. He"
"seems to have lost what little wits he had, and does and says the"
"silliest things one can imagine."""
"""And you do not fear attempting to lead him on to sell Dunkirk? You do"
"not fear going too near the precipice?"" I asked, wishing to weigh her"
self-confidence more by the manner of her reply than by her words.
"She laughed and answered: ""There is no precipice, cousin Ned; nothing to"
"fear save kidnapping, and I am always guarded against that danger;"
"nothing to do of which I need feel ashamed, save the acting of a lie, and"
"surely one may lie to the father of lies without sin."""
"""But the lie may be recognized,"" I suggested, ""if one be too bold about"
"it."""
"""My lie will go little beyond a smile or two. The king's vanity will do"
"the rest. He will make himself believe that I mean more than I say."""
"If an ewe gives birth to an ox, the weapons of the ruler will prevail"
over the weapons of the enemy.
"If an ewe gives birth to an ox that has _ganni_[87], the ruler will"
weaken the land of his enemy.

who was without a rival.
"If an ewe gives birth to a cow, the king will die, another king will"
draw nigh and divide the country.
One might have supposed that such omens represent a purely imaginative
"theoretical factor, but the introduction of the historical reference"
proves conclusively that the Babylonians and Assyrians attached an

'How?' my lady muttered.
"'He swore at me,' Marie answered in the same tone. 'And he spoke of"
you--somehow differently.'
"The Countess laughed, but far from joyously. 'I suppose to-night--I"
must see him?' she said. She tried as she spoke to press herself more
"deeply into the pillows, as if she might escape that way. Her flesh"
"crept, and she shivered though she was as hot as fire."
Once or twice in the hours which followed she was almost beside
herself. Sometimes she prayed. More often she walked up and down the
"room like one in a fever. She did not know on what she was trusting,"
"and she could have struck Marie when the girl, appealed to again and"
"""To please me."""
Mr. Wagge's readjusted glance stopped in confusion at her waist. He
"answered, in a voice that he strove to make bland:"
"""If you put it in that way, I don't reelly know 'ow to refuse; but it"
"must be quite between you and me--I can't withdraw my attitude."""
Gyp murmured:
"""No, of course.  Thank you so much; and you'll let me know about"
"everything later.  I mustn't take up your time now.""  And she held out"
her hand.
Mr. Wagge took it in a lingering manner.
"""Well, I HAVE an appointment,"" he said; ""a gentleman at Campden Hill.  He"
"starts at twelve.  I'm never late.  GOOD-morning."""
"When she had watched his square, black figure pass through the outer"
"gate, busily rebuttoning those shining black gloves, she went upstairs"
and washed her face and hands.
"For several days, Fiorsen wavered; but his collapse had come just in"
"time, and with every hour the danger lessened.  At the end of a fortnight"
"of a perfectly white life, there remained nothing to do in the words of"
"the doctor but ""to avoid all recurrence of the predisposing causes, and"
"shove in sea air!""  Gyp had locked up all brandy--and violins; she could"
control him so long as he was tamed by his own weakness.  But she passed
"some very bitter hours before she sent for her baby, Betty, and the dogs,"
and definitely took up life in her little house again.  His debts had
"it, though we know better. Do not disown us. You know how triumphantly"
"certain letters of yours are circulated, in which, to protect yourself"
"from suspicion, you rather meanly fasten it on others ... If you are now"
"afraid to incur a little hostility for _my_ sake, concede me at least"
"that you will not allow yourself, out of fear for another, to be tempted"
to renounce me; rather be silent about me.'
Those were bitter reproaches. In the man who had to swallow them there
"was a puny Erasmus who deserved those reproaches, who took offence at"
"them, but did not take them to heart, who continued to act with prudent"
reserve till Hutten's friendship was turned to hatred. In him was also a
"great Erasmus who knew how, under the passion and infatuation with which"
"the parties combated each other, the Truth he sought, and the Love he"
"hoped would subdue the world, were obscured; who knew the God whom he"
professed too high to take sides. Let us try ever to see of that great
Erasmus as much as the petty one permits.

Commodore Wilson eyed the spacecraft full of hastily assembled

-Have a good trip.
You've spent too long with lesser species.
The trash out on the housing estates.
"The dole scum, the layabouts."
Werewolves.
Come with me.
"- No, I'm actually tired."
I'm really...
"- Oh, hush now."
It's time for you to claim your heritage.
As a vampire and as a man.
"Now, who do we have in here?"
"Everybody, this is our boy..."
Adam.
These will be your kind of people now.
Melvyn there is a dentist.
Simon.
And... oh.
You're Sue?
"Hi, Sue."
They work in local government.
"And, er... oh, Tina and Liam run a garden centre."
"- There, see?"
Shall we go upstairs?
"- Please, yeah."
Mm-hm.
This way.
Hello?
It sounds like a party.
"Oh, well, maybe we should come back tomorrow."
"I mean, throwing him a party's not exactly mistreatment."
"Yeah, a vampire party."
Who knows what that involves?
All of them?
Are you still calm after hearing that?
You're so boring.
Hey!
Stop.
"Please, just stop..."
People die.
But it doesn't matter to you.
- It doesn't matter.
- You're wrong.
- I'm not wrong.
- You're wrong!
Everything.
Yours to toy with.
Release it.
Open up.
Kill.
Everything.
Until everything disappears before your eyes.
"Hey, what's your problem?"
Don't defy me.
Your molecules shall scatter like sand.
What did you do?
God.
Devil.
Hero.
Monster.
What will you call me?
Finish him off!
"I offer up this contract, to unleash the power of the spirit which envelops the air!"
Analyze existence.
Release.
That must have been cute as hell.
"But yeah, she lost the lisp."
"She grew into a beautiful, smart woman."
"Look, I know what Audrey did to you."
"And as far as I can see, right now, this is your chance to get back at her."
Ahem.
Didn't you say you were gonna buy me a drink?
- Is she in?
- Of course she's in.
You got to pay her tab.
Pay the tab.
Son of a bitch.
"All right, so when we get the money and I put it in the safe, I'll let you call Audrey,"
- and you can be the hero.
"- Yeah, absolutely not."
"You're not coming with me, and I'm not giving you the money."
Raven.
"Raven, it's okay."
Come here.
Come here.
Come here.
Come here.
Come here.
It's okay.
"You sure you're okay, Mia?"
Of course.
A little fall never hurt anyone.
"Uh, what's her name?"
The girl with the wild horse.
Her name is Zoe.
And she's our friend.
"Let's go, let's go."
- You're not pleased to see your friend?
- We're not that close.
- He's been causing me a lot oftrouble.
- I'm here to sort it out.
Please sit.
I'll put on some tea.
- Don't bother.
- No need.
- Please be careful.
"- Take care,Jenny."
I know how to do it.
I won't hurt myself.
"Jeffrey, take care ofyour friend, meanwhile."
"Make yourselfat home, Dumbo."
"I am, Mickey Mouse."
"Ma'am, why are you so concerned about the garbage?"
He paid me a thousand bucks to keep you talking.
Don't leave now!
I haven't had this much fun in 20 years!
- You're going to lose this game.
- Am I?
Lets wait and see.
You're always the loser.
Not this time.
I'm well prepared.
Let's put your preparations to the test.
- Are you always so determined?
"- Yes, that's my style."
Mine too.
So we have something in common.
Is that what you think?
Definitely.
...96 64 09.
"No, 9."
Fuck.
627...
- Hello?
"- Marco, is that you?"
"- Yes, Benigno."
- It's great to hear you.
I've requested your visit.
I'll see you Saturday.
All right.
- Where are you?
- Outside the clinic.
Dr.Vega told me everything.
"How could you, Benigno?"
You haven't come back to freak out on me?
No.
Do you need anything?
I need information.
How's Alicia?
The staff is forbidden to talk to me.
"She's in another clinic, they don't know where."
I don't believe that.
"Neither do I, but I'm not surprised they won't tell us."
"Hey, man, are you still my friend?"
"Of course, whom do you think I'm here for?"
Then find out what's happened to Alicia.
"If she's alive, if she had a baby, if it's alive..."
I need to know.
"You understand, don't you?"
Yes.
I'll try to find out.
You've got it.
Oh.
Goddamn right I have it!
Here!
"We're leaving, and we will never drink your overpriced ""Runaway Root Beers"" again."
But here's a nice tip because you gave us very good service.
Where did that money come from?
- Just be glad I had it.
- Thank you.
It's okay.
We're a team.
What the hell are we gonna do?
I know one thing.
We're gonna put on a brave face.
It's best that the kids don't know how bad things are right now.
We... are... fucked.
"Ooh, it's colder in here than it is outside."
"Okay, Kevin, I'm coming in now!"
I'm not doing anything!
One new message.
"Frank, it's Bob Pogo."
We used to work together at Mohican...
Airways.
It's an airline... down at the airport.
"Aw, shit, you know who I am!"
Here's the thing...
- Is somebody there?
"- Jesus, Dolores, hang up the extension!"
You don't have to bite my head off.
"I'm sorry, dear."
Don't cry.
"- So, Frank..."
Wash your hands first.
Where did that hair come from?
- Where?
- There?
That black thing.
Oh!
There's another one.
"Oh, wait."
It's the full moon!
I must be turning into the beast!
"Yeah, that moustache could do with a trim, too."
- I can see some...
- Ssh!
- Rhydian?
"- 'Listen, mate.'"
I've got a bit of a vomiting situation with my substitute parents.
They're throwing up everywhere.
Oh!
"Yeah, and I'm on bucket duty so I'm not going to be able to make it out."
"OK, well..."
"Oh, there she blows."
"Right, I've got to go."
No Rhydian?
What is it with everyone today?
Must be the full moon.
"You know, we don't have to do this."
- What?
- Stay here.
I don't care how your parents try and justify this.
It's still a cage.
It's still unnatural.
We agreed.
Cool.
That I'm on the list.
"Well, I can't say I'm surprised."
You made my top ten.
Just squeaked in there.
"Well, I don't even know if I'm going to do it."
Why wouldn't you?
I have my reasons.
"So don't do it, then."
"So, you don't think I should do it?"
"Alex, are you asking my permission?"
No.
Why would I need to do that?
It's not like we're...
It was one date.
One motorcycle ride.
'Cause I'm really not the possessive type.
Good.
'Cause I'm not really... a possession.
Can I see you tonight?
"Yeah, I'd like that."
"Oh, no, not tonight."
I've got to prepare for a deposition.
Tomorrow night?
- Tomorrow's tough.
- Working at the tavern?
"No, I, uh..."
I've kind of got a date.
Really?
Not a date date.
It's a blind date.
It was set up a week ago.
That means... we pretend that we've done nothing for two weeks.
"Put him on, I want to talk to him... I want to talk to him..."
At least give him my message.
I simply can't do that.
No.
Why do they want the material?
"No, answer me."
Why do they want the material?
We don't want to use it as a pillow.
"Yes... ln any case, that's impossible."
Yes... lt sounds as if we're guilty!
I'll contact him myself.
I'll call...
Good-bye.
"Hello, are you well?"
"- Yes, thank you."
- What do you want?
Can I have a word with Farzad?
Sohrabi?
Yes.
He's sitting an exam.
I know. lt won't take a minute.
Please call him for me.
Sohrabi!
You're wanted.
Are you well?
Yes.
Are you sitting an exam?
Yes.
is there a question that you can't answer?
"No, I know them all."
I want to apologise about this morning.
"C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, Henry."
You... little... pussy.
"Gentlemen, please go check that shit out."
Freeze!
"Give peace a chance, brothers."
My ego wants to kill you but higher-self doesn't.
"Jesus, baby."
She was talking to the man.
Shit.
Look at this.
Dude's got memory lock on.
"Well, that's all I can do for you, mate."
Time for a reboot.
"See you in about 15 minutes, hopefully."
Hey.
He's awake.
You might see a bit blurry.
"It's just your depth perception trying to calibrated, yeah?"
"Follow me as I walk, yeah?"
Get up.
Okay.
Alright.
Now.
Can you focus only over here?
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Burying you is like burying treasure.
I really don't understand what Akan's think because...
"Henry, stop kicking around."
"You're almost there, mate."
Here's where you gotta get to.

I didn't-
- I didn't know I had it in me.
"But when duty called, I found the strength to be a hero."
"I only hope one day, both of you get a chance to know how that feels."
"Actually, I was a lifeguard one summer in high school."
"And I saved, like, 15 people from drowning."
"Well, I'm a brain surgeon, so I've saved two or three..."

"Oh, those-- those-- those are good stories, too."
"Oh, yeah, but how did you stop that guy's pants from being pulled down?"
How did you pulled that off?
"I didn't know I had it in me, but when duty called,"
I found the strength to be a hero.
- It's nothing.
- It didn't look like nothing.
Matty tells me you broke his heart.
He found his rebound girl.
There's a tomb underneath the church.
You saved everyone in the church?
"27 vampires, Damon."
You can't just bring them back.
It's Harper.
I'm glad you found us.
"Annabelle, close the door, please."
You guys have been watching the same thing the whole time?
There are over 150 channels.
It's called a remote control.
This button changes the channel.
Hold it like this.
"- Did you get enough, sweetheart?"
- For now.
Are you hungry?
Do you want a little?
No.
"Thank you, Miss Givens."
Why don't you lay down for a while and get some rest?
She's fine.
"Aren't you, Miss Givens?"
"Of course, I am."
I'm fine.

"Bawacog, Croutch, Dark_Chii, McFly, MiniBen314, Thirteen."
What?
I'm trying to sleep.
When he was high.
That went on for about 3 or 4 years.
Until one day he strangled me.
And I'd had enough.
I told him he should let me go.
I'd come right back.
"I put my daughter to bed, left her room and stabbed him with a knife."
Six.
Seven.
Ow!
Twelve.
- Come now.
"- Thank you, Master Walter."
Good girl.
It's not even warm yet.
And then I met Marcel.
He was the first man.
I got into SM with.
"He showed me all kinds of things, candle wax and everything."
Until alcohol also came into play.
When he was drunk he had no taboos.
"He tortured me to the extreme with needles, whips, you name it."
Until I ran away covered in blood.
I was in hospital.
laid charges against him.
He got 4 years.
Which he had to serve.
And that was that.
One.
- Two.
- A children's toy.
"From Toys ""R"" Us."
- I'm just making conversation.
No one else in this house likes me.
At least I can talk to you.
- Especially if you need someone to talk to.

"Oh, please, I'm eating."
"So seriously, how well do you know Anna?"
I know Anna extremely well.
Uh-huh.
"Well, know that you can talk to me about anything."
I'm here to answer any questions that you have to help you in any way I can.
Why?
Because your dad would want me to.
"I'm, uh..."
I'm good.
"Uh-oh, Cherie."
You won again.
Hope I'm wearing my good underwear.
Tonight's just one blast from the past after another.
"- No, no, no."

Mm.

DAMON:
Mm.
"It's good to see you, Isobel."
Just having fun with your naughty little minion.
ISOBEL:
Mm.
How'd you find me?
I searched all the bank-owned foreclosures and found the most expensive one.
"Oh, I should have known."
That's not true.
I'm not going to have a child until there's peace in the world.
You just confuse me when you make declarations like that out of the blue.
"OK, I take it back."
I'll put it this way:
"Until the world becomes a peaceful place,"
"I'll be dancing alone, waiting all by myself."
How's that?
"Sounds like something out of a religion called ""dance""."
Good morning.
Thank you.
You're early.
"Yes, yes."
Just a moment.
"Tomoko-san, the phone is for you."
OK.
Excuse me.
"Hello, hello, this is Tomoko."
Yes.
Yes.
Alright.
"I'm sorry, but may I go out for a bit."
"Yes, certainly."
Sorry about this.
Tomoko.
Yes?
"Things are difficult for you, aren't they."
I'm certain about that.
I can tell.
"Yes, there is."
I'll tell you later.
"Pick a good time, but let's talk soon, OK?"
Yes.
"Hey, would you like to hear about Jesus Christ?"
Here you go.
Would you like to hear
"Excuse me, would you like to hear about Jesus Christ today?"
Like to hear about Jesus Christ?
- Okay.
"- Thank you very much, sir."
Would you like to hear about Jesus Christ?
Have a great day.
Would you like to hear about Jesus Christ today?
But what made him come back?
Won't you answer?
Nathan?
... right turn.
It doesn't recover.
We're dropping the...

"Of the 45 passengers on board, nine belonged to the same family."
All from Haiti.
So?
So they're afraid of getting fucked over by the Warsaw Convention.
"I explained to them that doesn't exist here, but they're scared, even still."
They set up a committee.
This is leading by example?
"It's not for us, stupido."
It's for the clients.
They're allowed to have pudding on their spa day.
It's like a -- a last hurrah before the real work starts.

"Yeah, 30 seconds."

"Okay, uh, I'll just come around, make sure everybody's form is okay, make sure you're, uh, keeping your cores tight, and, uh, your --"
"uh, good job."
Great.
Straighten that back out.
Yeah?
"Yeah, I got a good look."
"Yeah, yeah."

"Sure, I'll take care of him."
"Out of the way, blubberhead."
The famine is on.
"Guys, want some cigarettes?"
All you guys can have cigarettes off me.
"You better pack them now, boys."
Here comes the beef trust.
How do you do?
- A nickel you don't conk him.
"- All right, a nickel I do."
"- You missed him, chump."
- Yeah.
A nickel apiece you owe.
That cop don't walk right or something.
"- Those cops are so dumb, it's pathetic."
- You'd think they'd learn where a tomato comes from in police college.
Look.
"Hello, toots."
You want the bottle?
You want the bottle?
"Oh, nuts."
Hey!
What are you doing with my baby?
"""Hey!"
"What are you doing with my baby?"" Here's your baby!"
- You loafer!
I'll get the cops after you!
"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
"I put my name in for seven songs, so I'll be back up here again."
"- Uh, yes."
- Wow.
- Instant classic.
- Wow.
- That was really scary.
"- Yeah, yeah."
I was very scared there for a minute.
"Honestly, you're like a crazy person."
"Okay, I'm not crazy."
"It's just been a crazy week, Anders."
Okay?
Okay.
Brent Hoffman died.
Who's Brent Hoffman?
He was my favorite cat.
"You... you had to put him down, huh?"
"Uh, no, no."
He was eaten by two of my other cats.
Really hard to watch.
"Hey, I really appreciate you guys coming to one of my sing-alongs finally."
- Yeah.
- It's fun.
"And as a ""thank you,"""
I've got some extra tickets to the Rihanna concert this weekend.

The guy from downtown.
"The guy there from where Christie used to live, there?"
"The guy who disappeared up the block from Christie, the one they made the beef on."
You know the guy I mean?
His name was Batts.
His people are driving everybody crazy looking for him.
Nobody knows what happened to him.
He came into the joint that one night and then he just disappeared.
And for dinner.
Your secret room rocked my world.
"Yeah, it did."
But I am gonna give you a deadline.
A deadline?
For our date...
A real date.
It's got to happen tonight.
You get dressed up.
So do I.
"I pick you up... not here, but at your apartment."
"Where is that, by the way?"
"- Oh, it's not far... at all."
"- Okay, good."
And we'll go to my favorite restaurant.
"And afterwards, I show you my place."
Mm.
I-I need a little bit more advance notice.
"How... how about the last Saturday of this month,"
- 'cause tonight I have this...
- Cancel it.
"Look, if you don't do this for me, I..."
I don't know.
"Because your life is here, but... mine is not."
I got it.
You're right.
- I'll meet you by the elevators.
- Mm-hmm.
6:00 P.M.?
And if you aren't there...
I won't be back again.
Mother.
"It's dirty, there's something in the..."
- Jerry.
- What?
What are you doing?
Being forced to work quickly.
"- Normally, I'd be much more charming."
- Take it back!
"It was the biggest mistake I ever made, in my life,"
- not giving that to you.
- Don't... don't...
- Don't do this.
- The situation calls for a grand gesture.
That's all I got.
"I love you, Mel."
"And not being with you, it hurts."
Every day.
"- And it's my fault, I blew it."
- Stop.
"You're right, I should stop."
Jerry this...
- ... isn't going to work.
- It could.
It did.
And then it didn't.
Keep it.
I don't want to throw it away.
OK.
"So, like, hmm, I am..."
"I'm, well..."
"My boyfriend, Luke, hi Luke, he.. he said that he... he wants me to do this, and he told me he doesn't think that I will."
"I, Stacey Ragota, hereby accept the cinnamon challenge."
OK.
I'm ashamed now.
"But I got nowhere else to go, Paulie."
You're all I got.
"And I really, really need your help. I really do."
Take this.
And now I've got to turn my back on you.
Thirty-two hundred bucks.
That's what he gave me.
"$3,200 for a lifetime."
It wasn't even enough to pay for the coffin.
-We got to get out.
-I don't want to run.
Am I supposed to pick up and leave everything?
Go hiding?
"I don't want to do that, Henry."
Is that what you want?
"Karen, lf we stay around here we're dead."
You got it?
We're dead.
They're right.
You took too much of that stuff.
You're totally paranoid.
How's he doing?
He's okay.
They sobered him up.
Good.
Glad to hear it.
-You know what kind of questions they been asking him?
-l don't know.
I got my mind on so many other things.
I got no money.
The girls are old enough to read the newspapers.
- Really?
Wow!
I didn't know that.
All right then.
"Okay, let's celebrate."
"Yeah, because the new number i have in mind is about half a mil."
[Spits]
[ Clears Throat ]
"Come here, Russ."
- I rather not.
"- Russ, come sit down."
"- No, no."
"- Russ, sit the fuck down!"
Okay.
"Unfortunately, Russell, we have a new wrinkle in the situation."
"Oh, really?"
What's the wrinkle?
Basically I had to play pinata with Jerry the bookie's skull.
- That ups the invoice a little.
- Is he okay?
"- No, he's dead."
- Oh!
"Oh, God."
"You know, okay."
I'm really uncomfortable with this kind of conversation.
"You know, not to mention,"
I broke my 1986 World Series commemorative bat.
"- Oh, yeah?"
- It was a gift from my mother.
"She's gettin' a little old, and she's not feeling good these days."
- Hasn't left the house in 6 weeks.
"- Okay, just give me -"
"She wants to work for me, because she needs money."
What for?
She has all she needs here!
"Just sit down, Franz."
You want something to drink?
Coffee?
Quick!
Come in and shut the door!
"No sleep last night, Franz?"
You need money?
I don't need money!
- Put the gun down!
What's going to happen now?
"You'll slaughter your family, or what?"
I don't want to show up in the newspaper like that!
"I said, I don't need money!"
Franz doesn't need money.
Does it work with the suit?
"Yes, the suit looks good."
I look old.
No.
I would say mature.
I'd like to ask you something.
The tie looks good on you.
If you think so.
There is still a problem.
It'll be fine.
Are you coming with me?
I don't think I'd make it through an evening like this.
You don't have to.
I know.
Just tonight.
Shining City.
"All right, Tom."
"Step out of the truck for me, please."
Sure.
"- Open up the back for me, please."
- Sure.
All right.
"Heel, bud."

- Keep your weapons facedown.
[Gunfire In Distance]
We're SEALs.
We're supposed to know how to use a firearm.
If you had taught him how to load that thing... there wouldn't have been an accidental discharge.
The guy nearly blew my foot off.
It's like my 12-year-old sister handling a gun.
"No, my sister actually handles a gun better than these contras."
We were doing so well.
She never even got to see my penis.
Ta-da!
Who wants some more coffee?
"Thanks, yeah."
Sure.
Let me help you.
Nice to see that the gals are getting along.
"""Gals""?"
"Who are you, Fred Flintstone?"
This trip to India sounds fun.
"Yeah, I think it will be."
Are you concerned your parents might not approve of Leonard?
A little.
They're very old-fashioned.
"Well, I wouldn't worry about it."
"It's not like you guys are getting engaged, right?"
"Oh, God, no."
We're not there yet.
Not engaged.
Very interesting.
I have to tinkle.
You've been in there a lot tonight.
Are you okay?
Yes.
Are you writing a book?
Why are you getting upset?
I'm not upset.
Maybe you're upset.
What's up with you?
Bernadette?
I can't do this anymore!
He must be someone famous.
Stand back.
I'm going to jump.
"Go ahead, you first."
Rm lumping now.
Go ahead.
I'll wait for my turn.
I'm jumping because nobody loves me.
Nobody loves me either.
I'll get the fireworks going and jump into the garbage can.
How could anyone love someone in this world?
I'm the least loved person in this world.
Me too.
Marjukka doesn't love either of us.
-No.
Let's count to three.
One...
You could've made a good father for me but Mom's too difficult.
Three.
You skipped two.
I'm sorry.
I'll try again.
One...
Two...
I knew you'd chicken out.
There's an ostrich down there.
-What?
Look...
Let's make sure there are no feathers on the scooter.
Then we're out of here.
Do you really think that ostriches would like it here?
It's gotta be around here...
- We talked for an hour.
- Oh.
Oh.
Ah!
You've no memory of this.
- He was really drunk.
- Oh God.
I'm such an idiot.
I'm an idiot.
- Meredith was right about you
- No.
"- About me, about the whole thing."
- No.
Meredith was not right.
"It doesn't matter that I don't remember the specifics of what I said, because I was drunk when I said them and, you know..."
- In Vino Veritas.
- In Vino Veritas
"I mean, we know Vino Veritas is Latin for a reason."
It's just that you said some really beautiful things.
- You did.
- That's when I cried.
"I meant those things that I said, every word."
"Yeah, ok."
"Alright, we should get going."
You need to get your stuff.
It's like an hour to Sudbury or something.
You're gonna drive us?
- You asked me to.
- You asked her to.
Right.
Right.
"Hey, can we stop at a mall or something?"
"Ah, shit."
"Yeah, that's ah, that's palladium."
"Riley, you're a fucking idiot."
"Man, just say what?"
Don't talk to my crew like that.
At least he's doin' something.
Have you tried playing dead?
I gotta show you somethin'.
"Blair, I don't get it."
"I mean, there's nothing in this house."
Why would anyone keep it on lock down?
It gets worse.
Great.
"What, we gonna pay Timmy Song back with with a 200 dollar TV?"
So he's into low-budget slasher flicks.
"Really, really big special effects budgets."
Same place.
Same place.
"Ollie, I'm really scared."
Blair.
Let's get out of here.
"I was gonna say I'm really scared too, but yeah, let's get the fuck outta here."
How can Conner's inside not know this?
Hey.
"He had an inside, right?"
That's what it said in the plans.
"No, he lied on the plans."
There's no inside.
Shit.
Connor!
Shit.
It's all your fuckin' fault.
It's too hot in this gown.
We always feel the heat when we're going on a date.
What if we got found out?
I'm scared.
Don't be scared.
I'm here for you.
"When it comes to girls, you've got to be brave."
"If you have little courage, you must have a thick skin."
- I've got an idea to show off your heroism.
- How?
The painted face you're afraid of will come for you tonight.
- You slapped me!
"- No, I was swatting mosquitoes."
"Don't be scared, don't be scared."
Watch me teach him a lesson!
Block.
- Kick me now.
- How?
- From the bottom.
- OK.
You got the wrong place.
- Not like that.
Harder.
- Harder?
That's too hard!
Get lost!
This young man has great potential.
This is the proudest moment of my life.
Sifu Wong.
I feel safe around you.
Really?
I'm sorry.
We're moving to a new home.
Why?
I thought you loved to live by the sea.
I do.
Beautiful sea breezes.
I can imagine the view ofthe clear blue sky... and the deep blue sea.
Great!
Packyour things and wait for me.
I'll be here.
Why didn't you leave Hong Kong immediately?
What stopped you?
- Are you the new janitor?
- Yes.
You're doing a lousy job.
This is a fire escape.
"Look, there's garbage everywhere."
What if there's a fire?
I can't fy away like a phoenix.
I pay my monthly maintenance fee.
"If I find you goofing offagain, I'll file a complaint."
Don't leave any garbage here.
Move it all away.
Shit!
"Jeffrey, you're back."
"Yes,Jenny."
Are you with a friend?
"Yes, he's my old football buddy."
We grew up in the same squatter area.
Yes.
He's...
"I'm Dumbo, he's Mickey Mouse."
That's what you called each other?
Wait.
Hold it.
"Hey, come on."
"We're all concerned with human rights, for God's sakes."
"But the kids who want to get education have a right, too!"
Yeah!
Yeah!
Don't you understand?
"It's against your own principle, for God's sake!"
Yeah!
Yeah!
You can't accomplish anything by shutting kids out of their school.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Hold it!
Hold it!
"If you want to effect any change, you have to do it within the system."
Director:
"Ok, cut."
That's a wrap.
"I think I'll walk home tonight, Mike."
Take that and drop it by my house.
"Good night, tom."
Good night.
There's not a day in my life that I don't feel like a fraud.
"Priests, doctors, lawyers-- I've talked to them all."
I don't know anyone who hasn't felt that.
[Airplane flies over]
Hello?
In here.
Hi.
How did your day go?
I swear I didn't do it.
Who did this?
Brother...
Brother...
Brother...
Konda Reddy somehow knew about our people trying to escape.
They are taking away small children.
I tried to save a few.
But they found them.
Let the attrocities end with me.
You must save our men.
Let me be the last man to die.
Leave no one.
- Father...
- Kill me.
You bastard!
You came looking for your father.
Kill me now.
How dare you kill my man Cuddappah Raja?
Now kill me.
"You said he'll come as your saviour, right?"
I will kill him infront of your eyes.
and put his dead body under Gocha's feet.
"Velu, don't worry about me."
We must save these people.
Kill him.
Kill him.
He is my son Velu.
Vetri Velu.
"Konda Reddy, you think you can kill me?"
My son will surely send you to hell.
"If you are a real man, fight with him."
"Wait, look here."
See where the skin's broken?
Bastard even bit me.
Where does the guy live?
"Why, you gonna go there?"
I think I should.
Don't.
You'll regret it.
"It's just a suspicion, but..."
You know how the villagers have been dying out recently?
He's got something to do with it.
He's not human.
Give me his address.
It's out in the middle of nowhere.
You've gotta have a general idea.
It's hard to explain in words.
It's deep in the valley somewhere.
How much further is it?
Still a ways ahead.
Shit!
What's the matter?
It's there.
Over there.
I don't see a house.
Look.
Right over there.
"Whoa, isn't that a deer?"
"So, you weren't making this up."
"What did I tell you, dammit?"
What in God's name...
What's happening?
Look.
I brought you the best seafood.
It was the Mano-there he is.
Hi.
He asked me.
-It is my language.
I'm sorry.
If direction is not the feeling satisfied.
Can I get more.
"No Sven, I bet you have others more hungry than me."
I understand.
See you at dinner?
I'm kinda busy.
Kinda busy.
Even more!
She is beautiful.
"Honey, are you okay?"
Are you sure he no relation to Ramon?
You Ingracia!
"Should not scoff at someone, just because it's different."
Even someone who is having more a lot of work to save us.
-You are right.
When Sven- teach them all to fly.
It will be a rising up.
"-Erik, not ..."
-Get out of here.
-You will see.
Who dropped the fish?
"Guys, what's happening with the fish?"
Fish friends what's the problem?
The birds eat.
"Sven, you must fly on the wings of hope and ask them to help brothers emperors."
I'd love to know but ...
Previously on Fringe:
- There is more than one of everything.
OLIVIA:
Who the hell is this guy?
BROYLES:
We've recorded him at over three dozen scenes all of which relate to the Pattern.
- Why?
What is he doing?
BROYLES:
Watching.
Observing.
- We refer to him as the Observer.
WALTER:
"We were dead, Peter."
Until someone grabbed me.
"We were saved, both of us, by a man that I had never met."
- You talked to him?
WALTER:
He wouldn't be any use.
He just observes.
I have said too much.
I am not supposed to get involved.
MAN:
Nice specs.
I've never seen anything like them before.
They're from somewhere far away.
I don't have any money.
"Oh, that's okay."
I'm gonna give you one of these anyway.
There.
"Oh, that's great."
Thank you.
So far you haven't shown me a thing.
"You keep shootin' your mouth off, I'm gonna knock you right into next week."
- Knock it off.
- Don't tell me to knock it off.
"Cut it out, will ya, for Christ's sakes!"
There's nothin' goin' down.
Get some sleep.

- It's worth the half million?
- How many kilos?
- 60.
- 60 kilos...
"Eight big ones a kilo, right?"
This stuffll take a seven-to-one hit on the street.
"By the time it gets down to nickel bags, it'll be 32 million."
"Thank you, Howard."
Take what's left there with you and good night.
Uh-uh.
- Sure!
"- Clean-up time, Jocelyn."
"Jocelyn, how are you doing?"
Where have you been?
"Hi, Nate, I need to pick up Sebastian's packages."
Really?
What are his packages:
Big or small?
It's his luggage from the trip to St. Bart.
It's that stuff back there.
"It's too big for you, Jocelyn."
We'll take it up.
- Thanks.
- While you're here...
- do you think you can help us out?
- Sure.
What is it?
We found this package outside our door this morning...
But it didn't have no telephone extention or return number.
"So we took it to the 4th, Time Square, but..."
- That's Conde Nest.
- Yeah.
"It was addressed to an Andre Leon Talley, but..."
Andre Leon Talley?
Let me see this.
"I don't even know where it came from, what can I do with it?"
I'll take it.
Thanks!
"Slow down, punter foot."
This isn't Sports Ilustrated.
Look what I just found in the messenger center.
- Where did you get this?
So she is in town to kill someone.
And this is the site of her hit.
Hey.
Hey.
"I'm--look, I'm sorry."
I...
Are you okay?
Yeah.
"Yeah, I'm fine."
I'm just...
"I got a lot of stuff to do, you know?"
Can I take a rain check?
Sure.
Catch up with you later?
"Yeah, absolutely."
Okay.
Bye.
Are we way off base here?
Maybe we're chasing after something that doesn't even exist.
Has anyone ever told you to stick to your first instinct?
I've heard it once or twice.
I'm sure you have.
I want 'em at least another 15 feet back from the stage.
"Officer, hi."
What's going on here?
Setting up for tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
Big human rights celebration.
Joseph Dellaman's giving a speech.
The ex-political prisoner?
The rally's here.
He's giving his speech in the square.
Yup.
- Can I tell you something?
- What?
Don't take this the wrong way
I never got it.
I never thought she was right for you.
"You're too... wild, too alive."
I was wondering if maybe you needed a place to stay tonight.
Griff!
"Natasha's not here, but don't panic."
I got an address from the manager for 20 bucks.
"Hugh, we were thinking about maybe calling it a night..."
No!
No way.
We're on a quest.
He's on a quest!
With a vision.
I did not know that.
- You have a vision?
"- Yes, he does."
It involves a fertility clinic and a stripper.
It's beautiful.
"Sounds gross, actually."
- You can come too.
"- No, you can't."
You're not in the vision.
She's not in the vision.
Marla.
It was good seeing you.
"You too, Griff."
Good luck.
"You OK, baby?"
"IT WAS AFTER SCHOOL, WE GO INTO THE STORE,"
"AND WE'RE TRYING TO FIND, UH, WHAT LITTLE CANDIES WE GONNA BUY"
WITH THESE FEW PENNIES WE HAD IN OUR POCKET.
"AND IN WALKED OUR HERO, JACKIE ROBINSON."
WE WERE STARTLED.
"AND HE PAID FOR HIS NEWSPAPERS,"
"AND HE TURNED TO WALK OUT, AND HE TURNED BACK AND SAID,"
"""WOULD YOU GUYS LIKE SOME ICE CREAM?"""
"EVERYBODY SAID, ""YES, MR. ROBINSON."""
"HE SAID, ""NO, NO, NO."
CALL ME JACKIE.
"CALL ME JACKIE."""
I WAS SO EXCITED...
MY KNEES WERE KNOCKING...
TO SEE A REAL HERO WHO LOOKED LIKE US.
WE SHUFFLED OUR FEET.
WE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.
WE DIDN'T HAVE THE COURAGE TO SAY ANYTHING.
"BUT HE SPOKE, YOU KNOW, GAVE US KIND OF A PEP TALK."
NOW WE SAW HIM AS SOMEONE WE COULD ALMOST TOUCH.
AND HE BECAME EVEN MORE INTENSELY OUR HERO.
[VEHICLE HORN HONKS]
[INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS]
NARRATOR:
"IN MARCH OF 1948,"
JACKIE ROBINSON REPORTED TO SPRING TRAINING 25 POUNDS OVERWEIGHT.
HE ADMITTED HE WAS TOO HEAVY BUT SHRUGGED IT OFF.
"""WAIT UNTIL OPENING DAY,"" HE PROMISED."
[CHEERING]
"BUT WHEN THE SEASON BEGAN,"
ROBINSON WAS SLUGGISH ON THE BASE PATHS
AND BY MID-JUNE STILL HADN'T STOLEN A BASE.
I remember something like that.
"I like to poke Michael, because..."
You're so cute when you flinch.
When you recoil with horror.
"Poke, poke, poke."
- Here's some hotness.
- These guys are good.
- Sexy.
- Great chemistry.
"I don't know why, but these guys..."
"They, like, auditioned together, right?"
Norah!
Norah!
Norah!
"Oh, my God, Pete."
This is that crazy shot where they had like...
"They put the wall back, remember?"
"When it goes all the way around, someone was putting the wall back."
- Really?
"- Yeah, it was like a 3-D shot."
"- Oh, my gosh."
- This one was...
This was cake icing on my hand.
- It was?
- Yup.
- It looked like paint.
- Have a sweet dessert.
"- After this, you licked your fingers?"
- I licked that wall.
Check out Mike's performance here.
"Oh, well, there's a..."
What?
"Most of all, friends."
You don't sum up a man's life in one moment.
"There are no cold answers, are there?"
There's no simple yes or no.
A man's life is not the bricks.
It's the mortar.
It's the stuff that lays between.
The stuff--
The stuff you can't see.
I've known Walter my whole life.
God!
He's a decent man.
-He's a good man.
-But this is tough stuff.
This is body-bag stuff.
Tell me if there's some other way.
There isn't.
Die's been cast.
It was cast a long time ago.
Go easy.
Give him a blindfold and have mercy.
"Walter Stern was a tough man, but he was fair."
We give back the same.
No?
And you be careful.
Keep George with you.
Let him drive.
I gotta go in here.
I knew James Wakeley would surface...
... justasIknew when that bullet hit that boy...
... itwouldkeeptraveling.
And find its way... ?
You're a...
You're an action figure!
You are a child's plaything!
"You are a sad, strange little man, and you have my pity."
Farewell.
"Oh, yeah?"
"Well, good riddance, ya loony!"
"""Rendezvous with Star Command."""
"-Hey, gas dude!"
-You talkin' to me?
"-Yeah, man."
Can you help me?
-Pizza Planet?
Andy!
Do you know where Cutting Boulevard is?
"Oh, no!"
I can't show my face in that room without Buzz.
-Buzz!
"Buzz, come back!"
-Go away!
No!
"Buzz, you gotta come back!"
I...
I found a spaceship!
"It's a spaceship, Buzz!"
"Come on, man, hurry up!"
"Like, the pizzas are getting cold here!"
"-Cutting Boulevard, huh?"
"-Yeah, yeah."
Which way?
"Now, you're sure this space freighter will return to its port of origin once it jettisons its food supply?"
"And when we get there, we'll be able to find a way to transport you home."
About what?
Maybe we should take him to see a shrink.
"Look, honey."
"If we can just be patient,"
I think we can handle this.
We both love Mikey; right?
We're the ones that are gonna help him out.
Mom.
Mom!
( Gasping ) Mikey.
I was looking for you.
- What are you doing?
- I have something for you.
"Mikey, you have to learn to knock."
They're for being such a great mom.
Why don't you take the flowers downstairs and put them in some water while I get out; okay?
Mom.
Hmm?
"Mom, what if I..."
I'm getting cold.
"If I threw this in the bathtub, it would work just like an electric chair."
You're right.
Be a good boy and unplug it.
( Gunfire on TV )
This is so cool when they blast their way out.
- How do you know?
- I've seen it three times.
"Hi, guys."
How many dead?
"I know how much you miss your cat, so I got you a new one."
"Oh, thank you, Mick."
( Doorbell Ringing )
"Oh, they're a bunch of fucking liars."
The president is a liar.
I think there may be a problem.
Only problem is you motherfucker think I can't hear you!
"Hi, Mr. Freeman."
Unh!
Hey!
"Damn it, watch where you're going, bitch!"
What the fuck is wrong with you?
!
Shit I ought to whup your big ass!
Now get the fuck out of my way!
"- Slow down, granddad!"
"- Granddad, watch out for that curb!"
Ow!
I can't find my seat belt!
"Whoa, hey, granddad, I think we should talk about your eyesight and whether it's safe to drive."
I've been driving my whole life!
I don't need to know how to see to drive!
Shut up!
"Now, what the fuck is this?"
!
I hate when people do that.
I hate it!
I hate it!
I fucking Hate it!
That was supposed to be our space!
You know what?
You know what?
!
Fuck That!
"That's our space, God damn it!"
Can't stand it!
Can't stand it!
Why are they treating this car like it's a hotel?
What's wrong?
Why did you suddenly stop?
It's no fun.
Okay.
I can get out.
What are you doing?
Are you teasing me?
What's the matter?
Did something happen?
Just restrain yourself for another 2 minutes.
We will be arriving at the hotel in 2 minutes.
"Hey, who do you think you are?"
"If I say I can't help it, what will you do?"
Hey?
!
"Even if I am prepared to be understanding,"
"I just can't stand you people, I can't drive you anymore."
I'm not driving!
I quit!
I quit!
Hey!
Drive.
I'm not driving.
I quit.
You!
We originally agreed that I will get 20 000 Won for driving you there.
Just give me 10 000 won.
What?
"I've worked, so you need to at least pay right?"
"- No, I want to help you."
"Mr MacGregor, if I mentioned the name Dennis, and that I know that you're being ""B""-ed..."
"- ""B""-ed?"
"- Well, blackmailed."
"- Look, may I come in?"
- Wee Sonny MacGregor blackmailed?
- I think you're mistaken.
- You're wondering why I'm here.
"I know why you're here, friend."
"You're being ""B""-ed, too."
"- No, I'm a complete outsider."
- I wouldn't say that.
"Please, let me explain."
A young lady came to see me...
You're a lucky fellow.
"Good luck to you, sir, and good day."
- Mr MacGregor?
- Go away.
You'll regret this.
- How did he find out?
- I don't know.
Why didn't you let him talk?
He obviously wanted an ally.
The more friends we have now...
Make an ally of that idiot?
"No, thank you."
I'll rely on my bomb.
And now... for the gunpowder.
(Doorbell)
Bill!
"Oh, Bill!"
Honey!
You must have dropped it.
Thank you.
Is everything there?
Yes.
I didn't touch anything.
Thank you.
Where are you going?
Home.
May I walk you there?
I've got nothing to do.
"Yes, but I'm going home."
"Yes, of course."
Good.
I couldn't live without dancing.
And I love watching it.
Do you like dancing?
I guess so.
"Well, yes."
But I've never gone to see anything.
"What else do you do, besides dancing?"
"I love traveling, and I go to the Cinematheque a lot to see films."
Recently I've discovered silent cinema.
It's my favorite.
Silent cinema?
Yes.
What do you do when you go out?
I don't go out.
You must go out sometime.
"I was looking after my mother, but she died two months ago."
I'm sorry.
"My mother died too, but a long time ago."
"Well, we're here."
"Yes, my lord."
She is quite important to me.
Too important.
- Master...
- Silence.
I can sense her powers growing stronger.
I would hate to think you are training your own sith... apprentice to destroy me.
Never.
My allegiance is to you and you alone.
Then you must prove it.
Eliminate her.
She's my most trusted...
I said eliminate her!
"As you wish, my lord."
Ventress.
Split up.
Looks like I'm her favorite.
I'm kind of disappointed.
Only the droids follow me.
You want to race?
Come on.
I'm going to need some help.
Where are you?
I'm hit!
I'm heading toward the separatist flagship.
I see you.
I've got her.
"Master, I need your help quickly."
I'm surrounded.
"You have already lost the battle, child."
I've ordered your reinforcements to return.
No.
"One call to Dale, we're back on track."
Absolutely!
Let's do it.
What is wrong with you?
He threatened us.
Just remember that.
- It is extortion.
- Does that mean he's gotta be dead?
- We're not giving him our money.
- What money?
That worthless scrap of shit?
"Yeah, okay."
"Maybe it's time for your friend, the drug-addicted carpet installer."
"- Oh, Scatter."
- Scatter!
Yeah!
He could help.
This is killing me.
I have slept five hours this whole week.
"- Oh, God, here we go."
- I have dandruff with big flakes.
I've gained two pounds!
Listen to my voice.
I'm losing my instrument.
Shouting isn't helping.
"- [Woman] Hey, Gig?"
- Yeah?
There's a couple of cops in the club asking for you.
- I'll be right in.
"- Oh, great!"
Cops in the club.
I've always wanted to give an inmate fame.
Did you say that to him?
Something like that.
Strong words.
Something like that.
Strong words.
Did you mean it?
Did you mean it?
'Course I didn't.
'Course I didn't.
I was het up.
I was het up.
"You threatened to kill a man who's now missing,"
"You threatened to kill a man who's now missing, possibly dead."
possibly dead.
OK.
Where were you Friday night from 6:00 onwards?
OK.
Where were you Friday night from 6:00 onwards?
I was having a business dinner with associates at La Scala -
I was having a business dinner with associates at La Scala - it's an Italian restaurant here in town.
it's an Italian restaurant here in town.
OK.
Can you give me some names?
OK.
Can you give me some names?
Sure.
Sure.
Malcolm Paris was there.
Malcolm Paris was there.
"Country town, Warwick."
Everybody knows everybody.
"Country town, Warwick."
It's when I'm nervous.
I used to sing that song to my children.
When they are scared.
To help them sleep.
"And now, whenever I am frightened..."
"Beautiful story, now shut the fuck up."
Shit.
"Hey, hey, no, no."
They are Massalit.
Villagers.
Farmers.
Why are they running?
- That's why.
- Janjaweed.
JACOUB:
What do we do?
Depends how many there are.
Let's take one alive and find out.
- You take the wheel.
- What?
Drive right up beside him.
You son of a bitch.
Jacoub!
Get off there and translate for me.
He's going to tell us where the camp is.
(SPEAKING IN SUDANESE ARABIC)
"If you become Tahir's woman, it will make you safe."
And you also.
I promise.
You cannot save everyone.
That's what Bakri said.
"But saving even one person, surely, would be something."
Hey.
Hey.
Hey!
I can't believe you guys are both here again.
Neither can I.
I can't believe it even more.
"Uh, I thought we agreed Lana was off limits."
"No, I wasn't there for Lana."
"Okay, I care about Noel."
Noah.
His name is Noah.
"It is, right?"
Wait.
Now Noah sounds wrong.
Wait.
"Why are you scolding me, man?"
You were the one bringing her flowers.
They were for norm.
Noel.
Man...
"All right, look, look."
We're both wrong.
"Hitting on Lana is a total violation of several commandments, many edicts, and at least one mores."
Or hang on.
I'm about to blow your mind.
It's only bad if we like the dude.
"Uh-huh, uh-huh, I'm listening."
"Yeah, this guy owes me eight bucks!"
You know what?
He does not return phone calls promptly!
Let me ask you this.
What if he's a racist?
boss?
- You know the drill.
- Pick up my goddamn hat.
Get the hell out of here.
boss?
- Fuck off.
Go!
You've had training.
Some.
don't wake her yet.
Let her sleep another hour.
Logan... without a doubt the most perfect night I've had in a very long time.
But I don't deserve it.
Do I?
I did something.
Something unspeakable.
I've remembered what happened in Westchester.
This is not the first time I've hurt people.
I didn't know.
You wouldn't tell me.
So we just kept on running away from it.
I think I finally understand you.
Logan...
He's fantastic.
You said you only needed the girl!
I told you I was forced to bring a new tool to bear.
Your friends had every chance.
And so did you.
Nate?
Put her down.
Honey.
Will!
I will kill you honourably at dawn tomorrow.
With any weapon you prefer.
You wish to fight me?
You have stolen my lady's affections.
- I wish the chance to avenge myself.
- GEORGE:
Mallefille!
No!
"Very well, monsieur."
I will give you the opportunity.
But not the prize.
Let's go back.
This is ridiculous.
"What, run for my hole like a rabbit?"
I could never respect myself afterwards.
"Nor could you, Aurora."
I'm going to fight at dawn for the right to see another dawn.
- Eugene.
- It's too late.
He's in love.
Monsieur.
Madame.
Welcome.
The doctor is here.
These are my seconds.
The sun is rising.
Shall we go?
Please.
I wonder...
Is there by any chance a cleaner one?
- Don't hurt him.
Aim at the clouds.
MARSHALL:
"Old man Marshall, as long as you're still married to Lily, you're doing just fine."
"Sir, this is on us."
Sorry the wings were so hot.
"Oh, no, dear."
It wasn't that they were too hot.
It's just that I had wings earlier.
Much earlier.

"Kids, back in 2009, your Aunt Robin was the host of a morning show for local New York cable."
And it was on early.
How early?
Mike?
"wakey, wakey."
"But then, everything changed."
Hey.
Hey.
See my show?
"Oh, I meant to watch it."
"I just got so busy with the whole ""being sound asleep"" thing."
"It took all night, eight hours down the drain."
"Oh, it's fine."
But get this:
After the broadcast...
Hi.
Are you Robin?
Yeah.
"I'm Don, your new co-host."
"Don was Don Frank, seasoned veteran of no fewer than 39 local morning news teams from all over the country."
- That's beside the point.
"""Ghastly little man,"" you call him."
Right.
I might as well go to bed.
You coming?
"Not for a minute, no."
"[Man singing on radio, indistinct]"
[Humming]
[Dorcas]:
"So you want pilchards, do you?"
[Janet]:
I think so.
We always used to use coley fish.
I'm sure.
I think pilchards would be better.
"You gonna make it, are you?"
All right.
What did he think of my pasties?
He loved them.
Ha!
Thought he might.
Don't forget the washing.
Looks like rain.
You know...
"When Andrea's able to walk, he's going to need some clothes."
"Yes, I know."
- I thought I'd use some of the money Aunt Elizabeth left me to get him a new outfit.
Why?
"What do you mean, ""why""?"
Why not use our joint account?
What?
We're both responsible for him.
Pardon?
Pate maison?
Yes.
Your lunch date.
"It was with a girl, wasn't it?"
"As a matter of fact, yes, it was."
Des ecrevisses?
Oui.
Now I'm going to spoil your fun.
How dreadful of me.
"Don't tease the animals, Mrs. Brown."
You might get bitten.
Du saumon?
Oui.
"My, we're in a bad mood."
Excellent.
"Et vous aussi, monsieur?"
"Nothing for me, thanks."
Tres bien.
Merci.
Why were you and John glaring at each other when I came in?
I told him our product was 20 years out of style.
A lot of people still buy it.
Three times as many would buy furniture like this.
What's that?
Sketches of a new line of modern furniture that we're not bringing out.
May I look?
You can have them.
Are these your own ideas?
"Well, some of them."
I had a designer working on it.
"Oh, I think they're awfully good."
She could be fucking him right now.
She could be fucking him in Ojai or in a fucking sailboat for all I know.
I appreciate your candor.
I'm both embarrassed and illuminated.
You did nice work today.
Are you gonna be with us tomorrow?
- Every day.
- Indeed.
"Yeah, have you seen Ryan today?"
"Um, he's with his dad dealing with some heavy shit."
"But it's not about you, so don't sweat it."
I don't.
Goddamn right you don't.
Alicia Mendez sweats no man.
- [Chuckles]
"- Yes, ma'am."
[Music playing]
Alvey:
Nate!
"Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
"Hey, what are you doing?"
Sparring with Juan.
"No, no, you're..."
"No, no, you're not."
Come here.
I said no sparring until your head's right.
I'm fine.
You're not fine.
You're not fine.
You're not cleared.
"You're not fucking training until you are, okay?"
Done.
But that leaves us one short to Mick Jagger's.
Van Hoogstratten.
See me in my office.
What is it?
You ok?
I'm in!
Congratulations!
"Now, let's go out the homosex."
You know...
"The tall guy, Ralph?"
What?
He's gay!
Standing in the fog always gives me strange feelings.
Yeah.
This is something that only really happens in winter.
"But, I wonder if Saho can knows this place."
Ah.
Maybe the fog isn't a good thing if you are waiting to meet someone.
Nice to meet you all.
My name is Katsuragi Saho.
She's really pretty.
I met Saho-san at her high school's culture festival.
Fumi-chan came to see us about how my club uses tarot cards.
Yeah!
She is like my teacher!
Saho-san knows so much!
I even learned how to use tarot cards!
Look!
I have my cards!
Does anyone want me to tell the future?
!
There's only one way to find out.
- What the hell am I doing here?
- Look at it as a field trip!
(Travis):
"Look, I've cooperated with you clowns."
"If you think I know anything else,"
- you're wasting your time!
- Pa?
- GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME!
"- I've just had enough of you, you lowlife piece of..."
Ah!
(Fen grunting)
(screaming and grunting)
Get off!
Get off!
(Travis):
My property and lay off!
(man):
"You can't do that, she's a human!"
- (Fen grunting)
- Don't lay your hands on her!
(stabbing sound)
(man screaming)
Come on!
Get off!
Get off!
Shh!
Shh!
- Shhh!
It's alright.
Shh-shh!
"- Are you alright, sir?"
Xiaotian has back.
Aku want to be with him tonight.
Can we watch movie tomorrow night?
I don't have time for tomorrow!
"- Then, the day after tomorrow."
- No time either.
Xiamu.
"Xiamu, it's a gift for you!"
Please take it!
"Xiamu, she has been fall in love with you for a long time!"
Consider I have taken it.
Sorry!
Is this the place?
It can't be wrong.
Why did Zhang Jingyu tell us to go for this place?
This place is not bad!
I'm scared!
Let's just go home!
It's okay!
I'm here with you.
What is going on?
Yawang!
Let go of her!
What is happening?
Run faster!
"Uncle Tang, don't beat Xiaotian anymore!"
- Stop it already!
- Get up!
Go to sport field and run 10 kilometers!
You deserve it!
"Girl who not go home in the midnight, is a bad girl."
"Xiaotian, the time has passed."
I'm in a fox's den!
So what!
"Whether I'm killed by a fox, or get rich off of their pictures, you'll never kill me, so don't call me again!"
Honey.
"I'm hanging up, you bastard."
I'm risking my life for this.
Live or die.
Turn into a fox!
"Honey, please change!"
- What?
- Turn into a fox!
- You don't change when you do this?
- No.
You're still the best!
Welcome!
Tickets are sold here!
"Hey, they didn't buy any tickets."
"Dad, what's with all these people?"
It's a sign that everything will be alright.
The cop.
Welcome.
May I help you?
I came to see a circus performance.
You came to the right place.
Do you know her?
Who is she?
"No, I don't know her."
- Is that so?
- Yes.
Who is she anyway?
A dead woman.
She was found axed near Nam Mountain here.
No le dejen mover.
Take off your clothes.
She's clean.
"Viktor Karp, I'm Regan."
Agent Regan of Homeland Security.
ETU.
I'm out.
That's why I'm here.
What happened here?
I had a baby.
The humans took it.
Why you want to see Liana?
I'm her daughter.
Liana doesn't have a daughter.
You're at home.
So I see.
I had you brought here.
We needed you someplace private in case you said something you shouldn't.
"Flynn, you got a drug problem."
No.
- No.
I got an alien problem.
"- Well, you need to deal with it before I let you back on the team."
Team?
Right.
"'Cause we're all just team players, aren't we, Truss?"
You're using me.
You're using Regan.
God knows what you got on Briggs.
You are privy to information that is beyond classified.
"And if I don't come back and play, you're gonna contain me?"
If I have to.
Better than you posing as a Japanese!
"Damn Robin, I quit."
Gosh...
Something terribly important is missing.
What did you lose?
I lost a toothbrush!
I'm not kidding. it's an heirloom.
Passed on through the generations.
For good fortune. lt's very important.
I'm afraid I'll have to search you all.
"Right, stealing right under the Commissioner."
And Inspector Robin's nose.
It's really too much!
"I agree to a search, I'll go first."
"Yes, I approve of a search!"
No need for you.
"Dumplings, you do it!"
"Oh yes please, come!"
Not him. I meant her.
- Inspector Robin!
- Sir!
You're responsible for security tonight.
"If you don't find the toothbrush, I'll have your head!"
Yes.
- Fools!
- Yes sir!
Get away.
Salute!
- Body search!
- Yes sir!
Hurry up!
"If we can't find it, I'm done."
She died when Dirk was 13.
Cancer.
"I was working three jobs, so it fell to Dirk to take care of her."
And he was a great kid.
He made sure Jane got her medicine.
"He helped her, cleaned up after her."
"But, you know, you watch somebody die, slow."
Waste away to nothing.
It does things to a person.
Horrible things.
I didn't know about his mother.
He-
- He wouldn't talk about her not even to me.
Lot of anger in that boy.
I'm sorry.
"We'd really like to pay our respects, Mr. MacGregor."
"Um, do you mind telling us where Dirk is buried?"
"Oh, he wasn't."
I had him cremated.
All of him?
"Well, I kept a lock of his hair."
"Oh, that's-"
- That's nice.
Where do you keep that?
"On my bus, in my Bible."
"Thanks for subbing tonight, Eddie."
"My pleasure, coach."
"Eddie, you wanna ease up on the pedal there?"
I got it all under control.
[TIRES BURST]
What the hell was that?
[TIRES SQUEAL]
- Right!
And I want to buy it.
But I dont want to sell it.
Think about it!
I will give you whatever you ask for!
But I still wont agree!
Not even for 50?
Not even for 55!
60?
You dont understand!
"Look, I have told you."
70?
Who are you?
80?
Whats so special about this mansion?
I mean to say that..
90!
Wait a minute!
Wait!
If you want it so badly then I wont disappoint you!
I want to ask you one thing.
"But I hope you are not kidding, right?"
I dont do that!
"Then come with the money, I will get ready the documents!"
I have already prepared the documents!
Very good.
-You wiIIjust have to sign them!
My man is waiting outside with 90 lakh.
Just go and open the door!
Okay.
Wait a minute!
Dont hang up!
Why would he fight back for that bit of money?
"Regardless it is a robbery or murder,"
I want to find the guy who did it.
Sawadee Club
"Mr. Lin, this way please."
Enjoy your dinner here.
All these for the two of us?
All your brother's favourites.
"David, simple meals will do next time."
Don't waste food.
Yes.
Hi!
Lincoln.
Remember me?
This is Roger and Mr. Law.
Hi!
We met before.
Your brother introduced us last time.
I must have been drunk and left early.
Pity your brother has passed away.
We missed him.
Our condolences.
Thank you!
We're having boating party next week.
You brother will never miss it.
You must join us.
"Let's have fun, okay?"
I'll check my schedule and see.
Alright.
See you.
"I'll see you out, Mr. Law."
Why bother?
"Yeah, maybe ten?"
Ten?
"Yeah, me too."
"But, did you get any flowers?"
I think you know I did.
"I thought it was really sweet, and I was gonna say, if you're not busy, we could hang out this Friday?"
I think I'm free.
"Yep, yes I am."
I'm working on the bar at a local Valentine's disco thing.
"It's under-18s, so it might be a bit lame, but if you fancied keeping me company?"
A date?
"No, Will, not a date."
Just two friends hanging out.
Great.
See you Friday.
It's a date.
"No, it's not a date."
Cool.
"She said it wasn't a date, but we both knew it was."
"Before that,"
"I had to make the most of my new, pointless, shitty manual job."
Hellooooo?
"Will MacKenzie, I'm here for work experience."
"Hello, you must be Will."
"Great to meet you, I'm Jim."
This here's Wolfie and Steve.
"Hi, Jim, hi, Steve, hello, Wolf."
Wolf-ie.
"Wolfie, right, gotcha."
You'll have a right laugh.
Long as you don't mind a bit of blue talk.
"- Not a poof, are ya?"
"Finally, a letter from Naples!"
"Vito, how do you like my little angel?"
Isn't she beautiful?
She's very beautiful.
"To you, she's beautiful."
"For me, there's only my wife and son."
Our dear mother - ...is dead!
We'll go backstage later and take her to eat.
"Sit down, you bum!"
"Oh, excuse me, Don Fanucci."
We'll go see her backstage.
Who was that?
The Black Hand.
That's Fanucci...the Black Hand.
We'll talk about it tomorrow.
Tomorrow!
Always tomorrow!
You'll pay me today!
Let's go.
Not my daughter!
Let her go!
"Here, take all my money!"
"Vito, come on."
I know what you're thinking.
But you don't know how things are.
Fanucci's with the Black Hand.
The whole neighborhood pays him.
"Even my father, in the grocery store."
If he's Italian why does he bother other Italians?
He knows they have nobody to protect them.
Forget that.
Did you like my angel?
I will see.
They're closed.
Man over bullhorn:
"In the group over here,"
"I need a priest, a nun, and two students."
That's exactly what we want.
...and the camera goes around here.
Burke?
"Oh, Burke."
"Is the scene really essential, Burke?"
Would you do without it?
This damn thing doesn't make sense.
It's perfectly plain.
You're a teacher.
You don't want the building torn down.
"Come on, I can read."
"Well, what's wrong?"
"Well, why are they tearing the building down?"
Shall we summon the writer?
"He's in Paris, I believe."
Hiding?
Fucking!
"Scene 39, hotel."
Take 4.
"All right, hustle, background, and action!"
[Roar of protesters]
Girl:
We're not backing down!
Director:
"And action, Chris!"

Wait a minute!

THE MUSKETEERS OF PIG ALLEY
New York's other side.
The poor musician goes away to improve his fortune.
Later.
"The little lady meets Snapper Kid, the chief of the Musketeers."
Alone.
"The musician returning with replenished purse, ...meets the Musketeers in Pig Alley."
The musician determined to recover his stolen money.
A friend tries to cheer the little lady.
The little lady at the gangster's ball.
Fear of the big boss forces them to settle the fight outside.
The gangsters feudal war.
One good turn deserves another.

YES?
DRUGSTORE.
MISS JUDITH!
PACKAGE!
IT'S A CHARGE.
"TAKE IT, POP."
"AFTER YOU GO OUT FOR DINNER, I COME BACK"
AND PERMANENT-FIX THE PLUMBING.
Judith:
FINE.
I USE MY PASS KEY.
YOU DON'T WORRY ABOUT NOTHING.
THANKS FOR EVERYTHING.
"GOOD NIGHT, POP."
GOOD NIGHT!
"You're busy selling your gear, so you don't need mine."
"You've got it all wrong, mate."
"- Shh, it's fine, fine."
"Let's call the boss, see what he thinks, shall we?"
"For-for fuck's sake, Jonesy."
"Just, this shit doesn't grow on trees."
You know what it's like.
I'm on hold on your tip-off...
"Just go away, just go!"
I was just explaining about the private party.
This isn't...
Not a problem...
Get a cab
Be careful.
Why don't you join us?
I wouldn't wanna intrude.
"Maybe, uh, maybe another time."
- Guide me.
- Swivel round and rock back.
"Yeah, that's it."
Okay.
"Come inside, I insist."
"Quick, come on."
"You can do it, come on."
Just go for it!
Gem!
Fuck!
Let's see how you like it.
No!
"Gem, listen to me."
Focus.
There's a saw.
- For a job.
- You don't have a job?
- Did you see the pretty fish over there?
- Did you lose your job?
My daddy lost his job.
- Did you get a new job?
"- Yes, giving big shots to little girls."
- Mommy!
- Big shots.
There you go.
- Mrs. Riblet.
Weak and dizzy all over.
- Be still my heart.
- Smell something?
- Yeah.
"Ma'am, smoking is not permitted in the hospital."
This is my glaucoma medicine.
My grandson grows it.
"Oh, no, thanks."
Put that there.
"Why don't we put these away, so that we don't get busted?"
- Smells like primo stuff.
- Yeah?
"God, I miss the '60s."
- New computer?
- Yeah.
CD-ROM.
I'm connecting us up by modem to Mount Sinai.
Pooling our resources.
A couple more things.
Dr. Benton goes nuts if you're late or don't answer a page on the first beep.
He has a bad temper.
"And tell Mrs. Manicotti that I'll stop up there later, okay?"
All right.
Should I take the rest of the dog food along?
No.
I won't have to feed him till tomorrow morning
-when I get him back.
"-Oh, I see."
Okay.
"- Don't drop him now, Trix."
"-No, I won't."
"- Oh, he's a good fella."
Bye.
-Thank you.
"- I'll see you later, Alice."
"-All right, bye-bye."
(clears throat)
"Hiya, sweetheart."
"Hiya, Ralph."
I'll have your supper ready for you in a minute.
"Oh, don't go to any trouble."
I'm not gonna eat here.
I'll eat over at the lodge.
I got just enough time to wash up and get over there.
We got another emergency meeting.
Again?
!
"Ralph, you had an emergency meeting last night."
-So?
-So?
Do you realize you Racoons have more emergency meetings than the U.N.?
Just so happens that the Racoons have more emergencies than the U.N.
(Alice sighs)
"No, no, no, no, no, no."
This is about Kitty's social life.
I don't really want to intrude.
"Oh, trust me."
She loves to intrude.
She lives to intrude.
Nonsense.
You know what?
I love mother-daughter teams.
- It's twice as much fun.
- OK.
"Well, she loves contractors."
- Kitty.
"- Nora, I feel so confident in this,"
I'm not gonna charge you for this consultation.
Sit down.
Sit!
Great.
"OK, here's what we're gonna do."
Hey.
So this is really good.
"I would just change ""watchdog"" to ""necessary vigilance."""
Protection over fear?
It's good.
I like it.
Sit down.
I'll go over the whole thing.
"You know, actually, I..."
I kind of have to go.
Is it OK if we run through it tomorrow?
It's a personal matter.
- Oh.

I'm going to get our money.
but--
Our money?
Your choice.
Take it.
It's a pleasure doing business with you.
Let's get the fuck out of here.
000 looks like?
This is fucking awesome.
boys.
Our next fight's a 10-grand buy-in.
Todd?
When do I get some?
I discovered him.
This fucking guy.
How would you like to discover this?
I'm serious.
yeah?
These fights today-- these private fights man.
You want to fight in real fights-- proper fights with proper prize money and betting money.
That's how you make money in fighting.
- So when do we get some?
- I've already put the word out.
Mmm.
It's almost as if Trina has become our very own Lady Di.
"Oh, and I corrected your spelling mistakes."

"Well, I have to say, as far as wakes go, this one was pretty good."
Mum's was better.
"Well, Mum's didn't have nearly as much dancing."
But it did have uncle Terry standing on the balcony shouting at the neighbours like there was no God.
"My brother, the life and soul of every wake."
Wait!
You forgot me!
We thought you were...
Going home... ..where you belong.
No way.
"I mean, Dad's OK today, but tomorrow he'll be bad again."
Which one?
"No, no, no, no."
You were in your best suit.
Was I?
"Oh, yes, of course!"
"I went to the theater, of course!"
"- No, no..."
"- Yes, yes, with Winnie Atwell, yes."
Winnie Atwell?
"Well, Marjorie Atwell then, Marjorie."
I always call her Winnie because...
"well, because she looks like Winnie."
She's not black.
Black?
Churchill wasn't black.
"Look, look, look,"
I gave you £75.
You put it in there.
What do you mean by telling me you called the police?
You've done no such thing.
Your wife's just told me you're still searching the rooms.
"Well, I thought she'd called them."
You lying hound!
- Mrs. Richards...
"- Go and call them now, immediately."
"Mrs. Richards, we will, the moment we've searched..."
Right.
I shall call them myself then.
Couldn't we just wait until...
I've never seen such a place!
"All right, Mrs. Richards."
Would you like to use the office phone?
"We'll go at eight bells, same as before."
"Now, Morrison, get up on deck and warn everyone you meet."
"Wagstaffe, go and tell Dawlish."
You?
Get up aloft.
This time let's hear you cheer.
- Who's on watch?
- Ponsonby.
Where's Scott-Padget?
Where is he?
"All officers confined to their quarters, under guard by Marines."
Listen to me.
I'm warning you.
"You use that knife, and you're a dead man."
"All right, lads."
No rushing on deck.
And wait for the cheer.
"Now, take some more, sir."
You'll stand better what I've got to do.
"Now, get ready."
"Now, grab him."
Look lively!
Put your backs into it!
"All right, you."
Start on number four gun.
Hip-hip-hooray!
What's happening there?
- Leave me alone.
- Shut your mouth.
"Don't move, sir!"
"- This means your death, Vizard."
- Take him below.
- Did he tell you he went to see Marosi ?
- No.
"He's bottling it up, he's dealing with all of this on his own."
I bet he didn't tell you his girlfriend dumped him.
Hold on one second.
"Alright you lot, leave him alone."
"What's going on, Stevie ?"
Talk to me.
I don't want to take it.
I think you should kick that ball as hard as you can.
Go for it.
"Listen to me, Pru."
"He's going through a lot right now, so... promise me you'll be there if he needs you."
I promise.
"Ok, great."
Bye.
I think I have one for you.
Please...
Please...
It's all right.
I'm here to help you.
"Mark, it's me."
Listen...
I need Pru's number.
She should be in a hospital.
"No, sorry,no can do."
Hospitals require all kind of information.
"- No, you're doing great."
- She needs an internal scan.
Did she have anything on her ?
A phone or ID ?
She is yet to speak.
It's empty.
Just one bullet.
Hey!
Stop.
Ram.
Gopal.
What's his name?
Verma.
Stop.
Stop.
What are you?
What if he had fired?
If he had fired Bittoo would be dead... and Verma's son would've been hanged.
The same thing... will imply on Boss and Shiv.
I didn't get it.
Boss will kill Shiv... and he'll be foreshadowing crime.
But the Boss workforces.
I don't trust my father.
It's an old rule.
First clear the garbage then clearly record.
Hi Ankita.
Hi.
Why did you come out?
From today your outgoing...
Yeah hello.
And your phone's incoming is barred.
Go lock yourself in the room.
There are 200 channels on Tata Sky.
Sit at home and watch television.
I'll call you when it's time for the engagement... and nuptial ceremonies.
Don't come out until I don't call you.
Go.
J.E.
Pepper!
Pepper!
Here we are!
Come on!
"Come on, digger!"
"Come on, there you go!"
"There you go, digger!"
Go get it!
Go get it!
Fetch!
"Fetch, digger!"
"Go, digger!"
"I didn't know you walked out this way, Andrew."
Yes.
One of digger's favorite spots when I'm in the area.
"Fit, are you?"
"- Yes, can't complain."
"My word, look at him go."
He's like a whippet.
"- Yes, isn't he?"
Sheer joy of living I call it.
Still digging up neighbor's gardens?
"Yes, digger by name, digger by nature."
"There's no cure in the book for that, I'm afraid."
"Actually, James,"
I'm glad we ran into each other.
I've been wanting to see you about digger.
"There's nothing wrong with him, is there?"
"Not really, but he is having some problems with his eyes."
How do you mean?
"- Alright, but hurry."
- Okay.
Tasty.
"You know, I'm honest only as much as I want to be."
How come?
"Well, just that I'm not so different from your character."
Really?
- Are you all by yourself?
"- Yes, she left."
"Anyway, both ladies are pretty tall, including the one before."
Aren't they?
How about the face?
Don't they look alike?
"Well, I can't say."
I couldn't see their faces closely.
- Is that so?
Alright.
- Good-bye.
But don't they look alike?
"Uh, sure."
That's possible.
- Good night.
"- Yes, good night."
- What are you doing here?
- Looking for you.
Would you like to have some?
What's this?
Were you drinking all by yourself?
"I'm the type you like, aren't I?"
"Yes, you're right."
I'm not having sex with you.
I am not having sex with you.
It's a case you worked on when you were a copper.
"Jesse, Alan's boy."
"He's back, Dad."
Jesse's come back.
Leave her!
Dad?
Look at him.
"- Take his face away from me, please."
"- Dad, he didn't do it."
He admitted to it.
And you believe that?
Dad I know he wrote you letters.
"- I destroyed them, they gave me the creeps."
- All of them?
- Yes.
What about mom?
Did she keep any of them?
You know what?
You're gonna have to ask her that.
"What is all this, Mark?"
It was 20 years ago.
Why are you bringing all this up again?
"Here we are, one chicken curry and one lamb tagine, sir."
Enjoy it.
- Disgusted or not you must have read them.
"- Yes, of course I read them."
- And?
Well you know he wanted us to meet him.
Wanted us to a... to talk.
- But of course we wouldn't entertain the idea.
- Why not?
'Coz he killed your brother.
"Okay, I'm on my way."
Josh needs my help.
Esme's stoned.
- What?
- Yeah.
He wants me to go over and give her a talk.
- Really?
- Mm.
The first thing I got into trouble with as a teenager was smoking weed.
Mmm.
Let me know if there's anything I can do to help.
It's delicious.
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.
I'm glad you called.
"Guess you want me to come down pretty hard, right?"
Yeah.
She'll listen to you...
I hope.
- She's pretty stoned.
- Is she?
It's not funny.
"No, I know."
"For three, and it's good."
"He is just 3 of 13 behind the arch, and he puts up a big three to give his team a four-point lead."
This is a high-resolution S.P.E.C.T. Image of a chronic marijuana user.
"Okay, so, here you can see the decreased activity in the prefrontal cortex."
This is bad.
Oh.
"The, uh..."
"Weed, it can, uh... can trigger psychosis."
Aunt Kate?
I'll say.
Ka-chow.
You're gonna fit right in in California.
My goodness.
It looks like you've helped everybody in town.
"Yeah, everybody except one."
"- Hey, is it getting dark out?"
- What?
What'd he say?
Let me say that again.
Is it getting dark out?
"Now, what was I supposed to do after that?"
They fixed their neon!
- Low and slow?
"- Oh, yeah, baby!"
"Just like in its heyday, right?"
It's even better than I pictured it.
Thank you.
Shall we cruise?
"Oh, thank you, dear."
I'd love to!
"- No, no, no."
- Lizzie!
I remember when Stanley first asked me to take a drive with him.
"Hey, Miss Sally."
May I have this cruise?
"- Of course, Mater."
- Uh-uh-uh!
"...and again and I said, ""No. "" He asked me again, and I said, ""No. """
"But, oh, he was a persistent little bugger for a two-cylinder."
"Finally I said, ""All right, one little drive. """
Oh!
Sure.
Come out!
Come out in the end.
We got them all.
Is there one left?
We can meet together now.
Where are you?
Why don't you come out?
What do you want?
"My name is Jurgen Hoffman, I'm a scientist."
I've come to get you out of here.
We should leave immediately.
What do you know?
I've watched through this window.
I've witnessed the deaths from over there.
I know how and why they died.
"You're in great danger, come with me."
So you tell me why they died.
What difference does it make to you?
Now.
Come with me.
Wait a minute you come to my place and you want me to leave and you don't want to tell me why?
"Ok, you have a creature, an alien creature on your roof."
Where?
I study these creatures.
"You're in great danger, come with me."
-Tell me where he is.
-You want to die?
-No.
-Let me explain.
-Let me go.
-Let me explain.
Calm down.
SIX MONTHS LATER
Help!
Help!
Please help!
Just go away.
They're gone now.
Don't be afraid.
I'll take you home.
Jenny!
How do you know my name?
I've listened to you sing so often...
Who are you?
I feel as if I know you.
I know you can't see too well.
"I've wanted to help, but I never had the chance."
"In this world, not everybody is untrustworthy."
Will you let me help you this time?
Is it all right for me to leave?
Stay calm.
Let me check it out.
It's only a cat.
It often sneaks in and scratches my furniture.
What a pain!
- Why did you turn off the light?
- You can see?
I only see shadows.
It was better last month.
I could see images.
Turn on the light.
It makes me feel safer.
What are you doing now?
"And it's left-hand drive, so you're a cheapskate."
It's true!
It's never overtaken anyone.
That's what passengers are for.
His dog ate it.
She did.
A couple more I have to stick up -
"Mitsubishi Evo VIII, we looked at."
Where's it go?
AUDIENCE:
Sub-cool?
Wrong!
Why is it sub-cool?
It's a proper car.
It's fast and it handles well.
That's nothing to do with coolness.
It's like having ginger hair.
Anyone else got any thoughts on it?
MAN:
Uncool.
Uncool.
"He says it's uncool, he's kind of right."
"The thing is, it's very gender-specific."
"If you're a man, it's really uncool."
"If you're a woman, it's fantastic."
We wanna meet you.
"So it kind of goes there, as does...the same story with the Subaru."
Yeah.
Put that there.
Right in the middle with the F60.
"It's funny, it's the way of the cool wall."
"I've got one last one here, the Peugeot 206 GTI 180bhp."
"No, that's fine."
"Joongrae, I like you."
You live foolishly.
You know me?
"Just, a little."
"You're reckless, but not loathsome."
You know nothing about me.
I knew I'd meet you some day.
Seriously?
Do you love me?
I like you very much.
- Do you want me that much?
"- Yes, more than any other woman."
"Then, have me."
I don't mind.
But I still love you.
"Joongrae, you are mine today."
"Thank you, Moonsook."
I love you.
"I love you, too."
Have a seat.
You must've gotten up early.
Aren't you tired?
"No, are you?"
"No, but I think I'm coming down with something."
It's because we worked ourselves too hard last night.
"Oh, come on."
"You were married once, right?"
"Yeah, I got divorced."
A long time ago.
Should I leave you alone?
Seems like you were deep in thought.
Let me see those hands!
Ladies and gentlemen we would lik e to begin boarding Japan Airlines Flight 3 20.
he amount of time we've been away from home just to mak e our band stronger and be successful  is a lot and there's no rest.
"It's just go, go, go."
"Like, you fly from one place to another to another."
-See you.
-Bye-bye.
think we're very lucky in the fact that when we were touring this time  we get to go to a lot of different parts of the world and you come across a place you haven't been to yet. t's just always so exciting.
-Harry!
"-please, Harry!"
please!
Harry!
This is a little strange.
"This many photographers aren't allowed in the building in, Iike, england."
"Hey, Harry!"
Harry!
I'm excited.
1 D!
1 D!
1 D!
1 D!
1 D!

How are you?
You okay?
Let's go.
"Bro, how crazy was that?"
I've never seen that.
That's mad.
That was crazy.
"Like, you know, all I kept thinking was, ""And this is in Japan."""
Yeah.
- Better than tits you'll ever get mate!
"All right, I'd spunk over the big ones, and they're not better than I'd get."
Bollocks.
"Here, Steve..."
- Speccy here... reckons he has better!
- Stop that.
- I have.
"- Fuck off, you're a virgin!"
- Classic virgin.
- You're wrong.
I did it last year.
With a girl I'm seeing tonight.
"Yeah, sure."
Yep!
"She's fit, she's older than me, and she goes like a porn star."
"- Oh, right!"
"- Yeah, and she's got massive titties and I..."
"Well, I... fucked her hard and all night long."
What are you and this dirty horn bucket up to this weekend then?
I might come and check her out.
"Going to an under-18 disco where she works, so you won't be able to."
I could go.
- What?
- I could go.
I'm 17.
You're 17!
?
- You're 17?
"- Yeah, yeah"
- I just look older.
There's looking older and then there's that.
You look about 30!
I miss the track team.
And I miss the basketball team.
We have no time for other sports.
Lacrosse is hard enough.
Forget it.
Why ShaoIin Kung Fu all of a sudden?
Are you at all interested in lacrosse?
"Showing up late, and all."
Bringing your weird friends.
You're a bit strange yourself.
"""My name Minmin."""
Can you play lacrosse?
You use this?
It's for throwing the ball.
This is no good.
You must control the ball.
Shoot at the goal.
"Oh, OK."
It's quite difficult.
I can't take this anymore.
Hey!
help!
I need help!
Hey!
"please, help me!"
What am I to do?
Task Force 7 needs more students adept in martial arts.
select a few students.
Request payment by wire.
And the other request?
We've dispatched 3 students.
Payment is complete.
- Hanna?
- Her daughter.
Are you her son?
No.
I'm just the guy who opens the door.
"Mr. Leland, this is my daughter Hanna."
- Hello.
"- Hello, Hanna."
"Oh, I forgot to get your signature on this."
Um...
It's just part of authorizing you to look at the safe deposit box.
Sure.
Thank you.
Okay.
Um...
- I won't be late.
- Okay.
What are you doing coming to the front door?
It was a better way to meet than her tripping over me behind the furnace.
"Yeah, but just knocking on the door?"
Why couldn't you ask me?
- You would have said no?
- My mom thinks you're trouble.
- You don't like her boyfriend.
- He's not her boyfriend.
He's a customer at the bank.
Some architect from Syracuse.
Really.
"What do you mean ""really""?"
He had a crappy plastic pen.
So?
So architects draw for a living.
Have fun...
What else?
Loosen up.
Put the pen down.
I'm not going to test you on this.
Come on.
Teach me something.
Anything.
- Okay.
- Mmm-hmm.
"If a ball is thrown up into the air, and its height, H, equals 100 T..."
What are you doing?
Turn around.
Talk to me.
"If T is time in seconds, at what limit is the speed..."
You lost me.
What does that mean?
You have to put it in context.
"- Jazz it up, find some humor in it."
- Humor in calculus?
"- Well, try telling a story."
- A story?
"Once upon a time, there was a ball."
It was thrown into the air.
And its height...
Maybe I should just write books.
"No one understands those, either."
Just kidding.
- Don't give up.
Try it again.
- Tell you another story?
"- Hi, Professor Larkin."
Fine.
I'll do it.
Okay.
What are doing?
Are you mental?
Put it down.
Put it down.
Let go.
Put it down.
I am taking care of it.
I got it.
Put it down.
I got it.
"Billy, what the hell are you doing?"
"Stan, I can't work with this guy."
"What, you can't work with me?"
"Who do you think you are, lady?"
I've been here for eight years.
And you're just another untalented pretty face.
"Billy, calm down."
"Untalented, huh?"
The ratings keep going up every night.
How do you explain that?
The ratings go up when the jackpot goes up.
"That has nothing to do with you, you moron."
Billy!
I've warned you before about your attitude.
That's it.
You're out of here.
You're fired.
Somebody call security!
What?
Go hide and keep quiet!
"Stop Mieze, stop!"
Promise that you won't look behind that curtain!
I promise...
I promise.
I promise that I won't look behind that curtain.
- Yes.
There you go.
"I guess you brought something along, right?"
Stop giving me presents!
What's wrong with that?
Why not?
We have everything we need.
"I have a dress, you have your clothes."
What would we need more things for?
Because it's nice.
- What?
"- Franz, I wanna tell you something."
Go ahead!
I want to wear my old dress!
Blimey!
"We'll look for work, even if it's on a yard."
Why?
Why?
Where did you get that fur from?
I met an old friend.
"- He told you things about me, huh?"
- No.
- But you let him give you a fur!
- Yes!
And I can't?
I can't give you anything?
"Hey, man."
"It's all good, right?"
"Look, you get a little money in your pocket."
Nothing wrong with that.
"Just for now, right?"
Plus it's always good to have a roommate that can pay his half of the rent.
"Hey, what do you say you and me head down to the rec center?"
Got a pick-up rugby game going on.
"Then afterwards, maybe go get me some ribs, some corn."
Some hot chicks.
Maybe she got a friend for you.
But one of them ugly ones.
"Buck-toothed and, you know, just got the fangs."
"Got the fangs happening, huh?"
Know what?
Yeah.
Huh?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah?
Yeah?
Just give me a couple minutes to change and then we'll head on out.
"Oh, dinner's on you tonight."
You still owe me...
"I think, what is it, $19.40?"
"Oh, you're serious about that?"
So...
Yeah.
Dinner and girls.
Both on you tonight.
"No, the girls will be on me."

What are you doing in my office with your butt in the air?
I was hoping for an injection.
Go to the waiting room.
This isn't an outpatient surgery!
They told me to wait here.
See?
Another example.
"This is an affront to Professor Ciotti,   and shows lack of respect for a person of his stature."
I'll report you to the Academic Senate and have you expelled.
"Cicchirini, calm down!"
And you... get out of here.
Out!
What about my injection?
You expect me to give you an injection?
Get out!
Out!
Motherfuckers...
- Did you do it?
- Me?
No.
Was it you?
"- No, no!"
Maybe it was him.
- I didn't do... it was him.
It wasn't me.
Who is it?
"""Who is it?"" That's for me to say!"
Who is it?
Am I disturbing you?
"No, no, my dear."
Come in.
You're never disturbing.
We'd been here all night.
"June's mixed up, he's getting old, he don't see very well."
Lying son of a bitch!
I'll make him talk.
He's not gonna talk.
It's his sister.
Can I speak to the boy?
"How are you this morning, Byron?"
Just fine.
Pretty sleepy?
"Yeah, I guess so."
Did you go stay someplace with your uncle Ronnie last night?
No.
You sure?
Yeah.
"You didn't see a lady, a pretty lady?"
No.
You sure?
Yeah.
Did your uncle Ronnie tell you to say that?
Yeah.
So this has just been pretend?
Yeah.
What do you say we stop playing pretend and play really?
Okay.
"And I think you really ought to spend a night or two in jail, so you don't tell your sister."
Dale...
You got to let me go.
"I can't do that, Lila."
You can't let them put me in jail.
"What's going to happen to our baby, with me in jail?"
Your mom will keep taking care of him.
"It-it's not that I wanted him to be sick or anything like that, but I..."
I wanted...
"the opportunity to show him that I could be there for him, you know?"
I haven't always been.
I've been going on and on.
You haven't.
This is what...
"recovery is all about -- you know, opening up, being honest."
Okay.
"So, tell me about you."
"Uh, recovering drunk."
"Wife, sister, mother."
"Two kids -- boy, 10, girl, 8."
Uh...
I don't know.
Life gets pretty boring when you stop drinking.
What kind of work do you do?
Assembly line -- boring.
Come on.
I told you.
Went on and on and on.
"Well, okay, okay."
"Uh, it is boring."
"Um, but it's super-high-security."
'Cause you mostly do government work.
It's a company called Northrop.
Hi.
"Hey, handsome."
What are you doing here?
"I just, um..."
I wanted to see you.
- I didn't want to go home.
Gin is good.
Gin is good.
So... what's wrong with ya?
"I mean, other than the whole ""psycho chopped the baby out of your belly and ran"" thing."
Other than that?
Is... is there something other than that?
You tell me.
I'm just a chick with a drink.
No judgments.
Oh.
I get it.
You don't want to open up to me.
I know.
I'm not the touchy-feely type.
I got fired for being heartless.
Cooper apparently agrees.
Maybe he's right.
It's the baby.
He have 11 toes or something?
He's perfect.
He's absolutely perfect.
"He's the baby in the commercial, he's so perfect."
And I...
"I look at him, and I feel... nothing."
I can't... feel anything... ever since the...
"I mean, there's this pressure to be all ""mommy,"""
and I'm just...
I'm not.
I'm not ready or something.
I just...
I don't...
I don't want to deal with him.
-See you later.
I'm going to have to rent a tuxedo.
Rent a tuxedo!
"Oh, there's got to be a peasant in every outfit."
"He's never changed, has he?"
"Good old... ""Rent a tuxedo."""
"That's laughable, isn't it?"
(chuckles)
Take care.
I'll see you later.
(chuckling):
"""Rent a tuxedo."""
Who do I call about renting a tuxedo?
(phone ringing)
Hello.
Sergeant...
"uh, Mr. Bilko's room."
Long distance where?
"Roseville, Kansas?"
Fort Baxter?
"Tell them I'm not, uh..."
"All right, put them on."
"Hey, Sarge, we just called to see how you're doing."
"Hey, did you see your old squad yet?"
"Hey, what did they say when they seen you with all them stripes?"
"A master sergeant, huh?"
"They really flipped, huh?"
"Hey, wait a minute."
Henshaw wants to say hello.
"Hey, I was next!"
"By rank, Doberman."
By rank.
In a little less than 14 minutes.
"When I was your age, I used to love school."
I remember once we had to do this time capsule...
"You know, fill it with important things"
And bury it in the backyard
So we could dig it up when we were grown.
Really?
And... and did you?
Did you dig it up?
Oh.
Moved before I could.
What a shame.
"You know, I think of it every day of my life."
You have?
"Oh, my god."
That's so many days!
"So if you look at number five in your handout,"
"Using the chunking strategy, what is the answer?"
74.
112.
Excellent...
Mostly everybody.
Here.
Let me show you.
You're thinking addition.
You need to...
I don't need your help.
I can do it myself.
"Nice job, mr."
Heck.
You get it.
"Well, now that you explained it, it's comin' pretty easy."
- I'm...
Shh!
(Whispers) I came to apologise about yesterday.
Is that the only reason you came?
"No, it isn't."
Now I've really lost Bill.
- I am going to the police.
- Please...
That's no good.
No point crying over spilt milk.
You don't understand.
It's not his money I care about.
I really love him.
"So, now I'm getting my own back on that beastly Dennis."
Just a minute.
You said you saw a file on that authoress Flora Ransom?
- Yes.
- Right!
We're going to see her.
I have a few questions to ask that murderous woman.
Excuse me.
- Have a good time.
- I am not going to have a good time!
Is Mrs Ransom in?
She's out but we are expecting her back soon.
Come in.
Thank you.
My name's Bastable.
I'm the lucky fellow she's consented to marry.
"She's a widow, you know."
This way.
"Oh, was Flora expecting you?"
"[Salt-N-Pepa's ""Push lt"" playing]"
"[Indistinct shouting, laughter]"
TRAC Y:
Get down!
Four minutes to air.
That's four minutes to air.
Is Liz back yet?
No.
Which cat do you want Jenna to carry?
I'm sorry?
Which cat?
Oh.
I want... that one.
"Jack Donaghy to the forum, please."
Jack Donaghy.
Peanut's not an actor.
I just rescued her from a lab.
[Exhales sharply]
"Hey, Lemon, I'll drop you off."
Where do you live?
The studio.
I want you to drop me at the studio.
"I want to tell Donaghy to his face that I quit, and I want to do it in front of the whole crew so that they know he didn't fire me."
I want to see that.
"[Cheers and applause] ß It's time for ""The Girlie Show"" ß"
"Oh, oh, pull over!"
Pull over here!
"Tracy, I don't have time for this."
Right here.
This is where I grew up.
This is the Jordan family estate?
Wasn't no Jordan family nothing.
First team to the studio.
I gotta go.
I appr eciate your talking.
I can have that time in the 20s?
Check back with me.
"2 minutes to VTR, 2 1/2 live."
"""VTR"" -- that means a videotape record."
"That's the taped intro, then they come live to the studio 30 seconds later."
-
- J.J. -
- Isaac.
"Uh, Judith, this is Isaac Jaff ee, the managing editor."
"Uh, Isaac, this is my fiancée, Judith."
How do you do?
So nice to finally meet you.
I hope I'm not imposing.
"Judith, you ar e charming, and you'r e welcome her e whenever you like."
Thank you.
Watch out f or Isaac and the ladies.
"This is J.J. 's fiancée, Judith."
-
- Nice to meet you.
-
- Hi.
Would you give Judith a quick introduction
-- to Dan and Casey bef or e we start?
-
- Sur e.
I was thinking about what I said earlier.
About what?
About cr eating division between the show and the network.
"I said it's not good f or CSC, it's not good f or the show, it's not good f or Continental Corp,"
I thought you loved to live by the sea.
I do.
Beautiful sea breezes.
I can imagine the view ofthe clear blue sky... and the deep blue sea.
Great!
Packyour things and wait for me.
I'll be here.
Why didn't you leave Hong Kong immediately?
What stopped you?
- Are you the newjanitor?
- Yes.
You're doing a lousyjob.
This is a fire escape.
"Look, there's garbage everywhere."
What ifthere's a fire?
I can't fy away like a phoenix.
I pay my monthly maintenance fee.
"If I find you goofing offagain, I'll file a complaint."
Don't leave any garbage here.
Move it all away.
Shit!
"Jeffrey, you're back."
"Yes,Jenny."
Are you with a friend?
"Yes, he's my old football buddy."
We grew up in the same squatter area.
Yes.
He's...
"I'm Dumbo, he's Mickey Mouse."
That's what you called each other?
- It's good to see you again.
- The feeling isn't mutual.
Heads.
Mayhew?
Mr. Mayhew?
Mr. Mayhew.
Nice of you to come down.
Please.
Look at you.
Should I call the FBI and tell them I found D.B. Cooper?
Joking.
I...
"Please, come on."
Come on.
Please.
Hello.
Saul Goodman.
Please sit.
So it's a shame that we have to meet under these circumstances.
I believe you have something for me?
"Oh, yes."
- Mayhew.
Is that Irish or English?
- Irish.
Faith and begorra.
A fellow potato-eater.
My real name is McGill.
The Jew thing I just do for the homeboys.
"They all want a pipe-hitting member of the tribe, so to speak."
I digress.
Good things are happening.
"Fact is, your nephew is gonna get out in no time."
"That's wonderful, yeah."
"There's still a few details to be ironed out but now that the DEA is involved I think he's looking at time served, then probation."
Where are you going this late?
To the West.
"- What, on foot in the Zone?"
- Can I see your papers?
"Well, did you have a nice New Year's?"
Your name?
"Well, what's your name, Miss?"
Karka!
Pauline Karka.
But it is... bloody.
What do you have there?
My child.
May I see it?
"Now come inside and get warm, young lady."
The Rats
- Based on the play by:
Adapted for the screen by:
- What's it about?
- Go to the police!
"Room 12, the police inspector said."
"For that you drag my child out in the freezing cold, risking it dying?"
"- Well, whatever, Mrs John."
- Don't shout at my daughter like that!
"What has happened, Miss Pauline?"
"The inspector didn't say, Mr Hassenreuter,"
- only that they are to id..idi..
Pauline...
- Identify...
"- ...her, yes."
- Pauline?
I've never heard that name.
- What am I to do there?
Saira!
You have five minutes.
Leave before this cigarette gets over.
I cannot leave.
What story will I tell our kids?
That papa got scared so he ran away?
I forgot!
This story has an armour too!
No..
No..
No..
No..
No..!
"Come on, leave this world."
'A stormy sky...'
'A ferocious moon...'
"It's time, Jilaan."
Stop it!
No!
No!
'If they do not make it through the ocean of fire...'
'One last breath would forever remain a desire.'
"Bodies meet, bodies perish."
"Souls meet, they together forever flourish."
Shiv!
Shiv!
Okay.
If you wouldn't have come for me...
Then what stories would you tell our kids?
Prayer.
Listen carefully.
Your mom might sometimes say that you were Karan-Arjun in your past life.
You like doing that.
"Yours, Corporal Dawes."
"You, Evans."
Gordon.
"Come on, Stubbins."
Each man check his release box.
Easy now.
Nothing worse than blokes hitting their boxes at the same time.
It sounds like the Salvation Army on a Sunday afternoon.
"You've nothing to worry about, they're smashing parachutes."
They ought to be at £60 a piece.
"Morning, Bill."
Morning.
"All right, you gentleman aloft."
We're ready.
We are ready.
He's ready.
So are we.
"Gentleman, I don't like your colour."
You look a little green.
What colour would you like?
Suppose you surprise me.
"0K, Number 0ne, a good parachuting position."
Action station Number One.
Jump when I touch you on the shoulder.
Are you ready?
Go!
There goes my first one.
Reach up high on your front left webs.
Pull down steadily now.
"Your head well forward, feet together."
"OK, hold it."
- If she hurt you...
"- No, no."
She... she didn't lay a hand on me.
"I'm fine, really, I'm just..."
I'm just tired.
Whose body am I in?
You've seen Liana.
"That's what happened to your face, isn't it?"
"Dad, tell me the truth."
"Where did this, me, come from?"
I need to know.
Musa sent you to us from a breeding camp.
"Your mother found you a human skin, even though I knew what it meant... an innocent."
Did it have a name?
The baby?
Allison.
"From the day you became Allison,"
I vowed to protect you with my life.
But...
I failed you.
No.
Yes.
We should have left.
Gone on the run.
"I'm so, so sorry."
"Dad, don't."
You did everything you could to protect me.
I always will.
I don't know what you're saying.
I'm saying that I love you.
"As long as I'm alive, you're in danger."
- They'll use us against each other.
"A teenager has his right to get his mac on, Riley Haskell."
It's the law.
- Where's Mr Webb?
- He's sick.
"Look, I gotta go."
I'm really sorry.
The pizza was really good.
Jerk.
"And Precious, make sure you do that thing I told you to do."
- I made a mess.
"- Henri, help me out."
You grab the other side.
"Yeah, we'll just lift this up."
"- Man, I got this."
Grab that.
- You got it?
- That's better.
- Where is he?
Ate the whole box.
- He OD'd on Ding Dongs.
"- Oh, God."
- You okay?
"- We didn't have a choice, man."
- It was for his own good.
- He'll be fine by game time.
Dickie Dunn Jr.
Here with Dickie Dunn III bringing you another exciting season of junior league hockey action.
And this year's first battle is a real David and Goliath matchup.
"Yeah, Dad."
"If David were a Chihuahua, that'd be more like it."
"Yes, that's true, D-III."
It's the defending champ Ice Hounds versus Newman's upstart orphan team calling themselves the Zenovators.
Wow.
I get it.
"You are a trip, Ms. Sciuto."
"That's a good thing, right?"
(sighs)
What now?
Where is Baylor and who shot Ridgeway?
Wickes might be able to tell us if we ask nicely.
I'll ask.
I've seen your nice.
I'm going with you.
You said man-to-man.
Oh.
"Right, I'm sorry, we haven't met."
"Hi, I'm Elizabeth Brighton,"
SECNAV's public affairs officer during this time of crisis.
Wickes and I are going to form a special bond of our own.
(snickers)
GIBBS:
We think she might have a connection to whoever shot the secretary.
You know her?
(sighs)
I don't recognize her.
Did you talk to Lawrence Ridgeway?
He's dead.
He was murdered?
Murder weapon was a hunting rifle.
It's rare.
You know anyone with something like that?
(phone rings)
WICKES:
No.
- Yeah.
I loved that old house.
"- Yeah, I loved that place, too."
- I had my first kiss there.
"- Me, too."
"So what's going on, Jimmy?"
"I've just had a really bad year with the market and, it's disastrous, and it's going to be a struggle just to remain solvent for the next..."
How much do you need?
No.
It's... it's a lot of money.
It's too much.
Jimmy.
It's a hundred thousand dollars.
I'll call the bank.
No.
I can't.
I can.
I'll pay you back.
But it's going to take me a couple of months.
I know where you live.
This place is going to be perfect.
I hope so.
New contractors come tomorrow.
Better get the job finished.
New contractors.
Mm-hmm.
Sounds like a nightmare.
Pretty much.
You okay?
So the contractors start tomorrow.
Guess that means I'm gone.
One bus ticket to Austin. 8:00 a.m. tomorrow.
The Boss is being over-enthusiastic... but I'm going to use my brains.
By playing the right card at the right moment.
Daddy.
By the time he plays his cards...
Shiv and Ankita will already have their honeymoon.
I'm moron.
Hold on.
Jabbar bhai.
Dad call Jabbar bhai right now.
On the spot finish his entire family right now.
- Father's here.
- So what?
- Father's here.
- Shiv?
I told you we'll be visiting the saint's tomb one day.
And return to Benaras after that.
We'll visit the shrine today.
It's a good day today.
I'm pleased that you've been released.
And even happier... that you didn't need that goon's help for it.
Brother...
Brother come in.
No actually I couldn't do the job.
So I'm here to return Mr. Satyakant's money.
Brother come... come in.
- I'll leave.
- Please.
Please.
Brother come...
I'm going to the shrine.
Are you coming?
Yes father.
- We have our own bikes.
Fucking hell.
"Sometimes it is easy just to say ""yes""."
"Henry, catch it!"
"Oh, God."
I thought I'd lost forever Henry.
I was so scared.
I was so scared and you fell.
I thought I'd never see you again.
"I love you, Henry."
I love you.
How sweet.
If I took this moment and put it in a cup of tea.
I wouldn't need sugar.
"Yuri, please."
We can go now.
"Every year, 100000 baseball bats are sold in Russia."
"And at most, 50 baseballs."
Gives an idea of a great Russians pastime?
"This is a rare, survived bat."
Estelle.
"Would you, please, be so kind and stand up?"
No.
Or you wanna take her place?
"Estelle, your boy is quite a knight."
Sacrificing himself to keeping you alive.
Only for my dick... to kill you later.
"Are you sure, Henry?"
Are you sure?
"- I didn't hear a ""no""."
- Brilliant!
"Come over here, Henry."
"No way, we have a show coming up tonight."
Do the box again.
"Kids, didn't you hear me?"
We have a show tonight.
"Bye, kids."
All the best.
"Everything will be okay, my sweetie."
Give me a hug.
Barbuda loves you.
"- Bye, kids."
- Bye.
Here.
For you.
Maybe you'll need it someday.
"It's yours now, Maria."
"We promise that whenever the circus is around, or close enough, we'll come visit you, okay?"
"Look out for her, Quico."
"Maria, let me go."
"Be good, sweetie."
"Bye, kids."
My ring fell into the sea and it was lost to me the waters gave me a seashell as a present for you
Come on and eat Maria.
Do you still like chocolate milk?
Yes.
So...
Didn't you like the nightgown I bought for you?
But it's so pretty.
I've picked your school.
I'll take you to meet the principal.
She wants you to take a test.
But I've always studied!
In the circus?
Lock him up safely until he comes to.
I'll lock him up.
"I'm only sorry you didn't have a dizzy spell, too."
Then I'd lock you both up at the same time.
Good old Din.
What's up?
"Tonight, when everyone sleep, Din go back again."
- See gold.
- You did?
Where is it?
Didn't you bring any with you?
Bhisti cannot carry whole temple.
- Whole temple?
- Din see it.
All gold.
"Here, now."
We've got to get out of here now.
Get me some tools that I can rip these blinking bars out with.
- Already bring all tools could find.
- Yeah.
"Is this satisfactory, sahib?"
Think I want to break out of a blooming pudding?
"Go on, get something big."
Jaldi!
"Up, Annie."
"Please, Annie."
"What are you doing, Din?"
"A large tool you asked for, sahib."
"Annie, come on, pull these blinking bars out for me."
Work for me.
"Get me out of here, Annie."
"Come on, Annie."
"- No no no, not yet."
Don't you just love the city at night?
I wish I was one of those insomniacs.
I could live my whole life at night.
"Well, except I'd probably get rickets or something."
- Try a doughnut?
"- No, I'm alright, thanks."
Where is she?
In there.
So what's the story then?
"Just look after her, make sure she's OK."
Help her settle in.
- Be kind.
"- Yeah, good."
Ready?
Brit!
"No, I should check it."
Let me guess: work?
What?
We have finally finally traced the mobile of the victim from the scene where we found your friend's DNA.
Her name's Annie Green.
"For the best bit, it's turned on."
- You saying we track it?
- Already on it.
Alright.
I have to go.
"Momma, my sister, I have to go."
- Go.
- I'll see you later.
- I'll come back.
- Go.
Chopper is on the way there now.
Tell him I'll pick him up at 7.
Tell Nathan to come see me.
I'll do what I can.
Peyton?
Peyton!
- Where's Peyton?
- Dressing for school is my guess.
Who are you?
I'm the guy who's about to take that rake from you and beat your scrawny ass.
I'm her dad.
Who are you?
Oh.
Sorry.
The front door was open and I thought...
I'm Lucas.
Larry Sawyer.
"Hey dad, do you know where my..."
What are you doing here?
Oh he's trying to rake me to death.
What?
!
I thought you were... nothing crucial.
I'm gonna go put this back.
"- So, who's the guy?"
- What guy?
The one that's got you smiling.
That'd be my dad.
"Oh, I'd be smiling too but for entirely different reasons."
"Dude, that's my dad!"
Don't go all horndog on me.
There's a line!
"Speaking of which, I really don't wanna cross any so tell me if this is totally inappropriate to ask."
"No matter how much I mess up, they'll be there to help me."
But if he can't control his power -- it's all right.
How is it all right?
"By now, Steven has realized his powers are tied to his emotions."
Just like I knew would happen.
"He's used the memories of happy and sad things to land safely behind us, ready to give us a hug."
[ Grunts ]
Close enough.
Guys!
Wait!
You have somewhere else to be!
What?
There's no time!
Run to the big donut!
Run!
"Uh, okay!"
I would've liked a hug.
[ Panting ]
[ Gasps ] No way!
"No way, no way, no way, no way!"
Ooh!
Oh. [ Chuckles ]
Uh...
You're just opening?
I thought I was late!
Late?
We always open at 7:30 on Sundays.
"Ahh, duh!"
"Well, you're just in time."
Here you go!
My treat!
A fresh-baked frosted donut with sprinkles!
Call in the dogs and put out the fire!
We're gonna crown us a new champion!
"Checkered flag, here I come!"
No!
McQueen's blown a tire!
And with only one turn to go!
Can he make it?
You fool!
McQueen's blown a tire!
He's blown a tire!
"Go, go, go!"
He's lost another tire!
- King and Chick come up fast!
- They're entering turn three!
Come on.
"I don't believe what I'm watching, Bob!"
Lightning McQueen is 100 feet from his Piston Cup!
The King and Chick rounding turn four.
Down the stretch they come!
"And it's, and it's..."
- It's too close to call!
Too close!
- I don't believe it!
Lightning!
"- The most spectacular, amazing..."
- I don't believe it!
"...unequivocally, unbelievable ending in the history of the world!"
- And we don't know who won!
- Look at that!
- That's very close to call.
- Can we play that again?
"Hey, no cameras!"
It's me.
Where are you?
What about you?
Don't ask me anything.
You need to get to your daughter.
Now.
Tell me what's going on?
I'm at your place.
"Get back to your house, now."
First tell me what's going on.
I...
I misread the divination.
It's not him.
What are you talking about?
I cast the hex on the wrong ghost.
I saw a woman in front of your house.
I made a grave mistake.
"A terrible, terrible mistake."
It's not the Japanese man.
That woman is the evil spirit.
It was all her doing.
"So, go home now."
"I'm on my way there, too."
Then...
Who's the Japanese man?
He was trying to kill that woman in order to save people from her.
Understand?
"That Japanese man- he's a shaman, like me."
Was the woman... wearing white?
Did you see her?
A young woman?
That's her.
"Come on, buddy."
What'd we talk about this year?
- Balance and torque.
"- That's right, come on."
Let's go!
See what you got.
"Hey, your head's moving all over the place, like this."
You're all over.
"Connor, pivot the back foot."
Pivot like this.
Pivot.
That's better.
"Hey, way to go."
Nice hit.
Good job.
"Look, that front foot's gotta land in the same place every time."
- It slipped.
- No excuses!
Come on!
"Hey, what's the matter with you?"
Your focus is all over the place today.
Need a refill?
A soda?
"- Uh, it's a vanilla shake."
"- Oh, yeah."
We don't do refills on shakes.
- Yeah.
I figured.
"- Yeah, vanilla's my favorite."
"It has to be really good vanilla, though."
"You should, um, check out the place down the street, in the mini-mall on Olamar."
Best shakes in town.
"AND YOU NEED HELP, AND YOU KNOW IT."
I DON'T THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.
IS THAT A TACTICAL JUDGMENT OR A PERSONAL ONE?
BOTH -
"- EVERYBODY I KNOW IS IN DANGER RIGHT NOW,"
EVERYONE I'M CLOSE TO.
WELL...
I'M WILLING TO RISK IT...
IF YOU ARE.
HOW'S MY MOM?
"LOCKED UP COZY WITH A CIGARETTE AND A SHOTGUN,"
READY TO KILL ANYTHING THAT COMES THROUGH THE DOOR.
"HERE YOU GO,DOUG -"
- MY LUCKY VEST.
IT WILL LOOK GREAT OVER MY SHIRT.
thanks
"IT'S A LITTLE WORN, BUT IT WILL DO THE TRICK."
ARE THESE BULLET HOLES?
"YEAH, I BROKE IT IN FOR YOU."
IT'S A SHORT RIDE TO THE U.S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE.
"JUST THINK OF IT AS A PRECAUTION,LIKE A SEAT BELT."
A SEAT BELT THAT SMELLS LIKE OLD SPICE AND BOURBON.
"EASY,NOW."
"ASSASSINATION IS 1% SHOOTING, 99% PREPARATION --"
"ANTICIPATING MOVES,"
"DEVISING APPROACHES, RECRUITING SOURCES,"
FINDING THE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY
SO THE BULLET'S ALMOST AN AFTERTHOUGHT.
"USUALLY,THAT'S WHEN A TARGET IS ON THE MOVE --"
WHEN THERE ARE TOO MANY VARIABLES TO CONTROL THEM ALL.
WE SHOULD GET OUT OF HERE.
"MICHAEL,WHATEVER HAPPENS, THANK YOU."
"I mean, you call these problems?"
"""Oh, it's horrible."
"Someone wrote in the sky for me. """
I'd kill to find a little note in my diaphragm case.
Oh...
But that's just me.
Then maybe he should be with you.
"No, Joanne."
"Joanne, wait."
Wait.
This is the best party ever.
- Nice speech.
- It was horrible.
I thought it was great.
"Oh, happy people complaining."
"No, they deserve to be yelled at."
I'm Richie.
Lina.
"No, I know."
Um
"- You sat in front of me in Ms. Klinger's class, but then in fourth grade you were gone."
We transferred to private school.
After Kat was expelled for telling Mr. Dubin he looked like a penis.
"He did, he kinda looked like a penis."
"Yeah, and the turtlenecks didn't help."
I like your hat.
Are-are you making fun of me?
'Cause I don't think I could handle-
"No, I like it."
"It's, um... jaunty."
Hey.
"Couldn't have looked like crap just a little, huh?"
Theta bands could indicate at least half a dozen different things.
One of which is pain.
"The fact that he's no longer screaming makes us feel better, not necessarily him."
Chase!
How's cameron?
She's not giddy.
Fever's down.
White count's improving.
Has she said anything to you?
"You mean like,""I completely understand why foreman did what he did, and I hold no grudge?"""
What I did... did save my life.
Get in here and help!
Forget the suit!
He's tachycardic!
Wide-complex looks like v-tach!
It's not cryptococcus!
What?
- House was wrong.
The samples were negative.
So what is it?
We don't know!
- Give him in the amio.
Do we have any more leads?
That was our lead!
Foreman!
So the treatment isn't doing anything.
Foreman!
He's in v-fib!
No good.
Hit him again.
"Come on, man."
"Come on, joe."
There doesn't seem to be any problems with his eye.
Just a cut on his lower eyelid.
The match can't continue.
It's fine.
Stop joking.
Captain Tezuka is worried too.
I want to play.
Ten minutes.
"If you don't win in ten minutes, I'll substitute you."
Tezuka.
Alright?
No problem.
Sorry for the wait.
Still playing on?
"Just a little cut, no reason to make a big fuss."
That guy's left-handed.
No way.
You'd better admit defeat.
Nitouryu.
Note:
This name refers to Ryoma's ambidexterity.
Seigaku Tennis Team.
Congratulations on your victory.
Thank you.
Players of the tennis club.
"Today, my idiot son lost his game sorry to bring you guys trouble."
It's okay we won in the end.
- It's my treat today.
- Thanks.
"Eat, eat."
"- Everyone, let's toast."
- Okay.

Two albums plus a double 'A' side single.
Disbanded in '94.
Thanks.
- My God.
- What?
- Look.
- The Go-Go's.
- You must have that one.
- No.
For my mom.
This was her favorite group when she was my age.
It's signed by Belinda.
This would be the perfect graduation present.
"I've been looking all week long, and I couldn't find anything."
- Now I have Belinda.
- Graduation?
From college.
From business classes.
I'm surprised she has time for anything... except lighting darts on fire and throwing them at my picture.
"It's not a lot of time, but..."
- Go on.
Get it.
She'll like it.
- Thank you so much for bringing me here.
- This was fate.
- I think it was.
"And in return, I just might show you my withering stare."
I'm a lucky man.
- I think this one's mine.
- Yep.
Thank you.
- Is everything there?
- Yes.
- I didn't touch anything.
- Thank you.
- Where are you going?
- Home.
May I walk you there?
I've got nothing to do.
"- Yes, but I'm going home."
"- Yes, of course."
Good.
I couldn't live without dancing.
And I love watching it.
- Do you like dancing?
- I guess so.
"Well, yes."
But I've never gone to see anything.
"What else do you do, besides dancing?"
"I love traveling, and I go to the Cinematheque a lot to see films."
Recently I've discovered silent cinema.
It's my favorite.
- Silent cinema?
- Yes.
- What do you do when you go out?
- I don't go out.
You must go out sometime.
"I was looking after my mother, but she died two months ago."
I'm sorry.
"My mother died too, but a long time ago."
"Well, we're here."
Thanks for the wallet.
"- Sorry, it looks like a pigsty."
- Do you spend wisely.
So it is now.
What an ugly bag.
"- There are more than 200,000."
"- There are actually 500,000."
Jaså.
We clean up after yourself.
- I've messed up!
- It is you who have fucked you!
I salute the way from Vijay.
He got 10 years!
Shit.
Moment
"No, let it sit."
- Your fucking snitch.
"- Yes, I'm a fucking snitch."
Come on.
Hold this.
Wait here.
- They have several informants.
"- Bye, Dad."
You can even see in the new documents.
I send them over a secure line.
"Well, and if I need to check other cases ..."
Can I call you back?
What are you doing here?
Do you know why we tolerate your kind?
Because I just fit your work.
But you have gone too far.
Now there shall be no rules anymore.
I have not done anything.
Wow!
You know what I think?
I don't think you're gonna do a fucking thing...
"I think you're just gonna stand there, like the little girl you are..."
And I'm gonna grab that stick...
and ram it right up your ass...
And then...?
You're goin' swimming.
hey hey quickly
Dude....
Zoric is over there checking us out let it go...
We'll beat his little ass later...
Give me the stick...
Give me the stick...
Holy shit!
Are you fucking crazy!
?
Hey!
Okay.
"Please, move back."
move back
"Give me one reason I shouldn't suspend you, Owen..."
Can you think of one?
Don't you know what could've happened...?
You seem like a smart kid.
I just don't want to see you going down the wrong path...
He's a good boy... he really is...
Hello...?
Is John there...?
Excuse me...?
This is his wife who's this...?
"hello, Cindy..."
- What if they are ghosts?
- There are no ghosts.
That's enough.
"If they are alive, they must be exhausted."
We'll easily catch them.
- We must try to capture them alive.
- Why?
I want to finish them off.
Over here.
I can see them.
Give me that.
Stupid bitches.
- They've gone.
- They're in one of the wrecks.
We can't search all the wrecksl
"Did you see anything, Bosco?"
I haven't seen them.
They must still be here.
- We must wait until daybreak.
- We'll find them eventually.
I know how to drive them out.
"Paul, bring your lamp."
"Come here, all of you."
Le Bosco has an idea.
You come down too!
- Hurry up.

Stay here and tell me if you see them.

A real pisser.
You wanna talk now?
"Okay, let's talk."
Let's get it over with.

We'll go to the diner over there on the boulevard.
-Which diner?
-Rockaway Boulevard. lt's open 24 hours.
-They got danishes there?
"-Yeah, they got everything."
Let's pick up some danishes for Belle.
You hear about the points we were shaving up in Boston?
It's terrific.

I thought he'd never shut the fuck up.
I know.
Pain in the ass.
-Whatta you wanna do with him?
-Chop him up and get rid of the car.
Call me when you get through.
"-Frank, let's chop him up."
-All right.
"-Where you going, you dizzy motherfucker, you?"
-I thought you said chop him up.
"Up at Charlie's, not here!"
"Come on, what are you doing?"
Get the fuck out of here.
Mom.
Hey.
I'm so sorry.
Everything's fine.
`
The baby's okay.
She's okay.
She ?
It's a girl.
Sweet.
Cool.
"Well, looks like the old girl held up pretty good."
I can't wait to have a hot shower with the hot water we don't have.
I'll settle for sleeping in my own bed.
Or sleeping anywhere.
"Come on, I'll fire up the grill, we'll get the camp stove going..."
it'll be fun.
Caleb is going to be indicted.
I don't know when.
"- Oh, my God, the yard guy?"
"- Yeah, I know."
"What was I supposed to do, wait for you?"
You weren't coming back.
I wanted you to tell me the truth.
- Who's your favorite writer?
- Bendis.
"Well, hot damn, welcome to the club."
- I love that guy.
- You're not the only one.
"- You had me three months ago, and you left."
- I want to make that up to you.
- Kayleigh Fenchurch?
"- Jesus, Harry, stop the machine!"
"- I'm dying here, come on!"
"- Come on, one last push, JC."
"He was wearing a barman's outfit when he came in, wasn't he?"
Try Kinzoku in Chinatown.
(GROANS)
(PANTS)
Cuff-Fit.
All the rage in LA.
Need to see Lily-Anne.
"- It's not gonna happen, Grey."
- Why?
"What do you mean, why?"
You're the prime suspect in her father's murder.
I need her help to get me out of here.
Time is running out for me.
Like it was running out for poor Freddie.
Either she helps me get out of here or they're gonna catch me and I will not keep my mouth shut!
Alright?
- There you are.
"- Thank you, Stan."
Kevin Grey is now working in Kinzoku.
Lily-Anne Lau's karaoke bar?
SURI:
Who's that?
No one.
"Come on, let's go in."
(MUSIC PLAYS)
# It was a kind of so-so love
"# And I'm gonna make sure it never happens again it You and I, it had to be"
I?
Temperature suddenly dropping with no explanation.
Thought that you were a man of science.
I am.
But I also know that there are things in life that even science can't explain.
Okay.
Carter.
Any messages for me?
"Uh, no, Ms. Marquez, no messages."
There's nothing from Mr. Harpel?
Nothing.
Danny here?
Do you see him?
What about Ed?
It's kind of urgent.
[Sighs]
One of my whales disappeared.
I can help you.
I should probably talk to Danny.
I can do anything he can do.
Probably more.
- Really?
"- Oh, uh, really."
Can you find Mr. Harpel?
The guy you were supposed to meet earlier?
Mm-hmm.
You sure he didn't just stand you up?
Or maybe Paul Logan swooped in and yanked him from your clutches.
I knew this was too serious for you to understand.
"Hey, Danny."
It's Sam.
I need to talk to you right away.
Hey.
Looks like it's gonna be a late one here tonight.
Yeah.
"No, no, everything's fine."
"Just a lot going on, back-to-back meetings."
Yeah.
"I love you, too."
It's complicated.
"Family, Leon."
Always is.
"So, you think my chattiness is annoying?"
"I think you asking me about your chattiness non-stop for the past 20 minutes is annoying, yes."
Want to know who else thought my chattiness was annoying?
Wendy.
She said it made me sound nervous and insecure.
- Like that's even possible.
"- Stop it, Tony."
"It was one little comment Gibbs made, okay?"
Nothing more.
"And as for Wendy, I believe you were right to turn the book on that relationship."
"Turn the page, close the book, but... yeah, I guess I was."
Oh.
Meredith Bilson?
Who are you?
Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo.
This is
Agent David.
NCIS.
"We need to talk to you about your boyfriend,"
Petty Officer Caleb Adams.
Is s-something wrong?
May we come in?
"Uh, uh, I'm..."
Oh my dick!
"Now, you are charged with murdering."
You can employ your own lawyer to defend for you.
Do you have any lawyer?
Yes!
Chan Mon-gut!
Shit!
"Mister, are you ready?"
I've found Master.
Good!
Let's go.
"After the shaving, no hair will be left."
"You can't regret, Mister,"
do you want a second thought?
Come on.
Stop!
"Fleas are living in my armpit, why do you stop me?"
May I have a little bit freedom?
"Mister, do you want to go on?"
"Yes, please."
Foon is being charged with hom4cide in Hong Kong.
What?
Yes.
Hey!
What?
Are you going to save him?
How?
"If you don't, he will die."
People will die sooner or later!
You are smart and wise!
I can't help...
He committed crime in HK which is governed by British law.
- No.
Mr Thomas.
Can you tell me what you remember last?
Well.
I came out of my apartment.
and I walked...
My head was spinning and I fell down.
After that.
I don't remember.
It's better that way.
- Why?
What happened?
Repeated convulsions that lasted about fifteen minutes.
Your heart made it.
Then the ambulance brought you here.
I gave you narcotics and neuroleptics.
What?
You touched me?
I was wearing gloves.
Yes.
But you were near me?
How did I get here?
Listen.
Mr Thomas.
you had severe allergic reactions.
I don't want to shake you up.
I want to know the truth.
Did you bring me here?
You came into my home?
What about the alarms?
The insurance cut them off.
Yes.
I escaped because I played dead.
Played dead?
Yeah.
That wasn't my fault.
Get me?
Yeah.
Where'd you come from?
I've known this guy for six months.
What is that?
It's a good plan.
"I'm his crew, we go way back."
What about you?
I'm his sister.
"Okay, everyone stop."
"This is my lead, my research, my job."
You're out.
"No, wait."
Connor listen.
"Look, I'm begging you, okay."
I'm begging you to let me go.
"Look, the only reason Blair is here, the reason why we're in this mess, it's because of me."
"I didn't put her first, and now we've lost everything."
And I can't risk losing her too.
"I don't care about the plans, I don't care about the score."
I'm begging you.
Please let me come.
If I let you come...
I have ground rules.
"First, the cut remains the same."
You're not gettin' any extra money for coming along.
Totally fair.
Yeah.
Uh...
Lobster truck is here.
Hm.
"An hour ago, I found Mr. Myers down in the E.R. washing the feet of a homeless guy."
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.
Reminds me of my Uncle Ben...
"Goes to mass every day, twice on Sundays."
Nobody calls him crazy or that he has some syndrome.
You believe in God?
I was raised Catholic.
It never leaves you.
I pray sometimes... mostly for the mets.
God's record there is pretty spotty.
- What's going on?
- Anything?
Who brought Mr. Janson out here?
- I can see!
- You can see?
Jacob brought him for lobster.
Ha!
"Jacob, I can see!"
I can see!
All praise to Hashem!
I can see!
It's a miracle!
"I touched Larry, and Larry can see."
This is a fact.
"Look, as scientists, you have to accept hard evidence."
Larry has graves' disease.
That's why he was blind.
We treated him with a steroid that reduced the swelling...
like your girlfriend claimed.
He didn't?
He was murdered.
Skinned.
It was never solved.
The colleaguesthink that it was a kind of
"Personal vengeance, because the murderer or murderess took several days to skin him."
"Now guess who left New York a day after the murder, even days before the press found out."
She lied to you.
Probably from the beginning.
She played with you like a cat with a mouse.
She screwed you and whoever worked with her.
Where is she?
Where is she?
- Who?
No.
No...
Where is she?
Wait!
Where is she?
- No.
"Please, don't."
No.
This won't get you anywhere!
I'm meaningless.
You didn't accomplish anything.
[Sighs]
What?
[Ding]
Morning.
Did a package arrive from booth Allen in Chicago?
Who's gonna read me a story?
"Just read it yourself, OK?"
Not now.
OK.
Well?
Tell me his name.
(Sighs)
It doesn't matter now.
I'm back here in the loving bosom of the family.
"Yes, it does matter."
Who did you screw?
13-1.
Yep.
"Good, see ya."
The PDO's sent you a murder.
"Hey, you know we're out of this room tomorrow."
"A street kid, tortured and murdered."
There goes all the fun.
I don't mind adults whacking each other but this stuff twists you.
So Barney will meet you in remand.
Barney's instructing?
"That's good, isn't it?"
Yeah.
Good.
He'll meet you there.
Did you know the deceased?
Had you had an argument with him?
Had he tried to rob you?
Provoke you?
Had you had sex with him?
I'm not into boys.
You're currently living in a shelter in Abbotsford.
I always loved watching him sleep.
I take it you're setting out for Candor in the morning?
Yeah.
"Listen, I only want what's best for him."
You hardly even know him.
"You'd like to think that, wouldn't you?"
"But deep down, I think you're scared"
I know him all too well.
I'm not scared.
Of course you are.
You're scared he'll finally see you for what you really are.
Deadly.
You don't believe me?
Ask him.
(PANTING)
FOUR:
You okay?
Yeah.
You sure?
Yeah.
I'm not coming with you guys.
What?
To Candor.
I'm not coming with you guys.
What are you talking about?
What's your plan?
You guys are gonna find the rest of Dauntless.
Then what?
"You attack Erudite, assassinate Jeanine, start a civil war?"
"I'm sorry, I'm just not..."
I'm not cut out for that.
I'm not like you guys.
"Oh no, don't shoot!"
I hate violence!
I'm here to tell you a secret!
Put your pistol away!
What secret?
Get it out!
"Alright, but I have one condition!"
What condition?
I want Yoyo to kiss me once.
Supermac 99!
I order you to kiss her.
"Lucky you, kiddo!"
"In the name of our country, kiss her!"
Go on!
- You have to close your eyes!
- O.K.!
"Hey, wake up. lt's done!"
Japan cabled today.
Hiroshima only has a phoney Formula.
You have the real one!
We all know that!
That's why the other secret is even more important!
What other secret?
"I'll tell, but I have to kiss Yoyo this time."
What a pity!
Serves you right!
"Alright, but you have to close your eyes again!"
Sure thing!
My first kiss!
"Don't faint, wake up!"
"Now, what's the secret?"
My father Fat Pig is coming with his troops to get you.
"In the Paratroopers, I mean."
I don't know.
I guess I wanted to get knocked off or something.
But as soon as I got away from my mother... I suddenly realized how wonderful life really was!
And then I fought like a tiger to stay alive!
I was running away from problems.
You know what I mean.
"Yeah, I know."
"Something's bothering you, isn't it?"
Yeah...
Can I help?
"No, you can't."
Better not to talk about it.
All right.
"-Hey, have you had dinner?"
-No.
-Would you like dinner with me?
-Okay!
All right.
Doc Swain?
"Evening, Selena."
I'll be right with you.
My wife loved these flower gardens.
I try to keep them up for her.
"Ah, watch your feet."
Are you going to tell them about me?
"-I'll have to, Selena."
-Nobody in town must ever know.
"But, if I don't, you'll be risking your life."
-I know that.
"-Well, then, why?"
-Because of Ted.
- Fuck!
Watch out for cheetahs!
This is cheetah turf.
- What?
- OK.
Fuck.
We hit ocean.
What do we do now?
All right.
"Hey, look, look!"
Excuse me.
You guys going to America?
"Sí, vamos."
"Yes, we're going."
Thank you.
- Es mío.
"- Vamos, vamos."
"I'm telling you, Jorge... the first thing you have to do when you get to America... buy a device called TiVo, OK?"
Freedom means nothing if you're a slave to regular programming...
I promise you that.
"And now, how about you focus?"
We gotta figure out what to do when we get to the States.
We don't have wallets.
We don't have any ID.
We've got nothing.
"Well, I figure we're gonna land somewhere around Miami, right?"
There's only one guy we know who lives down there.
- Who do we know that--Raza.
- Yeah.
We gotta go see Raza.
- Adiós.
- Hasta luego.
- Shut up.
- He totally knows.
"- My point is it took Elliott a year to say he loved me, and another year to say it without using a cartoon voice."
"I think I should be ready for a guy who shows emotions,right?"
- Yeah.
Totally.
- Don't you think?
Just maybe not so many of them.
And on separate occasions.
"And,like,when you're not there."
"Hey,beautiful."
Hi.
This is a surprise.
I hope it's okay.
I just...
I couldn't stop thinking about you.
Dad.
Um...
"You know,I found a strand of your hair on my jacket."
"What,is he shipping out tomorrow?"
It smelled like you.
I'm kind of working.
I love that you're working.
"I love that you work here,and that your hair smells."
Thank you.
"Oh,can we go for a walk or something?"
Yeah.
Is that...?
Get a cramp?
You okay?
Yeah!
We should come back to the beach tonight.
- Adam.
"No, dude, that is Adam."
"Dude, that is Pete."
Can you give us a sec?
"Live it up, football jocks!"
- It's all downhill from here.
- Oh!
It's going down!
I just heard!
"Here, tonight!"
It's going down!
Nice dress.
Did your mom make it?
"Listen to me, damn it!"
"I didn't see them, but I heard their plan."
"""At 11:00 sharp, we shank the dork."""
"Ellie, some poor kid's getting pantsed!"
"No, this can't be happening."
Not now!
Not again!
"Boo, you got your crazy face on."
A-are you all right?
[ Sighs deeply ] 1987.
Senior prom.
I was so excited.
"I had a cool tux, a hot date, and a plan to help my best pal Bucky Martin score a dance with the girl of his dreams."
Bucky Martin?
Sounds like a stud.
- He actually wasn't.
- Stop it.
"But I knew he could be, if he-- if he just believed."
"And then when I saw Cindy Lee standing alone at the punch bowl,"
"They don't got gold, neither."
"Wait a minute, wait a minute!"
We had one of them nothing school trips.
To the museum.
"Yeah, they got a pile of gold."
And a stagecoach.
They had to kick me out.
We've got to go there.
"Come on, it's over here."
"Now, Tony."
We're going to create a little diversion.
The stagecoach.
I want you to roll it all around the museum.
Look out.
Watch it.
"Watch out for that thing, it's coming this way."
"Hey, where are the horses?"
I... don't know.
Now cause total chaos.
Watch out.
Short circuit the control system.
"Oh, no."
Letha!
Letha!
Look out.
Get out of my way.
Can't you put that thing out?
"Come on, take a shot."
Move it.
"Now, Tony,"
Make a hole in the plastic shield.
And it doesn't have to be neat.
- Just a minute.
alberto?
"Now I can leave, my best to yourIover."
- What lover?
.
- AII yourIies!
"It's my fault, but I didn't do it on purpose!"
"Scapece was yelling, but I couldn't understand!"
Stay back.
Be careful.
If I asked you to marry me?
No rush.
Rememberwhen we got married?
"We lived everywhere, we didn't give a damn."
We were happy because we were together.
How could we have forgotten that?
Jackass.

From the central Office.
"Two years have gone by, it was bound to come."

"It's always the same with you directors, you come, we get used to you, when everything's workin' smooth, you run off like thieves."
Goodbye.
Mamma's boy!

There you go.
Could you please tell John that I called?
Hi there...
Your mom or dad home?
Yes.
Mom!

"- Sorry to bother you, Ma'am."
What's this about...?
I'm afraid there's been an incident with one of your neighbors here in the complex...
"So we're just going around, talking to people..."

What kind of incident?
"Owen, why don't you go to your room...?"
"- Sorry, guys!"

I thought he was really obnoxious.
He kept fidgeting around.

Ready?
Lighten up.
We just got here.
What are you doing?
he was pushing me into the car thenpullingme out.
Itwasridiculous.
Diane and Tommy made us promise to meet them again on Friday.
We agreed.
Henry stood me up.
I feel terrible.
I don't know where he is.
He really liked you.
All he did was talk about her.
We were a trio instead of a double date.
He should have called.
I hope it's nothing serious.
But I made Tommy take me looking for him.
Hold it!
"Ah, Mr. MacGyver, we've been expecting you."
You should know your partner here tried to kill us.
Cleeve!
Is this true?
Don't be naive.
Did you really think I'd leave them to follow us or call the police?
Good thinking.
We didn't come alone.
"Oh, come on."
You don't think I'm gonna fall for an old trick like that?
No!
"Yeah, sure, now who's side are you on?"
Yours.
Can we discuss it later?
"He's got a point, MacGyver."
Come on.
Which way?
The plane.
"Oh, MacGyver..."
"Uh, MacGyver."
There's something I've got to tell you.
Later.
Get in.
Um...
The window!
There's no key for the magneto switch.
That was what I was trying to tell you.
I removed it so they couldn't take off with the artifacts.
That's a great idea.
Where is it?
Out there.

Get in.
What's happening?
What's this?
The Vesuvius.
We're having a dress rehearsal Monday afternoon.

That gives us only three days.
You've got to finish it!
The show opens Monday night.
"- Oh, alright."
- Fine.
Here you are.
"Now remember, we must have the costumes Monday morning."
[snaps]
- What about those amber spots?
- 'Right away.'
They should be on when the curtains come through.

Where am I?
Who are you?
I can't stop it.
I don't know who I am.
So I...
So I need to go home.
The interface has data tendrils like roots.
They've dug in deeper than they're meant to.
"Threaded through your brain, taken over whole areas, I can't stop it."
"I can't remove it, and I can't stop it."
But I...
But I don't know who I am.
I don't know...
I don't know who I am.

"No, revolutionaries."
They're coming to our village.
- What do they want?
- Let's wait and see.
We are your friends.
I hope you know that.
We'll march on soon.
All we're asking for is provisions and water.
"We'll rest a bit, and then we'll march on."
"My village is poor, but we'll share."
I love these gushing receptions.
Really charming.
"Captain howdy, do you think my mom's pretty?"
Captain howdy?
"Captain howdy, that isn't very nice."
"Well, maybe he's sleeping."
You think?
What--Regan...
Why are you reading that stuff?
Because I like it.
It's not even a good picture of you.
You look so mature.
I wouldn't talk.
You wouldn't talk?
"Well, I didn't have my makeup man there."
Let me take an eyelash off your face.
"No, I didn't get it."
What are we going to do on your birthday?
Isn't it nice it's on Sunday this year?
What can we do?
I don't know.
What would you like to do?
Got any ideas?
Mm-mmm.
No?
Let me think.
Let me think.
What can we do?
We never finished seeing all the sights in Washington.
"We didn't get to the Lee mansion, lots of stuff."
Shall we go sightseeing...

You won't?
You really won't do as I say?

"Director Kim, come here now!"
I'm not going to let this one go.
I'm serious.
I can't stand it when a person mistreats another.
Can't stand it?
So what?
"I still like you, even if you've done wrong."
I respect you as a director.
"Now, go and apologize."
I'm serious.
Go say you're sorry.
That's the right thing to do.
You apologize if you like.
Why should I?
Because you treated him like dirt!
You really won't apologize?
"If you don't, I'm going back to Seoul."
You won't?
"Okay, I'm leaving."
Let's go!
Seriously?
Back to Seoul?
What's gotten into you?
"Alright, I did wrong."
Let's stop this!
"No, you have to go and apologize."
"-Good, if you want..."
"I am going to prove it to me, but you do not take advantage which my parents have gone away to Florence."
And that does not return until this the night.
And you do not watch to me by the eye of the lock.
Absolutely.
In agreement.
"It sees calm, I am ""gentleman""."
-Certainly you do not watch to me?
-I have said that no. to You.
-I will do in a while.
I go.
-Please.
You do not watch?
eh?
"No, absolutely."
"I want that the things between us they are pretty, very clean, until the marriage."
"Soon all good will go, will be all normal one."
You do not watch?
eh?
holy shit...
Alvaro?
what you do in the ground?
Eh?
I do... yoga.
You like?
Good... it is not bad...
"It is pretty, truth?"
yes.
You like it or not?
Good... enough...
They see here.
"No, Alvaro, you do not do it."
The usual way.
Somebody pointed a gun at her and pulled the trigger .
Who?
It's complicated.
"Well, it all kind of makes sense now."
Why ?
You talked about her in you sleep some times.
I do ?
Yea.
Dreaming Flowers
Vi ?
"Yeah, man"
I can't wait until we get the dresses.
Things are going to change for us after that.
Oh hell yeah !
Do we need to chain it up?
Nah.
This'll do .
If you touch you DIE
Cool?
Cool.
This really is the last time I'm going to say this to you...
Okay ?
Or anything else.
I don't want you to send me anything anymore.
I don't...
I threw out the flowers.
You can't fix it!
And I'm really done with you.
"I don't want to talk to you again, I don't want to hear from you again."
I want you to leave me alone.
Please .
"- Hey, John, check the words to this."
Yo!
"And I ain't chatting no black talk, mate."
Yo means I in Spanish.
- Very impressive.
- There's more.
Yo no soy marinero.
I ain't no sailor.
Soy capitan.
I'm captain.
I've found Risdale.
"To dance La Bamba, what do you need?"
Una poca de gracia
Shut up!
"For once in your stupid and pointless life, shut up."
"I'm in love, mate."
Do you know what it feels like to be in love?
Have you ever been in love?
"Seriously, John, that ain't a trick question."
Have you ever loved anybody?
Anybody whose name isn't Mercer?
We're going to the seaside.
Pack a bag.
"Mi amor, Calum."
Mi gusto los churros a los chico.
You forget about the sea sometimes.
Yeah.
It reminds me of biscuits.
Really?
Why's that?
"When we were just little kids, my dad used to take us to the seaside."
Me and my sister would sit in the back eating digestive biscuits.
Takehara sees Mother a lot?
I don't know.
Come in!
Hello.
Hello.
What do you think?
Will you let us use it?
It's a little embarrassing.
It'll get you a lot in return if you do let me use it.
My mother says that she can't make it today.
I think you were supposed to go the Kabuki with her.
Has something come up?
My father came back.
I see.
Welcome.
It's been a while.
How are you?
Same as ever.
"Takao, I haven't seen you in ages."
Is your mother well?
Yes.
You should come to Kamakura.
The beach is really popular.
I'd like to get there this summer.
Excuse me.
Someone from the Kokuminsha is here.
"Send him in, please."
Will you be going in the bath later?
"I will, but after we're done talking."
Make yourself at home.
Mother was a friend of hers wasn't she?
"Yes, I think they were very close."
What do you mean?
Let me free.
No way.
The law is right.
Come on.
Why are you being so stubborn?
Law is dead.
But we are alive.
Why don't you be a little more sensible.
"Come on, look."
"I'll give you $10,000, you can do as you want."
"Eh, well then?"
Officer Jeng?
I refuse!
You keep quiet.
You want me to charge you with bribery?
What?
"Well, bribery would just make one more charge."
It won't make much difference.
Huh.
"I wanna ask you, did you come from Wayne County?"
Huh?
(Laughing)
"I've been around, in all parts of this area."
But not as far as a county of Wayne.
"You were an accountant, that right?"
"Me, accountant?"
"Can't make a good living these days, don't you agree?"
One thing.
"Was your name Lun Taichen, and did you know Cheng Tachwan?"
Cheng Tachwan?
Cheng Tachwan?
Yes.

I'm serious.
I love this color...

You're putting me on.
Wow!
Your eyes are the color of this bay!
"Man, you're weird."
They are!

Incredible.
Exactly the same color.
You're the first person that says they're green.

"He's not gay, is he?"
Dennis!
"- That's not Dennis, Mumsie."
- Of course it's Dennis.
- I should know.
"- Well, it can't be."
Then who was the man in the trunk?
"Oh, Mumsie, what have you done?"
What have I done?
!
You have murdered an innocent bystander.
Control yourself.
- Get this back to the barge.
- Why?
"If he misses it, he'll be suspicious."
"Besides, it pointless our taking it while he's alive."
"If I nobble him now, we can get it back."
Though why you had to go and warn him...
Hurry!
Hurry!
Our whole future depends on it.

Forgive me.
I was getting rid of my daughter.
Getting rid of people seems to be a hobby of yours.

Are you sure you won't have a drink?
"Oh, no."
"For once, I think I won't."
- Oh...

Business before pleasure.

Not at all.

I'm sorry.
l-l don't even like Nikki.
I was trippin' off Kenny.
"You can't help who you love, Derek."
You're not supposed to.
"When you love somebody, you love them."
Look at me.
At least you found somebody who loves you back.
I gotta go.
Where you going ?
"Stay out of my business, Chenille."
I know what Malakai wants you to do.
"Why are you trippin' off him, Derek ?"
All you're trying to do is get the hell up out of here.
Ain't no shame or blame in that.
It's getting cold out here.
Take that baby inside.
Hey.
Hey.
"Kai, I've been trying to catch up with you."
I gotta talk to you.
- Ready to roll ?
- l gotta talk to you.
- Wassup ?
"- Look, man. I ain't going with you."
What you mean you're not going ?
-You know what I mean.
-Did you come here to waste my time?
"This shit is nonsense, Kai."
It's dangerous nonsense.
"Just back up off it, man."
Come on.
- You believe me?
- Yeah.
- Poor bastard.
"- Jerry's a good guy, so don't..."
"No, I'm not."
"It's just that,"
"I mean, man, it's gotta hurt."
"One time I kissed this girl who I was,"
- I had such a crush on...
- I don't need to hear this.
- I had to watch you kissing Jerry.
- Yeah but that's not...
"Anyway, I did the Hail Mary thing, and it was great, I thought, and after the kiss, I was like, here we go, this is gonna happen."
- OK.
"- Yeah, OK, that's what I thought. ""OK."""
"Except she said, oh, kissing me was like kissing wait for it... her brother."
- Oh that's so gross.
- Right?
That's not what it's like kissing Jerry.
What?
He's a good kisser.
I'm just being honest.
But not as good as kissing me.
I forget.
Mm...
Still not sure...
You win.
I'm going to Dallas because I love you.
Do you love me?
"I can't believe I have to ask, but..."
"Yeah, I do."
I love you.
That was your first lie.
It's inevitable.
"You're gonna get old, Stefan won't."
Forever doesn't last very long when you're human.
"I'm sorry, but I don't have what you're looking for."

And tell your boyfriend to walk away.
- I want the invention.

I know that.
But Damon does.
- And you're gonna get it for me.
- He's not gonna give it to me.
Then the blood will be on your hands.
"It was nice meeting you, Elena."
"Hey, Anna."
"Uh, where are you?"
What's up?
Uh...
Give me a call when you get this.
How is Anna?
I like that girl.
She has fire.
"Uh, I don't know."
- She won't return my calls.
- Girl trouble?
"No, no trouble."
"Anna just owes me a call, that's it."
Is that the girl that I saw you with at the Founder's Pageant?
"So you two are getting pretty hot and heavy, huh?"
When was the last time you saw her?
- Why?
"Don't mind me, Joyce."
I've worked the Samaritans' Christmas bazaar.
I know misery loves company.
I just feel so alone.

Approximately 45 minutes after departure.

The ferry is always completely full on that day.
Did you hear what I said?
I'm not the one making the decisions.
Excuse me...
"Yes, what is it?"
- Look.
Good Sir Knight.
Good Sir Knight.
We're so grateful to you for rescuing us from those foul fiends.
Upsy-daisy.
"Very gracious of you, Sir Knight."
"We're very undeserving, really."
We're just humble fisher folk.
"However, we do have this maiden daughter."
As there is this custom the knight quite often marries the maiden he's rescued.
"Say hello to the knight, Griselda honey."
It was me that rescued you.
Will you clear off?
"What do you say, Sir Knight?"
Good Sir Knight.
- Well?
- Hark.
Be gone.

"Give us a name, Jordan."
You'll never find him.
Ah!
[Gunshots fire]
[Sobbing]
Okay.
"No, I understand."
Thank you.
Hey. [Door closes]
That was Ryan and Esposito.
They had to kill Jordan Keegan.
But they sent us digital copies of Jordan's computer.
That cave...
I feel cold.
That place... it is strong with the dark side.
"Mm, a domain of evil, it is."
In you must go.
What's in there?
Only what you take with you.
Your weapons... you will not need them.
"Yeah, whatever."
"What's good, Robert?"
!
What's really good?
!
Aah!
"That's right, Robert!"
I'm you!
Aah!
"I can't believe you going out like this, granddad."
"Nigga, hush!"
"Uh, yes, I-I just want to make sure that the sergeant know it's Robert Freeman."
"I'm at the mall, and I'm gonna be attacked by this crazy nigga at any time."
Okay?
So they're on their way?
"Okay, just making sure."
"Granddad, you do this, you really gonna be a bitch-ass nigga."
"I mean, I shouldn't be surprised 'cause if I Google ""bitch nigga,"" I'll find you, but damn!"
Ow!
I'm afraid to show my face!
"Hey, look who's coming."
"Go home, old man!"
You're a loser!
- [Cheers and applause
Come.
Panju.
Who is it?
Manoj?
Yes.
"Yes, that's me."
And you are?
We are coming from Kanyakumari police station.
We want some details.
Is there a problem?
Shall we talk inside?
"Okay, come in."
Who has kept this here?
- Don't change it's position...
"If you change it, he will get hurt later."
Thanks.
And you are?
He has come with me.
Take your seat.
Tell me.
The car parked outside...
Is it yours?
Yes.
You have changed the windshield of the car on the 19th.
How did it break?
Why do you want to know about that?
A small enquiry.
Tell me.
Some drunkards pelted stones on it as I'd parked it outside.
So I covered it and parked inside later.
You seem to have changed the glass in a hurry.
Small shards of broken glass pieces are still there.
I can't tell.
"-Hey, where's Lenny?"
"-Right here, Woody."
"Oh, no, I can't bear to watch one of these again."
"Oh, no, it's a Combat Carl."
What's going on?
"Nothing that concerns you spacemen, just us toys."
I'd better take a look anyway.
Why is that soldier strapped to an explosive device?
"That's why, Sid."
Sure is a hairy fellow.
"No, no, that's Scud, you idiot."
That is Sid.
-You mean that happy child?
-That ain't no happy child.
"He tortures toys, just for fun!"
"Well, then we've got to do something."
What are you doing?
Get down from there!
-I'm gonna teach that boy a lesson.
"-Yeah, sure."
You go ahead.
Melt him with your scary laser.
Be careful with that!
It's extremely dangerous.
He's lighting it!
He's lighting it!
Hit the dirt!
Look out!
Yes!
He's gone!
He's history!
"Come in, please."
I know you.
"No, I do not think so."
Yes.
"In the university, you helped me to put fiancee in a taxi, you were very amiable."
You decide to me very well.
Why have you come?
"I will see, I..."
-You want that I take a look at you?
truth?
-Yes.
I am very badly.
"Please,"
Get undressed.
-Also...?
-Yes.
Lie down.
tell me?
what happens to you?
"I have you feel nauseous, fatigue, lack of appetite."
We are going to auscultate the heart.
You seems to me a little excited.
This tightens much to me.?
It matters to him?
Please.
Thus I am more comfortable.
We see.
"Yes, very it is excited"
It excuses.
"Nowadays, the bra, they make them very small."
Thus it is well?
We are going to see where hurts to you.
Look around you...
"new fallen snow, you're with your family."
I just know this is going to be a great day.
Sue?
Sue Murphy?
"Oh, fuck me!"
"Hi, Ginny!"
"Oh, hi, Frank."
"How's the job hunt going, you poor thing?"
Any nibbles?
I should've died in Korea.
"Go play with Maureen, that's fun!"
Sorry about Frank.
He hasn't been himself lately.
That's all right.
Failure can break down even the strongest man.
How are you?
"Must have been a difficult Christmas after, you know,"
Greg abandoned you and the kids.
"Oh, no, we're back together!"
Greg took a Catholic cruise with Father Pat and came back a different man.
We're going at it like newlyweds!
"Well, that's a dirty mouth."
"Mister, I'm gonna shut you up."
"- Oh, yeah."
"- Oh, hi, stud!"
"Dear Lord, give me strength."
"Vagina, vagina, vagina!"
"Hey, baby!"
Looking attractive!
"Christ, I hate it here."
Bunch of kids.
- ( music playing ) - ( chatter )
"Oh, there's Ms. Bossman."
( chuckles ) Wow.
"WAGs for the guys in the front office, too, huh?"
- Dallas does it right.
- ( chuckles )
- Spencer.
"- Hey, Tanya."
- You look beautiful as always.
- ( kisses )
- What are you doing here?
"- Well, I heard a couple of my friends were vacationing in my neck of the woods, I thought I'd come by."
"Yeah, and I grew up nearby."
Might pop into my mom.
"Tanya, my business partner, Joe Krutel."
"- Hi, Joe."
- Hi.
Boys are getting big.
"Ah, yeah."
"Henry is already 6'1"" and he's only in middle school."
They grow 'em big like that in Texas.
When are you gonna make some?
It's such a shame to waste those genetics.
"Yeah, I am working on it."
"Tanya, where is, uh..."
Where is your husband?
- You just missed him.
- Where'd he go?
"Over there, massage."
Something really got under his skin this morning.
Said he needed extra pressure.
"Huh, wonder what that could be."
Send for my chopper.
I can take 3.
Coming along?
I'm staying.
MacDANIEL:
"I see them, Dai Uy."

Pardon me.
PETERSEN:

[SERGEANT SPEAKS IN VIETNAMESE]
HAMCHUNK:
Petersen!
PETERSEN:
Charlie's building caskets and ladders.
A lot of them.
How far away?
About 15 clicks.
That gives us plenty to do before they get here.
Restrict all operations to within 4 clicks of the camp.
- Will systems be operational by dark?
- Affirmative.
"May I suggest we contact ""C"" Team?"
See about the weather.
- Petersen?
- Yeah.
What was all that about ladders and coffins?
"When Charlie knows he's got a nice box to be buried in, he's just as brave as hell."
The ladders?
They throw the ladders across the wire to get at us.
Later they use them for litters.
Hello?
"Look, you tell me, and I'll tell her."
Even the phones don't work.
"Your sister says you've had an offer of £87,000 for your house in Brighton."
"87,000?"
Give it to me.
"Don't be a fool, Stephanie."
"92,750 I said, and I'm not taking a penny less."
You tell him that.
Why don't people listen?
Well?
"Well, let's scrub that 32p then, shall we?"
Let's enjoy ourselves.
"Oh, thank you very much."
"Oh, Major!"
Major!
"Um, can I have it now?"
"- What, old boy?"
- The money.
The money I gave you last night?
What... what is all this about?
You remember I gave you some money just before you went to that remembrance service?
- Remembrance service?
- Yes.
"I don't remember that, old boy."
It was for a chap you didn't like.
"You know, he was..."
one of those...?
One of those what?
Well...
Pansy?
Yes.
"No, it's not."
So now you're gonna be a gentleman?
(WHISPERING) Giants can smell blood.
And I'm always a gentleman.
(CORK POPS)
(CORK THUDS)
(GASPING) Ah!
What the hell is that?
It's rum.
Bloody waste of it.
(EMMA PANTING)
Here's the plan.
We wait for the giant to fall asleep.
"When he does, we'll sneak past him into his cave."
That's where the treasures are.
Where the compass lies.
And then?
And then we run like hell.
I don't have time to wait for a giant to fall asleep.
"The powder Mulan gave us, we need to use it."
We've gotta knock him out.
That's riskier.
Than waiting for a giant to fall asleep when we need him to?
Point taken.
"Ooh, you're a tough lass."
You'd make a hell of a pirate.
"Who's Milah, on the tattoo?"
Someone from long ago.
Where is she?
She's gone.
Gold.
Rumplestiltskin.
Why not?
is it problematic?
"Come on, Christine, we're both adults."
Herman is so...savage.
He doesn't beat you?
"No, in bed I mean."
What does he do?
He just pounds away.
And he comes at once.
"No wonder, that boy is crazy about you."
"Yes, but there's nothing in it for me."
Zilch!
Doesn't he repeat the exercise?
Falls right asleep.
Tough.
Perhaps I can help you.
How?
I'm psychic as you've noticed.
Get that boy down here.
I'll apply my gifts to see why he comes so quickly.
- l could possibly cure him.
- That would be wonderful.
"- Oh, but he's in Germany."
- l'll go and get him...tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
Good girl!
Up and at it!
"You're lying on something sharp, look!"
Didn't you feel it?
"No, there's a numb spot on my back."
Strange...
Clean sheets?
Wait!
Hold it!
Wait a second!
How do I break it to her gently?
I don't know.
You're good at that sort of thing.
I'm not that good at it.
"Now, wait a minute!"
Thomas!
Thomas!
Break it to her gently.
Break it to her gently.
He did it to me again.
"Hi, Lena."
Saul's got this little problem.
His heart attacked him.
"No, that's terrible."
"'Janet Clark, please report to maternity.'"
- Excuse me.
- Yes?
Could you tell me the status of a Saul Greenberg?
An ambulance brought him in a while ago.
Possible heart attack.
Sure.
I'll check for you.
No ambulances have checked in since this morning and that was a pregnancy.
That's impossible.
The ambulance left about five minutes before I did.
They may have gone to another hospital.
Was it a private ambulance?
Yeah. international Life Support.
- And his doctor?

"Hello, Douglas."
So...
"You, uh..."
"You got your guy at the table now, huh?"
That's right.
Ne'er-do-Wells could be casing our house as we speak.
Yeah?
Then why you playing pinochle with him?
"Because, moron, if I don't treat Mr. safety like a real person, they'll know he's a fake."
"Yeah, well, I gotta tell you, still weird."
"What's up with the walk, frankenstein?"
[Chuckles]
"[Chuckles] I just joined the gym, and I might have overdone it."
"Gym, huh?"
Throwin' your money away.
"I got 2 words for you, friend:"
Dynamic tension.
"Give me a bag of rice, gallon of milk, and a rubber band, and I'll give you a workout you won't soon forget."
"Don't work out with my milk, ok?"
"I'm telling you, it works."
Look at the shape I'm in.
I weigh exactly what I weighed when I was 12 years old.
[Groaning]
[Sighs]
Who's gonna pay for the window?
Go check out what's going on.
- Why don't you go?
- And you call yourself a man!
"Bello, come here!"
Come here!
"Bello, come here!"
What is going on here?
You're crazy!
Are you allright?
They picked the wrong person for a fight.
"Let's go Franz, here is your hat."
Are you alright?
"What's going on here, constable?"
"Oh, you don't know either?"
Acting like a deaf-mute.
- What do you want?
Franz again?
- Franz will be back.
- Flowers?
"- Yes, please."
I can't possibly accept this.
How do you think how is this gonna work out?
- You'll see.
- Are you hooking up with him?
- You'll see.
Even if you break his bones he'll stay the same.
You're quite smart.
"Reinhold, there are so many men."
I'll get you ten other guys!
I need him!
He must cooperate!
I didn't come back to the house ever again.
I haven't seen her or the kids since then.
Thing is I don't exactly remember how that fight begun.
But that's not important.
You've been married and you'll underst...
-Careful!
Hey!
I found a big fridge full of food!
I told you!
Ramón keeps the house ready for everything.
It's downstairs.
Do you want to see it?
No.
What are we eating?
-Are you hungry?
No.
Do you like the house?
-Yeah.
Have you seen the soccer goal?
What are we going to do?
Nothing.
Goal!
It's your turn now.
Now you.
I did know that Clara would talk about us.
About our relationship.
About how was everything.
But I didn't expect what she said.
Did she talk about me?
You weren't the point.
-The point was you two.
"Yeah, us..."
You have to think about the political aspect.
"They here, however."
-They are already bankrupt.
I was not finished talking.
M r.
"Borgen, you've got a phone from Norway."
They say it's personal.
Do you have a privacy?
Put them over.
Can you please go?
-Hallo?
-Hi.
Aksel?
Aksel Nilsen?
-Who is it?
-William Hansteen.
-Are you there?
-Yes.
How are you?
Do you know Solar Tech?
-Why do you ask?
-Old Lifjord Mechanical.
We leave on the solar cell production a few years ago.
-We have lost an important contract.
-Scanbrazil?
You have the interests of the market for alternative energy.
We are facing a breakthrough on 4G.
If I sent you ...
-We are not interested.
-How can you say that?
I see there are Eva who is controlling the company now.
"Yes, I met a little wall after what happened with Karine."
Where are you going?
I don't know yet.
Can I come?
You guys are unbelievable.
Real friends you turned out to be.
"Well, we got to do what's in the photo."
"Right, bro?"
Where we going?
Nowhere.
I don't want to abandon Jasper in case something goes wrong.
Are we okay?
I got jealous.
This is a- it's a very complicated situation.
You're doing your best.
"And I, obviously, am- I'm not handling it well."
(SIGHS)
You got jealous?
(EXHALES)
Tell me more.
"So, Ivan, I mean, what a surprise."
You said that already.
"Oh, yeah."
"Uh, can I get you something to drink?"
"You know what I like about you, Jasper?"
You never welched on a bet.
I have never had to send Marcus over here to collect.
And I can appreciate that.
I can.
Is that yours?
You mind if I see it?
(CHUCKLES)
Come on.
I hit something on the road.
Jimmy'll tell you.
What happened to him?
I haven't seen you in so long.
What happened to him?
"You, too."
How are you?
Why are you up so late?
"Well, he came in."
Youse came in.
I'm so happy to see him.
Go inside.
Make yourselves comfortable.
I'll make you something to eat.
-Go to sleep.
We're leaving.
-l can't.
Not while he's home.
I haven't seen him in so long.
I want to see him.
You go inside.
"This stuff is great, but it's like lead."
"Tell me, where you been?"
I haven't seen you.
You haven't called.
Where have you been?
"Mom, I been working nights."
And tonight we were out late.
We took a ride out to the country and we hit one of them deer.
That's where all the blood is from.
Jimmy told you.
"It reminds me, I need this knife."
I didn't know cats could smile.
(sighing ) Neither did I.
And there's a blue caterpillar.
Blue caterpillar.
Hmm.
Do you think I've gone round the bend?
off your head.
But I'll tell you a secret.NAll the best people are.
(laughing )
Alice.NNothing can harm you there.
Nyou can always wake up.
Like this.
(laughing ) Ow!
(sighing )
Must we go?
Doubt they'll notice if we never arrive.
They will notice.
Where's your corset?
And no stockings.
I'm against them.
But you're not properly dressed.
Who's to say what is proper?
"What if it was agreed that ""proper""Nwas wearing a codfish on your head?"
-Would you wear it?
N-Alice.
a corset is like a codfish.
not today.
Father would have laughed.
I'm sorry. I'm tired.Nl didn't sleep well last night.
Did you have bad dreams again?
Only one.
Never since I can remember.
I want her to be able to learn
- how to solve problems on her own.
- Yeah.
"I thought you guys were, like, super old and gross or whatever, but you're actually, like, really cool aunts and uncle or whatever."
Thanks or whatever.
He dumped me.
- What?
- What?
W-What'd he do that for?
He said I was suffocating him.
I can't believe you guys made me talk to my boyfriend.
You ruined my life!
And mine!
SAMANTHA:
God!
- JEN:
Um...
- JENNA:
Let's get piercings.
Do you understand anything that just happened?
Yeah.
Teenagers are crazy.
"I mean, I think we got it wrong."
"Like, babies are not the hard part."
That is the hard part.
But we'll get through it.
- Yeah. (sighs)
- Mm-hmm.
We just gotta put our thinking caps on.
"Okay, just get the hat, Greg."
"Oh, yeah."
They still got it!
It's just the end of the quarter.
You remember how that was.
But I am earning double time.
There's a bright side.
"So, when the laziest boy in the world wakes up, tell him he better wash those sneakers."
"And I said ""Bye."""
And tell him to let them air dry this time.
I don't want them banging the hell out of my dryer.
What?
"What, you don't even get casual Saturday?"
"No, it's just you..."
You look nice is all.
"It's work, Walt."
Everybody's gonna be there.
Ok.
Maybe we'll order a pizza tonight?
Ok.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Hi.
"You've reached Walt, Skyler, and Walter Junior."
"Please leave a message, and we'll get back to you."
Skyler?
Are you there?
I... don't know what to do.
I need to talk to you.
"Hey, Marie."
It's me.
What's up?
Yesterday I got home and found him.
He didn't even tell me he was coming.
- A man was killed?
"Hi there, Billy, how ya doing?"
Glad to meet you.
I heard a lot about you.
"Oh, here."
"I'll take it, it's my mom's."
Okay.
"Well, uh, how was your trip?"
Fine.
"Uh, did ya sit by the window?"
Yeah.
"Billy, tell Mike what you saw."
"I don't know, a bunch of clouds."
"Billy, come on, you saw the Grand Canyon."
"Hey, hey, you saw the Grand Canyon?"
"We're going to see the Grand Canyon from the ground, up close."
"Really, it's one of the most spectacular sights in the whole world."
So is Central Park.
Are we going to spend our whole vacation here?
"No, I'm with you, come on."
Wait 'til you see the trip I got planned for us.
- You're going to love it.
- I hope so.
"Listen to me, I'm telling you this city has grown a whole lot since you've left here."
"- I can tell, it's amazing."
"- Oh, yeah."
"I sell some lots, you know."
I sold some parcels out here.
I've contributed to its growth.
- Really?
"- Oh, yeah."
"- Big, big lots?"
"- Oh, yeah, oh, huge."

Right.
Very good.

Let's go.
"Let's go, let's go, let's go."
That didn't take long.
Oh.
Thought you were someone else.
Brannis told me one of you would be coming.
One of me?
Would it make a difference if I told you I won't make it easy?
Yeah.
"He told me that, too."
What did you do?
What did you do to my arm?
Aah!
"Well, that works."
Not if you want a massage.
Jarvis:
I imagine that'll be your colleagues.
We must go.
We can't leave him here.
He's a witness.
"Okay, Jenny a-and I, we're looking to have a new nanny."
"Or in Tyler's case, a... a manny."
[Laughs]
- What?
- Yeah.
[Both chuckle]
Stop it.
"You're, like, the worst liar ever."
Who is this guy?
He's Lanie's new boyfriend.
She wanted me to check him out but not to tell you.
"You know what this means, right?"
We... are gonna have some fun at Lanie's expense.
"Hey, Lanie."
I got your text.
And I've got your murder weapon...
"A picture of it, anyway."
I used the autopsies of The Phantom's victims to generate this.
Ryan:
Hmm.
Those serrations near the base are pretty distinctive.
Exactly.
Find the knife...
Find the killer.
Nice work.
"So, how's the background check going?"
"Oh, pretty good so far."
I don't like the sound of that.
"No, t-there's..."
there's nothing to worry about... y-yet.
It's... it's just a rumor.
Let's hear it.
Good luck with that.
Yeah I know.
Well it's not that big a deal.
It's not like Hannah Montana hasn't complicated your life before.
Yeah.
And I dealt with it then and I'll deal with it now.
-Hey there you are.
-Jesse!
"Whoa, whoa, dude!"
You're that guy dating Hannah Montana.
Did you know that?
Yeah I saw it on Leno.
[Laughs] Me too!
Up top bro!
Yeah.
Jesse what are you doing here?
Casual acquaintance and platonic friend.
-Nice.
-Your dad told me you were at the pier.
I just had some great news I had to tell you.
I can't wait aforementioned casual acquaintance and platonic friend.
Overkill.
My dad's coming home from overseas.
My gosh Jesse that's great.
Miley.
Dang it.
Hey it's okay.
I don't think anybody noticed.
One at a time bro.
"Oh, Hannah Montana's new boyfriend, Jesse,"
Apparently caught cheating today.
Ooh!
- We don't know yet.
"I'm so sorry, Nick."
You think you can figure out what this is?
I'm going to do my best.
"First, I have to test the cat's claws, but if I can't get it from the cat,"
I'm going to have to go see Juliette.
"Okay, are you good here for now?"
- Not really.
- Yes.
"Hey, where you going?"
I'm going to find Adalind.
[Cat yowling]
[Cage rattles]
[Cat yowls]
Maybe it just doesn't like me.
Blutbaden and house pets don't really mix.
"Except, you know, as the occasional between-meal treat."
I'm going to start with some valeriana officinalis.

[Cat screeches] All right.
[Suspenseful music]
[Footsteps approach]
"No, no, no."
Don't shoot.
"Hey, come on."
Put it down.
Who were you shooting at?
Adalind!
Adalind!
[Cell phone ringing]
Yeah?
"He was here at my house, Nick."
This is what I'm talking about.
What is up with you?
Nothing.
It's just...
Fresh margs!
This is some weak margarita.
Whatever.
You're the lightweight.
"Oh, ho, ho, say it over here."
Come here.
I hope your parents never come home.
"Seriously, dawg, let's find that punk's trailer park and burn it to the ground."
Who dat?
That freak from Chino.
He was all up in Luke's grill.
Maybe he's on OxyContin.
OxyContin is gnarly.
I heard he's like a total psycho.
He's a little bitch.
"I see that kid around again, I'm going to beat his ass."
"Yeah, run him out of Newport for sure."
I gotta go.
Hey wait up.
Where you going?
I can't be here right now.
What's the matter?
You don't know him.
You don't know anything about him.
He could be anywhere.
"Dad, I'm sure Ryan's fine."
We should just try again when it's light out.
Could be too late by then.
- This is not the time.
- It's the perfect time.
"Truth, Gemma."
- I love you.
"- Oh, shit, Chris."
Give me another chance.
You know you want to.
No!
Sorry.
"Serious buzzkill, Chris."
"- I say the moment's passed, mate."
- Yeah.
I choose truth.
- Felix isn't in Chile.
- So... where is he?
"Well, what happened was that he hung himself."
What?
He hung himself.
"Right here, from that crossbeam there."
"- Is this a joke, mate?"
"- No joke, mate."
It's what happened.
I'm in Afghanistan stewing in sweat and fear and blood.
"And when I get home, my kid brother's found swinging from the rafters."
The groundsman cut him down.
True story.
But this is terrible.
"It's been hushed up, naturally, 16 generations of French Catholics."
"Suicide's about as shameful as it gets, not to menton a faggot cop-out."
So why are we here?
I need to get the bottom of it.

"To celebrate our 25th episode, we've turned over control of the show to Rutledge."
I've got Wood.
"So far, he almost killed himself."
Whoa!
Whoa!
[Bleep]
And now he had me working the streets of San Francisco for tips.
Andrew?
I had $40 to Rut's $20.
Pow!
Yeah!
And we had our last passengers of the night.
I want to know more about this boy that you say you like.
I'm not sure about this.
He was really nice.
- I don't know.
- He was nice.
I thought he was nice.
Really?
You don't like him 'cause he's chubby and nerdy.
No.
That's not true.
Number...
"I mean, how hard is that?"
"I mean, a talking monkey could do her job."
It's embarrassing.
"Actually, that's 16."
"See, you're holding it upside-down."
"Oh, it's..."
It's confusing.
There's usually a little line under the nine.
It goes under the six.
The line goes under the six.
I'm pretty sure it's the nine.
It's no big deal.
"Look, I've seen it my whole life."
I've never seen it under the six.
"Why don't we ask Natalie, then?"
"Well, she's the expert."
Okay.
Okay.
But I see your point.
About the monkey.
All I'm trying to say is it's not the same Natalie.
"If you knew her, you wouldn't know her."
"Last night, after the show, she got somebody fired."
Really?
One of the crew.
Sound guy.
There were some wires on the floor.
She was...
"You know, complaining."
"And, I mean, I met the guy when I was there."
He was a nice kid.
-You're not trained.
-Since when?
I meant you're not trained to work as part of this team.
There will be other missions.
When you're ready.
"But for now, stay put."
-Glad you didn't bring you-know-who?
-Indeed.
Ugh.
When we're ready?
How are we ever supposed to be ready when they treat us like--
Like sidekicks.
My mentor.
My king.
I thought he trusted me.
Trust?
They don't even trust us with the basics.
They've got a secret H.Q. in space.
What else aren't they telling us?
I have a better question.
Why didn't we leave with Speedy?
What is Project Cadmus?
Don't know.
But I can find out.
COMPUTER:
Access denied.
-Heh.
Wanna bet?
Whoa.
How are you doing that?
Same system as the Batcave.
COMPUTER:
The funeral's over?
"Well, yeah, it happened."
We're getting married.
I told you you look good together.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
Now that Nana quit and Yoon-sung's gone...
The Blue House is so boring.
You said all you needed was me to be happy and...
This is why one shouldn't propose too soon.
Take it.
"Mine, too."
Da-hye.
It's OK if you're too busy to come to the wedding.
I'll text you my account number.
I wish you health and happiness.
Choi Eung-chan.
"Be happy, Eun-ah."
"Ma am, how about... we open a restaurant in the States?"
We can name it Delicious Korean.
What did the ex-president say?
"He's sorry, grateful, and he wished me happiness."
You know...
I was a chef on a ship once.
I love Korean food.
It's amazing.
The Americans need to taste my food.
I'll be famous.

I'd meet the children of the woman I portrayed...
Do you know where he is?
Maurice?
Why?
Do you want to tell him that Jonah's dead?
It'd kill him.
If he's still alive he's probably in Marseille.
The last time I saw him was in Marseille years ago.
"In a restaurant, of course."
"I actually remember the restaurant. ""Beirut""."
"Lebanese food, nice restaurant."
But that was long ago.
Do you have a picture of him?
"No, I threw it away."
Or tore it up.
You know how a broken heart is.
You do all sorts of things that you regret later-.
Be a little like me.
How?
I don't even know who you are.
Just tell Ricky the truth.
"Get rid of the cigarette, there's no smoking here-."

Let's do that again.
- No!
"Well, it's going to better use there."
What use?
Do you know what they're using that money for?
"They're feeding refugees, building houses."
You guys don't help anyone!
We help you.
"W-we help you, and we helped you save that money."
Please do not roll your eyes at me.
You can show me some respect.
"Paige, you started lying to us..."
I didn't lie.
"Well, you certainly don't seem to know the difference."
Do you?
- You lie to us.
You lie.
- Dad!
Stop!
- What are you doing?

- You go behind our backs.

What happened last night...
That's your friend from school.
Uh-huh.
"So, you're wearing a Mayhem shirt."
I am.
Yeah.
"Isn't the singer, like, a cannibal?"
"'Cause you're in, like, a Christian power metal band."
Seems kind of weird.
I don't know.
"No, actually that was just a rumor."
But he didn't actually eat anyone.
And Crucifictorious is actually...
It's not power metal.
"We're more of extreme grindcore with like, heavy thrash influences."
Like what thrash bands do you like?
Like Napalm Death?
Like the Keep?
Like Cannibal Corpse?
"Carcass, I mean, I really only have two sections for vinyl."
"Like metal, non-metal."
So...
Right.
"Well, mainly..."
You all ready to order?
Yeah.
I want the sizzling apple pie.
And I think also chips and...
"Oh, my..."
That's pathetic.
I'm back at the start.
What's up?
Um...
You have to get me out of here!
I can not go back.
I know.
We're going to America.
Thank you.
I love you.
We've got to track Zana.
-Sensato.
We will continue with the broad options.
Something will take us forward.
VG
-Tangen is out there.
-Falou With him?
"I told all I know, but it is not great."
He gave me a double and Coca-Cola sandwich.
Yes?
I am here.
I will not let it go.
But it is so serious that I will tell you first.
We have tips from a cocaine package by which Christer was responsible.
Right?
-you Do not know?
This is an interview or a complaint?
I can know about the whereabouts of this package.
Yes?
Camilla Bjerke?
We will take you in for questioning and searching his apartment.
Why is that?
-how Come?
-Recebemos A complaint.
-A Complaint?
About what?
"It's delicious, but I don't..."
Ataste.
Sausage?
A little dessert?
"Mom, some dessert forthe Director."
- I'm really fine as is.
- Taste it.
"It's good, a kind of chocolate."
"Kind of, it's called blood pudding."
It's chocolate with pig's blood.
- You have to eat it.
- I got that.
"Yourmother's right, it's not so hot here."
"They told me it was very hot here, but..."
"camels used to bring the mail, the directorwas a Bedouin."
- Are you making fun of me?
- No...
- Mattia!
- How's it goin'?
This guy?
Looks like the michelin man.
He's joking.
"He's the new director, from milan."
- I get it.
- What?
He always gets things late.
- Buy you a coffee?
"- No, I have to work."
"Wait, Iet me introduce two stalwart co-workers."
"little CostabiIe, one of our greatest employees."
- welcome to the famous CasteIIabate.
- Wait!
Was he on his way to tell me that he loved me?
What should I do if he wasn't?
"Gil Da Ran,"
I love you.
He was probably going to say it like that to you.
Alright then.
Is that so?
"It would be so, right?"
"If it's like that, I worried uselessly."
Like a fool!
"Yeah, yeah."
Like a fool.
Let's pack up your clothes!
This color suits Yoon Jae very well.
This color is good too!
This one matches well too.
"Here, go pack it up."
I'll go get a bag.
Does she like Seo Yoon Jae that much?
"Aish, what's this?"
Are these the keys for this house?
No.
Is it the contracted room for us after we get married?
What should we do?
"Wait a moment, and go answer the phone naturally."
What?
Hello?
"Oh, Yoon Jae."
- It's Se Young.
- So you were home?
- The doctor friend that you saw at the hospital.
I was so worried because you didn't answer your phone.
"You know, just go help Dr. Kovac with the rapid infuser, all right?"
No problem.
What do you need?
"Central line, supraumbilical DPL, rapid infuser and a t-pod."
What's a t-pod?
"Fine, I'll get it... again."
- What do you want me to do first?
- Find the O-neg.
Everything okay in there?
For the time being.
Call for four units of type specific.
Soon as I get this up.
Hypotensive pelvic fracture.
He needs the works.
Those are his kids out there.
"Hey, Frank, can you bring those guys to the Family Room?"
Sure.
"Come on, kids."
This way.
- I'll be right in.
- Great.
- Guide wire?
- I'm getting an error signal.
There's not enough water in the warmer.
- Thanks.
- Cordis inducer.
Stitch.
Where's Dori with the T-pod?
T-pods are on the bottom shelf.
Update his vitals?
"- Okay, infuser's on."
- Looks good.
- To New Yorkers.
They don't live here.
"I'm all f or love, son."
"Come on, hero."
And that's an order.
Washington hasn't released a story.
What gives?
Drake's the story. I'm not.
You see Johnny here-
- Johnny?
Sergeant Drake!
Johnny!
I didn't like that salute.
There was something final about it.
I got it alright why Johnny had taken a powder.
He'd faked a birth certificate to enlist.
"John Joseph Preston, eh?"
The Yale pin said so.
All I needed was a telephone.
"Sorry, gorgeous. I'd let you have it, only it's long distance."
Yale University.
"Hello, Yale?"
Give me your top man there.
What college?
"Yale, of course."
"Okay, so it's a university."
How would I know?
I just own taxis.
"Yeah, one of my men f ound a pin with a name on it, class of 1940."
I want his address so I can return it to him.
"Thanks, lovely."
"General, if you won't authorize me to go after him I'm af raid i'll have to go anyway."
I am two people.
One was born when I met you.
The other one began in a downtown L.A. tattoo parlor.

SANTANA:
"My father, Pedro, was showing his love for my mother, Esperanza."
Por Vida.
For life.
my mother was a beautiful woman.
"They were pachucos, zoot-suiters, and proud of it."
In June of 1 943 America was at war.
"Not only overseas, but with itself."
The racial tension was running high against anyone that was different.
Excuse me!
WOMAN:
Esperanza!

"For me, esa, put together with a lot of love!"
"Yeah, esa."

Let's bring our boys home to fight those zoot-suited dandies that are making it unsafe to walk our streets today.
"- Hey, come back!"
- Prostitute to get rid of this thief!
"- Stop, Give me that wallet!"
- Give the man his wallet!
"- He worked hard for the money, g.t guy!"
"- You worked hard, right?"
- Hold on there.
Do not fucking move!
- Fuck man!
Hello?
What's going on there?
- Want to play?
- Listen.
As for the last case?
"Laboratory, was caught in a match."
"- Mason, have checked the records."
You were right about the delivery.
- Where do I said that?
"- Yes, the better."
I received a delivery address in person.
1132 Orchard Glen Park Road.
- John ...
- Flee!
Jesus Christ man!
We take a look at dirt.
What are you doing?
"Yes, I hazırlıyorsun papers."
I love the computer.
"A real angel of death, believe me."
"Yes, I'd be more optimistic than we used to."
"Okay, Pete."
"All gone, tell him."
- Well ...
It's because of the surgery.
Do you think?
Yes.
I don't know.
How would you feel if you had undergone such an operation?
I don't know.
She is not like our mother.
Play it again.
Loads of kisses from me.
I can't wait to be back.
Pull up your blankets and close your eyes.
"Can you count the stars, shining in the night sky?"
"Can you count the clouds, hovering over the fields?"
Oh Lord watch over them with eyes that never doze.
He sees you and loves you.
He sees you and loves you.
Goodnight.
Get mom.
Mom?
Lukas?
Lukas?
- Hello?
"- Hi, good morning."
That was a huge order.
So many at the same time.
- Throwing a party?
- No.
Who are all those pizzas for?
"Pepperoni, Pepperoni?"
Is that your favorite?
Pepperoni pizza.
"""and let us say amen."""
- Amen.
"""May He who makes peace in His Heaven make peace upon us and upon all Israel,"
"""and let us say amen."""
- Amen.
"Thanks, honey."
Not a word to Raziya.
"Okay, honey."
"If you ask me, Mom was a spy."
"She grew up in Algeria, right?"
- And she visited Aunt Rosa in Paris once a year?
- Yeah.
She met an Algerian spy there who she knew from childhood and brought the secrets to Dad.
Do the math.
Dad was in Intelligence.
- He was a cook in Intelligence.
- That was his cover story.
So the Algerian spy got her pregnant?
- Maybe he was an Arab.
- God forbid.
Maybe she was the spy.
Or a murderer.
Ever see her kitchen cleaver?
- I know.
She was a Nazi hunter.
- What?
Then why did she take us on a heritage tour of Oschwitz?
Since when did she have family in Oschwitz?
It was an educational tour.
We're Jews.
"Unless your father is a little Arab spy,"
- which makes you...
- No problem.
Good luck.
Can't push the chair.
- Hey.
LAURA:
"Hey, Johnny."
KELLY:
How was the ski trip?
LAURA:
"Oh, yeah, it was fun."
- You knock them dead?
- I never got you out there.
That was always a big regret for me too.
- Does Greg Medavoy seem off his game?
- Why?
He seems a little depressed.
"- Yeah, he's got a domestic situation."
"- Oh, yeah?"
Do you want to go out for dinner?
"- Sure, what's the occasion?"
- No occasion.
"- Okay, your call."
- Tonight?
- Fine.
- I'll talk to you later.
See you later.
Martinez will be with you at arraignment.
We think you'll get a recognizance release.
He'll see you home.
It's better if you carry me down.
"Yeah, the chair nearly went over coming up."
Let's pick him up.
"All right, now."
"Here, we're gonna start weight training."
First things first...
Squats.
Okay.
That's it.
"Uh, that looks really heavy."
Look.
This is not gonna be a half-assed workout.
We gotta really get into it.
It's gonna hurt.
"- Yeah, but I can't lift that."
- Just position yourself under the bar and listen to me.
Here's what you're gonna do.
You're gonna take all the weight on your neck.
Then you're gonna jam your legs down and hyperextend your ankles... and then shoot back up and lock your knees in place.
Not one of those things sounds right to me at all.
Look.
You wanna fight like a man?
You gotta train like a man.
"Now, come on."
Gimme a squat.
- Ready.
Go!
"- Oh, my God!"
- Go.
Keep it up.
"- Daddy, I can't."
- It's...
I can't.
- Keep it up.
Keep it up.
"Doctor Gilbert Venin, I presume?"
"Shit Livingstone, asshole?"
Your finger's on the pulse.
Mickey the Arab wants a word with you.
I'm very expensive.
"- Playing for keeps, or you got the creeps?"
- Don't you worry.
We're in a pest controlled area.
What's on Mickey's agenda?
Disneyland!
- That's gonna be tough.
"- No, a straight split."
"Tomorrow, midnight, where you want, ladies as witnesses, face to face, all holds barred."
It's high time.
"You shit flies, keep buzzing around Mickey."
"If he ever comes out of the Casbah, he'll regret his mad wanking."
"He's not mad, he's here!"
Skedaddle!
Oh my!
Oh my!
Your what?
Do you have an aspirin?
Your lovely brothers.
"Simon and Edgar, for instance."
out of your league.
Forget it.
Edgar. 5 am.
Blow deal.
Rue Lenine.
In Charenteuil.
That's our turf.
Sure you've got no aspirin?
Some of the kids at school told the police...
-...that you and Taylor didn't get along.
-Yeah.
But I never wanted to kill her.
Never.
Do you believe me?
"Yeah, I do."
[SIGHS]
A couple more questions.
"On the day this happened, did you happen to smell anything?"
"Anything, like what?"
Like rotten eggs or sulfur?
No.
"Okay, um...."
Did you notice any black smoke?
"What, are you crazy?"
[SIGHS]
[SIGHS]
So?
I think she's telling the truth.
The way she talked about being there mentally but not physically.
Kind of sounds like demonic possession to me.
-Kind of?
-She didn't see any black smoke.
Or smell sulfur.
Maybe she's not a demon.
Kids can be vicious.
"Well, I mean, we're already here, might as well check out the school."
Right.
The school.
-What?
"-Truman High, home of the Bombers."
No!
Not again.
Get...
Go back!
Frank.
Frank.
"Oh, my God, I just had the worst dream."
You were having another kid.
"Maureen's the last one, right?"
Tell me she's the last one!
She's the last one.
"Oh, thank God."
It was horrible.
This baby had teeth!
What are you doing?
I'm trying to figure out which bill we can pay.
"Well, we got about eight inches of free water falling right now."
"So, heat it is."
"Frank, we'll get through this."
We always do.
I'm here for you.
The kids love you.
Mohican will realize their mistake and take you back.
"And if they don't, you'll get a better job somewhere else."
"Yeah, sure."
I'm gonna go downstairs.
"Oh, Sue, don't do that."
I haven't showered in days.
"I meant the kitchen, Frank."
Get some sleep.
Tomorrow will be a better day.
Only if I get hit by a bus.
I know the risk but I have to know her.
Elena.
She's a dead ringer for Katherine.
"- Anna, your face."
- It's nothing.
It didn't look like nothing.
- Matty tells me you broke his heart.
- Mom.
He found his rebound girl.
There's a tomb under the church.
You saved everyone in the church?
"Twenty-seven vampires, Damon."
You can't just bring them back.
It's Harper.
I'm glad you found us.
"Annabelle, close the door, please."
"Hey, Bethanne."
What are you guys watching?
You've been watching the same thing the whole time?
There are over 150 channels.
It's called a remote control.
This button changes the channel.
Hold it like this.
- Mm.
"Did you get enough, sweetheart?"
- For now.
"Anna, are you hungry?"
Did you want a little?
"No, thank you, Miss Gibbons."
Why don't you lay down and get some rest?
She's fine.
"Aren't you, Miss Gibbons?"
A medical friend?
-Why it interests so much to you?
-Or a medical friend?
And if outside thus?
"So that by your part, we have finished."
You were wanted who it.
"In agreement, but I can run?"
no?
-Until the shutdown of the street car.
-In agreement.
"It starts, damn it."
-It does not start?
"-No, it does not start."
First you invite to me and soon it does not start.
You had to fail to me indeed now?
Eh!
taken care of!
-I do not touch myself.
"We go, Lella, only a little."
-No.
For here.
-Let go of the hair. let it go!
- You will never change.
"We go, only I have requested you a little kiss."
-You kiss with the hands.
"-But, only with one."
What do you want?
-To where you go?
They see here.
We speak.
It vetoes the devil.
You have what you deserve.
She can't be.
She never goes out.
KNOCKING
Hiya!
How are you?
"Yeah, good."
"It's Melissa, isn't it?"
Yeah.
I'm Peggy.
This is Elaine.
I know.
OK if we come in for a sec?
"Yeah, sure."
You have the most incredible skin!
Have people told you that before?
Not really.
So pretty it glows.
Let's open that other bottle.
Where do you keep the corkscrew?
The drawer nearest the fridge.
"(If you don't want to do it, just say no.)"
CORK POPS
"Did I mention, this woman is a genius with a lens?"
PEGGY CHUCKLES
"She will make you look better than you have ever looked,"
I guarantee it.
"And if she can't, hell, everything we do is airbrushed, anyway."
I don't think...
I don't really...
We have a deadline.
And there's literally no-one else we can ask.
As a neighbour?
I like pain of every kind.
Needles through my nipples.
Needles in my back.
I've had two needle corsets.
"Blows of all kinds, with marks, without marks."
Slaps.
"Verbal humiliation, being scolded."
That sort of thing.
I can free my mind.
totally let go.
And simply enjoy.
Simply be myself.
It's wonderful.
I need it.
Bend over it.
Spread your feet.
As wide as you can.
Nice.
- Do you like whips?
"- Yes, Master Walter."
Count out loud.
- One.
- Good.
Two.
Three.
I met my first husband when I'd just turned 15.
We were together 7 years before we married.
For me the marriage was like a death sentence.
In quotations.
He thought I was his property.
That's how he treated me.
He beat me when he was drunk.
"Yeah, actually, Gibbs..."
No.
That's it.
Thanks.
We should have told Gibbs.
Later.
"Come on, McGee, answer."
Aren't you gonna get that?
Yes?
Don't tell Gibbs it's me.
Okay.
Yes?
The air marshal I mentioned before--
I need you to dig up anything you can on him.
Name is Mike Beers.
"Well, that could take a while."
TSA personnel files are always tightly wrapped.
What's this about?
Bishop knows the guy from somewhere.
She's trying to figure out why.
"Soon as you can, McGee."
Yeah.
Don't look at me.
Just do it.
Is everything okay?
What took so long?
"The air marshal, where'd he go?"
"He's, um... the charging station."
"What was that about, Tony?"
Nothing I'm gonna tell Gibbs until we're sure about this guy.
Sure about what?
"Well, that joke I told back there."
You'll be just like your dad.
"Shut up, shut up, shut up."
"- That's what really scares you, isn't it?"
- Stop it.
- Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up!
- You're going the same place he did.
Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up!
- You're going nowhere.
- Shut up!
Shut up.
Youshouldhavecalledmum.
She's all that's left.
- You abandoned her.
"- No, no, no, no!"
Get out of my head!
You'll never see her again.
You'll never speak to her again.
- Never see her face.
- Get out of my fucking head!
Get out of my fucking head!
Get out of my fucking head!
You're a bad son.
You'll never see your mother again.
You're going nowhere.
Straight into oblivion.
You deserve it.
You should have called her.
Get out of my fucking head!
- Yes.
- Listen.
- Yes.
See that boy sitting there.
Yes Big Boss.
- Give one to him too.
- Yes.
I don't have money.
I didn't ask for it.
I'm as old as your father.
Take it as my blessings.
Here.
Take it son.
Hey boy.
Won't you thank the Big Boss?
Offering water to the thirsty is a good deed.
And you've earned a merit because of me.
So should I be thanking him or will he thank me?
I must admit.
He's no ordinary boy.
Because he talks about common sense.
I forgot Lallan.
Even a bag of rice has pebbles.
And you Dushyant.
Why don't you setup a cracker-shop?
Maybe you'll do good business?
You made a big mistake... taking up enmity with Dushyant.
No guns.
I'll hack you to pieces with this axe...
And all of North India... won't be able to put you back.
Hey boy let's go.
Stop.
"I know with our history, you'll think I made this up--"
"Andy, what?"
"Now, an incident has occurred at my apartment. lt's not fit for visitors."
-l don't believe this.
-You wanna know what happened?
-No.
"-Hey, John, good morning."
"I've heard about fungus in the fish tank, dangerous tiles--"
You want to know what happened?
Yes or no?
What happened?
"Well, I have a very bad gas leak."
"Now, I called the gas people."
There is no way I'm gonna feel comfortable exposing you to danger.
-We're back to square one?
-We are definitely not at square one.
I want you to come to my place.
I told you. I turned that corner.
I'm looking forward to it. I'm a changed man. I have a dangerous leak.
"That's all we're talking about here, now."
"You want some advice, Andy?"
Get it fixed.
WOMAN:
Mike?
Roberts?
-Mike Roberts around?
I gotta see Mike.
DONNA:
He's not here.
Mike?
"-Hey, Roberts."
-Excuse me.
"Yo, how long you two been married?"
Come on.
Play ball.
"Okay, all right, time-out."
Time-out.
My time.
"You, uh, never played basketball, have you?"
"No, I've played once or twice."
Yeah?
"Yeah, I mean, I can see that."
"It looked like I was watching Lebron, and maybe he's just this much better."
You know what?
"Football was my sport, okay?"
Yeah?
Now you tell me that?
"Hey, you ready to quit?"
- No.
- Yes.
- Which one is it?
"Can you just give me a second, please?"
Can I have some space?
"All right, listen to me."
"You're not gonna outshoot him, so out-D him, all right?"
Play it like it's football.
"Put a body on him, steal the ball away from him and put it in the hoop, huh?"
"What's he gonna do, call a foul?"
We're in jail.
"All right, I can do that."
That's game.
"Let's have it, man."
"All right, badge, here it is."
A couple weeks ago we're in rec watching some tube.
"Whose bag is that next to Mom's, and whose hat is that?"
It's a man's hat.
- Maybe Morn bought it for Dad.
"- Yeah, right."
"Anyway, this is what we have so far."
1.
The picture. 2.
Dates of Mom's trips.
3.
Algeria - black hole.
"And, oi course, Aunt Rosa."
She's obviously hiding something.
The conclusion is:
We have a father and we need to find him.
And the conclusion is:
"There are pills, Shai, and you need to take them."
"""Have a father must find him!"""
"Maybe you're right, maybe I'm nuts, but I can't sleep at night and you can't either."
Don't pretend.
"What are you getting at, Shai?"
"Tickets to Paris, voucher for a hotel on the Champs Elysees, inflatable pillow for the flight."
Maps.
Even new swimsuits.
The hotel has a pool.
You are nuts.
He's nuts.
We fly a week before Passover.
- I can't.
"- You're on vacation from school and Dorona, you're free now anyway."
- But...
- I spoke to Raziya.
You told Haziya?
Hadn't you better catch him up?
You don't want him taking the hump again.
"Oh, lord, he could be anywhere."
I'll see you at Popmobility.
Thanks for everything!
Bye!
Bye.
"You'll have to take the lift, love."
"Oh, flip."
It's all right.
You don't have to fling me into the gutter by the seat of my trousers.
It's not the Beano.
"Quick as you can, boys."
Up over there!
Who is it?
Sir!
"It's Jimmy Baker, he's up on that ledge."
Everyone shush!
"He's too late, though, isn't he, sir?"
"Because he didn't come on the tram, sir."
"Climb over, jump down, I'll catch you!"
Look lively.
Is everything all right over there?
Get in your place!
"Yes, thank you, Sir Hamilton."
Baker was just helping me up.
"Lost a leg, sniper, Vimy Ridge."
Good man.
I was Naval Reserve.
North Sea.
Lot to be grateful for.
You said Baker hadn't turned up.
-I didn't say a thing.
What you can be sure is I'm not telling you the whole truth.
Tell me about Daniel.
-Daniel?
Yes.
Don't think I've forgot.
I told you he's 18 and he's studying economics.
I know that already.
What else?
Don't think I know much more.
Then when you meet...
He says:
"""I'm 18 and I'm studying economics."""
He doesn't have that voice!
And you answer him:
"""That's nice!"
"I like you."""
You're so foolish.
You guys must talk about something.
-Yes.
"A lot of things, sure."
Can't you tell me anything?
I wouldn't know how to repeat them.
Right.
I'm your father and we can't talk in the same way.
No.
We can talk the same but no.
It's not the same.
It's different.
I can't figure this out...
What?
Nothing.
What's wrong with you?
"Man, where the gefilte fish at?"
It's in the fridge.
That shit's perishable once it's open.
"They ain't in the fridge, man."
"Hold on, man, I know I put that shit in the fridge 'cause don't nobody want no hot-ass gefilte fish."
"Just like I said, right behind the peanut butter."
"Ain't no peanut butter in here, man, just yogurt."
"- Where the fuck are you, Ricky?"
"- Where you think I am, man?"
"I'm in the motherfucking kitchen, bro."
I'm in the kitchen.
I don't see your ass.
"Hey, man."
"Oh, God!"
"Yo, TTD, call the cops."
There's a weird white kid in our house.
"What house are you in, Rick?"
- Ricky?
- Uh...
- Ricky?
"- Oh, shit."
- Ricky.
- Boy:
"I know who you are, asshole."
- You're not gonna get away with this.
"- TTD, call Spencer."
( car alarm chirps )
"Wayne, Wayne!"
( panting ) Wayne!
"Well, look what the breeze finally blew in."
"Better late than never, though, right?"
It was just a question of time.
"Shall we go, son?"
Now?
You wouldn't want to worry Mama.
"No, I wouldn't."
Take good care of him.
"Oh, he'll be taken care of."
I don't want to go.
"Why, Wilbur?"
"Yes, tell her why."
"Well, because, you see, I'm not really a little..."
I like it here.
I want to go to school here.
This is a girls' school.
That's why I like it here.
"Now, Wilbur, you mustn't hurt your father's feelings."
"You wouldn't do that, would you, Wilbur?"
No.
You know how sensitive I am.
He's very sensitive.
"You're choking him, Mr. Hoolick."
Oh.
(COUGHS)
"Come along, son."
You don't have much time.
"It's been nice meeting you, Mr. Hoolick."
"It's been very nice meeting you, Mrs. Brendan."
"Goodbye, Wilbur."
"Don't say that, Mrs. Brendan!"
"All right, you."
Where is it?
Why did you tell Mrs. Brendan you're my father?
- It's at Jay-Mo's Diner.
- [Siren wailing]
[Coughing]
[Siren continues wailing]
[Grunting]
[Tires screeching]
[Coughing]
[Tires screeching]
- Backup's on the way.
- There isn't time.
"All units, 565 East Jefferson."
"I repeat, all units, 565 East Jefferson."
This is Lieutenant Al Garner requesting available fire and EMS units.
We got a man inside.
Requesting additional alarms.
"- Repeat, all units, 565 East Jefferson."
- [Coughing]
[Man] BP's 84 over 36.
[Garner] The owner's car was stolen.
I need to ask him some questions.
- He's in and out of consciousness.
- [Labored breathing]
I'm with the FBI.
Can you give me a thumbs-up for yes and a thumbs-down for no?
Did Kaman Scott do this to you?
We have 15 minutes to get him to the hospital.
Do you know this girl?
Tracy.
Tracy.
Don't let him...
- Please stop him.
- Is Tracy nearby?
My Barefoot Cinderella.
Don't need no slippers or a party dress.
The way you're looking right now is what I like the best.
And then you'll say do you wanna take a chance.
And stay with me forever.
No one'll ever be more beautiful.
"My barefoot, barefoot Cinderella."
[Audience cheering]
[Music stops]
You rocked.
Not hard when I'm with you.
"Hey, hey, hey."
I'm Hannah.
Hannah Montana ladies and gentlemen.
And apparently her new boyfriend.
Why is it always the guitar player?
Why not a nice cameraman like my nephew Lenny?
"But seriously, I'm happy for you Hannah."
And what's your name?
"Ah, you don't wanna know my name."
Come on.
You kissed her on national TV.
What are you shy all of a sudden?
Come on what's your name?
-Jesse.
-Jesse!
There you have it.
Hannah and Jesse America's new sweethearts.
Good night everybody.
"Bye, bye."
Thanks for watching.
Bye.

Second one's almost there.
- Cool.
- And this device I invented... will monitor the vibrations of the audience.
- That's great.
- Just keep the music coming... from the baddest jazz trio in D.C.!
And I got some women lined up for you.
"Michael, I told you."
I don't want to meet anybody.
"Come on, Jeff."
You got to get over Stacy.
It's been four months since you broke up.
"You got to move on, experience life."
- You're right.
"- Anyway, first show..."
Debra's bringing her cousin Denise.
"She's kind of fat, but she's got a cute face."
"Cool, cool."
"Second, Anita's bringing her girl."
Says she's a ten.
- A ten?
- Uh-huh.
"Without a weave, she's a six."
That's cool.
I got to go.
Warden.
Just appease her.
"With this baby here, you won't be here much longer."
"Move over, Wynton Marsalis."
Cool.
"Aren't you going to say excuse me, Dre?"
Excuse me.
"Thanks again for calling, Mr. Reed."
Not when he's your dad and he acts like your diary is part of the collective unconscious.
Wait.
"Sorry, I keep thinking about people sitting on this couch talking about being sexually abused."
That's what makes it fun.
You're a good kisser.
Am I a manly kisser?
Do you want to go to my prom with me?
N.Y.U. has proms?
Shit.
I'm drunk.
I should be honest with you.
I don't go to N.Y.U.
- Where do you go?
Hunter?
- St. Anne's.
The high school?
How old are you?
- Old enough.
- Wait wait.
"You want me to go to your senior prom, right?"
You're 18?
"- No, junior prom."
- You're 17?
- 16.
- 16 years old?
But I'll be 17 in two weeks.
You're 16?
"Oh my God, oh my God."
Don't freak out.
I haven't been a virgin for almost a year.
I probably know more about sex than you do.
"I know plenty about sex, okay?"
(BAYARD sniffing )

"Reason is the Salty Treat blew out an amp the other day, rockin' out pretty hard to some Lifehouse covers, which will happen."
"So, I'm pickin' up the slack."
I'm happy to do it.
Way she goes.
I'm Lisa.
Are you ever.
Look at you!
It's America's little sweetheart over here.
You're like a little Katy Heigl or like a little Katy Hudson.
What can I get ya?
Do you have cookies and cream?
Do I...
Do I have cookies and cream?
I sure do have cookies and cream.
(SIGHS) And I'm thinkin' maybe a vanilla-fudge swirl chunk for Mr. Newman over here?
"- That'll do, thank you."
- Okay.
And you're gonna keep an eye on little Caty Blanchett here
- for me till I get back?
- Sure will.
Thank you!
Be right back!
"- So, you're a farmer, Wayne?"
- Can confirm.
You don't smell like one.
(CHUCKLES) I'm kidding.
I'm a pre-school principal.
Do you like kids?
- Hmm...
"- I know, everyone likes kids."
They're so silly.
"65,000 children."
That's more than are born in Denmark in a year.
Think of what that money could do.
You could really do something.
- What do you get out of this?
- Nothing.
I keep my good life.
I buy remission for my sins.
And we're almost family.
- Why are you doing this?
- I'm assuming you're interested.
"Yes, damn it."
Of course I'm interested.
"Jacob, stay here."
You'll get to know Anna better.
You could take out Helene for dinner.
I'm going to to Sweden with the twins.
We're going fishing.
"You're a strange man, Jorgen."
She has to eat.
She's a terrible cook.
"- Take care of yourselves, okay?"
"- We will, mother."
- Don't lose too much online.
- I won 235 dollars last night.
Congratulations.
Try and hang on to them.
- Mom did it up wrong.
- We can't have that.
There.
Hop inside.
Thanks.
Thank you.
Impossible!
The enemy?
Hi!
You've got some nerve!
Isn't that the warning alarm?
Shut up!
You horny robot!
Let's hurry.
"Yes, but this may be a false alarm..."
"See you later, Romlin."
"But, I would like to continue..."
Is everything okay?
"Yes, all hands are preparing for battle."
What's going on?
Nobody's attacking us...
"Right, Manami?"
I doubt they've retreated.
Here it comes.
Are you really going?
Disengage Dimension Code Protection.
Manami!
"Condition level, rapidly deteriorating."
How's the pilot?
"Flail, do you read?"
Flail!
It's no good.
There's no response.
It has incredibly fast reaction time.
Who is this enemy?
I'll leave the rest to you.
Keep calling out to her.
Who is it?
It's Gargan.
Long distance.
- Huh?
- Gargan.
- At this hour?
- Yeah.
"Hello, Mr. Gargan."
"Oh, listen, Thompson, I'm gonna be out of the state for a week or 10 days."
"Oh, well, I'm sorry to hear that, Mr. Gargan."
We'll miss you.
Yeah.
I can imagine.
"But listen, I gotta make a business trip."
"When I come back, I'm gonna have a conference with the governor."
- You get me?
"- Sure, I understand, Mr. Gargan."
"I don't know how long it's gonna take me but meanwhile, I want you to get this straight."
I want everything run just exactly as I left it.
No changes.
"If there's any argument, whatever Miss Griffith decides, goes."
You understand?
- Is she around there now?
- No.
"I think she's in her cottage, Mr. Gargan, I could get her for you if--"
"No, no, that's all right."
Never mind.
Just tell her I called.
"Yeah, so long."
"And remember, no changes."
"All right, Mr. Gargan."
"Yeah, I understand."
"Take it, son."

You go to their home yourself and tell his mother.
"- Zaer, I do have to play kettledrum_"
- God willing.
What do you mean by God Willing?
Yes or no?
God willing means god willing.
"No Zaer,"
- It's not my answer.
- Definitely yes or definitely not.
"- I said ""God willing""."
"- I said ""definite answer""."
"You are repeatedly saying ""definitely""."
"If you want a definite answer, its been ""No""_"
"So why would you say ""God willing""?"
"Just say no, at first_"
- Just No. now I am relieved?
- No.
"Come on, take it."
Shush
"Thank you so much, sorry to disturb you."
- Goodbye.
This was a dream come true.
I'd landed a custom '66 Mustang.
There you go.
All right.
Thank you.
[ Engine turns over ] There you go.
I knew I had to go easy on her if I wanted a good tip.
But I had to take a shot.
How drunk are you?
[ Laughs ]
"Had a few, I'd say, at least."
[ Engine revs ]
"Oh, I will have you home in no time, my friend."
Done.
[ Laughs ]
"I don't want you to baby this thing, all right?"
You have nothing to worry about.
Seriously.
[ Both laugh ]
"Oh, that's sweet."
This was great.
"If I could just keep him happy and not wreck his car, a healthy tip would be in my future."
Don't baby that clutch.
Come on.
Give it a little gas.
[ Engine revs ]
[ Tires screech ]
Perfect.
[ Laughs ]
There's no way Rutledge was having this much fun.
You're the best driver that I have had yet.
Wood:
This was an inside job.
"So I'm gonna get to see you sometime this week,aren't I?"
I don't know.
[giggling]
I guess that's a yes?
[laughs]
Get your hands up.
Don't--don't shoot us!
Give me the bag!
Now!
"Okay, okay."
Give it to him.
Give it to him!
The purse.
Give it to me.
He's gone.
It's okay.
It's okay.
(Leo) The receptionist's alibi checks out.
She was outta here by 10:45 last night.
Same with Marla's assistant.
Her roommate said that she was home all night.
That leaves only two people.
Marla and Gus.
Can you think of any reason that an artist would want to steal his own art?
Publicity.
There are more reasons for a gallery owner to do it.
Insurance.
Selling the work without having to give Gus a cut.
Maybe you should talk to Ms. Saffer some more.
You can't actually believe I took Gus's work.
What would you believe if you were me?
For coming.
"Honey, we discussed this."
Just come tomorrow and help with lunch.
I keep my nose out of Dorona's business.
I'm afraid she'll hit me.
It's time to go.
"Come on, honey."
I'll drive you home and come back.
I don't want to leave them alone-They'll fall apart on me-.
"It's ok, I'll close the door."
- Were you smoking?
- No.
Liar.
Give me one.
- Where's the pack from?
- They're Mom's.
"Once a week, Saturday morning, with a shot of arak."
- Mom smoked on Sabbath?
- Where did you come from?
She promised not to smoke on Saturdays.
- It's cold.
- Did you take them home?
Kobi has an ear infection.
They don't need to be here.
- Where's your pervert friend?
"- Stop it, Natanel."
On the way to Frankfurt.
- Really?
Is he a flight attendant?
"- No, he's a lawyer."
Why?
I thought you were all flight attendants.
You know that.
Do not want to get involved with them.
He lived for the club!
-And Died for him too!
-My Condolences.
Thank you.
My condolences.
He was a good man.
-I Can send flowers?
-Of Course.
Thank you.
My condolences again.
Let the memorial later if you want.
They will make a memorial at the club and want me to be there.
-You Can stay with Jimmy?
"No, you will not."
"You can be a cop, but you can not order me around."
We can have it.
Let's leave it.
Health then.
-It Was a beautiful funeral.
-Yup.
He was a very good people face.
"He was like a brother to me, you know?"
'You just said that.
"Yes, but he was there."
I do not sit and stare at someone kill my brother.
Raymond!
Free your mind.
Preserves you!
Sorry about that.
-Get It.
Josie!
Jim!
"Look, josie."
1621/2. i got 'em cornered.
I got all the gold there is!
"They've got to buy from me now, at any price i name."
Here it is.
Gentlemen!
President grant is releasing unlimited gold from the united states treasury!
The gold corner is broken!
Jim fisk!
Let's get jim fisk!
Luke!
Line up the soldier boys.
We're marching on wall street to show 'em who's king!
"Jim, come here!"
"Jim, look!"
There's something wrong!
"Jim, what's happened?"
"I... just lost a bet, josie."
"We're not gonna march today, luke."
We're never gonna march again.
"I'm broke, josie."
Jim fisk is busted.
I'm right back where i started.
"Jim... don't worry about me, josie."
I'm all right.
"I was just laughing to think that for the first time in his life, nick was smarter than i was."
And i thought i was bigger than anybody else.
"Don't you worry, josie."
You've got yours.
See how smart i was to make you take all those things i gave you?
Split!
Where to?
Come here!
Don't stand and watch!
Get her!
"Bravo, aunt!"
That was wonderful!
Maa!
Remember your Maa now?
"Always remember her, before you touch another woman."
You can even remember me.
"Sure, Mom!"
"Call me ""aunt""...not Mom!"
"You were great, young lady!"
"Thank you, Laxmi."
What for?
This is my duty.
Not for the juice.
You did me a great favour yesterday.
You have protected my children like a member of the family.
"They're dear to me, too."
"Anything could have happened, if you were not there."
The worthless doctor just fled!
And I was thinking of getting him married to Janki.
I've changed my mind!
The doctor does not deserve Janki!
Have you asked Janki too?
Why ask her?
She has no sense either.
Maybe she loves him.
She was in love with that idiot of a film-man too!
But what happened?
- I don't know what he knew.
This is crazy.
"You're saying Dad hid one of his kids from us for years and then gave Holly the land, so his affair is thrown in our face because of some girl named Rebecca?"
I wish I could tell you what he was thinking.
- It's a shock for me too.
- I don't know why.
- He lied about having a mistress.
- That's not fair.
Why should I be so shocked that he lied to us too?
This whole family revolves around lying.
"- Justin, please!"
- Grandma!
Aunt Kitty!
- Hi.
"- Hi, Grandma."
- Hi.
Hi.
"- Hey, guys."
"Hey, sweetie boy."
"Hi, guys."
- This is wonderful.
- Joe.
"- Hey, Nora."
- Hi.
"- Hey, Kitty."
- I can hardly pick you up.
Please help me understand how you could discover your father has another child and not tell me?
- We were trying to spare you the pain.
- How?
By keeping me in the dark?
God.
You should've seen Justin's reaction.
Just army.
"Why are you here, Harper?"
You boneheaded Paddy!
So...

"Well, you heard him."
It's an Audi.
Give me that.
How fast does it go?
"I don't know. 140, I think."
What fish are they?
They're meant to be sharks.
But I think they're sort of catfish.
Do they cost a lot?
"Yeah, they cost $100 billion."
"""Smoking kills."""
"Thank you for that, cheers."
I'd forgotten.
"You know, Will, you've got a nice flat."
Thank you.
"Only one bedroom, though."
Largely because I find I can only sleep in one bed at a time.
You could get a bigger place.
"I mean, if you needed to."
"Would you like anything to drink, Marcus?"
"Thanks, just got a Pepsi."
Who are these people with the saxophones and trumpets?
Saxophonists and trumpeters.
Why have you got pictures of them?
'Cause they're cool.
What's cool about them?
I don't know.
They took drugs and died.
A vowel.
"""A."""

Friday is the worst day Its the day the ferry is completely full.
Did you hear me?
Im not the one making the decisions.
Excuse me...
"Yes, what is it?"
We are moving.
What do you mean?
"The factory is cutting back, There is no work for Rolf."
He got an offer as an mechanic in Notodden
And i have got a job on the bag production factory.
What does Lise say to this?
Do she want to go?
Okay.
Are you moving in?
Just temporarily.
I think
I could get more more money for the house if I did some work in the backyard.
"Why are you telling me this, Peter?"
"Look, I don't want you to worry about these... decisions."
This is all temporary.
I'm not trying to...
Colonize our past?
"Well, I don't think I'd exactly put it that way, but yes, I don't want these decisions to be misunderstood."
Okay.
I won't.
"So... we're making this work, right?"
"Oddly, yes, we are."
I heard Cary is back with you guys.

What are you doing here?
"Daniel, help!"
"Larry, Kim."
- It is so nice to meet you.
- Hi.
I did sort of a half get-up there.
"- For my niece, fake niece..."
- I should've done a full stand.
I think a full get-up would've...
It's the thought that counts.
"Listen,"
I hope...
"it's kind of weird, but I'd really love for you to take a look at my reel if you wouldn't mind."
"You know, I mean, I could take a look at it."
I'm not really...
I'm not doing TV right now.
"- That's fine, it's fine."

I'm doing really well.

"So Anna Nicole Smith, she's got uh... some pair of knockers on her, huh?"
"They're not real though, are they?"
Huh?
- Whoa.
- Hey.
What's all... what's all that?
Look at all his gifts.
I thought you said we weren't supposed to bring a present.
He said no gifts.
I don't get it.
- Hello.
Johnny was she sleeping with him?
"If I'd have seen something like that, I would tell you."
You think that maybe he was just an old friend?
That's all there was?
We didn't talk.
He didn't seem impressive.
I handed him an envelope.
- He wasn't?
- No.
He's gone and he knows not to come back.
"You know, that would be just like her."
"You see, you know, always looking to help someone."
"I'm dying, John."
- You okay?
- Yeah.
"It's gonna be okay about this guy, so forget about it."
- I let Jimmy down.
"- No, you didn't."
He's gonna die now...
- ...and he thinks I don't love him.
"- Listen to me, he knows you love him."
"And all he wanted was a little more time, where it didn't hurt so bad."
And he's gonna get it.
WEXLER:
Robin?
Yeah?
WEXLER:
You got my soup?
KELLY:
"Go ahead, you'll be fine."
"Yeah, Jimmy, just a sec."
[HELICOPTER BLADES whirring ]
- Do me a favor.
"Finish this beer upstairs in my office, quick."
Huh?
Higgins is here.
It's after 6:30.
"If he catches you in here without a jacket, he's gonna string me up alive."
"No, he won't."
What?
"I can guarantee ya, five gets you 50, he's gonna lay that old line on me that he's on the board of directors."
He's gonna tell me to throw your butt out of here.
Money's up.
[ Sighs ]
You're on.
"Hi, Hig."
And how is your investigation progressing?
"Oh, not too well."
- Are you sure there's nothing more I can do to help?
- [ Rick ] To help?
No.
Positive.
"Well, if there is anything, please don't hesitate to ask."
- Put Magnum's beer on my tab.
- I always do.
- Tomorrow at 3:00?
- I'll try.
Thank you.
You believe that?
"You're catching flies, guys."
Give that guy a drink.
?
[ Lounge Piano ]
?
Yeah.
"Would you, please, be so kind to describe them... to better understanding of how good it looks now?"
Sure.
His arm was shot off below the elbow... and the leg shot off below the knee.
- And there was a...
- Did you happen to see his head?
- Yes.
- Do tell.
"The skull was dented in and there was this, um..."
"His eyes were missing and, um... the bottom half of his jaw was shredded to pieces."
Just all right.
"I'm bleeding, too."
That was a little extraneous.
Stay close.
Henry!
Hurry up!
Close it.
"Henry, come on!"
"Henry, try to keep up!"
Come on.
Kick it in.
Come on.
"If Akan gets a hold of my work,"
Men like these will be brought out from the dead to form his army.
Go!
"Henry, no!"
Henry!
Take my hand!
Escape pod initiated.
- There are two pods.
- One.
- Marty?
What do you mean?
I just...
"I have a bad feeling about it, I, we need to find some rope with her."
"Blair, she's been kidnapped..."
I know.
She's probably traumatized.
"I know that, but she's been here for weeks, right?"
I'm pretty sure that's a fresh pedicure on her feet.
You're basing all of this on nail polish?
Yeah.
Did you get a good look?
Yeah.
I know.
I think so.
Maybe she got a gel pedi before she got kidnapped.
How do you know it?
"It doesn't matter, I just..."
"I think, I think maybe we should tie her up."
Tie her up?
Are you listening to yourself?
She's been tortured.
"No, I'm not doing it."
I'm not doing it.
Are you guys robbers?
"Sorry, Vivian, we..."
Who told you we were robbers?
Your leader.
He wasn't very good.
Connor.
I think it's my fault.
I think I took a wrong turn.
I don't know.
- Even money Stoker don't go the distance!
- Twenty says he does!
"I'll take that, and as much more as you got!"
Break it up!
Come on!
Nelson's working on his belly!
Stoker don't like it there!
Who does?
- What you trying to do?
Cop a Sunday?
- What's the matter?
Can't you take it?
"It looks like a home run, and it is a..."
"No, it's going to fall inside."
- You're doing swell!
"- How're you doing, Stoke, huh?"
"Okay, fella!"
"Okay, let's see that!"
That will be all right!
"Take it easy, Stoke!"
Take it easy!
There we are!
Give them a show!
"One more heat, and we'll call it a day!"
"Sure thing, Danny!"
Sure thing!
You're doing fine!
You're doing fine!
- I told you I'm gonna take this guy!
- He never laid a glove on us!
Ten seconds!
"Don't forget, if you try to slug with him, he'll kill you!"
Oh.
Marissa?
Look who's here.
Luke!
Hi.
Hey.
Mm.
Just grabbing a little grub before we take the boat out.
Boat?
"Yeah, I thought we'd take my dad's DawnSea."
"Do a little water skiing, have a little lunch."
So you have no idea where Ryan might've gone?
I don't know.
He did say something about going down to Mexico and gambling on cockfights.
"I mean, I don't know what kind of jurisdiction you guys..."
Quit joking around.
Will you answer his question?
"Yes, I did."
I really don't know.
I do not know the guy.
I never got the chance.
"Hey, there's eggs."
"Oh, I'm taking Caitlin to the stable, so I need to get that check."
Does Caitlin really need a pony?
"In a couple of months, she's not even going to like horses."
What?
!
I love China.
She's the prettiest pony.
We're not giving up China.
"Now go wait in the car, sweetie."
Mommy will be right with you.
"I'm sorry, kid, I, uh,"
"I don't know, man."
6 months on the sidelines.
I guess I still have a few blisters where I used to have calluses.
I don't think that's what this is.
"Oh, no?"
Then what is it?
You're about to be a dad.
You know?
You have to expect the world to start to feel different.
It just feels so hard.
Not as in difficult.
Literally hard.
Like asphalt is hard.
Like pavement.
And children are soft.
Yeah.
Defenseless.
That's why every day we try to make this world a little safer.
"If there's one thing I'm sure of, is that you and Savannah are going to be great parents."
"Charge by the hour, Doc?"
Aah!

Josie!
Aah!
No...
"Oh, my God."
Eleven.
Aah!
So what do we know?
"Our father's dead, daughter's missing, but we may have caught a break here."
I don't know if we have to retire so soon.
That's been the plan this whole time.
"One last job, travel for a year, settle down and..."
Find normal lives.
We're so good at this.
Do we have to stick to that plan?
Always stick to the plan.
Are you sure this time though?
Like really sure.
I'm always sure.
I could not be more sure about this.
I'm a hundred million billion percent sure.
"Yeah, that sounds like you're pretty sure."
"We're 30 years old, sitting in a fake painter's van, about to rob a house."
So cool.
It's not cool.
It used to be cool.
Okay.
This is our last job.
As planned.
Are you sure?
"I am... 100,000 billion percent sure."
Shut up.
"Yeah, sure."
Thank you.
There she is.
Faster than schedule.
- Ready?
- Yeah.
Finish it.
Finish what?

Heading for Castle Sky.
You've reached the voice mail of Emily Cale.
Why aren't you texting me?
"Em, as soon as you get this, call me back."
"- Keep moving, keep moving!"
"- Martin, I'm right outside the Capitol."
What the hell is happening?
Do you have the president?
I have Eagle.
"Call WFO, get as many men as you can to the Capitol."
I'll dispatch everyone I can spare.
I want a hard perimeter around Castle.
A hard perimeter around Castle.

"Come on, let's go, people."
"Fred, open the gate."
"The French are out of Rochefort, and we're the only English at sea."
We must let the flagship weigh anchor.
We are going for that fire ship.
Beat your drums to quarters.
"- Ponsonby, aim for the fire ship."
"- Yes, sir."
"Come on, every man of you!"
"My God, sir."
Look there.
Bring starboard guns to bear.
Hit her with all you've got.
Steady.

Get the wounded away!
- Open fire!
- Fire!
Get this fire out of midship!
Fire party!
Fire!
We'll go under the bows of the fire ship.
Wait!
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!

"- Aye, aye, sir."
Steady.
"Steady she goes, sir."
- Hard to starboard.
"- Hard to starboard, sir."
Stand by with grappling iron.

"He can do anything, Zone, South Beach, Atkins."
He's fantastic.
And he's cheap.
- How much?
"- Oh, I don't know."
[LAUGHING]
"Oh, shoot, I didn't bring enough double-stick tape."
Could you run down to the storage room and grab me some more?
Me?
"Yeah, I'd go myself, but I have nice shoes on."
"Oh, nice shoes."
"Yeah, I wouldn't know about that."
I get all my shoes at the car wash.
She works at a car wash?
- Yeah.
- Mm.
[GRO ANS]
"God, my shoes are nice."
I spent $40 on these shoes.
"- Oh, God, I hate those women."
- Which women?
All women.
"I mean, it's enough with them already, right?"
You wouldn't happen to be talking about those meanie moms?
"I'm sorry, I can't afford a personal chef."
I don't have time to take a three-hour yoga class.

Used to babysit me.

- Not as crazy as you.
- Not anymore.
"- Well, sit, drink."
"- Uh, I shouldn't."
"I'm responsible now, haven't you heard?"
"- Take a night off, it's good for the soul."
- Great for the soul.
"Oh, wow."
- This is not gonna end well.
- Can't wait.
I hate this house.
It's better than the tomb.
I didn't stay locked up for 145 years to end up locked up here.
Maybe you should quit complaining.
- You gonna stop me?
"- Let it be, Frederick."
- You heard what Pearl said.
- I don't care what Pearl said.
"What you got, boy?"

Back off.
Back off.

Come on.

We're going to visit my little sister.
I had hoped to have a champion by now.
Why don't you slay the Jabberwocky yourself?
You must have the power.

So did I.
"But they didn't, and now here I am, still in one piece."
And I'm rather glad about that now that I'm seeing you again.
"I would have regretted not seeing you again, especially now that you're you, and the proper size."
And it's a good size.
It's a great size.
It's a right proper Alice size!

How could you!
Nicholas?
"You'll have to pay your utility bills, partner."
You know how difficult it is shaving' in the dark.
My room.
Lie down and rest.
What room is this?
It hurts here.
I can't believe this.
This is my room.
Just lie down and relax.
You were in my dream.
"No, when I was taking a bath."
Really?
Do I look dirty to you?
Think I slept with Changwook?
"No, no."
"Then, what's wrong, huh?"
Because I used to date foreigners?
No.
"Actually, it makes it better."
"When you're dating, it's a turn-on."
It is?
"But to cherish someone in your heart, it can be a problem."
It hurts so much.
"There's no woman here, is there?"
"No, stupid."
Really?
Of course not.
It hurts?
It's nice being with you in the morning.
I don't know what to do.
In my brain there is this illness.
My ex-wife had slept with my friend before we married.
I didn't know that before.
"But then, I found out, and I couldn't forgive her."
"Aphrodite, Venus."
"Gaea, the Earth."
"And Selene became Luna, the moon."
"Ares, Mars."
"Zeus, Jupiter."
"And Cronus, Saturn."
"""The gods march in rank."""
Exactly.
"Now, according to Royal Observatory records, uh, this orbital alignment happens only once every five hundred years."
And it will next take place in two days.
"And that, I mean, if we are to believe Solon's riddle, is when the Treasure of Atlantis rises."
But where is the treasure?
"Well, legend says that it's hidden in the Tower of Fear."
"And, uh, the Greek word for ""fear"" of course, is, uh Thera."
"Uh, where's the picture?"
There-
- There--
There was a picture.
The picture.
Where's the picture?
Yes.
I'll show you.
"Ah, here we are."
"Yes, here we are."
That's it.
"And there I am, MacGyver."
"There I am with your grandfather, and there is the Tower."
"Professor, you know that volcano is still active."
"Yes, I know."
But there are ruins near the crater.
Simon took me there once.
That's right.
A dual role?
!
No.
You will play a cook!
A cook even in films?
!
"There are songs, I hope?"
"You're going to the in-laws' place, not for a role."
Why send me there?
Will you have me released?
Not the cop-house!
My in-laws!
They need a cook.
Wow!
My head on the block?
!
But they're Brahmins!
"You must play a Hindu cook, although you're a Muslim!"
And cook what?
Biryani?
And paya?
Remove the meat from the rice and the dish turns vegetarian.
Don't worry.
"There's a woman working there, Aunt Laxmi."
She'll take care if you tell her you're my friend.
Folks there must be highly educated.
If I speak...
"Only if you speak, that is."
What does that mean?
Is Babu your name?
"What was that ""Ba"" and ""Bu""?"
"Not numerology, is it?"
It looks like there's some tidy minge here.
"Yes, it's tidy because there's no hair on it."
"Oi, Si, Hannah Fields is over there."
It's her who write your Valentine?
"Oh, yeah, shit."
She looks quite fit actually.
"Right, I'll go over and tell her you fancy her."
- No.
- Why?
"Well, you going over and telling her I fancy her, seems a bit, y'know, childish."
When in Rome.
That's how you got to play it with younger girls.
You go over...
"Shit, she's coming over here."
So did you get my valentine's card then?
"Oh, yeah, great."
Thank you.
- Do you want a drink?
- I've got one thanks.
"No, I mean a proper drink."
Oh... right.
"Yeah, thanks."
You're fit.
- Sorry?
"- Oh, forget it."
Come on.
"You're well sexy, I used to stare at you in assembly."
Right.
"Ooh, you're so horny."
Tongue me!
"Um, how old are you?"
"Blimey, that didn't take long."
Why can't you compromise on something?
Anything?
Because then I'd be you.
A real Hollywood agent.
"I want to look like that French girl in ""Last Tango in Paris."" Oh."
Where are my heels?
"She had that hat, remember?"
It's black with the flower?
Clothes are not what I remember about that movie.
What?
You're nervous.
[scoffs] [laughs] It's cute.
You're cute.
Just cleaning my boots.
[sighs] [brush swiping]
"Do you love me, Nick?"
[laughs softly]
I wouldn't want to be on this ride with anyone else.
[chuckles]

Do you remember what I said the first time I saw you do stand-up?

I said you were going places.
Yeah.
And then you asked me if I wanted to come with you.

I want to come with you.

I can't wait until our trip to Merced this weekend.
Doesn't matter.
See?
You keep to yourself some things too.
But it's not the same.
-Why not?
You're 13...
Daniel is 18...
I'm your father...
And I want to know what you're doing with an 18 years old boy!
"Well I go out with him, to the movies, we dance, laugh, argue, tell jokes, we go to the theater.."
And nothing else!
Had he kissed you?
I said nothing else.
Won't you have slept with him!
That's why you're worried.
The whole point was this.
It's not funny.
What if I'd answer yes.
Nothing.
What could I do?
Who knows..
The first thing would be telling mom.
Do you think I should tell her?
You should know.
So you've slept with him.
If you say so...
Want to make me angry?
That's what you said when I was little.
And what are you now?
If I were so little you wouldn't ask me this.
"It's true, but now..."
-Now everything changed right?
"J. D. , come on !"
"Go call an ambulance, man."
Go call a fucking ambulance!
I told him not to move.
Hurry up!
SANTANA:
Thought I knew it all.
Ended up in juvie hall.
And the shit got even deeper.
COP:
To the right.
Open up your mouth.
"Okay, pick your clothes up."
Take it on down to the property room to exchange your clothing.
"(whispering) Don't fucking move, you fuck!"
Don't make a fucking sound.
Hear me?
(groaning)
(GRUNTlNG)
Does it feel good?
"Fuck, yeah."
"You say one word about this,"
"(panting) there'll be shit on my knife, not on my dick!"
Fucker.
(GRUNTS)
"Damn you, you fucking asshole!"
Kill him !
Kill him.
(groaning)
SANTANA:
killing that first night got me the worst that juvie had to offer.
An extended sentence with a guaranteed bus ride to the big time as soon as I turned 1 8.
What's happening?
Deep breaths.
What are you doing?
Giving you the chance to prove that Pure Bloods aren't immortal.
"Pure Bloods could die, and that we, the infected ones, will be the ones to take you all down."
I...
I...
I thought you loved me.
I do.
For everything you've just done for Marcus and I.
Who is infected now?
"I know it hurts, mom."
- Please don't!
- I can't.
Stop it you bitch!
It has to work right?
Tell me it's gonna work!
I'm so thristy!
"I can smell him, he's right there."
"I'm so thirsty, honey, please!"
Why isn't this working?
"She's fed to many times, she's been turned for too long."
Let me out!
What can I do?
You can let me do it.
Mom!

I'm sorry.

"If you need anything, then..."
just ask.
Morning.
I've come for Peter.
He's my son.
You want it.
Yeah.
Why can't you get better for me?
We had so much and it's all fucked up forever.
I'm so lonely.
I know.
Do you remember when you rode with me in the ambulance after I tried to kill myself?
Of course.
That's what love feels like.
What are you doing?
Lovely Sid and lovely Michelle are fucking.
We're not...
Not in the way you're thinking.
Effy?
What's wrong?
It keeps happening.
OK.
Lie down.
- Do you mind?
- No.
"I like this story, anyway."
Thanks.
"""Orpheus was the greatest poet who ever lived."
"""His music was so beautiful that when he played rivers would stop flowing,"
"""winds would stop blowing,"
"The will, adding me to the company."
He's been lying to both of us this entire time.
Who is that?
I don't want to sell this house.
Me neither.
"Wait, stop."
- What is it?
- Mm.
Oh.
I just thought we were good.
You're right.
It's too soon.
Sorry.
You should be.
For thinking I want some lame missionary position.
"There's just something about bedroom sex that's... so predictable, you know?"
"So... so ""old married couple."""
I'm just a girl who's more into... surprises.
You're right.
Beds are for sleeping.
We were married?
I had no idea.
Oh.
"Oh, don't stop."
Don't stop.
Don't move.
Shit.
Who is it?
Hope this isn't a bad time.
"The phone, Adriana."
"You need something, call."
But then I wouldn't get to see your beautiful face.
"I don't think you are, Dad."
"You know who's in there, right, besides the little girl?"
Her mother and her father--Charlie.
That means he knows.
And that's two people with a lot of information that have had some pretty bad experiences with us over the years.
They have to go.
"Dr Penzler, too."
I can't risk a leak.
It's too important.
They don't matter anymore.
It's all about Allie.
"You're not in charge here, Mary."
I am.
Take a step back.
Calm down.
I'm sorry.
You're right.
"Just, the two of them having gotten together has made me a little nervous."
- They could really gum us up.
"- No one's getting killed here, Mary."
Of course not.
CYNTHIA:
I got to go to the bathroom.
Grab a cup.
Knock yourself out.
"Lisa, hows he doing?"
He's still breathing.
Are you all right?
I just don't want any more bad news.
Mr Watson?
"Luke, when he died, he wasn't mad at you anymore."
DALE:
"No, quite the reverse."
Knock-out drops.
Surely you've heard of them?
- For knocking out what?
- People.
Who else?
- You mean a sleeping draught.
"- I suppose so, but instantaneous."
"My dear madam, you're asking for a Mickey Finn."
- Am I?
"- We have a mild soporific here, if you're sleeping badly."
"I'm sleeping perfectly well, thank you."
Mickey Finn...
Mickey...
Thank you very much.
"Desiree, you are the expert on crime, how would one obtain a Mickey Finn?"
"Well, I get all dope on drugs from a little crook called Maury Fish."
He hangs around in a pub called the Limehouse Arms.
The Limehouse Arms?
Thank you very much.
(Piano music and chatter)
- Yes?
- Gin and...
"Port and lemon, please."
- Thank you.
- One and six.
- You know Maury Fish?
- Why?
I want some Mickey Finns.
"The real McCoy, mac."
- What for?
"- Ask no questions, eh?"
DUD:
Not very.
DETECTIVE:
So how did you ID this Ray Malcolm?
DUD:
Neighborhood snoop across the street recognized Ray's car parked out front.
Did they see him?
"Mmm-mmm, but she did see a black guy with glasses come out a little while later, get in Ray's car, and split."
"She didn't even know Ray's last name, but she thought he was staying a couple blocks away with some dopers, so we checked it out."
Can you separate it?
Mmm-mmm.
Not yet.
That Ray's package?
So who's this black guy?
"They call him ""Pluto."""
"Evidently, he's been hanging with Ray for the last couple of weeks."
They say he's from out of town.
Pluto.
That's it?
For now.
So who's the girl?
Fantasia.
Bullshit.
Good-looking.
Ray's old lady.
Here...
Listen to this.

It isn't that I...
Thank you.
Lin?
You're a brave woman.
"No, just a woman praying that her family will forgive her."
There is nothing to forgive.
I thought you'd never get here.
- Choppers are coming up the valley.
- Where's Doc?
"Caught one in the back, but he's going to be all right."
Let's get the colonel.

What area's designated as offloading ramp today?
M. P:
"Last pad over, next to the water."
- See that runway over by the beach?

That's where your Peter-san's going to be coming in.

"Thou dost stone my heart, and makest me call what I intend to do; a murder... which I thought a sacrifice:"
I saw the handkerchief.
He found it then;
I never gave it him:
send for him hither;
Let him confess a truth.
- He hath confess'd.
"- What, my lord?"
- That be hath used thee.
- How?
- Unlawfully?
- Ay.
- He will not say so.
"- No, his mouth is stopp'd;"
Honest Iago hath ta'en order for't.
O!
my fears interprets:
"- what, is he dead?"
- Had all his hairs been lives... my great revenge had stomach for them all.
Alas!
He is betray'd and I undone.
"Out, strumpet weep'st thou for him to my face?"
"O, banish me, my lord, but kill me not!"
Kill me to-morrow:
let me live to-night!
"- Hay, if you strive."
- But half an hour!
"- Being done, there is no pause."
- But while I say one prayer!
It is too late.
"My lord, my lord!"
"What, ho!"
It broke.
I don't know what happened.
"Oh, it's ok."
I'll fix it.
Unless you forget where you put it.
"Don't you worry, I'll find a perfectly safe place for it."
We're out of juice.
Norman.
Come on.
When are we getting our house back?
"Jess, come on."
I'm serious.
"Look, I feel bad enough about what my Dad did already."
Everybody's always giving Roman a raw deal.
He's my brother.
I'm not gonna do that.
I didn't mean it like that.
It's just...
I know you don't see it but...
He scares me.
And I don't trust him.
"Remember, I'm the one that caught him snooping in our bedroom."
"Come on, Jess."
He's not a bad person.
I plead his case.
I know exactly how bad he is.
I can't do this for another 18 months.
We need to get him into a halfway house.
Alright.
"As soon as we find a place, he's out of here."
Hello.
Hey.
YOU LIKE ANGLES WITH THE TARGET ON YOUR RIGHT-HAND SIDE
BECAUSE YOU'RE LEFT-HANDED.
THAT'S RIGHT.
I KNEW I LIKED YOU.
PUT IT ON.

PATHETIC.
YOU'RE BETTER THAN THAT.
LET'S GO.
WE HAVE A BIG DAY AHEAD OF US.
I'VE GOT TO TURN YOU IN.
THERE WILL BE QUESTIONS.
IT WILL BE PAST LUNCH BEFORE WE'RE DONE.
TURN ME IN.
"A LOT OF SECRETS, A LOT OF ENEMIES --"
"I THINK IT WOULD BE A SHORT STAY,DON'T YOU?"
"NOW,DON'T YOU THINK WE COULD COME TO AN ARRANGEMENT?"
I DON'T THINK SO.
"NOW,BE HONEST WITH ME."
IF CIRCUMSTANCES WERE DIFFERENT DO YOU THINK THAT WE COULD...
NOT IN THIS LIFETIME.
"MAYBE THE NEXT ONE,THEN."
THE INDICTMENTS CAME DOWN YESTERDAY.
THAT WAS QUICK.
"THEY FOUND A LEAK IN THE U.S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE,"
"AND EVELYN,WOW --"
THEY'RE GONNA BE WORKING UP HER FILE FOR YEARS.
"SHE WAS A VERY,VERY BAD GIRL."
I MANAGED TO KEEP YOU OUT OF IT SO FAR.
Why don't we let Dr. Lockhart present the case?
-Absolutely.
-She's disoriented.
She's repeating questions.
I just wanna get another CT.
-How long here?
-About six hours.
"Luka, your malrotation in Exam 4 is puking blood."
-l'll check back.
"-Yeah, well-- ls she responding to commands?"
Yes.
Hand squeeze and eye opening.
"Rule of thumb, if the patient's exam is non-focal..."
"... andrespondingto commands, just observe and wait."
-Dr.

Get her off the board.
Pulse ox 97 on two liters.
"When you say a truck, do you mean they were driving an SUV or a pickup?"
"SUV, it was blue or black."
It was definitely black.
"- Okay, Judy, we're going to sit you up."
"- Ow, my chest!"
"Did you see the driver or any of the passengers, ma'am?"
There were at least two of them.
"The driver was young, a teenager."
"White, black, Hispanic, Asian, what?"
White.
I'm not sure about the passenger.
Lungs are clear.
BP 112/78.
Or you're just acting blind to the truth that we're husband and wife!
And the way to Bela is the only thing I remember.
Can't you understand that?
"I don't want to understand it because I'm so tired of you, Migs."
"Well, I'm tired too."
I can't take it anymore.
One more chance?
I will change.
"If I would keep you hoping, you'll get hurt even more."
"Migs, I need you."
I'm begging you.
-I'm here for you now.
-What are you doing here?
.
This is wrong.
-Wrong!
-Wrong?
.
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
My heart and mind says you're the one I love.
You're the one my heart is screaming out.
"But what if, what if your memory comes back?"
How?
What if the accident really happened so I can come back to you?
.
I don't want to get hurt again.
Don't be scared.
Don't be scared.
What did she say?
.
"Hello, this is Joy."
You named your battleship after your assistant?
Yep.
"They're both cold, heartless war machines."
"Your tea, sir."
"Look, I am truly sorry for the mess I caused."
Let me make it up to you.
Take Zhu Li.
"My battleship, it's yours, and everything on it."
"It's not the fleet we were looking for, but it's the next best thing."
All right!
Team Avatar is back in business!
It's okay.
We're gonna stop Unalaq and get Jinora back.
I hope my dad's all right.
I'm sure he's fine.
Get the men and fall back.
What about you?
I'm going to end this right now.
Go!
"Hello, Tonraq."
Looking for me?
"Brother, I'm too strong for you."
You're no brother of mine.
You betrayed me.
You had me banished.
"Yes, I did."
Stop!
He's mine.
You are not the true chief.
I am.
And you will bow to me.
"Now that I've defeated you, your daughter is next."
"But Ms. Viola, there many dangers along the way."
"Hazard-no, challenges."
-As soon as it comes.
"Okay, find Uncle Ramon ..."
"Send him to bring friends, Adélie how he can."
-Is ...
Do not forget the family motto.
The RE-MASH.
"Come on, Uncle Bud, we have too many fish to catch."
"-So, what news?"
-Ruins.
"Every corner, every direction, completely blocked."
There are rumors of people thinking the unthinkable.
"Noah, are calling The Iceberg's End."
-How to answer this?
-We will try again.
-We can not ...
Return- to seek hundred times.
-There is no escape.
"-Thousands of times if necessary, there is always a way out."
"It does have, and right there."
"Ice, no ice, but it has ice tone and testing ..."
Let me help you.
"Ready, you can go."
"Erik, no!"
Bounce!
"You saw, you saw?"
"Never, do it again."
"Father, I flew!"
-Erik.
-I flew!
"I beat my wings, was very quick."
Come on.
"One, two, three!"
Wow.
That train is not moving very fast.
This window won't open.
That's why we need to get back in there.
Could pick up the pace.
You're not going fast enough.
I am too going fast enough.
No job is done until the paperwork is complete.
Stand by.
Where the hell is Rudy?
Okay.
"Oh, boy!"
"Oh, oh..."
"Oh, wow..."
It's not that bad.
You're making a big deal.
Wow.
You're making...
Come on.
It's like my grandpa.
It's not that bad.
Where the hell have you been?
Pull me up.
Hand me the chocolate and then I'll pull you up.
Hand you the chocolates?
Yeah.
And then I'll pull you up.
How do I know that once I hand you the chocolate you're not gonna just leave me out here and take the chocolate?
I wouldn't do that.
That's what I would do.
The third name.
"Yeah, the guy in Cleveland."
What about him?
He's the district attorney there.
"All right, we'll handle it."
Anything else?
The last name.
It's gotta be done on Friday.
That's the 13th.
Friday the 13th.
It'll be done the following day.
Some of the boys think it's bad luck to take a contract for the 13th.
We can't push our luck.
"Sorry I can't ask you to stay, Lew."
Gotta get dressed for a dinner.
"Next time, for sure."
Hi.
Come on in.
"I'm Lynn Harper, Mr. Gordon."
Thanks for coming.
I wanted to welcome my new neighbours.
I'm glad you believe in being neighbourly.
Always.
"Come, I'll introduce you to my husband and his brother."
Then we'll have dinner.
Lead the way.
Open the valve.
"Excellent dinner, Mrs. Harper."
Everything was delicious.
Thank you.
And it's Lynn.
"I understand you're in the lumber business, Mr. Gordon."
Is it my forehead?
What?
Last week I told you my hairdresser said I had a big forehead.
"You said it was fine, but you were lying, weren't you?"
"To protect you, yes."
[Man chattering on t.V.]
"Hey, fellas."
Could I speak to Arthur in private?
He's for safety!
That's all.
Watch this part.
"Carrie, come on, let's go."
I'm comin'!
Coming.
I'm coming.

- That lovely box.
- And its contents.
Please open it.
Whatever can it be?
"Oh, books!"
"Oh, thank you, Colonel."
It is only a very modest treasure chest.
"""The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire""."
- Will it not be too difficult for me?
"- Oh, by no means."
"You may find it even more exciting than ""The Mysteries of Udolpho""."
But I shall have hundreds of questions to ask you.
My children.
-You wanna get somethin' to eat?
-Nah.
"I had somethin' last night, ruined my appetite."
"Besides, I gotta get down the road."
Okay.
Thanks for the ride.

Good.
"Okay, we open."
Come in.
-Where's the john at?
The war is like a time bomb for everyone who stuck their neck out.
How did you recognize me?
You said my name right away.
Your voice.
It hasn't changed.
"Like in the past, when you'd brief us before we'd go."
I'll visit again soon.
Maybe with good news.
"Whatever you'll do, good luck."
"The children would say ""Mazzel and broche""."
Ok.
Thanks.
More chicken and we're also out of orange juice.
"Ab, come on."
-Orange juice.
I like to have a full fridge.
In case something happens.
What happens?
-Anything.
War.
-You and your war.
There.
-Thank you.
Juice.
And juice.
I called you at the office earlier.
-I wasn't there.
And you weren't there yesterday or the day before yesterday.
That's true.
I was away for work.
-But they didn't know where you were.

"All right, class, today we're going to be talking about variables."
(kids laughing)
"Okay, it's just a rear end."
We all have one.
Mine just happens to be a hot Brazilian woman's.
"No, we're not laughing at you."
We're laughing at Griffin's shoes.
"Why, what's wrong with them?"
I don't even know what those are.
"What's ""Teslik""?"
"Um, I'm not sure, but my mom says they're very popular with Latvian athletes."
"Running, throwing, lifting big things."
Teslik.
"That's all right with me, man."
ANNOUNCER:
Each shoe sold separate.
Are they really that bad?
(laughs):
Are you kidding?
They're terrible.
"Man, high school is rough."
This year it's sneakers.
Last year it was all about being overweight and wearing a baseball cap.
"Hey, guys, sure hope we win the big game on Saturday."
"Hello sis, how are you?"
"I'll go to your house later, okay?"
.
"Sis, are you okay?"
.
They really are close to each other.
Who?
Migs and Bela.
I'm not used to seeing them like that.
"Sis, be strong."
Fight for Migs.
"You know, show Migs why he fell in love with you."
I just find it so hard every time he sees me but he doesn't remember me.
But I can't make it obvious.
I have to hide it.
-It hurts so bad.
"-Sis, you can do that."
I have to carry on.
I'll show him why he loved me.
Take a bath.
"You know, this is where we had our second date."
And you always take something home for Raya and Mrs. Robles.
That's why Raya loves you so much because you always bring her food.
-It's because you keep bribing her.
-Is that so?
.
-Who were you talking to?
-It's Ara.
Later...
"I'll go to our house, I'll just get something."
-Do you want me to go with you?
.
Kevin.
I'm Frank.
Brad.
-Hey.
"-Oh, hey."
"Oh, God."
"Come on, come in."
Excuse me.
What do we do now?
Just ask her to...
you know.
You kids see a lot of hookers?
"No, this is our first one."
Why do you have a picture of Grace Kelley?
'Cause I'd like to be like her:
Marry a prince and never get old.
"When you take your clothes off for money, do you get cold?"
Depends on the room.
"I have this dream that I'm naked at school, and I have to get home without anyone seeing me."
"I have that dream, too."
"Last time I had that dream, there was an alligator chasing me."
You ever get that one?
Nope.
Do you ever watch cartoons?
Yes.
Are you married?
"Boy, you ask a lot of questions."
The meter's ticking.
She's on the bed.
She's on the bed!
"Now, how do you want to do this:"
standing up or on the bed?
"Yeah, here, want this?"
That should clear up the infection in about 24 hours.
"However, the world might look a little fuzzy to you for a while."
"Here, put these on, Paula."
It'll cut down the glare.

Judy.
Take that-- that's my new hat.
For Pete's sake.
"Around here, all hats belong to people."
"But if you find one in the bush, keep it."
(CHATTERING)
- And where're you going?
"- Well, to make lunch."
"Lunch has already been prepared, courtesy of Jack, our new short-order cook."
"Well then, I better check on it."
I wonder how many ways you can boil eggs.
Chief cook and bottle washer.
"Boy, what a waste of talent."
Hmm.

- Where was she hit?
- In the neck.
"- BP's 100/76, pulse stable at 100."
- Through and through?
- Saw one hole but it wasn't leaking air.
- You need a hand?
- Possible SCI.
- Where is he?
Ricky?
- What's her name?
- Alma.
"Hang in there, Alma."
We' re gonna try to find him for you.
- Set up a cross-table lateral of the neck.
- Carter.
Still got med students waiting.
Want me to jump on that?
Better idea.
You talk to them.
So.
"Newbies, huh?"
You don't wanna work here.
"- Haleh, get that dead body out of here."
- And take it where?
- Someplace else.
- How much O2?
- Five liters by nasal cannula.
- You hurt anywhere else?
They shot him!
"Oh, please, God, don't let him be hurt!"
"We' re gonna find out for you, but you gotta help us."
- Do you have pain anywhere else?
JOHN:
It's really green as hell.
"You know, I'm a country boy, John."
That's a bunch of crap.
You were born in L.A.
Mmm-mmm.
Malibu.
(SIREN WAILING)
JOHN:
What the fuck?
Howdy.
Dale Dixon.
"Welcome to Star City, boys."
"We've got a full day, so if you'll follow me we'll get you unpacked and get you something to eat."
"As soon as I saw you drive by,"
I knew you were the boys from California.
"(TRUCK HORN HONKING) Cops look the same everywhere, I guess."
Follow me.
(TIRES SQUEALING)
"Oh, shit."
WAITRESS:
"That's three scrambled and a cold Bud, whole wheat, sausages."
You boys are in for a treat now.
"Say, Fern, can you bring us some extra biscuits, too?"
"Sure thing, Hurricane."
"Some more coffee, too, please."
She call you Hurricane?
Folks call me that.
I never have figured out why.
I figure we can wait up in the woods.
"When the bad folks show up, we'll put the stopper in the bottle like that."
They'll be sorry they ever heard of Star City.
Ahem.
"Okay, you're not helping, really, with my nerves here, so I gotta go."
Goddamn it.
"Hi, I'm Lucy Miller."
Um...
You must be Maggie.
I'll be representing you.
"I brought warm, comforting beverages."
Or what's left of them.
The rest is on my new white shirt that I wore to impress you.
"Uh, can we sit?"
Great.
Oh.
Sorry about your chips.
Um...
"Look, uh, yours is not a hopeless case."
Seems pretty hopeless to me.
Hm.
I can see that.
I'm not saying it's going to be easy.
They do have your son's voice on the 911 call.
I don't even know what happened to me.
I didn't mean to scare him.
I didn't mean for any of this to happen.
"You know, um, I'm scared too."
You're scared?
This is my first day in the field.
That's comforting.
I volunteered.
I specifically wanted your case.
A charity case.
Because I think I can help you.
Is that what you want?
"If we stay around here, we're dead."
You got it?
We're dead.
They're right.
You took too much of that stuff.
You're totally paranoid.
How's he doing?
Busting his balls or what?
He's okay.
They sobered him up.
Good.
Very good.
Glad to hear it.
You know what kind of questions they're asking him?
"Jimmy, I don't know."
I got my mind on so many other things.
I got no money...
The girls are old enough to read the newspapers.
Tell him he's got to call me.
Okay?
"As soon as you talk to him, e's got to call me."
It's very important.
He doesn't know I came here to see you.
It's like he's crazy.
- Take this.
It's a couple of thousands.
"- Thanks, Jimmy."
"Don't worry, everything will be all right."
I got some beautiful Dior dresses.
You want to have them?
Pick out a few for yourself.
- You get 50?
For what?
- For facilitating.
Who's taking a bigger risk here?
He likes prison.
"You did bring the cash, didn't you?"
"Look, if this option is too expensive you can still always..."
Badger in the chow line.
"Conscience gets expensive, doesn't it?"
All right.
There's our boy.
Right on time.
- Go back.
- What?
"All right, all right, all right."
"So, what do you think?"
They see us?
"No, man, I think we're good."
Badger looks like he's gonna throw up.
Give me those back.
Just give them to me.
"Oh, no."
Where the hell is Jimmy?
Should've been here 10 minutes ago.
You think Jimmy is actually for real?
A guy who wants to be in prison?
There's more than one kind of prison.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
There he is...
Wait a minute.
"- Oh, no, no, no."
- What?
You're right.
Poor Dori.
Dori!
He's running faster.
Great!
Dori.
Did you kick me?
"No, I was just running."
What's wrong?
I don't know what's happened.
It's weird.
What's the matter?
Are you in pain?
I think it's a muscle cramp.
Can't move at all.
Really?
You can't move?
No.
"Dori, come here."
"Oh no, what shall I do?"
It's very swollen.
The doctor really said you don't need to be looked at?
"Yeah, he's my relative so he wouldn't lie."
He said an unused muscle snapped.
We have unused muscles in our body?
I don't know.
Maybe it's like an appendix.
He says it'll be very painful only for a week.
Lucky I don't have to go to the hospital.
But shouldn't you see a doctor at least once?
Is talking on the phone enough?
Don't worry.
"Foon, that painted face did it."
That clown again?
The opera troupe might be involved.
I thought so!
You stay out of this!
"Marshal, if you need any help, just ask."
No need.
I'm the Marshal of seven provinces!
"When I'm on a case, I can withstand anything!"
"Reporting for duty, Marshal!"
I've arrested all the painted faces.
But I don't know who's the murderer.
Quiet!
Reporting for duty!
Who's the murderer?
Reporting for duty!
"Marshal, you've made a mistake!"
I've got to go on stage any time now!
- Snake Tongue!
- Here!
Are all the painted faces here?
Yes.
We got everyone.
What about him?
- He escaped.
- Numbskull!
- Useless...
- Reporting for duty!
Stop!
Make way!
Where do you think you're going?
What are you doing?
A clown ba...
It's like a baby...
It's like a clown that is a baby.
- I said cl... clown baby.
- Mm-mmm.
You said baby clown.
- I don't even care.
- Yep.
"""Clown Baby""?"
What in the hell kind of a name is Clown Baby?
"Bro, it's perfect."
Nobody's gonna bet on a guy named Clown Baby.
He's gonna be a huge underdog.
- Which means we stand to make even more money off him.
- Exactly.
"- Oh, that's brilliant."
"- Hey, pal, 500 bucks on Clown Baby."
"Oh, Dennis. 500?"
"That's all we got, dude."
You saw Charlie.
We turned that kid into an animal.
"Oh, yeah?"
Call me a Holocaust victim?
Say you're prettier than me?
"Okay, maybe that part might be a little bit true."
We'll see how pretty you are as soon as I punch a hole in your...
Wha...
Where the he...
Who took my shit?
I might have had some.
"What did you just say, you little bitch?"
I might have had some of your pills or whatever.
-It was New York.
-Johnny Sack?
What was it?
The fat joke?
I'm sure that didn't help.
Carmine.
"This HUD thing we're into, they wanted a piece of it."
I think they confronted Ralph...
-things went sour.
"-What'd he say, John?"
Wasn't what he said so much as what he didn't say.
We're talking about New York here.
Before we do anything in terms of a payback... you go to your people.
I want a full investigation.
Nobody makes a move until we know what happened.
You understand?
What the fuck?
-What's going on?
-Have a seat.
I'm Dominic.
"I know you don't know me, but...."
You're the guy who broke into Stew Leonard's that time.
You stole all those pork loins.
"Yeah, but that's not why I'm here today."
-We're here to talk about your drug problem.
-What?
"-Jesus Christ, you fucking kidding me?"
"-Sorry, baby, please."
"No, fuck this shit."
You were told once.
"Now, sit down."
Sit down.
But you and your boy the only ones to walk out alive.
Kind of a miracle.
HENRY:
"Shut up, Fitzgerald."
FITZGERALD:
Is that what you did?
Shot one of your own to save this little dog here?
Why?
"Was he playing with this little boy's mama, huh?"
Did he kill her?
"Hey, you can quit polishing that rifle when I'm talking to you."
I'm working on it.
You can work on it when I'm done talking to you.
Look at me.
HENRY:
That's enough!
"You're forgetting your place, boy."
"As far as I can tell, my place is here on the smart end of this rifle."
HENRY:
"You move along, Fitzgerald."
That's an order!
Listen!
There's only a couple hours of light left.
We got to stash these pelts and get rid of the boat.
Let's go!

"Trauma panel, type and cross four units."
- He could've bagged his spleen.
"- Look, I'll get the other one."
- We need you here.
- We'll be there.
"- Now, Gallant."
- It's cool.
It's not cool.
Hurry the hell up.
"- Come on, let's go."
- You've got two doctors.
That's enough.
We've got a critical patient who needs rapid assessment and prompt treatment.
What's the matter?
Forget what happened earlier and do your job.
- I
- I can't help that guy.
"- This is what we do, all right?"
"Now, get your ass in there."
Come on.
Come on.
"John, it's beautiful."
Absolutely beautiful.
Marriage can be a great thing.
- Can be.
- Yeah.
What the hell do I know?
Mine failed.
For many reasons.
"Right now, I'd like to see the chain the dog"
Was wearing in the park.
Greta's leash?
Why?
Mm.
"Grasping at straws, I guess..."
Nothing for you to worry about.
"Well, OK."
Sure.
OTIS:
"How is she, Greta?"
AUDREY:
"Oh, fine."
Maybe a little more restless than usual.
[Snarling]
Here it is.
What's important about the leash?
"Oh, nothing probably."
"You know, I'm just checking on anything."
Do you have a headache?
Yeah.
"It's an occupational hazard at my age, I guess."
Probably a lot of sinus too.
There's a lot of dust in the air today.
"Well, let me get you some aspirin."
Oh.
"If you would, uh, think this will be better."
"If it's a little seltzer, if you'd dump it in a small glass"
"Of water, please."
Sure How about some coffee?
"Uh, no, no."
No thanks.
I know it!
I know now!
You have done this!
You have done this!

What do you want?
Are you blind?
Just wait a second please.
No!
Please.
Sit here.
Let me examine you.
"Don't hurt me, or I'll beat you up!"
You want a fight?
That's fine with me.
Stop!
That's no way to treat a patient!
"I as just arranging your seat, Master."
What's wrong with you?
I feel uncomfortable from head to toe!
I'm Huang Fei-hung.
I'll examine you.
Let me warn you first.
I've crippled several of my doctors!
Your pulse is weak!
Can you do something about it?
Of course!
No problem!
Back to normal now!
I'll get the money tomorrow.
You focus on the arrangements.
Are you done with the hospital arrangements?
I came here after paying the advance amount.
My brother's friends are with him at the hospital.
He is repeatedly asking to meet you.
"Once the transplantation is done,"
I will be the first person to meet him.
She is cooking a story to rob him.
Priya?
Are you crying?
"Thanks for being there, Vikram."
Be strong.
I'll be there for you.
Your company is all I need.
Everything will go smoothly.
Who is this woman?

Even I want to fall in love with her!
I'll pay.
What's your lover Vasundhara saying?
"Start, start..."
Go closer!

"You, moron!"
We have to take the other route now.

I am so glad to see you.
"Hey, where's Ryan ?"
He's...
Hey.
"Hey, Atwood."
I got to look for Pancakes.
"Oh, my God !"
Pancakes !
I'm gonna go with you.
Great.
"While you guys do that, Ryan and I will, uh..."
Go.
"Yeah, we're gonna go."
Where are you gonna go ?
"Yeah, we just got here."
"Well, we need supplies."
I have supplies.
"No, I know, but, uh, who knows how long those will last."
"Yeah, and there'll probably be a run, especially when the zombies come out."
Seth.
Ryan.
"Look, guys, we'll be fine."
"Just stay here, lock the doors and don't open them."
"Summer,"
Pancakes needs you right now.
Be careful.
Michelle's pregnant.
Dad?
I stabbed him.
I stabbed my husband.
We're gonna get you in a cast later.
You can have everybody sign it.
"You're just gonna have to be prepared for a little bit of itching, okay?"
All right.
You want to talk about it?
No.
I can't.
All right.
Okay.
"I know it feels that way, but, um, you gotta believe me."
There's a lot of people that want to help you.
Okay.
"Well, maybe later."
All right?
You still playing soccer?
Yeah.
Starting fullback.
"Oh, yeah?"
Starting fullback.
"That's, uh..."
"Yeah, see, I don't know anything about soccer."
You could ask me about basketball.
I'm good with the basketball.
"Invented by a doctor, probably to get more patients, 'cause, you know, basketball injuries."
Is my dad gonna be okay?
Dr. Bennett's taking care of him.
He's in good hands.
"Okay, so crits are stable."
It's too bad it ain't winter.
We could grab a couple bags of those coals.
"""Everwrite Fountain Pen Company."" I wonder what's in there."
Come on.
Let's take a look.
It's loaded full of cases.
Fountain pens.
Hundreds of them.
- We can break that easy.
"- We shouldn't, we don't need those pens."
- It ain't like stealing coal to keep warm.
- We can sell them.
"Now, listen."
"What we don't take, we ain't got."
Look around.
See what you can find to break that lock.
"All right, whoever's in here, come on out."
"Come on out, I say!"
- What's the trouble?
- Just a couple of kids.
I heard them.
Come on out of there.
"Come on, you hoodlums."
You won't get away.
"- Come out, or I'll come in after you."
"- Let's make a break for it, Jerry, now."
"Come on, Rocky!"
Jump!
"Hi, Snowflakes."
"- Hi, Jerry."
- Hello.
What do you hear?
Did anyone come to visit me?
who do you mean?
We are all here.
My friend.
Which friend?
Did anyone by the name Deepa visit me?
Deepa?
No.
No one like that had come.
Where is my phone?
Did she call me?
I need to talk to her immediately.
I'll leave.
"Sadhana, wait."
Where are you going?
He is asking about someone called Deepa.
I asked for my phone.
I need to talk to Deepa immediately.
I need to see her.
What is this?
Sadhana was the one who took care of you.
You didn't even talk to her.
"I will talk to her, later."
I need to talk to Deepa now.
Will you give my phone?
What do you think you are doing?
We have been praying for your recovery...
We have spent a lot of money and waited.
You must be happy for getting your vision back.
You are reciting someone random woman's name!
- What did you say?
What?
Possible.
After my careful analysis...
Possible?
No way.
"Excellent judgement, Marshal."
I traveled far for White Tiger.
So I leave this insignificant case to you.
I'll hold you responsible for your fail this.
Responsible?
Me?
Marshal!
You've come such a long way.
How about having dinner with me tomorrow.
Please...
We weren't invited to the restaurant's opening.
Why?
They've invited Huang Fei-hung.
Huang?
It's his birthday a couple days later.
Send him a birthday suit.
He'll like my suit for sure.
Is everything ready for my birthday?
"Everything is ready, Master."
Master...
A tailor's here to make a suit for you.
What?
Your birthday suit.
Show him in.
How come it's different tailor?
Ah To's away.
Let me take your measurement.
Fine.
I just wanna walk.
How is he?
"Well, he's doing pretty good, considering."
Do you think she ever really loved him?
It doesn't look like that matters.
"- Breathe, Harriet, breathe."
- I am breathing.
We need to come up with a better game plan for that next contraction.
You're doing just fine.
- Let's just have a look at you.
- Okay.
You're going to feel a little pressure.
A little pressure might be a nice change.
Where's Dr. Gettis?
He was due in here 10 minutes ago.
- I don't know.
I paged him.
- Get him in here.
- What is it?
- I need you to roll over on your side.
- I need Dr. Gettis right away.
- Okay.
Get that pillow down.
Yes.
- Don't push yet.
- What's happened?
Just something the doctor needs to look at.
They can't find him.
I've got Dr. Chadway.
"Doctor, we have a prolapsed cord."
The baby's heart rate is showing decels.
"Yes, sir."

I won't let it.
"I love you, Bobby."

I have to get back to the club.
Hey.
"Come on, now."
"You don't want me to be late on the night I'm gonna elope, do you?"
"Diane, why do you have to go?"
Why can't we just get out-- Bobby.
"Bobby, I have to go back to the club."
"If I don't, Jessie'll be suspicious."
"Don't you worry, honey."
No man is ever gonna lay a hand on me again except you.
I swear it.
Come on.
Let's go.
Okay.

"Then, crossed dimensions, ...and came out of another hole."

I know things have been difficult between you but...
Our marriage has been for public show.
"In private, he's ignored or slighted me at every turn."
You need to stay strong.
You're still the Queen of France.
Perhaps not for long.
Do you think that the King would want a scandal that could endanger the throne?
"The Dauphin is his son, the King could never admit to anything else."
I had hoped that everything with Aramis was over.
Forgotten.
"You're in big trouble, mister."
- No.
"Oh, God."
- Yup.
- You're gonna have to pay for it.
"- I told them, Officer."
"I said it was stupid at the start, but nobody listened to me."
That's good.
Remorse.
Nice candy.
"'Cause, for starters, we're looking at three big ones."
"Oh, God!"
Three big
- Three years?
Three hundred dollars.
What?
For the windshield.
"Plus, there's this little baby right here."
"You'll have to put that together with tape, but it still counts."
- This-
- This is a ticket.
- Yeah.
For operating a class-two vehicle without a license.
Weight class two.
Can't this wait?
Mr. Richards is suffering from a concussion.
- We're talking.
- There's nothin' on it.
My pen ran out of ink.
"Officer, i really must insist."
"From doing paperwork all night, between you and saving your boss."
- My boss?
"You bring him home, Wallace."
# Y tú que te creías #
# El rey de todo el mundo #
# Y tú que nunca fuiste #

They got your commercial on TV up in Indian Ridge.
"It's 4:00 in the morning, but it's TV nonetheless."
You trick-or-treating?
Was wondering if you knew anything about Ken Mersey going missing.
"Yeah, what kind of trouble he got?"
"The considerable kind, I guess."
Ooh.
"Really taking yourself seriously in that uniform, ain't you?"
Don't mind going after an old drinking buddy like that?
"As far as I can see, he's under arrest."
If he's still alive.
How do you take your coffee?
I don't.
Well...
No sales being had.
No maintenance or repairs being had.
It's just a whole lot of nothing.
I haven't had a real need for Ken in the garage.
- What about the stolen truck?
- Trucks.
He took them with.
He didn't say anything.
He just... went.
That don't sound like him.
-I have an appointment!
What is happening?
Go and look.
"Maestro, I have something special and he won't let me come in."
-You cannot pass!
-Go away outside.
I have something truly exceptional.
"See, show the maestro."
Show it to the maestro.
-What is going on?
-Can't you see?
I only see a cheeky one.
"-In other words, two of those."
-Look at it maestro.
"Well, look at it."
Is it not a loveliness?
Show it.
Show it to the maestro.
-Congratulations!
- What did I say to him?
Doesn't she at least deserve a test?
"Yes, I don't know."
Perhaps.
At least it deserves the proof of the currency.
Show me how you move.
Pick it up.
Is it like this?
Or is it so?
Well you have a future.
"So says someone, who knows."
-Thank you maestro.
-Then you make her a star?
People page.
Names...
"Karl W. Taylor, Eric Sawyer."
- Page thirty-three.
- Society world.
It's a photo of a couple that just got married.
Centerfold.
What does she do?
"She's an actress, a model... a dancer, and a dental technician."
She enjoys cooking and hip-hop.
"She's wearing a black bikini, and she's fine."
Yes!
What's her measurements?
Thirty-eight...
"After you touch it, it only lasts for thirty seconds."
You really got superpowers!
That's what I've been trying to tell you.
"- Man, this is wild."
- Check this out.
"Jeff, you were hit by a meteor."
Think anybody else got superpowers?
Larry?
"Larry, come in here."
Something's wrong with this TV.
"What's wrong, Mary?"
The channels keep changing by themselves.
They keep what?
Fix it.
It's this thing.
It's this right here.
"Oh, see, I know what's wrong."
I know what's wrong.
He's cute.
I know how to make him feel better.
"No, I know a better way."
Lift him up.
"Oh, goodness."
"Oh, goodness, what have you done?"
"What are you doing this time, Jimmy?"
He's still conscious?
Yes.
Hello.
You'll be fine.
You just gotta get a little bit power.
"Ladies, could you give us a little space, please?"
Thank you.
"You're a big deal, you know?"
You're not the only one wronged by Akan.
You and I want the same thing.
This might hurt a bit.
Here we go.
That's wonderful.
Now we can take you back to my lab.
"I'm Jimmy, by the way."
I realize this is very confusing for you.
But it's better if I show you at the lab.
Hello?
"Oh, thank you."
They're Here.
They must have followed you.
I can't...
I can't let them see me like this.
I can't let...
I'm sorry.
What are you doin' here?
You're gonna miss your race.
Don't worry.
"I'll give you a police escort, and we'll make up time."
"Thank you, Sheriff."
But you know I can't go just yet.
"Well, why not?"
I'm not sure these tires can get me to California.
- Peet stop?
"Yeah, does anybody know what time Luigi's opens?"
I can't-a believe it!
Four new tires!
I can't-a believe it!
Four new tires!
"Grazie, Mr. Lightning."
Grazie!
- Would you look at that!
- Our first customer in years!
"I am filled with tears of ecstasy, for this is the most glorious day of my life!"
"All right, Luigi, give me the best set of blackwalls you've got."
No!
"No, no, no."
You don't-a know what you want.
Luigi know what you want.
Blackwall tires.
They blend into the pavement.
But-a this...
Whitewall tires!
"They say, ""Look at me!"
Here I am!
"Love me. """
"All right, you're the expert."
She thinks she's doing her job.
I am going to pull him from her class.
Don't overreact.
The agency said there was gonna be emotional scarring.
"Hey, give it back!"
How could you like to be his parents?
Where are my baby fish?
Mr. Michaelson bought them for his aquarium.
They were mine!
They were grown up.
It was time for them to have their own home.
You had no right to sell them!
"- Mikey, what's wrong with you?"
- They were mine!
Calm down.
They were only fish.
You don't care about how I feel.
You don't love me.
I hate you
Calm down.
Stop it.
"When Daddy gets home, we'll talk about it."
He's not my real daddy.
You're not my real mother!
I hate you!
I wish I never met you!
"Mikey, wait!"
( Door Slamming )
I'm sure there's an explanation.
If we could just get him to talk.
I don't know.
Maybe they're right.
He died of love.
"I mean, he must have been killed by a jealous lover."
Makes sense.
This was brutal.
"Marshal, could it be White Tiger?"
- According to my calculations...
"- Not him, right?"
- Could be.
"- Yes, yes."
- After serious consideration...
- It's him.
Not him.
The Marshal is right.
I came from the North to GuangZhou just to catch White Tiger.
Minor cases like this should be settled at your level.
"If you don't solve this, you'll come to regret it."
I'll regret it!
"Marshal, Marshal!"
"Marshal, you're here all the way from the North."
Come for dinner tomorrow.
- OK.
"- Please, please, please..."
"Sifu Tam, we haven't been asked to perform our lion dance at the start."
Why not?
They asked Wong Fei-hung.
Wong Fei-hung again?
His birthday's in a few days.
"Junior, deliver a birthday robe to him."
He'll like the robe I make him.
"Foon, it's my birthday in a few days."
Are we ready?
"- Yes, Sifu."
"Oh, my God."
"Oh, my God!"
He kinda looks like Josh Peters.
- It's Josh Peters!
You're Josh Peters!
- Sorry?
You're Josh Peters from high school!
From a guy I know at high school.
The system could be mining some of your personal memories for texture.
Was Josh Peters someone you were scared of?
He was a bully.
I wasn't scared.
"I wasn't scared of him, but he was a bully and..."
Man!
Take a couple of Krav Maga classes and I'd be ready.
I'd be ready!
Kali ma!
Dah!
I'm gonna get some wine.
Re-up.
"I'd offer you some, but I don't think you can drink it so..."
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
"Catch ya later, Peters."
This non-alcoholic wine is pretty good.
"I'm not like a expert or anything, but it's kinda great."
I was in France.
"I stayed at this, like, vineyard, and they had this wine, like, grape-stomping festival."
"Now that, that wine was good."
I know that.
You're being discursive.
- What is discursive?
Discursive?
What?
You gotta show us the house.
It's just over that hill.
It's just the one house.
You can't miss it.
You came all the way here.
You should see it through.
"Don't touch me, I gotta go!"
Where do you think you're going?
I said let go!
Shit...
Hey!
Mister.
Mister?
Mister?
You all right?
You fucking bastards.
We're sorry.
Fuck off.
I'm gonna get your asses sacked.
You just wait.
"We're real sorry, okay?"
Fuck you.
You deserve to get scorched by lightning.
Where are you going?
You got hit by lightning.
Hey!
What's the point of taking all those health tonics-
if it's lightning that kills you?
How can something like this happen?
What are the chances?
"But they'll say, thanks to all those tonics, he survived."
I know.
But nothing appears to be wrong with the thermostat.
And I couldn't find anything wrong with the lights and the TV either.
Okay.
So what is it?
"Something strange is going on in this suite, Danny."
Not you too.
"Come on, Don."
[Scoffs]
Thirty-nine degrees.
"Your, uh, dairy storage is exemplary, Delinda."
I bet you say that to all the girls.
[Chuckles]
Whoa.
Sorry.
"Well, filters clean."
Ventilation good.
Everything looks perfect.
"So, uh, we passed?"
"Oh, with flying colors."
I'm not supposed to reveal that until the official report is issued.
It'll be our little secret.
[Chuckles]
"Okay, so..."
Just...
Just one more thing.
What's that?
"Um, I was wondering if you might have dinner with me some evening?"
"Oh, Mr. Ackerman."
"Oh, no."
"Call meJerry, please."
Jerry.
I don't recognize anybody's voice.
Don't make any mistakes here or do anything stupid.
Don't tell me how to live my life.
- Cut them loose.
- All right.
OFFICER:
"All right, this way out."
MARTINEZ:
Let's go.
[DOOR OPENS]
"- Hey, Greg."
"- Hey, John."
KELLY:
How you feeling?
MEDAVOY:
Okay.
"You know, all right."
John....
- Could I talk to you for a minute?
- Sure.
"John, when you got separated, did you give that a lot of thought?"
"Did you have it pretty well worked- out, what you were going to do?"
- It was her call.
- It was Laurie's idea?
Yeah.
"For me, you marry, you marry for life."
Me too.
"You know, that's exactly me too."
"But when it happened I was so busy being pissed off and hurt, I wasn't listening."
She was trying to tell me why she wanted to leave.
But you know what?
She was right.
"And that, you know, makes me uncomfortable."
[SCOFFS]
"Well, just because I'm comfortable with myself doesn't mean I don't wanna fit in."
"- What, you wanna fit in with us?"
- Yeah.
"I mean, you guys could try and be a little nicer to me at school."
"- Okay, well, we could try."
- Thank you.
- Okay.
Good.
- Okay.
Good.
- This is good.
- This is good.
This is a tip for you.
A tip?
"No, Marly, that's not..."
"Oh, a hundred bucks?"
"Whoa, thank you."
Somebody's getting a haircut.
And a new pair of shoes.
"I'm not looking, I'm not looking."
I just wanna get my purse.
"I don't wanna see anything, or, God forbid, touch anything."
"It's okay, he's gone."
Ah.
"Well, I am leaving."
I wanna thank you for a particularly humiliating afternoon.
- Are you mad at me?
- Mad at you?
"No, that was great."
"I don't know, which part was my favorite?"
- Getting ready for the theater.
Theater?
Sure.
It's Laura's opening night.
- I forgot.
- You promised to come.
"Yeah, but..."
- I couldn't stand it tonight.
- Why not?
I had my share of amateur dramatics today.
You're mean.
It's supposed to be really good this time.
Can't we lie in bed and watch TV instead?
How original.
"""A Streetcar Named Desire""..."
perhaps it's on TV tonight.
Vivian Leigh instead of Laura Kirsch.
"Marco, I have to go, and I want to."
- You can come here and watch TV.
- Yeah?
"Yes, I'll tell Laura you're ill."
Yeah?
"Yeah, see you soon."
"My God, they're full to bursting."
Look at my figure.
Look at my figure.
"Did you know that I haven't put on an ounce... in ten years, Stella?"
Please.
Look at my figure.
"Did you know that I haven't put on an ounce... in ten years, Stella?"
I weigh what I weighed...
How much do you think this exclusive casserole set costs?
- Yeah.
You do?
What should we do now?
[BOTH CHUCKLE]
"Oh, yeah."
Memory serves.
"Now that I have your attention, listen up."
"You do not come into my town, threaten people I care about."
Going after Elena?
Bad move.
You leave her alone or I will rip you to bits.
Because I do believe in killing the messenger.
You know why?
Because it sends a message.
[GASPS AND GRUNTS]
"If Katherine wants something from me, you tell that bitch to come get it herself."
[KNOCKS]
- Hi.
- Hey.
I couldn't sleep last night.
"You were obviously upset about something, and I just walked away."
That's not me.
That can't be us.
"You're my friend, Elena."
"If you need me, I'm here for you."
And I'm sorry I couldn't show you that yesterday.
I met my birth mother.
Oh.
Was it?
Are you okay?
[GRUNTS]
TYLER:
You're his kin.
"People would keep coming in, 'cause they associate you with your old man."
Maybe you should hang with las viejas on 190th.
Why are you looking at me like that?
Doctor says you're getting out of here soon.
They set you up with a daytime nurse for a couple of months.
I spoke to the insurance lady.
I put a little extra in to get you through the next few weeks.
- Gracias.
"- You've got a real gift, Carlos."
Don't let go of that.
"- Put me down, carajo!"
- I got you.
"- Put me down, coño!"
- I got you.
Nice!
Let's get some light in here.
"Better, right?"
"You have some nice plants here, Mr. Eddie."
Let me knot it for you.
They could use some water.
Let's take this jug.
Carlos:
"Turn it, dude."
You're gonna break the window.
- Mickey:
Stop fucking bitching.
- Carlos:
What did I tell you?
- Daisy:
You'll hit the walls.
- Shit.
Why aren't you trying anything on?
Did you take your meds?
"What do you mean, did I take my meds?"
Of course.
"For God's sake, Mom."
Ha-ha-ha.
"It's just, you don't spend money like this when you're on them."
"- What are you saying, hm?"
- Nothing.
It's nothing.
Just having a good time with your friends.
Isn't that all right?
"Just because I'm sick from time to time, I can't have a good time?"
- That's not what I'm saying.
- We're having a good time.
See?
That jacket is gorgeous.
You see that jacket?
"It's beautiful, right?"
"Oh, my..."
"Oh, with the shoes."
"Oh, my God, it's perfect."
"Come on, baby."
Just try something on.
Try these on.
Wanna try these on?
They're really cute.
We'll get three of these.
We'll get one for you and one for Grace.
Let's get three of them.
"- Thanks, Robin."
You're awesome.
Slapped you!
"You probably think I'm finished, huh?"
!
"No, there's another one!"
"Oh, my God!"
"Don't worry, bitch, I didn't forget about you!"
There's a slap for you!
"Slap, slap, slap!"
"Yeah, there you go!"
"Here's a little ""reach around the back of the head"" slap!"
"Oh, God, please!"
"You have to get away, he won't ever stop!"
"Oh, I'm going slap happy!"
"# I'm goin' slap, slap happy #"
# Slappity slappin' you #
# Teachin' you a lesson for comin' in my house #
"What are you looking at, Robertson?"
!
They're here!
The audition results for the school musical are in!
"Hey, you got the lead, Wendy!"
- All right!
"- All right, Wendy!"
Who's the male lead?
"No surprise there, it's Bridon!"
"- All right, Bridon!"
"- Cool, Bridon!"
I get to be a stand-in!
"Congratulations, Bridon!"
Guess we'll be working a lot together!
"Yeah, great."
Goddamn it!
What else?
"Well, women like Sherri already know they're beautiful and desirable."
-You won't score points by telling her.
-Okay.
Don't be in a hurry to spill your guts.
She doesn't need your life story...
-... beforeyougetthe salad.
-Got it.
"As someone who knows your life story, I'd say she doesn't need to hear it at all."
"Right, right."
"I'll be cool, aloof, distant."
"She's here, she's here, she's here!"
What about the-
- What-
- What--
What about the kiss goodnight?
-Should I ask or just go for it?
-Go for it.
Don't wait until the last minute.
It creates pressure.
-Get it out of the way early.
-How early?
"After dinner, when you walk to the car..."
"... openherdoor,waitforher to say thank you..."
"... smile,leanin ,andkissher."
"Oh, nice."
"Hi, Alan."
You ready?
"You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen, and I don't deserve you."
That's another way to go.
-Madam.
-Thank you.
- Yeah.
"I thought we could chat for, say, 10 or 15 minutes."
John.
- I'm sorry.
Can I call you back?
"- No,you can't."
- I booked you a flight.
- What?
"It leaves Dulles for Columbus, Ohio at 1:45."
I tried to get you on the one to
"Charleston, but they're all booked up."
"So if you leave now, you'll just make it."
I can't.
I can't.
"It's Christmas Eve, John."
You shouldn't be alone.
I can't.
"Yeah, you can."
You know... when Mary got sick...
I couldn't help thinking... this isn't real.
I can stop this.
I know I can.
I can stop this.
"No one can stop it, John."
Listen to me.
Planes are going to crash.
Earthquakes are going to happen.
People you know and love are going to die... and no matter what that voice tells you... there's nothing you can do about it.
It's two years to the day.
He told me that she's goi ng to call.
He said that Mary's going to call.
He's lying.
Marjukka.
Your dad's about to die.
Who's stroking your hair now?
Who's enjoying my happiness?
I hope he's better Than I would've been for you
My heart still sings for her
My red-haired girl she is
Although you're not by my side
Let my thoughts come to you
Silence!
"In front of this congregation, I'd like to apologize to you, Jesse."
Your childhood was ruined because I studied plastic bags.
"Forgive me, Jesse."
I love you.
Dad...
-What?
The fire devil...
I've settled my score with him.
Really?
I'll be damned...
Then I can die in peace.
Can lemma mm my hand?
"Yes, she can."
"Bye then, grandpa."
Nice to die when it's not raining.
What next?
"Take good care of Jemina, will you?"
-I will.
She likes you.
She's like her Mom.
And her Dad.
Your flame is burning bright
"Hello, Goni."
I smell that wonderful soup of yours.
Gonki!
We're eating!
"I'm sorry, my darling."
How was your meeting with Alex?
Where did you meet?
At the theater cafe.
- And?
He asked me to direct a small insignificant play.
Do you know it?
"I know the playwright, that's enough."
I don't want to play anymore.
I hate that piano.
Why are you picking on the piano?
You don't have to practice if you don't want to.
"Still, he asked you to direct."
Yes.
In the basement hall.
That playwright is a disgrace.
Delicious.
Daddy made us such good soup.
"Gonki Galonki, why aren't you eating?"
Taste the soup.
I made you soup!
Did you see the doctor?
- Tomorrow.
I thought it was today.
You were wrong.
I'll pour Gonki Galonki some lemonade.
Now try the soup and tell me if it's good.
"Are you sick, Mommy?"
They said it was on the floor.
I didn't understand.
Really.
Please try to forgive me and understand.
I'm just new here.
It's my first day.
If I'd known it was down there...
You sure you'll be OK?
I'm really very sorry.
Please try to forgive me.
"If you need anything, just call me."
Anything you want...
I'll be outside.
"Phil, when you get a chance, take a look at this article."
It has been a day!
Dr. Jones is a piece of work.
Had me running back and forth.
I can't wait to get out of here.
No.
I'm talking about the one right there.
No.
"Look over there, girl."
Stop.
He's all right with me.
He's cute.
Of course he's cute.
That's why I'm telling you to look.
"You having a problem there, Jessica?"
Yes.
"I put my money in there, and it keeps eating my money."
I can see through their clothes.
This is weird.
- It.
Move.
Mother!
Let go.
Mother!
They do not touch to me.
"We go, walk."
You do not resist.
-You lower those hands.
Mother!
Paulino.
I am the Dr. Cicchirini.
Let go!
Mother!
I am innocent.
-Poor little bastard...
-It is a Judiciary error.
How it is going to be a judiciary error?
Paulino!
Paulino!
They are going away to cool meatballs.
Son mine!
Senorita.
Whereupon expensive you return to appear?
You have found another disease to arrange for me?
"No, no."
"Then, stop to bother me."
By the way?
"You know nothing of an ambulance, of a patient who flees?"
No...
"Better, because my fiancee spent three days in the jail before clarifying the misunderstanding."
If I discover who has been I twist the neck to him.
"- Robin, how could you?"
"No, she's right."
Maggie deserves some time to herself.
"Nobody likes to be alone, especially after a breakup, but that's when we discover who we really are and what we really want."
She deserves that.
OLDER TED:
"And kids, I meant that."
Which is why I'm not proud of what happened next.
It's around the corner.
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)
(MEN GROANING)
Hey.
"Maggie, sorry."
Class ran a little...
- Who's this?
- (CHUCKLES) This is Adam.
And it's so crazy.
We grew up next door to each other.
"God, we haven't seen each other since..."
- (LAUGHS) A long time.
- (LAUGHS) Yeah.
OLDER TED:
And then Maggie Wilks told us the second-greatest love story I've ever heard.
(ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING)
I just moved to town and I had to look her up.
(MAGGIE LAUGHS)
I guess we've got a lot of catching up to do.
Yeah.
"Yeah, of course."
OLDER TED:
"So, kids, I missed out on the ultimate girl next door to the guy next door."
"Well, see you next time."
Do you understand?
"May your knowledge rain upon Toni's bar, so the seeds of education and prosperity take root."
What do you want?
I saw mom in the supermarket.
- Attention!
Report to 08...
- Supermarket...
The last time I heard from her she was in Sweden.
That was the end of the seventies.
What would she be doing in a supermarket around here?
What do I know?
You imagined it.
Why would she suddenly just show up here?
Sweden is much too far away for a short visit.
But suppose I did see her.
You've got her mixed up.
I didn't get her mixed up.
Do you hear that?
"This singing, you hear that?"
Isn't that great?
It' s been going on for days.
Why can't everyone just leave me alone?
You'll get the file in the morning.
Alright?
Fine.
Shouldn't I come with you?
It's not necessary.
Too bad!
"A 1,000 Euro show."
"How come 1,000 Euros?"
What were you thinking?
Toni's 999 Euro show?
That's hilarious.
Get me some soup.
Yep.
Uh-oh.
"Thequestionis ,willthe  House pass the bill as amended?"
This is a 15-minute vote.
"Oh, my God."
My ass is killing me from that shot.
But I feel pretty good.
Really?
- Ma'am.
- What?
"Oh, boy."
Here we go.
It's like I want my baby to live.
I don't want my baby to die.
"Maybe think of it more of as a bill, which in a very real way is what it is."
- Mm.
- There's Pierce.
He even walks dumb.
"Every time I see him, I hear circus music."
"Come on, Owen."
"It's your time to shine, you dim fucking bulb."
- He voted no.
We lost the vote.
- Oh!
We are victorious in defeat.
We may allow ourselves a brief period of rejoicing.
"Okay, so I lost the vote."
I won by not winning.
"God, I don't know how I feel."
"Apart from, like, having a raccoon take a shit in my head."
"But when the lights came back on, it was the donkey who was taking a shower!"
"Oh, my goodness!"
Why would I do that?
Ha ha!
"And right behind you, there was danger!"
"- Oh, man."
- You were paralyzed!
It was a donkey-eating waffle.
"It was packing heat, and it wanted revenge."
I want revenge!
The donkey ran.
But how far can you run when you are on a plate covered in butter wearing a pink tutu?
- No!
- And a sombrero.
- No!
- And a coconut brassiere!
And about to be eaten alive!
"No, please!"
"Please, I'll switch to pancakes!"
- Aah!
"- Num, num, num!"
And the donkey was never seen again.
Hoo hoo hah hah hah hah hah!
But what Puss didn't know is that right behind him was the one thing he feared more than anything else.
- No.
You wouldn't.
- I would.
- You didn't!
- I did!
No!
Anything but that!
No!
Maybe if he wasn't so handsome...
Which one?
Both.
How can I compete with that?
You had a world-famous TV star and a hunk that drives a truck.
He drives a truck.
"Well, morning's no slouch."
Ah.
She's probably twice as old as both your guys.
"Even so, that body, those big tits..."
"Oh, you did very well, my friend."
I suppose.
You did.
And now it's time to put all that behind us.
We agreed... fresh start.
Fresh start.
Right?
Clean slate.
Clean slate.
What?
What are you thinking about?
Your dirty slate.
Yo.
"Matt, I just got off the phone with Diane's lawyer."
"Oh, fuck."
He told me about the D.U.I.
The D.U.I. with the kids in the car.
"Got to say, didn't see that coming."
It's bullshit.
I was so not drunk.
Believe me...
I've driven drunk.
-(overlapping chatter)
"What do you think of your old squad, huh?"
I hate to admit it-- you look almost human.
(laughter)
Pass the glasses around.
"Listen, you want some cigars?"
-Anything you want.
-(overlapping chatter)
"Here you are, pappy."
"Say, pretty classy, pretty classy here."
-Yeah.
"-Oh, I was going to get a whole floor, but some maharaja beat me to it."
(laughs)
TUBBY:
"Doing all right for a PFC, boy."
PFC?
"Look alive, Tubby."
That was ten years ago.
"A lot of things must happen, you know, in ten years."
(laughter and overlapping chatter)
"Hey, hey, if you're not used to it, that's champagne."
Take it easy.
"Yes, I'll, uh, I'll have to go easy."
I've got a big day at the office tomorrow.
Office?
"Working at an office, huh?"
Good boy.
"Gave up driving a truck, huh?"
"Sure, he's got his own company-- Morgan Truck Lines."
Morgan Truck Lines?
Mm-hmm.
That big transcontinental outfit?
You still want to play charades?
Yeah.
I got to go.
(laughs) Really?
Mm-hmm.
Parker.
"You know, I can help you, Doc, with your ex."
(chuckles)
"No, you can't."
"Oh, yeah, I can."
I need to go home and check my judgment.
It's about Wickes again?
You were right about the tell.
He looked at that photo for a reason.
"Yeah, he did."
That's not enough.
"So, you were wrong about the guy."
No one here likes you any less.
"I want to stop running, Gibbs."
Really see the people around me and not just blurs as I fly by.
Really see them.
I just don't know if I can.
Not yet.
"I'm here, Doc."
I know.
(clears throat)
"== sync, corrected by elderman =="
Previously on Dance Academy...
Our problem is with your kind.
You're a second-year in a first-year leotard and we don't like the second-years.
"Even if there was a moment, we've probably missed it, so there's no point in..."
A jam in Los Angeles.
-Let me...
-No hydraulic fluid
-for the platform lifts.
-This is ridiculous.
You guys are making me laugh.
You call yourself truck operators.
"-What's your dram, hydraulic fluid?"
-Yeah.
"-Yeah, what are you driving, diesels?"
-That's right.
"Well, you simply drain the lube fluid out of the hitch gearbox, transfer it to the hydraulic lifts."
Look alive!
Stop jamming up the works out here!
-Get going!
-(phone ringing)
"-BILKO: $10,000 a year?"
"-Oh, $10,000."
That's nothing.
That's just the beginning.
You're worth a fortune to me.
"-Hello, hello!"
-I'm calling about the Dawson figures.
-What?
!
-Dawson figures-- I have to have 'em right away.
I got to get downstairs and sign some papers.
"-(overlapping chatter, phones ringing)"
-Go to it!
The Dawson figures.
What about the Dawson figures?
-(phone ringing)
I owe a lot of money.
I can't pay him.
Pay who?
A loan shark.
Why?
Because I wanted to get my family out of here.
I didn't want my daughters in this town anymore.
You borrowed money for your daughters?
Stop...
What's wrong with you?
What is it?
What's wrong?
Two months ago I found a brick.
At the Point.
A brick of what?
Tobacco?
Heroin.
You know what that is?
How much did it weigh?
One kilo.
What did you do with it?
I sold it.
What did you do with the money?
I spent it.
On what?
The car outside.
Do you think that's why they killed your daughters?
I don't know.
They came here for their money.
"They took the washing machine, the fridge, the television..."
"If I don't pay, they'll take the car and the boat."
We'll have to move away.
"If you're happy, I'm happy."
Don't you feel well?
Is your boss treating you all right?
Forget it.
"Hey, you speak Italian?"
Hide this for me!
Next week I'll come and get it!
"Abbandando, meet my nephew!"
How's business?
"It's good, it's good."
Fanucci's mad.
Says the neighborhood's getting sloppy.
"People don't pay on time, don't pay the full amount."
Says he's been too nice to everyone.
So Fanucci's changing?
Sure.
He wants double from everybody.
Even from my father.
"I'm a friend, right?"
So you'll let him work here?
I've got some bad news.
I feel rotten about telling you this...
But Fanucci...he's got a nephew...
And you have to give him my job.
"You've always been good to me, ever since I came here."
You looked after me like a father.
I thank you.
And I won't forget it.
Vito!
"Oh, no!"
Take this to your family.
Thanks anyway.
"- Beautiful, isn't it?"
- Milan is amazing.
It'll change our lives.
Who is it?
It's Mario.
Guess where we are?
What?
I'll call you this evening.
Problems at work?
"Optimism, Silvia!"
- Yuck!
- Darn it!
- WELCOME TO THE SOUTH -
You can't do anything?
I've been working there for 15 years!
You promised!
You know I was counting on it.
I understand.
"It's not fair, though."
Bye.
Shoes!
"Naples: gunfire downtown,"
Minister Maroni in visit to the regional capital.
"102 deaths since the year began, 1,300 in the last ten."
It's as if an entire village were erased from the map.
- What is it?
- No transfer to Milan.
What?
Someone disabled got the job.
"To live in Milan, a person has to be handicapped?"
"They have priority, it's only right."
"Wasn't your friend ""Leave it to me"" Mario helping you?"
Liz:
The drug will take her soon.
Narcan.
Heroin antidote.
All the agents looking for you have it.
"[Gasps, coughing]"
"Liz Kenyon, you killed Kevin Whitfield, didn't you?"
I took him to protect him.
"Yeah, well, now I'm taking you."
[Police radio chatter]
[Handcuffs click]
James:
Just breathe.
Just breathe.
So why would you ever promise those parents you'd find his killer?
Because...
"They believed in him so much that it made me believe in him, too."
[Young woman coughs]
You're a hell of a lawman.
"Thank you, son."
So are you.
But I got to ask you to stay away from Gracie...
Until I figure this out.
Figure what out?
She's my granddaughter.
She misses me.
Yeah.
Because you died.
Just give me some time with this.
[Bell jingles]
[Sighs]
"So, this is Peng's."

"I'm sorry, I..."
Wait.
Please!
I'm Adam.
Patricia.
You must be his friend.
You must be his son.
"Come in, then."
Can I get your opinion on something?
What's wrong with this picture?
You want me to say she looks fat?
Would you say she looks at ease?
She's smiling.
You think?
I'd say that was a smile.
She's uncomfortable.
Self-conscious.
"Then, why did she do it?"
I'll call you.
HE SIGHS
I should...be getting back to work.
"So, what is it that you do, Patricia?"
I'm a journalist.
"Oh, so you work together."
"He really hasn't told you anything about me, has he?"
"I bet he hasn't talked about me much, either."
So we should be equally insulted.
"Well, maybe he's being cautious."
You've been seeing each other for over a year now.
Then he has told you something?
BY EVERY OTHER ONE IN THE COUNTRY.
"WHY, IT'S JUST ANOTHER MURDER."
I SUGGEST THAT THE LIFE OF A HUMAN BEING
IS NOT BENEATH YOUR CONSIDERATION.
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL GET ONTO IT MYSELF.
JON?
MAY I REMIND YOU
THAT YOUR FIRST EDITION IS ON THE STREET AT 7 P.M.?
ALL I'VE GOT LEFT IS THE FINAL.
I'LL PUT THIS ON PAGE 2.

HOW ABOUT PICTURES?
I'LL SEND THE MEN OUT RIGHT AWAY.
Kyne:
AND I'LL SEND YOU A SPECIAL LETTER OF COMMENDATION.
"NOW, GET OUT OF HERE, BOTH OF YOU, AND GET TO WORK."
DO YOU WANT ME TO FEATURE THIS THING ON MY TELECAST?
"ED, I'M REAL JUMPY."

SOMETHING THAT'S TAKEN A LIFETIME OF BRAINS AND GUTS TO BUILD...
"AND IN ALL THAT LIFETIME, I FIND I'VE MADE ONLY TWO BIG MISTAKES."
"WELL, I'M SURPRISED THAT YOU ADMIT TO THAT MANY."
- Sorry.
- I'm sorry.
I didn't mean--
- Don't bother.
It's not worth it.
What do you think?
It's not very good.
It's not very...

"It's not your fault, you know."
It really isn't.
"You'd better go home, Mrs. Cole."
Exterior train.
Station.
"A full moon, a clear sky."
A man sits by the shore.
There has been a quarrel.
A woman is walking away from him.
Now she turns back.
"""I didn't mean what I just said."
"And, anyway, you said worse."""
It was a declaration.
"- ""Stupid bloody fool"" was good."
Did you think of that beforehand?
"Are you trying to pick a fight with me, Mrs. Cole?"
No.
What I'm trying to say is that... if all of this stopped... the sparring and the jibing and the insults and the arguments...
I'd miss it.
"Even if I were dead,"
I'd still miss it.
The Catrin Cole School of Dialogue.
On and on and on and on and on.
What do you mean?
Have you heard of the killer Chou Lien-chan?
Chou Lien-chan
"No, and I have no quarrel with him"
He's chief disciple of Tiger Yeh
"You killed Tiger Yeh, and he'll come for you!"
It's been 30 years-why bring that up?
Show me your stuff before you die

You're playing this for real!

"What is it, Ah-fang?"
The boss is waiting for you in the vineyard
He's the district attorney there.
"All right, we'll handle it."
Anything else?
The last name.
It's gotta be done on Friday.
That's the 13th.
Friday the 13th.
It'll be done the following day.
Some of the boys think it's bad luck to take a contract for the 13th.
We can't push our luck.
"Sorry I can't ask you to stay, Lew."
Gotta get dressed for a dinner.
"Next time, for sure."
Hi.
Come on in.
"I'm Lynn Harper, Mr. Gordon."
Thanks for coming.
I wanted to welcome my new neighbours.
I'm glad you believe in being neighbourly.
Always.
"Come, I'll introduce you to my husband and his brother."
Then we'll have dinner.
Lead the way.
Open the valve.
"Excellent dinner, Mrs. Harper."
Everything was delicious.
Thank you.
And it's Lynn.
"I understand you're in the lumber business, Mr. Gordon."
- Right.
- Does that mean trees or...?
No.
Splendid.
That's exactly what we're going to do.
- Mumsie!
- I have it all worked out.
- I've recced his barge.
- Wrecked his barge?
!
"No, Reconnoitred."
He lives on a barge.
"- But, Mumsie..."
- Shh!
Hello?
Are you that Dennis creature?
This is Flora Ransom here.
I have your money.
Come and collect it at 7:30 tomorrow night.
"Now, you get the pills, I'll prepare the trunk."
"""Solder wire to hole marked Z."""
And that's that.
- Wonderful.
- Whatever's that?
"That, my friend, is the bomb completed."
Now for the gunpowder.
Get out my Indian army colonel with the overdraft clothes.
(Doorbell)
Mr MacGregor?
My name is Lord Mayley.
- Yes?
- We haven't met before but you're said to be a very decent sort.
- You're very kind.
- I'm sure you agree that we should help each other.
- How much do you want?
He'll be coming soon then.
Though I hope that's after the bill is passed through.
Why do you look so weak?
Eat some of the chicken that you love and be strong!
Prosecutor Kim Young Joo is so pitiful.
I know Chairman Cheon Jae Man too...
That person did that...
There is no trustworthy person in this world.
Everything is pitiful.
Everything is scary.
Unnie take this.
What?
This is a man's?
Give it to Go Ki Joon!
Go Ki Joon!
?
Did you change to Go Ki Joon!
?
Unni... do you not have any sense?
You and Go Ki Joon go well together.
Me and Go Ki Joon ssi?
You two date.
I came for Da Hye's tutoring.
Go in.
Is this what you came to find?
You really are fearless.
Even entering the President's study.
It seems you don't know when to stop.
Stopping...
Doesn't quite suit me.
Let me ask you one question.
What is the reason that you're doing this?
That's what I just said.
"Where did he get it, right here?"
So why are we here?
Johnny Cannata and Frank Doss own this hotel.
Why would they kill a comic?
I don't think they did.
FBI has had them under surveillance.
"Price was involved with Cannata and Doss, very tight."
Silent partner?
We don't know.
Let's go nose around.
How was fishing?
Rainy.
Hi.
Someday I'm gonna be wearing threads like that.
Mrs. Noogman.
"Yeah, definitely his better half."
Where's Miami's favorite mouth?
I don't care.
I got an agent.
I'm a singer now.
I ran into Annie downstairs.
Said she saw a cocktail waitress named Dorothy Bain... head up here with Morty Price about 4:00 this morning.
What's your connection with Miss Bain?
We're acquainted.
"She's a sweet kid, Sonny."
You'd like her.
She's got a cute little boy.
Yeah.
I'd like to meet her.
You know where we can find her?
My lips are sealed.
That's all.
"Keep an eye on them, Seymour."
"Company, attention."
Fall out for five minutes.
"Oh, Quigley."
Come here.
I've already warned you a couple of times this week.
Look at yourself.
"Well, what's your excuse this time?"
Walking around on my knees to give my arches a rest.
Let me see your hands.
Ever try using soap and water?
Let me see the other one.
I thought so.
You heard what Mr. Jeffries said.
That's your last warning.
If you're late again you'll be dismissed.

"""Coming:"
"Edward G. Robinson in Dark Hazard. """
- We've gotta get a load of that guy.
"- Yeah, he's not bad."
You got a Mickey Mouse on the bill today?
"No, not today."
"What, no Mickey Mouse?"
"- No, no Mickey Mouse."
- Why?
He's making a personal appearance in Jersey City.
"Oh, you're trying to kid somebody, huh?"
I totally forgot to order it without peppers.
Yeah.
Even though I told you seconds before that I hated green peppers.
- My head still must be a little fuzzy.
- Must be.
So what kind of food does Bo like?
- Nothing special.
She seems like someone who'd like a good steak.
- Maybe.
- What's Bo's favourite restaurant?
We don't really eat out much.
...We..?
- Yeah.
"""We"" this, ""we"" that."
"You're pretty much right in there with Bo, huh?"
"Right by her side, day in, day out."
Yeah.
"You know, we're kind of a team."
Is that healthy?
"I mean, don't you want to branch out on your own one day so that both of you can flourish?"
- Yeah.
"You know, you're totally right."
I'm actually planning on going back to school and getting my law degree.
"Oh, law."
- That's so great.
- Yeah. it's so great.
- Gotta pee.
- Okay.
"Oh, jeez."
"On, shit."
"Oh, my God."
"On, God."
"Well, open the door!"
Okay.
"Hi, Wilbur, how are you?"
I'm in no mood to get engaged today.
"Do you feel all right, Wilbur?"
I'm fine.
"What's on your mind, baby?"
"Well, Mrs. Brendan wanted to see you in her office right away."
Why?
She didn't say.
I'll walk back with you if you want me to.
"Okay, but no swans."
No swans.
Get my coat!
"Sure, sure."
Skeets!
Yes?
(WHISTLING)
Nothin'.
Wilbur's a very remarkable boy.
"In this day and age, it's so difficult to rear a child properly."
Yes.
I wouldn't give you 10-to-1 on a boy like Wilbur living to grow up.
"Oh, that's a little on the pessimistic side, Mr. Hoolick."
"All right, I'll make it 8-to-1."
"Oh, really."
"Here he is, Mrs. Brendan."
"Hello, Mrs. Brendan, did you want to... (STUTTERING)"
Surprised?
Of course he is.
I've had a hard time catching up with Wilbur.
Now you have him back safe and sound.
Here you go.
Brittany Gold.
Get out of the car.
I'm sorry about the tape.
Don't worry.
"Billy won't show it to anyone, especially not your wife."
Karl Stoltz is dead.
"You know who that is, right?"
Did you really think
I was going to let a bitch like you set me up?
I'm really sorry--
You know what?
I could run you in right now for the vials of shit that I know you have on your person.
- Fucking bitch!
- Aah!
Chain in or out?
"In, please."
"All right, listen, I don't know who's going to be there today, okay?"
- Yes.
- I need you on your A game.
- All right?
- Okay.
Laser focused.
Okay?
- Pee less.
- Right.
"Also, please learn how to tie your own tie because you're a grown-ass man."
"- Oh, well."
- [sigh]
"I'm so proud of you, sis."
What are you--
What the fuck is wrong with you?
10!
10!
- 10 cardboards!
- Wonderful!
- Ugye?
- Great!
It was worthy.
"We struggled for him, but was worthy."
Where is the kind Tót?
He was it here yet before.
- Lajos.
- Daddy!
Do not sleep eternally.
#Girls!
Respectthe lad well.#
"I am glad that you have a so good mood, my dear Tót."
"I do not know it, how I shall express my gratitude."
"- Come on, major lord."
"- But yeah, yeah."
- I'm happy and satisfied.
- I am glad.
I say only so much that was Helebrant second lieutenant till now my room-mate.
"But, if I return onto the front, the your dear Gyula your son gets into his place."
"This is beneficial because it surrounds the schoolhouse, a guard doubled where I live."
Oh my God.
"For my son, good man like this his commander."
We thank you.
Kind angel.
Oh what are you doing?
!
Na!
Mariska!
I told them not to come.
There wasn't any point if you weren't there with me.
[soft guitar music]
A girlfriend!
"Hey... oh, right."
A girlfriend among us!
We have been infiltrated!
Hello. [laughs nervously]
"Oh, my bros, my bros, my bros!"
This place is too dope!
They can't let it last!
There's only one option left.
Get the Kool-Aid.
[men cheering] Yeah!
Now mix it with the vodka.
"Quickly, now."
"Shots, my bros!"
It is the only way.
[slamming podium] We must do shots!
[men clamoring]
"Shots, shots, shots, shots!"
"The younger bros first, then the eldest."
Do you want to get out of here?
"Well, you... you don't want to hang out with Mike anymore?"
Uh...
"Oh, mother, mother, mother, mother, please."
"No, let's..."
let's go back to my place.
- Okay.
- Um... ♪ ♪
Let's go back to our place.
- Okay.
- He'll be fine.
- Jackass!
- Stop calling him that.
- Climbing in places like that?
- He got a good person killed!
- It was an accident.
Peter... a cop died!
There was no intention.
"In fact, he tried to stop her."
You're defending him.
He was just trespassing.
It was a sad and tragic accident.
I think you're minimizing just a little.
I have to get to work.
Can we talk about this later?
- Or we could not talk about it at all.
- Mel...
No.
I'm just surprised you feel that way.
"Alright, buddy, much as I love spending time with you, where the hell is this bar?"
Where is Natasha?
Um...
She works at this bar...
She works...
"The bar is, uh  somewhere."
"Hey, you and Natasha,"
- you sure she's going to want to see you?
"- Dude, she loves me."
She never judged me.
- Worst thing I ever did...
- Dumped her?
Yeah.
"The thing is, you don't know."
You don't know.
So stop saying that you know.
- Okay.
- [Knuckles Cracking]
"It's okay that you have moods, Clark."
I'm not afraid of the different sides of you.
I love all of you.
"The world is an ugly place, Martha."
"And it is full of brutish... cruel, nasty people."
[Sighs]
I heard something on the recording from Gaad's office.
Is he in more trouble?
He's probably gonna lose his pension.
Maybe even go to jail.
- You shouldn't feel sorry for him.
"- Well, how can I not?"
- Martha...
- This is tearing him apart.
Martha.
- Gaad is not your friend.
- [Click]
"[Gaad] Oh, come on, guys."
Martha's ugly.
[Men Laughing]
I'd have to be 10 scotches deep before I touch her.
[Agent] Eew. 10 scotches and a bag over her head.

Bastards.
I know.
I know.
[Crying]
I can smell it.
"You know, somehow Dawson and Skagway and... even California seem like places I've just heard of."
Seems as if I've lived out here in this wilderness forever.
Other people and other places... never existed.
But there's one thing I do remember... and that's a very kind and wonderful man.
I wonder what Buck sees in the fire.
"What are you thinking of, Buck?"
"Well, he's probably remembering more than thinking."
Remembering back to the time when he was more wolf than dog.
When there was only one law- the law we were just talking about.
"It's getting late, Jack."
Think I'll say good night.
"Not guilty, Your Honor."
Cabin!
- The tree!
- The mine!
"Oh, boy!"
"Hey, somebody pinch me."
That does it.
It's just as it was in the letter.
"My, oh, my, oh, my."
I do declare.
Hey!
"Hey, boss!"
Boss!
"Come here, quick."
Hmm.
Look at this.
"Oh, my."
Oh.
"Lookit, lookit!"
Tell me if I'm dreamin'.
"Here, you three can go."
Allez!
Let him go!
"You ""reviendras""?"
You will come back and see me?
Leave them in peace!
"- But, Officer..."
- Sit down and leave them in peace!
- Evening.
- Bonsoir.
"Next time, vous ne sortez pas sans passeport!"
- Sorry?
- Don't go out without passport!
"- Ah yes, passport..."
- Mon amour!
"- Go and call a taxi, I'll wait for you here."
"- Yes, bonsoir!"
"- Excuse me, the Hotel de Bon Commerce?"
- Hotel du Bon Commerce?
- You know it?
"- Yes, Boss."
"Via des Beaux Arts, near the Place des Abbesses."
"- Ah yes, Abbesses Place."
- If you could write...
Shouldn't we call a doctor?
You should start by not fighting all the time.
"She's got indigestion, that's all!"
- Where have you been?
- With Gremier.
"I wanted to come back sooner, but the car broke down."
That'll teach you to go out with the first people you meet on the street.
"They're not the first people I met on the street, they're..."
"Look, I've never met anyone like me before."
"Apart from the first time, and that was mostly fighting him off."
Badly.
Please.
No-one's ever taught me how to do this.
"Adam, here's the thing, right?"
I don't care.
"Yeah, like I want to hang out with some whiffy Goth anyway."
Excuse me?
Just cos you're a vampire doesn't mean you have to smell like the undead.
"One word, Mitch."
Deodorant.
Tch!
"- Oh, good."
You two have met.
- He's just leaving.
You want to watch yourself with this one.
She's been giving me the glad eye ever since I arrived.
- Loves a bit of fang.
- I do not!
That is a terrible thing to say.
I do not like a bit of fang.
"Not his fang, or anyone else's."
"Er... you know, I'm not ruling it out."
Just if the right fang came along.
But I haven't even thought about it.
At all.
For ages.
Oh.
"OK, ladies."
I'll catch you later.
Can we?
"It's when you give, you know, her being allowed to sleep with one person and that's it, no questions asked."
Another plausibly fruitful option.
New GTA and COD out today.
We're going to sesh.
- Been gaming much?
- Always gaming.
- You?
- Just gamed.
Stimulating morning game.
Evening game will eclipse.
I gamed a 4:00-to-4:00 shift last night.
You're gaming taxi driver's hours?
I gamed a 10:00-to-4:00 shift today.
Gaming banker's hours.
I'll probably game a 5:00-to-7:00 shift now.
Cing a Sept.
Nous aussi.
You guys wanna hit up a happy hour?
We're gonna hit another happy hour.

"- Glen, how are you now?"
- Good and you?
- Not so bad.
"- Well, I guess the teddy's out of the tickle trunk on this one, too."
Plus he's scared shitless of me.
We pay four large.
Cost of business.
Take it out of his payroll.
"And it's only his first dealing rap, so worst case scenario?"
"They plead him out, he does five months picking up litter in an orange jumpsuit."
So who goes inside?
I don't need them seeing my face.
"Well, I don't need them seeing my face."
Why not?
You look like his typical clientele.
Dick.
Fine.
We'll flip for it.
Call it.
Heads.
Mayhew?
Mr. Mayhew?
Mr. Mayhew.
Nice of you to come down.
Please.
Look at you.
Should I call the FBI and tell them I found DB Cooper?
Joking.
"Please, come on."
Come on.
Please.
Hello.
Saul Goodman.
Please sit.
So it's a shame that we have to meet under these circumstances.
I believe you have something for me?
Ugh.
"Oh, I do not want this vacation to end."
"Promise me when we get home, we'll only speak French to each other."
"Oh, ce sera comme nous sommes sur notre propre île privée au paradis."
I was kind of hoping for English with a fake French accent.
But of course.
I had such a good time.
Mm.
And you are really sexy.
"You put the ""moan"" in Mona Lisa."
- Me?
- Mm-hmm.
"You put the ""oomph"" in arc de triomphe."
Ooh.
You put your hands in my pants at the Louvre.
"I know that that's not what we're doing right now, but it was fun."
Yeah.
It was all fun.
"Yeah, it was."
And you know what the best part was?
What?
No Mansfield.
"I mean, you blew off opening a new office in Hong Kong to go to Paris with me, and your boss didn't even call or e-mail or text."
He fired me.
Take a look!
Take a look!
300 workers illegally held 300 workers illegally held

Whoever can bring me the head of Fei
Will be my sole adopted son!
Still want to take Barry's place?
"- Get out of here, Barry."
- I'll go get a teacher.
You want to go?
"I'm not gonna fight you, Dirk."
Why not?
You chicken?
Come on!
No.
Get up!
Get up!
- Come on!
Get up!
"- Hey, get back!"
Get back.
That is enough.
"So long, Barry Cook."
You all right?
Barry was my friend.
I just burned his bones.
"Well, he's at peace now, Sam."
"I mean, if dad had let us stay just a little while longer, maybe I chould have helped the kid, you know?"
You read the coroner's report same as me.
Barry was on every anxiety drug and antidepressant known to man.
School was hell for that kid.
His parents had split up.
He just wanted out.
"It was tragic, but it's not your fault."
"To tell you the truth,"
I'm glad we got out of that town.
I hated that school.
It wasn't all bad.
It's...
L.A. You can wear whatever you want.
"Ok, I'll just grab my purse."
I'll get your heels.
"Well, hello to you, too."
Thought you said you had...
a meeting to go to.
What?
"You said you had... a meeting, remember when I texted you... earlier?"
"Oh, yeah."
"I did, but uh, but I'm done now."
"Oh, great."
"Hallie, what's up?"
What's going on?
What's going on?
I think I should be asking you that question.
Excuse me?
"What is going on, Dale?"
"Uh, nothing."
"Look, I'm just-"
"I'm, did I miss something here?"
Wait.
Do you like him now?
Is that it?
"Look, I'm just gonna leave."
All right?
Of course you are.
"Zach, you're a piece of crap you know that?"
You're just another famous asshole guy who thinks he can screw around with any girl he wants and then not call them.
Well... fuck you!
"We're not... even dating, Hallie."
I've told you that 10... times.
"Xiaotian, I love you!"
I'll wait for you!
Yawang!
Mother!
Father!
How is it?
Was it hard?
- Yes.
"- It's allright, no problem!"
"It's done, don't think about it anymore."
Let's go home and rest.
I have cooked some delicious food for you!
- You came too?
- Uncle asked me to come.
"I see, you forced to come."
"Yawang, I really miss you!"
Are you allright in the university?
"Sometimes, I think..."
"You have entered the university that you want,"
I have entered the military academy.
We are getting close to our perfect life!
"I told you, we will be together for not much time anymore."
Let's go for it together!
- I...
- Is the next stop is your school?
When yor class will be ended today?
5:40 p.m.
5:40 p.m?
I'll pick you up.
Let's watch a movie later!
I don't really like movie.
You don't?
"Oh, I shouldn't worry about that."
He's an actor.
"Unless you review them, have intercourse with them, or do both simultaneously, they don't remember you."
"Uh, ladies and gentlemen, it is my privilege to introduce you now to a young man to whom we all owe a great deal."
Soon we hand him back to the RAF for a very different kind of shooting.
"Until then, he is our very own American."
- Mr. Carl Lundbeck.
- Hi.
Hello.
"- Alex Frayle, director."
Hi.
Good to meet you.
Wyndham Best.
How do you do?
I'm playing Johnnie.
"Carl Lundbeck, Flight Lieutenant."
- Hi.
- Hello.
- Mr. Hilliard.
- If I've got the right--
Mr. Ambrose Hilliard.
Yes.
"Sir, I saw every Inspector Charnforth picture there ever was."
Just used to go right back and watch them again.
Oh!
"""You see, someone has made a mistake."""
"""A simple mistake, but easy to miss."""
Yes!
Oh!
"Sir, I need to wire my mom."
There's our secret weapon.
Now you write him in.
"His pride, my pride."
- Please.
- Enough talk.
Time to play the game.
Hello.
Hello-ah.
Friend of yours?
"It's Jonesy, open up!"
Get rid of him.
I'll be listening.
"Luke, Luke, what's going on?"
I've been calling you for hours.
"- Sorry, man."
"- Not a sound, people."
Thought it's gonna be some country house megabash.
"No, it's a total wipeout."
No one here.
Just a few losers.
"- Well, I may as well come and say hi."
"- Seriously, you don't wanna go in there"
"Seriously, I do."
I've been on the road three hours.
"20 pound carried from the station, treading through this mud, to follow your fucking GPS."
"Plus, I've got a shitload of gear that I'm supposed to be shifting tonight."
"Can't let you in, mate."
It's a private party.
Is this some kinda wind-up.
"What's going on, Luke?"
N-Nothing.
- Are you standing me?
- No.
"That's it, isn't it?"
Fear of bodily fluids.
I need a break.
Let's take a break.
Okay.
"Okay, I'll get him."
Richard.
Why don't you walk around in those and see how they feel.
- It's Peter.
- Hello?
"Oh, no."
Really?
"Well, did you call your mom?"
"Oh, right."
Damn.
"Well, can you make it through the day, Petey?"
Are you barfing?
Okay.
"Okay, let's see here."
"I don't get off until 6:00, and we are just slammed here."
It's a sale day.
But don't worry.
Someone will come and get you.
This is why we have neighbors.
"We're part of a community, Peter."
Does your mom make you do that?
"No, this is my own towel."
I bought it with my own money.
I have the whole set.
"See, this is the bath sheet... and this is the hand towel... and this is the washcloth."
- Isn't the washcloth cute?
- Yeah.
"When they hang on the rack, they go like this."
No more than five.
- I know a way in.
- No.
"No, your Abbess..."
- She doesn't need to know.
- She said they search every inch.
We can't.
There are inches Mother doesn't know about.
Ladies.
Everything all right?
Yeah.
This is...
Sister Marie.
- Miri.
- Since when do we bring strays home?
She's going to help hide our men at the Abbey.
Then she should be at the Abbey.
Why is she here?
She knows our plan.
I prefer not to let her out of our sight.
We'll need a car or a way to slow the Germans down.
The Abbey has a truck.
They take it to town on market days.
"I could ""borrow"" the keys."
When do you need it?
Walking freely is a privilege.
- Brilliant.
- Maybe now you will think twice before attacking.
Alfred's going to have to find a way out from the inside.
- How?
- I don't know.
He's going to need our help.
"Look, what do you want?"
"Look, I'll make any kinda deal with you."
What the hell do you want?
"Hey, listen, who put you up to this, huh?"
"That-that caputo guy, huh?"
Carmine caputo?
You're not gonna get away with it.
"Do me a favor, huh?"
Listen...
"Oh, Jesus Christ."
"You see the thing is, my friend needs the money you've taken out of his pocket all these years."
[Chuckling]
"Hey, hey punk, that's easy."
"Twenty, thirty thousand dollars..."
I'll give you anything you want.
"Just get me the hell down, ya hear?"
"Hey, hold it, hold it."
"Hold it, please."
Now where's your house?
"It's over in englewood, new Jersey... 26 ocean road."
How do I get in?
That's easy.
"I'll give ya key, huh?"
This one here is the front door.
The alarm system...
Be my guest.
Where's the safe?
"It's the first room, right behind the kitchen."
You can't miss it.
It's to the right.
What's the combination?
"No, wait a minute, okay."
You were the last one to see him.
Did you give him the suicide weapon?
-Me?
To commit suicide?
I'm from the insurance.
-That clears you.
Our company doesn't provide this service yet.
Excuse me.
Give me.
What was wrong with him?
Was he an alcoholic?
"No, acute leukaemia."
He only had a few weeks to live.
He was very scared.
Scared to tell his wife and afraid of total decay.
He couldn't handle the final weeks.
That's why.
Bang.
"This isn't possible, guys."
If only it had been a few days later.
Now we've been liberated.
Dorien.
Did I age that much?
-Ab!
I recognized you right away.
You didn't change a bit.
What a surprise.
Come in.
Were you working in the garden?
"-Yes, shall we sit there?"
I just made tea.
-Alright.

"Oh, shit, that's Dad's room."
Dad.
You!
You told me to go into the light.
- What?
"- Oh, yeah."
There was a light.
"I almost walked right into the goddamn thing, you ungrateful little shit."
You wanted me dead.
"No, no, no, no, no, no."
And I'm a freaking five?
I said you were making a comeback.
I'm a goddamn ten.
I'm just...
I'm just glad you're alive.
"I know you are, kid."
I'm just breaking your balls.
Look at this.
I've been up ten minutes.
Already my Tinder is blowing up.
"Yeah, all right."
"- How do you feel, Mr. Farrell?"
- Never better.
These comas are a dynamite way to catch up on your sleep.
I might need another one in a couple of months.
Being single is exhausting.
"If anyone asks, say we're looking for treasure."
Imagine I ask you:
"- ""What are they here for?"""
- Treasure.
It could mean trouble.
Not at all.
What a beautiful village!
"Yes, it's very beautiful."
You've hidden it well.
We haven't hidden it!
The ancestors built it here.
It was them then!
They built it like this so no one would steal it.
"Tell me, why do you think they built it here?"
Because I wasn't there.
You weren't here before then?
Did you arrive recently?
I think the car has a problem.
It's stalling.
It struggles on hills.
The gauge isn't working.
"Yes, it has a problem."
"Farzad, get out."
- ls there water here?
"- Yes, over there."
"Get out, guys, and check the car."
Try to find out what's wrong.
Has your car broken down?
Our car?
It's given up the ghost.
Meaning?
It can't go on.

"-Quick, what is it?"
-A little memento.
"We fly from such a great distance, with a noble mission."
and you steal in a supermarket.
That makes 3625 crowns and 50 hellers.
-Thank you.
-All right.
Hello.
What does this mean?
We can't figure out the process in which this works.
-Can you give us some advice?
-What is in the can?
Great.
But we can't see in there.
"Do you have matches, doctor?"
No!
"Jeez, it's petrol!"
Where did you get it?
This must go immediately!
-What if someone saw you?
-It was lying in front of the house.
Unattended.
"The man who owns this, saved a long time for it."
-Worked.
Went without food.
-Really?
Someone stole my car!
Someone stole my car!
Someone stole my car!

Someone stole my car!
I've been saving all my life!
That's very interesting.
Doesn't somebody get intelligent and realize children must grow up their own way?
The mind's nothing to do with it.
It's your feelings.
Kids get born and you just worry about them and you hope for them.
"Well, I gotta get going."
"- Good night, Nellie."
"- Good night, Allison."
Hello?
"Oh, hello, Mother."
I've been thinking it over.
You can invite anyone you want to your party.

It's been there for months.
We gotta hide!
"You know, hide?"
"It's when you-- You know, when you--"
"Just get behind something, quick!"
We took him to a relative
Why'd he do it?
"I don't smell booze on him, but he's not talking."
Could be high on something.
How else could he end up like that?
What the hell happened?
"How's it going, Sergeant?"
I'm his uncle!
Let go of me!
Rotten bastard.
Couldn't he use GPS?

Hi.
How are you?
"You may not be aware, but Stephanie is, uh-- she's recently divorced."
"Oh, well, that got to the point."
To the--
"Oh, you're setting us up."
It was my idea.
I know.
"But at some point, I thought, ""Why be coy?"""
She's right.
"I mean, you're both single, you're both smart and nice."
Smart and nice.
Wow.
"Stephanie, can I offer you a refill?"
- Yes.
Thank you.

I'm not to talk to papers.
I'm not to let no one in.
I'm not from the papers.
I'm from the Ministry of Information.
The Film division.
Film?
And then you went to Dunkirk?
We meant to.
But the engines stopped five miles out.
Broken bearing.
We never got there.
"But in the paper...it said, you got home troops."
This steam tug on it's way back gave us a tow.
Soldiers spilling' over the rails.
"So we pulled someone in, see."
Someone seen us docking' and put it in the paper.
They got the wrong end of the stick.
Didn't they?
"Dad said, we'd be a laughin' stock."
"Said, ""You mustn't tell the papers""."
But you write in the papers.
For the pictures?
Can Lily ask you somethin'?
Yes.
Have you ever met Robert Donat?
The famous actor?
No.
"No, I haven't I'm afraid."
Dad!
What are you doing?
Big Brother has such a tragic death
Can't I even make him an altar?
There's not enough space even for the living
Who cares about the dead!
You...
What?
What are you guys arguing about?
Don't you know that dad is sick?
"Brother Jin, please rest in peace!"
Hey!
What are you doing here?
Go away!

What secret?
"We shouldn't talk here, I'll wait for you at hillside"
Come here quick!
Come here!
Hey!

What secret?
You really want to know?
Since I asked you out
I'll surely tell you!
Someone wants to kill you!
Who?
Who dares to kill me?
Say!
This man is very skillful
I don't think you can handle him!

- I know‎.
Sorry‎.
I forget‎. ‎
How?
Here's 50.
Why are you doing all this for me?
Hurry up.
There's coffee if you'd like.
Laure!
"Laure, it's Gilou!"
- Calm down!
- How's it going?
"So, who was right?"
You switched your phone off?
"Sorry, I went back to sleep."
"I'm taking a shower, I'm coming."
"- Wait, I'll make some coffee."
- I don't have any left.
I'll see you at the office.
"See you later, then."
"Fuck, just what I didn't want to happen."
"You're entitled to a private life, aren't you?"
I don't know.
What?
How come you don't know?
- Aren't we serious?
"- Yes, we are."
"Anyway, I've got to go."
I'm taking someone in for questioning.
What kind?
The kind of dealer involved in settling scores in a squat.
A guy got hit in the lung by a bullet.
It went through the ceiling.
He is dead?
He'll survive.
- It's good to see you again.
- The feeling isn't mutual.
- You're not pleased to see your friend?
- We're not that close.
- He's been causing me a lot oftrouble.
- I'm here to sort it out.
Please sit.
I'll put on some tea.
- Don't bother.
- No need.
- Please be careful.
"- Take care,Jenny."
I know how to do it.
I won't hurt myself.
"Jeffrey, take care ofyour friend, meanwhile."
"Make yourselfat home, Dumbo."
"I am, Mickey Mouse."
"Ma'am, why are you so concerned about the garbage?"
He paid me a thousand bucks to keep you talking.
Don't leave now!
I haven't had this much fun in 20 years!
- You're going to lose this game.
- Am I?
Lets wait and see.
You're always the loser.
Not this time.
I'm well prepared.
Let's put your preparations to the test.
- Are you always so determined?
"- Yes, that's my style."
Mine too.
So we have something in common.
I think I can stand that.
[Greta snarling]
DAVE:
Scrub right here.
[Shower running]
[Monique gasps]
What the?
Oh well.
"Hey, this isn't so bad."
[Monique giggling]
"Dave, what's that?"
[Doorbell ringing]
I'd better see who it is.
I'm gonna check the breaker box.
The breaker switch jumped off for some reason.
"Hey, who was at the door?"
MONIQUE:
"Whoever it was, they left."
"OK, Richard."
"Stand there by the front, over there"
A little closer to the center.
That's about right.
"OK, now, I'm gonna kick the car out of gear."
"OK, you got it."
Can you hold it?
Yeah.
"Yeah, I can hold it."
I'm not gonna push it far off hill though.
"Well, uh, tell you what, now."
What I want to do is to kind of ease up on it a little bit.
"Like, you know, let it... as if you"
Were gonna let it roll forward and pick up a little momentum.
STAYNE:
I cannot fathom it.NYou are far superior in all ways.
RED QUEEN:
I know.
But Mirana can make anyoneNfall in love with her. (animals GRUNTlNG )
even the furniture.
Even the King?
I had to do it.
He would have left me.
is it not betterNto be feared than loved?
Not certain anymore.
let her have the rabble.Nl don't need them.
I have you.
They're wonderful.
You must let me try one on.
It is good to be workingNat my trade again.
It's just a pityNyou have to make them for her.
What is the hatter with me?
Hatter?
(chains rattling )
(THUNDER crashing )
Hatter.
Have you any ideaNwhy a raven is like a writing desk?
Alice.
I don't like it in here.Nlt's terribly crowded.
Have I gone mad?
I'm afraid so.
You're entirely bonkers.
But I'll tell you a secret.NAll the best people are.
Here.
That's better.
You look yourself again.
"I'm sorry, Mr Devereaux, but we get a lot of cars here and it's hard to keep track..."
- You mean the car is here now?
"- Oh, yeah."
It's right outside.
"They stole it right offthe street from you, huh?"
Goddamn.
"You're gonna have to pay the towing charge, you know."
"I was told these things happen in New York, but one never expects it."
"Yeah, well, that's New York."
Is this your first trip over here?
Yes.
"Where's my car, please?"
It's right over here.
You're lucky this time.
It's in perfect shape.
Not a scratch.
You must lead a charming life.
Henri.
Je vous attendais.
Let's go!
I wouldn't be surprised if I'd been followed.
"- Listen, I'll see you at Pop's tonight."
"- OK, babe."
Take care.
They got the bridge blocked off!
This is the police.
You're surrounded.
Come out with your hands up!
This is the police.
You're surrounded.
Give 'em the gas!
Hold your fire!
"Yes, Miss First Lady."
It's in my pocket next to my heart.
"You know, Mary Todd gave it to Lincoln to remind him he only had so much time to do good things while he was in that chair."
- I hear you.
"Well, kiss Amber for me, okay?"
I love you ladies.
Miss you.
- I gotta go back to being president.
- I love you too.
Did you know that 1.5 million people visit the White House every year?
"No, I did not know that."
"Look, I'm sorry."
I'm sorry that I didn't make it to your talent show.
I'm not.
Seriously.
Did you know the White House used to be called the Presidential Palace?
"Look, I need you to hear me right now."
Look at me.
I really wished I was there.
"No, you don't."
All I-
- All I did was twirl a flag.
It was stupid.
"You know that you don't have to do that with me, right?"
- What?
- Have thick skin.
You're 11.
- Good morning.
"- Good morning, sir."
- How are you?
"- Fine, thank you."
Yourself?
"L""m damn blissful."
"Pete is happy, Joan."
He loves you.
The two are completely separate issues.
My PI was right.
Marriage is a big sham.
- How old is she?
- Twenty-two.
"She""s the towel girl at the 24 Hour Fitness."
"For weeks, Pete was complaining:"
"""Why aren""t our towels as white as the towels at the gym?"""
"And then one day, not another word about towels."
"That""s when I knew."
- I guess I have to leave him.
- I would.
- No way.
- Brenda.
"You""ll just have to win him back."
"Women""s Club."
Same time every Tuesday.
When was the last time you and Pete had a date?
"We went to Tiffany""s soccer game on Friday night."
"A date, Joan."
"High heels, tight skirt, pretending to be the maid?"
"Joan is a grownup, not a Barbie doll."
She has real-life responsibilities.
- Pete needs to suck it up and be a man.
- Says a woman twice divorced.
"Look, Joan, is Pete being a prepubescent jerk?"
Yes.
"He""s a man in his 40s."
What do you expect?
It doesn't sit well with my policy of plausible deniability.
Let's get going.
I'll see you around.
"And by that I mean please, stay away from me."
"See you later, ghosts of staffers past."
"Madam President, I brought you Congressman Pierce."
"I brought him also, ma'am."
Richard Splett.
She already knows who you are.
You can go.
"No, no, no."
Not you.
Not you.
We're such big fans.
I'm a big fan of yours.
"Thank you, Madam President."
I am here to serve.
How can I help?
The president needs you to do something for her.
"And in exchange, she feels that you deserve a better job."
- Yes.
- Thank you.
"Ambassador, perhaps."
How does that sound?
Ambassador?
Me?
"Oh, wow."
Not what I was expecting.
What's your favorite city?
Dallas.
"I love Dallas, Texas."
"No, it needs to be a foreign city."
"Uh, we knowwhat risks you've taken in inviting us here."
[Translator] I took no risk.
I am too old to be afraid ofwhat anyone thinks.
- [Mao Speaking Chinese] - [Translator] Don'tevertrustthem.
They nevertell the truth... or honor theircommitments.

- Vietnamese are like Russians.
Both are dogs.
"Mr. Chairman, there's an old saying in my country:"
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.
[Speaking Chinese]
[Translator] That has the added virtue ofbeing true.
"[Kissinger] Yourwritings have changed the world, Mr. Chairman."
[Translator Speaking Chinese]
- [Speaks Chinese] - [Translator] Bullshit.
My writings mean absolutely nothing.
[Mao Speaking Chinese]
[Translator] I want to knowyoursecret.
"[Kissinger] My secret, Mr. Chairman?"
[Mao Speaking Chinese]
How a fatman gets so many girls.
- Heh-heh-heh-heh.

"Thank-- Thank everybody, please."
"- Yeah, just let us know."
- Just let us-
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- If you get some more info.
- If there's an update.
- Yeah.
Um...
Guys.
"Look, this is the hard part."
Pete's gone.
"- Yeah, I know."
"- No, I mean, like, when someone is missing..."
"Hey, we've had more manpower on this than we've ever had looking for someone."
"I mean, I've got the fire department involved in looking for him and I hate firemen."
- No.
"- No, it means a lot."
- Yeah.
"- Ricky, thank you."
- No.
What Iâm trying to say is...
"You know, someone in Pete's condition?"
He didn't go anywhere.
He couldn't have gone anywhere.
He's gone.
He's in the river or something.
And it's hard when a body doesn't--
Doesn't turn up.
"Look, this isn't the first time I've had to have this talk, but... when it's people you know, it's hard."
"- What are you trying to say, Ricky?"
"- Horace, he's gone."
New York City.
"Relatives, you know."
Yeah.
"Well, you have a good time, anyway."
- Yes.
Is that my cheque?
- That is your cheque.
- Good.
"- Thanks, Saul."
- Shalom.
- Have a good time.
- I wonder how long he's been planning that.
- I don't know.
You heard him.
"Lena's been planning, he's been postponing."
"Hey, my new tux is in here."
He didn't even mention it. it's not on the bill either.
She must've really been anxious to get on that vacation.
I'm goin' that way.
"Come with me, pay him and we'll say goodbye to Lena."
"OK, that's a good idea."
- Here.
This'll keep you honest.
- Mac.
Will they keep the shop open while they're on vacation?
They might have someone part time to take orders.
Out of business?
"Hey, brahda."
Bet you'd like a ride to Diamond Head.
Ten bucks round trip.
Ten bucks?
"No, thanks."
X-rays are up.
"-C-spine clear, mediastinum looks okay."
-Very good.
-So where are you registered?
-What?
-Definitely have to.
-Could someone get SonoSite?
"My ex-wife didn't, we ended up with clocks."
"With my sister, salad bowls."
Seven of them.
Does anybody mind if we just focus on the patient?
"Okay, then."
"Can we have that SonoSite, please?"
Neela.
Can you get away?
-We need to go get a license.
-We don't know where to get married.
-We do.
Hospital chapel.
-When did we decide that?
"-You were busy, I thought you--"
-And Jerry's gonna marry us?
"Yeah, he has some kind of minister's license, so l-- ls that really who we want?"
"What's Frank gonna be, the ring bearer?"
We don't have a lot of time.
I had to make some choices.
-Are you gonna choose the flowers too?
"-No, no."
"But you like lilies, right?"
"-Michael, we have to talk."
-About what?
-l think this is getting a little-- Dr. Gallant.
You're so tall.
Get lost!
So sorry.
Goodbye.
"David, sit and eat with us."
I've to work.
Thanks.
Thank God having David here.
I'll never know how to deal with those members.
Like it?
We can change it till you like it.
Can you stop spending money to me this way?
"When you did something wrong, sent me gift."
Now you buy me a car.
So what?
I'm not that greedy.
You know how bad that makes me feel?
What?
Aren't I nice to you?
You just walked out on me.
Why did we've to split up?
You really want to know?
Tell me.
"You're ill-tempered, stubborn, give me no sense of security..."
"Ok, cut it out."
"You're not my cup of tea, ok?"
Then imagine me to be coffee.
"Milk tea, tea and coffee mix, anything."
"Michael, let's just be friends."
"It's all my fault, ok?"
"Lisa, is everything ok?"
This is your tea.
Not now.
- What's wrong?
- I don't know.
I keep it running perfect.
"It's Tony's sister, she did it."
She's as weird as he is.
"Tony, I command you to make this car run perfectly and continuously without interference from your sister."
I can't stop the car.
Tony's energizing it.
It's like your brother doesn't even know you.
- It's yo-yo.
Let's go!
- No.
Don't run.
You crazy?
You don't want to go to that school.
"Please, trust me."
"Now, come on, hurry."
"Hey, wait for me."
"Come on, you guys."
Get in there.
- Let's go!
"- Come on, get in."
I'm dreaming.
You're surrendering to the board of education?
"Sir, you see that car going down the street?"
- Yeah.
- My brother's in it.
He ought to be going to school.
You ought to catch up with him.
Another truant?
"Oh, boy, we're gonna have a load."
Okay.
Less gay it is.
Great!
"I'm gonna give Wes a call, see what he thinks of the glasses idea."
"Oh, Jack."
He has no idea what he just...
Anticlimax.
What's wrong?
My boyfriend back home thinks that college is gonna make me some sort of... sex robot.
Tell me about it.
Mine thinks it's gonna turn me into a brainwashed sex doll.
You know what?
We should teach them a lesson.
Yeah?
If they're gonna treat us like that... maybe we should just act like it.
Yeah!
"Okay, close your eyes."
You tricked me.
What are you gonna do about it?
- That.
- Ouch!
Not too hard!
Stop!
You stop!
"Oh, you're so sexy!"
I feel so much better!
Me too.
Pillow fights fix everything.
"You know, I heard that but I always thought it was a sham."
A pillow sham?
"Ooh, good one."
I've never done that before... with a girl...
I bet you anything he's well hung.
How do you know?
Did you see him?
You want a cookie?
Of course not.
You can tell from a guy's face.
And especially from his crotch.
I've got a sixth sense.
"He's friendly with Benigno, isn't he?"
Yes.
"He isn't a faggot too, is he?"
No way.
Are you nuts?
Are you insinuating Benigno's a faggot?
I'm not.
"It's vox populi, honey."
You're very wrong.
Dr. Vega confirmed it for me.
How would he know?
Alicia's father told him.
"I don't approve of him being so intimate with the patient, but Dr. Vega told me not to worry."
"Benigno doesn't like women, he's into men."
My God!
I'll leave so you can carry on pulling him to bits.
The poor thing likes Benigno.
"Good choice, sweetie."
Hey.
"Hey, Benigno."
I'm free tonight.
I'm going to the Cinematheque.
Want to come?
I'm meeting my editor.
Sparkly!
"Fine, you can't live with Elliot!"
"But you're not living with us, so get your crap out by Friday."
Friday?
Friday.
Friday's my birthday!
I've already e-vited everyone to a party at our place.
Whose place?
Your place.
"Look, I can't just un-e-vite everyone"
I've already got two e-yeses and twenty-four e-maybes.
That's a lot of e-sponses.
"Bambi, I'm gonna put my e-foot up your ass."
It's a Mexican-themed fiesta.
on the first anniversary of my 29th birthday.
That means I'm turning thirty!
Donde ?
56 Wallnut Drive.
Cuando ?
Thank you for asking ocho-thirty until upside-down question mark.
Sombreros at the door.
I'll be there.
Gracias amigo.
I borrowed one of your dictionaries!
"Since there were twelve surgical residents at Sacred Heart fighting for four attending spots,"
Turk was ass-kissing the senior staff.
"Oh, damn,"
I left my briefcase upstairs.
'Scuse me a second!
Turk thought he was the only one who heard that.
"Docteur Wen, docteur Wen !"
DR. WEN!
-Hi there.
-Hi.
"Just set it down there, OK?"
Are you studying the stars Miss Sylvia?
Exactly!
Thank you!
Oh my god!
God miss Sylvia?
Oh add out 20 percent.
"Very good, thank you."
"I'm falling asleep I'm tired, I'm falling asleep and you're boring me to death."
"Please don't die, I know you'll love it,"
Hurry up please!
hop
"You'll love it,"
Fuck!
I'm fucking you.
Fucking you...
"Sorry, you're eating."
Oh It's my pleasure.
How did you meeting go with the girl?
She didn't believe me.
Who would believe a man who's capable of waiting till the shrimps get cold?
"Oh, what did you got?"
This is for you.
This is what I drink.
"Oh, thank you."
"Start getting your dinner, I shouldn't start talking about your duty again."
"Here, open it."
Hey you?
Hey you?
What's with these glass arrows in the head?
"- Ok, ok."
"- They make a good team, you know."
"Jin-san, I wonder if even now you are being discharged, you want to stay."
"Hold on, Captain."
Before when we were running under the bombing... you know I could have done it alone.
Don't you?
But... we are trained to don't let no one behind.
Fool!
Nobody is going to praise you...
""" Thank you "" you should say..."
Male here.
I found the main point.
It was true... there's a special warhead...
Male here.
Entered inside the TL.
Good.
"Start the access, I'll go as soon as possible."
Yankee.
Can you immediately put together a log?
Yankee?
What's going on?
Yankee?
"Gimlet here, over!"
"Male, reply!"
Gimlet here.
Male here.
Can't contact Yankee.
I'll send a scout team to the surface to investigate.
To the surface?
Hey!
Male!
Didn't earn your points yet?
- We should all be drunk for this.
- Let's get really drunk.
- All right.
- Yeah.
You know what?
I'll get some beers.
- Come with me.
"- Wait, wait, wait, wait."
Let him go.
- Mmm.
- I don't know what happened.
- Mmm.
Mmm.
- Mmm.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
"Deandra, we've been at this for days now."
It's like you have no motor skills.
Just grab that bar and jerk it down behind your neck.
Hey!
How's the chip off the old block doin'?
"- Bobby, not now, okay?"
"- Hey, your old man ever tell you how we fought back in '61?"
"They billed it as ""Beauty Versus the Beast."""
Wasn't much of a fight.
First-round knockout.
- He went down like a...
"- Wait, wait, wait."
Hold on a second.
"What's goin' on with you, Thunderson?"
"What, are you trying to humiliate me?"
"Uh, I think you did that to yourself 40 years ago."
You know damn well you hit me after the bell.
Incidentally you might ask your daughter if she remembers seeing Mr. Dennings in her room that night.
"Look, he wouldn't have any reason in the world to go up to her room."
"I know, I realize, but if certain British doctors never asked, ""What is this fungus?"" we wouldn't today have penicillin."
Correct?
"When she's better, I'll ask her."
It couldn't hurt.
In the meantime....
That's okay.
"I really hate to ask you this, but for my daughter, could you please give an autograph?"
Of course.
Where's a pencil?
Right here.
She'd love it!
What's her name?
I lied.
It's for me.
The spelling is on the back:
Kinderman.
"You know that film you made, Angel?"
I saw that six times!
Really?
It was beautiful.
Thank you.
-'Bye.
-'Bye.
"Please, no!"
-Do it!
"-Please, don't!"
You bitch!
Do it!
"Please, no!"
Let Jesus fuck you!
"Last year, Greg Hayman took me to a very nice sushi dinner."
Then we took a romantic walk to a nearby research lab..
where we trashed the place and freed 20 monkeys.
I knew it!
I knew I wasn't crazy!
"Last year, a monkey did attack me at the bus stop!"
"So between her and me being friends, and her history with Ross.."
it just isn't gonna happen.
It'd be like you falling in love with a cat.
-Hey.
-Hey.
"How's my favorite dog, huh?"
How's my favorite dog?
You're subdued.
-Did you give him a beer?
-No.
-Will you excuse us?
We need to talk.
-Sure.
"Oh, me, right."
-He's miserable.
What happened to him?
-Nothing.
-We talked about stuff.
-What stuff?
Rachel stuff.
"Oh, Joey, you bummed him out!"
This is the happiest dog in the world.
"He spends a day with you, and look!"
He's breathing.
"Okay, well, he's watching us so just look happy, okay?"
-I'll take him to Wendy's.
"Come, Ashwini."
Let's go.
Let's not stay here.
"Who is it, Ashwini?"
Inspector Arivazhagan.
Can I come in?
"Sir, I killed him."
I accept my doing.
Do you know how many years of jail for a hit-and-run case?
"Keep quiet, Ashwini."
Sir...
What should I do?
I'll tell you.
"I'll miss you, Manoj."
Be careful.
I'll be awaiting your call.
Call me soon.

Did he inform you?
Did he call you?
Get me my bag from the backseat.
Get it.
"Oh, you ...."
"Smart, sneaky girl!"
"Oh, you ...."
"Smart, sneaky girl!"
"Oh, you ...."
What can I do then?
I got an idea.
What is it?
I can guarantee success with my idea.
- Your Highness will have to be patient.
- Why?
"If you can be patient,"
I'll guarantee you'll have the books of Chin Kang Fist and 8-divine Sword.
Brother!
What is it?
Fung-wu killed his master!
He killed his master?
How can it be?
How can it be?
It's true!
Fung-wu's master was playing chess with His Highness.
"Suddenly, he held a sword in his hand and plunged it into his master's body."
That's unreasonable.
How can it be?
I saw it myself.
His master told him before he died that he'd done the right thing.
Done the right thing?
That's strange.
What happened afterwards?
His Highness arrested him for murder.
Did he resist?
It was useless!
He's helpless!
"Yan-ling, don't be sad!"
I'll find out the truth.
"1, 2, 3!"
"1, 2, 3!"
"People, please, move out of the way, please."
Keep this door open.
"Come on, open the door."
- Bring him in.
Is he conscious?
"- No, ma'am."
"- Oh, my God."
- Calm down.
He's going to be all right.
He's going to be all right.
We'll cut him right here.
Gauze.
- That's good.
- On your left.
"Thank you, nurse."
"Dr. Simmons, take a look at this."
Heavenly father...
I know everything happens for a reason... so I'll just leave it in your hands.
Amen.
Excuse me.
I need somebody to talk to about my friend.
I'm worried about his condition.
What time you get off work?
I just want to discuss his condition.
Visiting hours are over.
Good night.
"You're doing much better, Mr. Reed."
Don't try to talk.
You need your rest.
"My name is Vanessa, and I'm going to take great care of you."
Understand?
Just push the button on the side of the bed... and I'll be there.
"- Oh, this is your car, right?"
- Yep.
See?
Fixed it.
Okay.
You're backing up?
Just fucking go straight.
"I took a precision driving class, Dan."
I think I know what I'm doing.
"Ma'am, we've lost Pierce."
I'm sorry.
We should have hired Navy SEALs instead of those two actual seals.
How do you lose a whole person?
"A cuff link I get, but not a person."
Okay.
She said she's losing her voice.
Just heard from a reporter who says Moyes thinks the White House hired lobbyists to destroy its own bill.
"- Oh, my God."
- Jesus.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
"She said you fucked up, Ben."
And I'm mad as hell that you put Gary in the shit.
You need to get him out.
"- She didn't say that, Gary."
"- Yes, she did."
"Everyone, shut your fucking holes!"
The president is not sick.
- You guys are.
You're parasites.
You're like an infestation of mediocrity.
I don't care if you're a 1950s radio broadcaster.
Master!
Master!
Why did you kill Law Ching?
Why did you force my master to die at my sword?
I didn't force him!
Now I understand.
This is your filthy trick to get our book.
Nonsense!
It was the Shaolin!
Shaolin?
Impossible!
Impossible?
Why?
The poison your master drank is familiar to the Shaolin.
Shaolin temple!
Stop!
Sung Chi!
Execute him for the murder of his master.
"Your Highness, Law Ching has cheated you."
His student definitely knows 8-divine Sword.
Arrest him!
8-divine Sword?
Don't stop!
How are you?
Speak!
"Yes, or you'll have to suffer more!"
But I don't know 8-divine Sword.
How can I tell you?
"Your Highness, please stop!"
Why?
The man has the same temperament as his master.
He won't tell you even if you kill him.
That hasn't changed.
You don't lose a steady hand.
"Except, back then it was control."
Now it's rheumatism.
"Ladies and gentlemen, we're in the oldest part of Amsterdam."
We're driving past the oldest buildings.
We're now going to sex theatre Casa Rosso.
We wish you a very good time.
Can we help?
"-That's nice of you, thank you."
I'm killing myself dragging my husband around.
He insisted on going on a holiday.
And it had to be Holland.
Wanted to see the old mother country?
Niels!
-Ab!
Wout!
He recognizes us!
-Of course.
Thank you very much.
Does your husband still enjoy a sex club?
He thinks it's beautiful.
He can't move well anymore.
He's had a stroke.
"But his brain's still working, isn't it?"
My sweetheart.
"Miss, help me, please."
Miss!
Shoot.
Shoot me.
Kill me.
Please.
"""Let me get intoxicated."""
"""I am young."""
"""Show me the magic."""
What are you thinking?
"You know, Gul."
Jaipur will be lonely without you.
And you?
I have become lonely.
It's very late.
I have to go home now.
Can't you cancel it?
What?
Going home?
Mumbai.
"- No way, Karan."
Mumbai is my dream city.
And you know Pia has found such a nice job for me.
I can't lose this opportunity.
And you can lose me.
"Karan, path is meant to take travellers to their destination."
And not to stop them.
Understood?
I am just a path for you?
You are not my destination too.
"Fine, Gul."
"You will meet me once before you leave, won't you?"
Of course.
Go to sleep.
Your daughter has returned.
Ask her where she was the whole night.
Her friends had thrown a bash.
Farewell party.
And so are we.
You are so explaining this to me.
"Hey, baby."
"If this bar were a meat market, you'd be the prime rib."
"Oh, god."
"You reek of cannabis, Bender."
Cannabis?
"Hey Maxine, you've got something on your chest - my eyes!"
Go away.
It's never going to happen.
"Hey, are you like a parking ticket or something?"
"Cuz you've got ""fine"" written all over you."
I have a headache.
You can stand here but don't talk to me.
"Look, you look a lot like my next girlfriend, you know what I'm saying?"
"Oh, my god."
How long does this go on before you actually quit?
I never quit.
That's one thing that you're gonna learn about me.
I never quit.
Never.
Fuck it.
[BENDER] Fuck what?
Fuck it - let's do it.
What?
Where we going?
We're gonna go to your place.
We're gonna go- we're gonna go to my place?
Mm-hmm.
Sweet.
- Now.
"- Oh, now."
(voice cracking):
including... my poor wife.
(creaky door opens)
"Oh, hi."
I need to switch rooms.
This guy is bumming me out.
I don't know if you have any singles open or...
Silence!
"Now that we have you, we don't need this frail, old man."
"Well, that was a stupid move."
You're all under arrest.
(dramatically):
For murder!
(surf rolling)
"Aw, this soaks deck."
"Hey there, Chief."
You mind if I pick up here tomorrow?
Say between 1:00 and 4:00?
"See, I'm a cable installer..."
"Good, because our cable is out."
We missed the last Mad Men.
You will fix our cable.
"Oh, this will be easy."
Good luck.
We've tried everything.
"Oh, so pirates couldn't fix their cable?"
That's right.
"Exactly, so let me do what I do."
Caw!
Caw!
PIRATE:
It is working!
Go!
Thank you.
Get out!
Do you still love me?
I gave you my reasons.
Do you still love me?
"Say ""I do not love you."""
Say it!
Say it!
I do not love you.
You're a liar!
"You did the right thing, coming to see me."
I do not have anyone else.
You say it is the Church that has persuaded the King to renounce his love for you?
Yes.
"You have beauty, wit, intelligence, yet none of these have proved strong enough to retain the King's love."
Only one course remains open to you.
What do I have to do?
There's someone you should meet.
Who?
His name is Guibourg.
Who is he?
He's a friend and he sees the world as we do.
Where shall I find him?
Monsieur Guibourg?
Yes?
I need your help.
Who are you?
Who are you?
I am the Marquise de Montespan.
And how may I help you?
I need to reclaim a man's love.
Are you helping him with his homework?
"Oh, ."
No.
He does it all himself.
"He's getting a ""d."" maybe you should help him."
"Oh, no."
We do.
We do.
We totally do.
"It's just that we can't help him, 'cause we don't really understand it ourselves."
"Okay, okay."
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'm going to set aside some extra time...
An evening next week...
To teach parents a math class.
Oh!
That would be so...
Wait.
What?
A class for parents?
Is there a problem?
No.
That just sounds like a lot of work...
For you.
"Welcome, parents."
I'm sure we're all thrilled
"To be here on a night when ""the mentalist"" is on,"
But tonight we're gonna learn...
excuse me.
Ms. Rinsky?
How wonderful.
An interruption.
You didn't forget your phone again did you?
"Anyways, Aunt came out to check her bank account, and it broke her heart."
Give her a call ok?
Welcome!
This is driving nuts!
Give me a can of beer that's past the expiration date.
There's no such thing.
It's $1.70.
-Get money from Jang Min.
-Sis said that she will kill me.
"If that kills you, I should've been dead 88000 times."
It will be $1.70 sir.
I don't have money.
See?
"Fine, let me call my sister first."
Chan!
Come on Chan!
Geez.
"""Sis isn't answering her phone."
"I left her a voice mail."""
"""I told her that you cried your eye balls out."" Hehe look at this kid."
"""Ok."" Send."
"This is so simple, Honey."
Hey what time are you coming home?
"Yes, mother around 7?"
"Ok, I'll get ready then."
"Ok, Mom see you."
What did you want to eat?
Just make whatever you want.
Fine!
"We can just text this, ""What time?"" ""What do you want?"""
"""7,"" ""Kimchi"" It's so simple."
"""With hasty regards, Tadao. """
"Grandma, it's a very good idea!"
"You should go, absolutely."
- Everybody to Hawaii!
- Wonderful!
- It will be a great holiday!
"- Grandma, let's go!"
"Let's go, please!"
Wait!
My mother also wrote...
"""Dear Grandma, Suzujiro told us to stay at his home."
"""No sense staying at a hotel."
"""We decided to take advantage of his hospitality."
"""It is such a big, magnificent residence."
"""We are just loafing around."
"""The garden is beautiful, and nothing is better than the ocean-side view."
"""Grandma, please do come!"
"Yoshie. """
Look!
It's a gorgeous home!
It looks just like a hotel!
Here's another letter.
"It's from Clark, Suzujiro's son."
It's written in katakana.
"Here, can you see it?"
"""Dear Aunt..."
"""I am the son..."
"""of your eldest brother..."
"""Suzujiro Haruno."
"""Ever since my father..."
"""came from Japan..."
"""to Hawaii in 1920..."
And I am not apologizing.
My past isn't about you.
"-Oh, that is cold."
"-No, it's not."
It's clear.
"You're gonna keep me in my place, are you?"
I'm not gonna keep you anywhere.
You are free to move around.
"Well, I'm not moving, for your information."
"You can work your tough-girl thing, but I know you're in love with me."
That's irrelevant.
"Kind of tired, babe."
You know?
-You're up early.
"-I know, and I'm not happy about it."
-You need some Valium?
-I don't wanna get back into that again.
"Yeah, that wouldn't be good."
Try swimming.
It helps.
-So how are you?
How's work going?
-Good.
-Just not sleeping enough myself.
"-Oh, I'm sure."
-Hospital's been busy.
"-A lot of psychos, huh?"
"No, just a lot of pained souls."
"Listen, I appreciate your interest in Alex."
I meant to tell you that.
I really like Alex.
I like her a lot.
- We doubly accept.
Does anyone else want to join our little contest?
- I'm in!
"- Ja, wonderbar!"
- Huzzah!
- Okay.
I think I'm going to take the kids out and terrify a few more trick or treaters.
- Will I see you later?
- The night is young.
Trick or treat.
Ahem.
Ahem!
I shall begin.
Once upon a midnight dreary...
"There was this crazy albino guy with a hook, and he lived in a mirror!"
"And if you even look at him, you'd wake up in bathtub full of ice with your kidneys gone!"
Well...
"Hey, hold on."
I didn't say we were doing this here.
- Uh...
What?
- You named the terms.
I name the place.
"Okay, fine."
Where we gonna do this?
- Castle Duloc?
"- Oh, ha ha."
"Very funny, Shrek."
But this is where Lord Farquaad lived!
Ja.
Und died.
I heard it's haunted by his ghost!
The mailman put one of your letters... in my box.
I'll give you some medication.
I'm growing a mustache.
Miss Brody.
It's me.
It's Detective Ridgely.
"You all right, honey?"
Take this.
Miss Brody.
Don't you ever try... to sneak off on me like that again.
You understand?
It's all right.
"Hey, Barry."
"Long night, squire?"
Hospital bills.
You got a file for every nosebleed in Illinois?
If you'll just be patient...
Thank you.
But this says 3B.
Yes.
Miss Brody lives in apartment 2B.
Somebody made a mistake.
That's right.
Valerie Wheaton died in apartment 3B.
Who has access to these files?
Only hospital personnel.
I want a list.
All right.
Do you by chance recognize the handwriting on this?
This looks like Dr. Pierce's writing.
What were you doing at the El station... so late at night?
Why do you want to know?
"Oh, mate."
That'll be a little surprise package I've arranged for us this evening.
"Without wanting to give the game completely away, they're twins, from Macedonia and..."
.. they don't have keys.
You - out.
"Laters, bro."
- Mr Douglas.
- Calum.
"- Oh, no."
- John Mercer!
I'm not staying here.
Where was it you shared the cell?
"Pentonville, wasn't it?"
- I'm not staying here.
The lad's an idiot.
- That's a bit harsh.
"Granted, he's no Stephen Hawking."
"- John, mate, don't be like that."
"- Don't ""John, mate"" me, please."
- I'm not staying here.
- You don't want to live with him?
Fine.
Get rid of him.
- John!
- What are you doing?
This way you get the flat to yourself.
"John, mate, please, I've changed a lot since then."
"I'm sorry about that deodorant, mate."
"Just tell him you'll stay with me, please."
John!
Please!
Don't...
Here.
Look at this one.
"Oh, that's great."
Great.
With the smoke around Jivver's face.
Yeah.
So how's Hallie?
Looks like...
"you guys are an item now, huh?"
No.
"No, not an item."
Definitely not.
"She's a very nice girl, but um, she doesn't take no for an answer, does she?"
"Well, you're a big boy."
I'm sure you can handle... her.
"Hey, um, I wanted to ask you did you tell her to pursue me?"
Uh...
- Hello there Miss homebody.
Why aren't you dressed yet?
For what?
Did you forget my big screen debut deal?
We're going to my L.A. Red carpet premiere.
Hello.
"What do you think, Johnson?"
I think she's dead.
No excuses.
Seven was supposed to tell you.
Yeah.
"Well, he didn't."
"Oh, my god, I did actually."
It's just that you had your head buried in those photos and you didn't notice.
"Well, can I wear this?"
"So, do you know what everyone is saying?"
What?
About how you and Angela had sex.
- Who?
- You and Angela.
No.
Who's saying that?
I don't know.
People. I mean.
"She told me the truth, of course."
What truth?
How far you guys went.
Well.
Yeah.
Because nothing happened.
"Right, so how come it's all over school?"
"I mean, you're not talking it up like some low-life..."
"derelict cretin telling everyone you did her, are you?"
J ust checking.
- H i Brian.
- H i.
- This is Gina.
- Hey.
- Right.
H i.
- Brian saw the entire thing.
I heard you actually chased the gunmen.
- Chased the gunmen?
- l would have screamed.
I have to leave the room when my father uses the electric knife.
"I think chase is a little bit strong, but I was going to check out the situation ..."
because you know if there's a gun--
Mr. Yagami?
We were in the same class.
But we did not go.
"I saw him yesterday, to my work."
He had to return to that time.
I see!
Good!
Sorry for inconvenience.

I freaked out yesterday.
Sakota
"During his run, he had a pain."
"Sometimes you what, Sakota?"
"It crashed into the train, and is the result."
"It's been what, in fact ?"
- This would be a heart attack.
- A heart attack?
This is not true...
This is not true...
I can not believe.
This is impossible.
No...
No...
Do not be sad guy.
- Huh?
- It was a night protection.
"Okay, I'm making out with this guy..."
PG stuff.
"And he mentions that he's going out of town, he's gonna be out of touch."
Run.
But maybe he is going out of town.
Where?
Where's he going that he's gonna be out of touch?
Where are you going out of town to again?
Um...
Uh...
Pittsburgh.
Pittsburgh.
Run.
"So, what, now I'm just supposed to run from every guy who doesn't like me?"
Yeah.
There's not gonna be anybody left.
I don't know why I'm saying this but I think I know a nice guy who might actually like you.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
He's friends with my brother.
His name's Bill.
We'll all meet for drinks and it'll be good.
"So, I mean, I'm in his bathroom right now."
What do I do?
"Well, you gotta come out eventually, right?"
But I'd take my time in there.
I'd let him sweat.
- Thanks.
- Good luck.

BEN:
"Yeah, the boat looks great."
You say that like there's only one problem.

Okay.
How soon can you make it to Bridgeport?
Why?
Because I need you to be the rope.
Okay.
Who am I playing?
Pete's mom Maggie.
"Uh, isn't she, like, north of 50?"
"I just played your mistress a few years ago, Marius."
"What, now I'm your mother?"
"What is this, Hollywood?"
"Well, we're screwed if you don't."
Ohh.
Do you have any idea of her height?
No.
Oh.
Good.
I'll sit.
"Uh, need to be dark, and I'll need something that makes them not want to look too closely."
Okay.
"I need to know a few things about her, please."
I don't know much beyond her name.
"Well, figure it out."
- [phone rings]
- Shit.
Yeah.

"Each year, 100,000 baseball bats are sold in Russia, and, at most, 50 baseballs."

You freely admit you killed this man?
"Yes, sir."
"But this is my day in court, and I aim to finish."
- Are you doing okay?
- Yeah.
- What have you been up to?
- When?
All this time!
I've been looking out the window.
The window?
What were you looking at?
"Just looking, Barbuda."
I see.
How are you doing in school?
"The principal says that I'm behind, Barbuda."
Behind?
How come?
Didn't you showher how you can read?
"How you can draw, write and walk the tightrope."
Didn't you tell her that your mom made you study every day?
"Don't worry, sweetie."
You'll get the hang of it in no time.
Don't worry about that.
I miss you already!
I hope the circus comes by Rio de Janeiro again.
"Next time, I promise I'll bring Foguinho."
"Come on, my tightrope walker."
Barbuda.
Can you take me up there someday?
Ask your grandma.
She'll take you.
"I want to go with you, Barbuda."
Can you take me?
- Mom!
- Maria!
!
- Are you starting again?
!
"Why is Kobi screaming, honey?"
"Then who is that, Yitzhak?"
"Why are you crying, Yarivi?"
Your father called me.
He said he might want to come too.
Suddenly everyone's interested in me- I'm a celebrity-.
"It's all kosher, dear."
"Poor Jonah, my beautiful sister."
"She was better at everything else, but I could teach you how to cook!"
"So what are you up to, Aunt Rosa?"
What can I do?
I teach Hebrew.
"Besides your leg, are you feeling better?"
Why?
- Are you better?
- What do you mean?
He's asking if you're better.
You said you were sick.
"- Me, sick?"
- Aren't you sick?
I'm as healthy as a horse.
This is in Paris.
"You came to visit, remember?"
Your mother came every year.
Do you know where in Paris?
- Do you remember?
- How?
I was only five.
Then how should I remember?
"Victor, no."
Stop.
I'll bring him down myself.
Give that to me.
Look what you've done.
"Sickle, stop."
"Sickle, I'm commanding you to stop."
"Sickle, this is Dr. Victor Gannon commanding you to stop!"
- He's out of control.
- Sickle!
Go back!
Sickle!
No!
Letha...
look.
- I can't look.
- You must.
It's miraculous.
"There are no miracles, Letha."
Only scientific explanations for everything.
"Well, then, just explain to me what we're seeing."
It... must be that... boy.
There's a...
There's a force that centers around that boy.
A force capable of countermanding the basic physical law of...
gravity.
"Victor, I don't know what you're talking about."
Molecular mobilization.
"I need that boy, Letha."
- I need him desperately.
"- Now, just a minute."
"Brilliant, my boy."
Mukesh.
Come here.
I don't care what people will think of me...
But you will never be able to face anyone again!
Put the knife in me!
What?
You don't have to kill me!
Insert it in a little bit!
Sarika!
I'll break open the door!
He will kill both of us!
Good!
We will die together like star-crossed lovers!
I am warning you for the last time Sarika!
That felt good.
First class first!
It was never Johnny who betrayed me...
It has always been you.
"And today, you want to get away again."
Not this time!
This is Mukesh.
is Johnny there?
"Who, Karpov?"
Yes.
He took off.
To Mauritius.
The lucky fucker ran into a bag of cash!
Johnny!
"Brother, we have reached."
Where are you?
We have been waiting outside the train station.
Are you coming?
How?
I've got no place to work.
What's wrong with the country?
MaIIefiIIe is there.
"The children do need a tutor, but..."
I just can't stand the sight of him any more.
I tell him outright I want him to leave and he plainly refuses.
"I'm a coward, of course."
I can never simply boot my lovers down the stairs.
- Ha!
- What?
Why don't you stay here in Paris and write?
Because alfred's here.
I've got to go somewhere.
"Anywhere, I don't know."
"Maybe I should just curl up and die, yes?"
"Listen, BuIoz."
"I need 3,000 francs now."
Let me read this... and we'II talk tonight at the Baroness Laginsky's party.
I hadn't planned to attend.
alfred might be there.
I know for a fact that he won't.
AII right.
- What's that?
- marvellous.
- Her memoirs?
Am I in it?
- No!
This bit's about her childhood.
"You'II come in later, after she chews up her husband and a hundred others."
It's true.
She's a cannibal.
"If you divide 98 by 12, it makes $8 a year for her loyalty."
"Then throw in Señora Rodríguez, Señora Salcedo, Señora García--"
"Son, we have to have the sense of the community."
That's very important.
"- Tito understands that, right?"
- Claro.
Carlos:
Tito understands everything.
Woman:
You're a day late!
"Hey, Miss Mercedes."
Miss Mercedes!
Ah-ah-ah!
I need you at the other building.
- Can I clean up first?
- Later.
What's the fucking rush?
I told you we have to get these windows in by the end of the month.
Why are these cans in with the newspapers?
Didn't we have this conversation before?
- I posted notices on every floor.
- That's not enough.
"At the end of the day, you're responsible, not the tenant."
My man!
What's happening?
"- Maggie, my buddy Mickey."
- What's up?
- Mickey... and Daisy.
- Daisy:
Fuck you...!
"Daisy, what's happening?"
This is Berna.
"Seventeen black, we won!"
Great!
"Fortunate in games of chance, unfortunate in games of love."
we won.
"What, thats all?"
yes.
Ok then
Thanks
Here.
You where splendid.
"Truly, you looked marvelous."
"Enough with the complements, you know that there is no room for them between us."
What time is the meeting?
Tonight at midnight.
And Uli?
He is carrying out a small mission.
You are becoming quite the dangerous Cassanova.
Me?
Why do you say that?
I have my reasons.
Should I bring Mr. Dinamo's car?
"No, bring mine!"
"Adriana, wait!"
wait.
What happened to you...you are quite the mess.
I was trying to stop a man from shooting a woman.
Who was he?
"I do not know, It was dark."
And who was she?
"Don't know, I only saw her shadow."
"Oh, sure."
"Ah,I see, there goes your ""ghost."""
Hi.
"Terribly sorry, officer, but this is actually my car."
I'm...
"I'm trying to, uh, teach my girlfriend how to drive stick."
She's got a lot to learn.
I know.
"But, you know... women."
"All right, I hear you."
It's a warning... this time.
Yeah.
Thank you so much.
"What are you, some sort of a misogynist?"
You're welcome.
"Oh, go."
We got lucky.
"""We""?"
"This isn't your car either, is it?"
Hmm?
I stole a stolen car?
Now how about that drink?

"All due respect, I'm the best-equipped to go."
- How many wars have you been through?
- My share.
- It should be me.
- You?
You haven't fought in a battle.
This is about us getting home to our loved ones.
- Why would you...
- Because I have no loved ones.
"If I fail, you can still go on."
Why?

Addons Let him live if completing simple tasks.
"Addons A coward in life, only if, will cause an end to a simple task."
What will happen?
We must always be together.
We can not let us win.

Addons Do not kill me!

"Addons As you inferred, plane to Oslo."
Which Addons journey will end and i.
-Aliens.
What?
-All this for nothing.
They abandoned us.
"Folks, the sea is frozen."
It is impossible the aliens return.
Frozen hard.
Frozen hard.
"If the sea is so far, we will take as food."
"Than before die hunger, too."
-I better go.
-We can not let them.
-I think they'll leave.
-It seems that we ...
"I must inform you that the Adelie, not help us anymore."
And who will bring us fish?
"Some good questions, has no good answer."
"Sven can not leave us, not now."
"I'm sorry, fofuxo."
If they also get no longer be alive.
I can not stand ...
Do not take it anymore.
Get away from me.
I'll leave.
-That crazy guy!
Me too.
We girls let's jump.
"Sven, teach them, teaches them to fly."
Erik is not so easy.
Help them Sven help them.
"But not all Penguin is equal, Erik."
But you're a penguin.
(PHONE RINGING)
Hi.
So are we doing something tonight or not?
I can't.
My girlfriends are sleeping over.
I'm having a sleepover.
This is like the first normal thing I've done since I got pregnant.
"All right, well..."
Just let me know where I fit in here.
"Okay, I'll talk it over with Jody and Francine and I'll let you know."
(SCOFFS)
I'm just joking.
"Oh, yeah?"
"Well, not funny."
And...
You know what?
This isn't going to work out.
I have to go.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
"No, I have to go."
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
"And I don't like your friends, either."
They're not nice.
What does that have to do with anything?
They're still my friends.
We'll see.
"Yeah, we will."
Boyfriend problems?
He thinks my friends aren't nice.
And why would he say that?
Because they aren't.
But it's high school and you have to have friends and these are the only friends I can get right now.
My job with you always comes first.
I promise.
Come on.
We've got a million things to do.
Okay.
We've got to talk to the publicity people and set up a photo shoot.
Natalie.
I hate that picture!
"I like the other one better, the one on the trolley cars."
What do you think?
I don't know.
"Oh, my God."
It's so weird seeing myself on a bus like that.
"I mean, I can't believe it's really me up there."
I can't believe this is really happening.
"I can't believe it, either."
"I hate to bring this up, but we have work to do."
"Remember your predecessor, Marissa Kessler?"
Murder victim?
Multiple stab wounds?
Does that ring a bell?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
All right.
Randy and the Captain are probably already there.
It should be just around the corner.
It's number 24.
24. 24. 24.
Are you done?
Sorry.
Let's do this.
What's the guy's name again?
You're confused.
He's confused you.
- It's very confusing.
- Don't move!
"I said, don't move.!"
I mean business.
Goddamn it.!
Would you think about what you're doing.!
This guy's a scumbag.!
He doesn't want you!
He's only using you!
Come on!
Put the gun down!
Back away from Jack now!
- You've gone completely crazy.
You know that?
- Thanks for noticing.
How do you plan to get us out of this one?
Watch me and weep.
"It takes all kinds, Dalt."
"Okay, Bill, Wendy, I hope you're getting this."
They are walking directly towards the helicopter... and they're staring at me like a couple of crazed dogs.
I'm gonna try to get a word from them if I can.
"This is unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen."
This...
"- Oh, my..."
- Get out of there.
"- Let's go, pal."
Let's go.
- I'm being asked...
- Come on!
Go!
I just got so nervous.
- You were great.
- It's like a tax on the stupid.
"Come on, Randy."
We're parked out front.
Good job.
"Well, thank you, mr."
Monk.
- It was fun.
- Yeah.
I'm glad you did it.
What a fun thing to do only one time and never try it again or mention it again.
"Natalie, where you going?"
"Mr. Lawrence, I told you I wasn't an actor."
I'm so sorry.
Sorry about what?
That you did such a terrific job?
The phones are lighting up like crazy.
They love you.
And those little ad lib things you did.
You were wonderful.
Wasn't she wonderful?
So...
what do you say?
- About what?
- About doing it full-time.
It's just three nights a week.
I promise it won't interfere with your day job.
"I mean, I don't know."
You really thought I was good?
I told you when I met you you're a natural.
Mr. Monk?
- What's going on?
- I just got fired.
"Oh, my gosh, are you serious?"
"Oh, don't act so shocked, Carrie."
"All the times I've watched ""All About Eve,"""
"and I didn't even realize you were ""All About Eve-ing"" me."
What are you talking about?
Me?
I didn't want to get you fired.
"I mean, I've been working my butt off to save your job."
Yeah?
"Well, nice work..."
Taking my assignment and all.
"Bennet, you vanished."
I couldn't reach you.
"And apparently, you were out partying."
So what was I supposed to do?
Not stab me in the back.
Thanks for being such a good friend.
I didn't mean to get him fired.
Oh.
- Who are you?
- I'm Dorrit...
Bradshaw.
I'm just waiting to meet my dad.
"Oh, I didn't realize Tom had kids."
"Yep, me and my sister."
Don't worry.
I won't be long.
I just need some money.
Got it.
"Don't tell him, but he's super easy to manipulate."
"What's this, then?"
It's not mine.
Isn't this your handwriting?
"I said, it's not mine."
You know anything about a Japanese man living in the village?
You're dripping water all over the place.
Answer me.
Do you know him or not?
Did you meet him?
Answer me.
You're scaring her.
Get out for a sec.
"Come on, this is serious."
It's you and me.
Daddy is a policeman.
I'll know if you lie.
Did you meet this man?
Tell me.
Tell you what?
Everything.
"Where you met, what you did."
Why should I tell you?
Because it's important.
What's so important?
"Answer me, girl!"
"I said, what's so important?"
What's so damn important?
What the hell is so damned important?
You don't even know what's important.
"Stop grilling me, goddamn it!"
Fuck!
What are you doing?
Take it!
Go!
"Hold it, lady, what are you doing?"
Looking for somebody!
Who are you looking for?
Chao Fung-wu.
Chao Fung is at a chess game with his master and Highness.
Having a chess game?
I'll join them.
His Highness has ordered that there be no disturbance.
It's alright!
I won't tell anybody if His Highness loses.
What are you doing?
I'm just looking for his student.
No!
No?
Surround her!
This is ridiculous!
"Go away, or we'll do something!"
I won't leave unless I see Fung-wu.
Brother!
"Yan-ling, why do you figtht with them?"
You better go away with your sister.
And don't disturb the chess game!
The chess game?
He's playing chess with Mr. Law!
You came to find Fung-wu.
"Yes, they just won't let me in."
Mr. Royal Guard!
We are friends of His Highness.
You should at least tell Fung-wu that she's here.
That's right!
It's all yours.
Delicious.
It's so delicious...
So delicious.
It really is delicious.
Sorry.
Welcome.
"Please press the button to select your room, then receive your key at the front desk."
Resting or staying overnight?
Overnight.
"Overnight is 14,000 yen, plus day fee of 5,800 yen."
Really?
That's the rule.
So expensive.
200 yen is your change.
"The girl's no good, she's not sexy and she's loose down there."
"Seriously, and she mentioned her dad is a cop, too."
Don't tell me you fell for her sob stories.
Where are you?
The bathroom.
Bet she's already stolen your stuff and left.
What?
First time?
Never done this?
Not for this reason.
No one here.
"Oh, an employee."
"""What are you doing here?"""
Not throwing it?
"Well, I just bought this phone."
Tired?
Hey there.
Can't say I blame them.
There's nothing I hate more than a damp cold.
Let's check this out.
Howdy folks.
Who are you?
Sheppard.
"This is Teyla, Ronon, McKay."
You from Matira?
No.
Over the mountains then?
A little further.
Then you've come a long way.
You'll be in need of food and drink.
Sit.
"Take it, you don't get many strangers around here?"
No.
Especially not those who travel near dark.
Why's that?
- You really don't know?
- Callum.
What's your business here?
"No business really, we're just travellers."
Then you best keep travelling.
Ya...
Alright then.
Wait!
"Goran, you can't send them out there."
They look like they can take care of themselves.
May not even start tonight.
"It's been three months, how much longer do you think it will wait."
"Hi, what are you talking about?"
The Daemus.
He just got out of intensive care.
"We should probably go visit the man, considering it's kind of our fault that he's in there."
"Man, would you quit saying that?"
It is not our fault.
You know what?
You're right.
It's your fault.
Hike.
Go long!
Come on.
I got a cannon over here.
"Further, further!"
Oh.
Ooh.
"Usually, I'm a big fan of physical comedy."
Pratfalls and what not.
Yeah.
When I heard that crunch...
"- Actually, it was still kind of funny."
- Yeah.
"Look, you know what?"
"We'll go visit him, give him a balloon, draw penises all over his cast."
He'll smile.
We'll be in the clear.
"Hey, Aaron."
You okay?
I'm not really sure.
"Well, he should be more than okay because he had lunch with..."
Liza Blue.
Liza Blue?
The porn star?
"Okay, first of all, that's not her real name."
There is some problem.
Where are you going?
To have a smoke.
Pia.
"- Yes, sir."
Where is Gul?
- She must be around in the office.
Where is Adi?
He has gone for a smoke.
- Gone for a smoke.
Alright.
Thanks.
Adi.
- Hi.
What do you think?
By when will Umbrella Creations' designs be ready?
"It will take another three-four days, sir."
The workload is very heavy.
Gul is there to help you.
She must have also prepared some designs.
I have thrown her sketches in the dustbin.
She is new.
She will learn gradually.
We should close Flora Enterprises and start a fashion institute.
Along with Gul everybody else will also learn.
Hold it.
Hold it there.
Just stop kidding.
"If she is not talented, sack her."
Throw her out.
You know we are short of time.
It is better you do this job.
"Yes, certainly I am."
Do you ever stop and think that some of this could possibly be your fault?
What?
What?
I was too permissive?
"No, no, no, no."
"I'm not talking about the liberal child-rearing sense, Mom."
You blame everybody but yourself.
"You go out of your way, it's me, it's Kevin, it's Dad."
Where were you in the picture?
Do you ever think about that?
I don't see any ocean out there.
This is a terrible place to come to.
Please!
Please!
Just one minute!
One minute!
It's for my little girl.
Thank you so much.
You're so kind.
This must happen every night.
"Yeah, it's like ""Sophie's Choice"" in here."
What do you need?
I need a grass Hawaiian skirt for a hula.
"There's miriachis, which would be Mexico..."
Coconut cup?
Closer...
Ukelele...that's a good sign.
Sorry.
"No, don't tell me that."
Don't tell me that.
"Look, I'm sorry."
"Look, I don't..."
I don't care.
Shut up.
Get in here.
- What are you doing?
- Let's go.
- Pull down your pants.
- What?
Don't ask questions.
- Shove these in your underwear.
- Why?
You want me to do it?
"'Cause, I swear to God, I will."
- Why can't we leave it in the bag?
- Because it shows up on the scanner.
"And we're not about to have them confiscate $250,000."
"$250,000?"
- No.
Why do I have to do it?
- 'Cause you're the donkey boy.
You really suck at not asking questions.
What's a donkey boy?
"- Step forward, sir."
- Thanks.
"- In the basket, please."
- There's a table when you get to the line.
"Act casual, think casual, be casual."
"Remove your keys, any metal objects."
"Laptops out, please."
Thank you.
"If you have liquids in a Ziploc bag, please show them to us now."
- Thank you.
"The way he talks, you'd think he had something there."
Excuse me.
Hey.
Look at the dude.
- Come on.
Let's give him the works.
"- All right, kiddo."
"- Hey, watch out!"
- Give me that!
I'll make you eat that ball in a minute!
"All right, come on!"
Let's go!
Like taking candy from a baby.
"How'd you get it, Crab?"
I hoisted it over the transom in the alley and dropped it.
- The corner caught me right in the dome.
- So long as it didn't break the machine.
"Boy, we'll be in the money now."
Six nickels and two slugs.
Imagine crooks like that?
Putting slugs in a slot machine.
- Chiselers.
- I'm gonna break this thing...
Pipe down.
- It's only Soapy and the gang.
- That's good.
"Hi, Soapy!"
"- Soapy, look what we got."
- You should see the hook I got.
It's the most I got in my life.
- We got a sucker's poke.
- No kidding!
That's not really an answer.
I totally thought I was being abducted.
"I was so happy to wake up in my bunker and not some alien mother ship, but also, same time, a little bummed it didn't happen."
"I, uh..."
I need a minute with Oleg.
That's fine with me.
How's everybody doing?
Good?
(gun fires)
"(man screams) No, uh, everything's fine."
At ease.
"Uh, he's got it under control."
"I'm pretty sure, okay?"
(man shouting in Russian) Thanks.
See?
You get it?
Yeah.
Great.

"Yeah, what a shocker."
Right.
"Next, I need you to, uh, take your shirt off, please."
Open up there.
"Yeah, those."
Plug the jacks in there.
"Yeah, in there."

"Sorry about that, boss."
Sorry about that?

Is that your fault?
"Well, it was O'Leary, sir, he, er, completely went for it."
He went rogue and started typing things into the computer...
I didn't go rogue.
"Anyway, you said you 100% trust me, I didn't go rogue."
"Oi, big boy, look at me, yes."
"Explanation now, yes!"
"OK, I thought the killer and the kidnapper was Miley Cyrus."
Did you?
Yeah.
"Right, why?"
"She had motive, there was a bypass going to go through the old people's home."
"I thought the old people loved the VHS, she knew her way around a VHS."
And the...
And the delivery of the ransom note was in VHS.
Albert.
(Camilla starts crying)
"Oh, sweetie!"
Why don't you sort things out with him?
- Because I think it's too late.
- It's never too late.
"If you like him so much, why don't you commit yourself?"
"You know, it's probably just some sort of misunderstanding."
"Oh Camilla, now you got me going too."
"(light waltz, both girls laugh and cry at the same time)"
Hey... silly me.
I can be such a wise-ass.
Didn't I realise I was talking about myself?
Apparently not.
I needed one more push.
And that push came from an unexpected place.
(knocking on door)
May I come in?
Are you all right?
- Entrez.
I'm almost done.
- Sure?
We used to be lovers.
Can you believe that?
You and Pierre?
"Yes, I know."
I thought he was the love of my life.
Are we talking about the same person?
- Yeah.
Unfortunately.
- What happened?
- L'amour rend aveugle.
Open it!
Get out here.
Get out here!
Tell him to come out here.
- Tell him!
"- Do what he says, Dennis."
Thanks.
Please don't do this.
I got three kids.
Shut up!
I know he tripped the silent alarm.
I know there's a dozen cops out there just waiting to kill me.
Then how the hell do you think you're gonna get out of here?
Out the front door.

What 'you want Pam?
"Yes, 'tell'."
Let's say 'tell'.
- Tell 'Tell'.
It's a great sauce.
This is mayonnaise.
This is vinaigrette with...
With garlic.
- Oh yes.
And this is 'Iyutenitsa'.
"It looks like ketchup, but it's natural."
Do you want to taste it?
I?
Mr. Lloyd?
What's up?
OMG.
The Turkish security officer.
Jesus Christ.
I think he would have accompanied us to Sofia's embassy.
Absolutely not.
The escape of the king would be a humiliation for the Turks.
It could cause a diplomatic incident.
Bulut would bring us back to Istanbul to overthrow the scandal.
Let's go home.
In ambulance.
"Ludovic, we have to stop shooting right away."
"Mr. Lloyd, that's enough."
"- Well, Louise."
Duncan filmed the trip.
Ludovic?

"Hey, yeah, sure."
"Listen, you done us a big favor, now we'll do it for you."
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
"Hey, come on, let's go."
That Tony sure made himself scarce.
- We better walk you home.
- Where do you live?
I...
I was supposed to stay at a hotel.
But I don't know which one.
You could stay in our hideout.
- Yeah!
- Thank you.
We'll look for Tony tomorrow.
If we aren't busy beating up goons.
- Yeah.
"- Hey, it's Yo-Yo."
- Get down.
"- Come on, hide."
- Did he see us?
- I don't know.
- But he's coming this way.
- Who is he?
- Our worst enemy.
- He's worse than the goons.
Thank you.
Would you like a drink?
- No.
I am good.
"I know your speciality, Gul."
"You are handling Umbrella Creations' account, aren't you?"
"Yes, Mr. Bajaj."
There is one thing common between us.
A hunger for success.
I can sense that about you.
I see the same hunger in you.
"You want to be very, very successful."
Nothing wrong with that.
The only difference is you work too hard.
I have a philosophy.
Party hard.
And work smart.
For instance this waiter.
How many hours does he work?
10?
12?
14?
"I mean, I don't know."
How much money does he earn?
Look at me.
I work for three to four hours.
And both of us know how much money I earn.
That's why I have an offer for you.
Join my company.
Get my company Umbrella Creations' contract.
"Salary, whatever you want."
A dream house.
Where did the husband spring from?
He had left her?
Left her where?
A husband is no baggage to be carried around!
He's left on a pilgrimage.
That's wonderful!
A thorn out of my path!
But he will return.
How's that?
He has a return ticket.
God!
I'll have the railways cancel his ticket!
I want Laxmi!
I've no interest in life without Laxmi anymore!
Has Kishan paid you his rent?
Not in the last 6 months!
Haribhai?
I'm in a hurry...
See you later.
Look after my connection;
I'll go after the collection!
Who's throwing the litter around?
That's no litter...
Siraj!

And what's this?
Have you left Grand Hotel?
Yes.
This set-up is my own.

What's that?
A Hindu name?

Amy's almost here.
Any last words of encouragement?
Ignore all your instincts.
"Oh, my God, Clark."
"Don't look, it's pornography!"
The worst kind...
Long-form narrative.
"""Clark's Playbook of Scenarios to Help Jack Break Up with Amy""?"
"Okay, I'll give in."
It's my playbook of scenarios to help Jack break up with Amy.
"It's a little overthinky, right?"
"It's weird, but kind of sweet."
I wish someone paid that much attention to me.
Maybe there's someone that does.
And he's a lot closer than you think.
Have you tried... online dating?
"Damn it, Clark."
"Amy, I wanted to talk to you because..."
"Oh, I just thought of another crazy payroll story."
Buckle up.
"It was a Friday, of course..."
"That controls the automatic functions, breathing, sleeping, wakefulness, intestinal functions."
She can open her eyes but as a mechanical action.
"Her brain is dead, she's got no ideas or feelings."
Come in.
"Hey, you!"
Come on in!
"Yes, you."
Hello.
- My name's Benigno.
- Marco Zuloaga.
This is Alicia.
- Was it your first night here?
- Yes.
The first is the worst.
Then you get used to it.
What are those boots for?
They stop her feet from twisting sideways or falling forward.
- They look like Ibizan boots.
- Do they?
I've never been to Ibiza.
I know you.
From my writings?
No.
It was at the theatre.
We happened to be sitting together.
I didn't notice.
At one point you started to cry.
I told you about him.
"He cried watching ""Cafe Muller."""
I have to go.
So soon?
We haven't had a chance to talk.
There's still due process.
"Out here, due process is a bullet."
I want you to keep that lighter.
It belonged to a medical specialist in Captain Coleman's team.
"After delivering a Montagnard baby, he was on his way back to camp and..."
His friends found him about 3 clicks out.
"Beheaded, mutilated."
His wife couldn't have recognized him.
And that V.C. In there did it!
That has nothing to do...
Tell it to Captain Coleman.
And shout it loud because Arlington Cemetery's a long way from here.
DOC:
Next.
Now what is it this time?
That old ear bothering you?
Methiolate.
I'm not going to hurt you one bit.
Now just hold still.
That's it.
Don't move.

That's for you.
Take it.

I have an offer...
Zero.
You say island white is the most addictive narcotic on the market.
Where's your proof?
It takes a lot more than hired muscle and a shiny factory to impress me.
You want proof?
I want 100% customer retention.
Follow me.
"Guys, I found Bosley."
- What?
Where?
- Here...
"Here, and..."
"Oh, my God."
- That's Amanda Kane.

Looks like he's turned her into a human Guinea pig.
- I'm going in there.
- I'm riding shotgun.
I'll be your eyes and ears.
Meet your first and only customer.
- Who is she?
- She's nobody.
- She have a name?
- None she remembers.
Your narcotic's impressive.
Just keep looking.
"Pussycat, nice."
"Station him, park him for a bit."
"Oh, there's another animal coming along, what's that animal?"
Kangaroo.
Kangaroo and a pussycat.
Yeah.
They're fighting.
Yeah.
Who's winning?
The pussycat.
Let the pussycat kill the kangaroo.
OK.
So who's won?
Pussycat.
That is your spirit animal.
"Aah, that's nice."
You could've been anything you wanted to be in the world and you chose a pussycat.
You're a curious goat.
"Yes, I know, but..."
What I need you to do now is call to your guide.
"Make the cries of the pussy cat to the heavens,"
Sleet and I will join you.
DERMOT MEOWS SLEET BLARES
"It's a very quiet pussy cat, Dermot."
"Sleet, Sleet, that's great, can we hold the goat for a second?"
"Keep going, Dermot."
Sounds like a very sad pussy cat.
Or an owl.
"Sounds more like an owl, doesn't it?"
More like a sort of...
"Imagine, just a bit angrier."

He's good.
So go ahead.
Tell me to go fuck myself.
Tell me what a fucking bitch I am
Because I don't know what a good man I'm losing.
That's not what I was gonna say.
I will tell you this...
I wish we had more time.
"Somebody needs to go there and stomp that nigga, son!"
Entiende?
"Yeah, he lives up on Webster Ave,"
Right by my cousin Tina.
"Just say the word, E. Man, okay,"
"And it's done, we got you, man, we got you."
"You don't have to worry about shit, entiende?"
"(Man) We gonna fuck him up, E."
I'll handle it.

Hey!

I can handle a chair.
Go get a chair.
See what you're doing to him?
You're getting him all worked up.
- He's the toughest guy we know.
"- Yes, he is, but he..."
"Hey, Mac!"
"Get a chair, smash it on my back."
That's the right attitude.
He's got the right attitude.
I'll tell you what.
"Charlie, go put on those little short-shorts."
- Let's take things to the next level.
- Yeah.
- But first things first.
Let's get good and drunk.
- Let's get drunk!
- Whoa!
"How you doing, Ed?"
Ooh.
Terrible.
I feel like that drill was driving right through the top of my head.
It might be a good idea at that.
Let out that beer you slopped up last night.
"- Quit riding me, will you?"
- I ain't even started on you yet.
- Come on.
Let's eat.
"- No, Frank, I couldn't."
"Come on, do you good."
You gotta eat.
- I got just the thing to straighten you out.
- What is it?
Some nice ice-cold oatmeal smothered with lard.
Go get some more.
Yeah?
Let's get some more.
Come on.
"Tomato juice, eh?"
Hmm.
"Well, next best thing in the world for a hangover."
Yeah?
"Well, what's the best?"
Heh.
Laying off of the booze entirely.
What time did he roll in last night?
"Oh, I wouldn't know that."

Right.

Great.
We can talk finally.
There's nothing to talk about.
You were right.
I was wrong.
I'm sorry.
"It isn't that simple, Michael."
"You thinkyou can let the job be whoyou are... all you are, and you can't."
It's dangerous to think thatyou can.
I know I can be...
passionate...
- but I'm good at what I do.
- I know.
- It's no secret that things between us have been--
- Little rocky.
It isn't easy for me either.
"Evelyn comes along, and she's attractive... sweet, needy."
Don't deny it.
Fine.

Dinner's almost ready.
You and the kids get started without us.
"Come on, come on."
"Come on, come on."
Uh...
"It was my fault, not theirs, you know."
I-I pushed them into playing.
"Yeah, you're good at that."
Why did you do it?
The card game.
The kid you found dying in the street.
- No.
- How about not lying to me for once in your life?
I was trying to get out from under.
These guys-- they had my money.
Whose money?
The money for the... for the shop?
The money you loaned me-- it wasn't enough.
Shadab!
Wait!
Don't beat!

"You are bloodied angry, today."
"You are no more that Faiz, who I had loved."
Yes.
Just a little shaken.
"Well, that's understandable."
"Don't worry, I got all the ones in the mall."
You're safe for now.
Ugh.
Blue looking for someone?
"Well, someone's found you."
[grunts]
Yah!
Ugh! Hello?
Is anyone here?
Are those things gone?
I thought they were going to get us.
You're safe.
I took care of them.
But now I need you to help take care of the school.
Look for any other kids that might be hiding.
We've all got to look out for each other now.
Stay strong.
You guys can do this. [grunting and groaning]
"Oh boy, oh boy."
It's good to see you.
I was so worried.
Are you all right?
Ugh.
We're fine.

Oh.
It's so good to see you guys.
"Likewise, buddy."

There's Pete Campbell.

They went without me?
"Oh, which hurts, but I should save them, which will require swimming."
"Hmm, just had those saltines and cottage cheese 20 minutes ago."
"So, in ten more minutes, I should be G-2-G."
I met the nicest couple from Baltimore.
They said their neighbor's granddaughter would be perfect for me.
You think that's code for fat or black?
Probably both.
A wee little thing like you should be enjoying yourself.
Do you like to get high?
"Mm, naughty girl."
I only have this much.
"Uh, we can do blowbacks."
"Oh, it's been a while since I've had that... but I don't think so."
Do you have a light?
"Hm, sure!"
I knew I would be of some use.

"Hey, man, you know what's good for your health?"
Get off the table.

Hey.
No problem.
No problem at all.
"Lay it down, pal."
"Sonny, relax."
"Now this little guy didn't mean it, right?"
"Robbie, let me handle this."

"Hey, what's the matter with you?"
- That's the fourth drill you've burnt up.
"- Well, what's it to you?"
Dombrowski's trying to sweat a record out of us.
"Listen, Frank, get down to work and quit knocking Joe."
Let her down.
We could've missed something.
All right?
"Look, here's the plan."
We're gonna...
"Um, start a fire in the kitchen, and it'll distract them."
Then we'll run.
There is no plan.
What are you gonna do with that?
I don't know.
I shouldn't have borrowed that money.
"No, Blair, this is not your fault."
Okay?
It's not.
All right.
Two kids come back from Christmas break.
"The first kid says to the second kid,"
I had the best Christmas ever.
"Got a new XBOX with every single game for it, a new bicycle, season tickets to my favorite basketball team."
What did you get?
"Second kid says, I only got a sweater."
"First kid says, why."
Second kid says...
"It's because I don't have cancer, Jimmy."
I know you're scared.
"No, it's..."
Actually kind of funny.
I'm pregnant.

Shut up.
You know very well there are no wreckers anymore.

The tide may have washed up the bodies.
I asked you if you were there.
- What about you?
Were you there?
- Me?
No.
I was herel
"So, why have you got blood on your shirt?"
You're crazy.
There's nothing there.
God curse the wreckers!
The sun is rising over the shore!
A sad and gray day!
The tide is out!
I can see two small figures.
They are getting up!
- They start walking.
- That's enough!
- Shut up!
- They are still weak.
They support each other and stagger forward.
Be warned.
Let him go.
Husband...!
Who are you and what do you want?
"I'm a local salt cooker named Pan-dong, sir."
And?
I came to give you an important information.
Could I possibly get my tax reduced in return?

"No, no!"
You'll have a big problem in your hands unless something is done!
A big problem?
"Sir, are you all right?"
Thanks.
Be careful.
Arrest this man!
What is the meaning of this!
Let go!
We know what you've been going around doing.
I have done nothing wrong!
We'll find out once we get to the government canter.
Take him away!
Let go!

I think it's time for us to go.
"Listen, would you wait for me outside?"
Okay.
I'll be there in a minute.

It was strange.

It often sneaks in and scratches my furniture.
What a pain!

"The sad little brother, Jeremy."
And there's Caroline.
Obnoxious Caroline.
"I got all of my info from her, by the way."
"She had no idea who I was, and she wouldn't stop yapping."
Aww.
And there's Matt.
"Friend, ex, Yappy's future ex."
Lots of connections there.
- Matt's not involved in this.
"- He's involved with you, isn't he?"
"Look, you shouldn't be here."
You need to leave.
No.

"- It is not exhausted, is there!"
"Begone, by!"
Disappear!
- Then say it!
I want to wear my old dress!
"Oh, dear."
"We'll look for work, even something on the street!"
Why?
Where'd you get that fur?
Where'd you get this?
I ran into an old friend.
- And he told you about me?
No.
- And you let him give you furs?
- Yes!
But I can't give you presents?
"Franz, let's dress like before and look for work."
You're not gonna tell me who it was?
I made that up!
Where'd you meet?
On the street?
While I'm risking my neck and showering you with money?
"Get away from me, you tramp!"
You tramp!
Damn you!
Get out of my sight!
I'm out risking my neck and slaving away like crazy!
Franz!
Let me go!
Let go!
This is my home!
Leave me alone!
This is my home!
Open this door!
Just wait until I ―
"Now, we are famed for our seafood."
You what?
See food?
What's 'see food'?
"Fruits de mer, sir - cockles, whelks, crabs, mussels..."
Them shiny pebbles?
"That's food, is it?"
"They are something of a delicacy, sir."
"Well, bung 'em in the bag."
And give me one of them pies with legs.
"No, no!"
Keep still!
"No, you're not even supposed to be in here."
Two points for straight in?
Wicked.
And one point if it goes in off the backboard.
Backboard?
Do you mean me?
What are we calling this game?
How about...
'Get the ball in the jug'?
Or 'Super juggy throw throw'?
Or...
Jugball?
"Yes, jugball!"
You're a genius!
We should play every day.
Make it company policy.
"Right, yeah!"
Brilliant.
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
That would be brilliant.
But need no urging in the night

"Not yet, but it's an Arab club, so Natanel, forget your disposable forks"
- and take off your skullcap.
- Are you crazy?
- Or wait in the hotel.
- It's my right to wear it.
- What's that got to do with it?
- Don't shout.

"- Yes, you are."
"Fine, I'm shouting."
Happy?
I know this music.
Isn't this...?
What is this place?
"Judging by the food, it's still a Lebanese restaurant-."
Judging by the hairdos it's Yemenite.
Israelis?
- They're onto us.
- Should I take it off?
- You're paranoid.
- So why are you whispering?
Tel Aviv?
Are you from Tel Aviv?
- Jerusalem.
- Why didn't you say so?
Menashe!
All Israelis are our guests.
We'll treat you like kings.
I'll get you drinks and we'll have a toast.

And that is you will never see me dance.
I'll put money on it.
"One day, you'll dance."
Who's that out there?
Jude Cassidy.
Don't think I care for you.
I just need you alive.
"What do you mean, he's gone?"
Argument about the M25 got out of hand.
An argument with the M25?
You can't leave me here on my own.
"I don't know who to go to, Rose."
No sign of him leaving Mercer's flat.

Hello?
"Hello, is anyone there?"
Hello?
- I didn't...
- What?
- Know anything.
- What didn't you know?
It wasn't...
You knew.
- Mwah!
Oh!
Mwah!
[Chuckles] Wait till I tell the ladies.
"- Okay, noon."
Noon.
"- Oh, ladies?"
Ladies!
What the hell?
What's that about?
I just wanna give them what we have.
What we have is 500 miles to drive.
"Yeah, but we came and we disrupted their lives, and I just feel like we owe them something."
"Yeah, we actually do..."
$230 for a night's stay.
Or how about you can support me on this?
I think it's disgusting.
Whoa!
What?
The two of them together is just gross!
It should be illegal!
"All right, I'm done with this."
- Come with me.
"- Dad, help me on this!"
"I'm not gonna help you, you little bigot."
Let me show you something.
See that crazy old man right there?
- He comes here every day...
- Hey!
To protest the love in this house.
"Yeah, and he's right."
Certain people just don't belong together.
Whatever happened started inside.
There was some kind of fight.
He grabbed some scissors and chased her out here.
Find me the station manager.
I want a list of every employee that was here last night.
"Make that every employee, period."
"Yes, sir."
Any idea on motive?
I guess you could say that there were 12 million people with a motive.
"Myself, included."
This was the lotto girl.
She broke my heart three times a week.
What is that?
What is what?
On her fingertips.
Is that paint?
Yeah.
Looks like it.
"Hey, Gabby."
Take a sample from her left fingers.
Okay.
Excuse me.
Mr. Monk?
I have a nephew.
He's 10 years old.
He's your biggest fan.
He...
He clips articles.
He thinks you're cooler than Spiderman.
Really?
Kids.
"If I could get your autograph, he'd think I'm some kind of hero."
It's written in my notebook right here.
See that?
"""It looks like her number came up."""
Let's see your notebook.
I didn't write it down.
I just thought of it.
"Please, come on!"
Can you believe this guy?
You know what?
"I'm gonna have your badge, officer Kil."
"Come on, Shecky, let's walk it off."
Excuse me.
I'm Stan Lawrence.
I'm the station manager.
- Here's that list you wanted.
"- Great, great."
I'll make sure they get it.
How long did she work here?
Not long.
Just a few weeks.
I still can't believe it.
I should've put more lights back here.
"No, you can't blame yourself."
It was after midnight.
The parking lot was empty.
More lights wouldn't have made a difference.
"Thank you, officer."
That's very nice of you to say.
I'm not an officer.
I work with Mr. Monk.
Is that Adrian Monk?
I've heard of him.
- That is it!
"- Come on, baby!"
Come on!
Come on!

"Thank you, honey."
Good night.

- Too much fun.
My daughters house beats.
Always use stops.
I do not trust him.
"- Well, Rook is a party man."
- So.
He carries the goods under the counter.
I stand here and had to protect the interests of Arment'in.
The problem is that not only protects their interests.
Arment'e tried to say but I did not listen to me.
What can I do?
The man's son.
So we need to go to the shipment to go somewhere I want to sağlamanı.
And all of them.

Of course.
Take the week off-- protecting my investment.
I appreciate that.

- What do you mean?
- You haven't heard?
That Victor kid kicked the crap out of him.
His mom said he worked him over really good.
When the fuck was this?
I guess.
I thought you knew.
Like I told you:
"Hit me again, I said."
Do you remember?
Nobody knows what the girl has gone through.
But now we must speak about it.

I have only written here.
Poste restante.
Mr Harald Brennemann
I have no identity card.
- Maybe you have his forwarding address?
- Where has he moved to?
I don't know.
To the West.
"Brennemann, Brennemann..."
Brennemann...
Brennemann...
"No, but there are a bunch of letters there."
"Christ, no!"
- He never picked them up.
- He can still come by.
"- Please, I'd like to have them back."
"- No, it's not that simple, Miss."
- They are returned to sender.
"- But please, that's me."
"- Yes, by postal route, Miss."
"- But please, I no longer have an address."
They could get into the hands of strangers.
"Please, give me the letters."
- Please!
Baber's story checked out.
You guys are free to go.
"Huh, technically, I'm supposed to say that."
Yeah.
Oh!
I'm sorry.
You can tell them about the fertilizer.
"Well, it turns out Baber, being the frugal shopper that he is, bought the cheap stuff,"
So what you have couldn't even blow up a dollhouse. [ They laugh. ]
Uh-huh!
"Could not blow up a dollhouse, could I?"
- Challenge accepted!
- No!
No!
No!
That's not what he meant!
Thanks for letting us go.
And for not waterboarding us or making us stare at the moon.
- O...
K.
- OK!
"Let's go, you guys"
I'll buy you an ice-cream sundae for your troubles.
"Oh, no!"
"Sweetie, I'm fine!"
"Yes, absolutely, I'm fine."
They dropped the charges.
"Well, there really were no charges, so I'm a free man!"
What?
"Oh, that's great!"
That's great news!
Amaar!
You didn't even think about it.
what the fuck does 520 have to do with 469?
520 ain't even close to 469.
What's that got to do with anything?
Piece of cake.
Don't worry about the alarms.
I just got to get a key.
No problems?
I'll take care of it.
Tell him what you were telling me.
Too good to be true.
Big score coming from Air France.
Bags of money coming in.
Americans change their money over into French money and send it back here.
Calm down.
It's beautiful.
totally untraceable.
but I got a plan.
he's a piece of work.
all cash.
The best time is probably over a weekend.
So maybe Saturday night.
There's a Jewish holiday Monday.
They won't find out until Tuesday.
Beautiful.
What about the security?
Security?
You're looking at it.
It's a joke.
I'm the midnight-to-eight man.
He just comes in like he's picking up lost baggage.
It's beautiful.
Nanteuil.
What's the matter?
We've been robbed.
- How?
- On the train.
The gold was bound for the Bank of Munich.
It wasn't monitored?
The conveyors didn't last long.
- They were thrown off the train.
- By whom?
A man.
Dressed in black.
A conveyor crashed on a pylon.
The others could make it but they're in poor shape.
A man.
All in black.
- Are you Mr Fandor?
"- Yes, why?"
"You must go at once to 46 Bonaparte St, 4th Floor."
This is Juve's address.
You must be mistaken.
No.
Not at all.
"Fandor, my boy!"
My boy!
Juve?
Is that you?
It's me in the flesh.
"When Lady Beltham's hotel blew up, you were found dead under the rubble."
"This is what I have made believe, in agreement with the Director of the force, Mr Havard."
"Immediately after the explosion, several of my men were found dead, some shredded."
One of them was unrecognizable.
- She's adorable in any outfit.
She is.
Damn her.
I looked like...
I literally look like a man who is...
Like a man who's...
A big man in this school uniform.
I don't know what you're talking about.
- Who invented that?
- You're nuts.
"- Ari, you look adorable."
"- Oh, thank you, honey."
And I look like crap.
Fluffy.
- Fluffy.
Fluffy.
- Fluffy.
Fluffy.
"- Here we are, two girls..."
- Exuberant.
...off into the night.
You just came out of that door looking like you're surprised that you came out of that door.
- How did you achieve that?
- What does that mean?
You came out of the door like you didn't expect to.
Maybe one of the one of the ADs just pushed me out.
"- Oh, right."
- I didn't realize that we were rolling.
"Is it true that there's only, like, a few Yugos in the world?"
Here's a story:
I hit my head here really hard.
- It hurt.
- Would you?
- Mm.
"And, well... kinky."
Filthy.
Just arseholes.
A pair of complete and utter kinked-up... filthy racist arseholes.
"We've just left a vulnerable young boy with a pair of not only instinctive killers, but heinous pervs."
You do realise I'm zipping my coat up and going back there?
"Yeah, and I'm coming with you."
Mitchell?
Yeah?
Mitchell?
Are you packing?
"Unpacking, still."
"Oh, boys."
Your phone rang.
"Oh, thank you."
It's a withheld number.
Which usually means something official.
"Like a job, say."
They've left a message.
- It won't be good news.
"- Oh, you don't know that."
- Put it on loudspeaker.
- Uh.
Go on.
"Please, please, please."
"Hello, John."
This is Nita Mawulawde.
- That's how you say it.
- Duh.
I'm calling in regard to your interview this morning.
"Brígida Bonazzi. divine, it enters, Brígida Bonazzi, enters, enters, between..."
"Ah, you, Brígida Bonazzi are very good."
It will not do damage to him?
"No, it will seat to him either, it will seat to him very or."
"Oh, what pretty you are..."
You have paid attention?
"Small nose, small nose, small nose..."
Nothing is heard.
In the end that son of puta fuck really.
What is going to fuck that.
-You are very bad?
poor truth?
"-Who, I?"
"Oh, there are lost the memory."
"Calm, now you will see."
"Yes, yes, I want to see."
"Well, slowly, first I clear this to me..."
You do not hear anything?
Listening...
"-Thus, slowly?"
eh?
-Yes.
"Yes, now you will see pretty legs."
Thus...
Thus...
Fuck!
Now you are going to see.
"It quiets, you do not move, I am in charge."
-Let go.
I do not touch myself.
-It quiets.
You do not resist.

"Ariel, I was flying-- I was--"
"Ofcourse I was flying, and I-I saw the-- the watch--"
The witch was watchin' the mirror... and she was singin' with a stolen set of pipes.
Do you hear what I'm tellin' you?
The prince is marrying the sea witch in disguise!
- Are you sure about this?
- Have I ever been wrong?
"I mean, when it's important?"
What are we gonna do?
Before the sun sets on the third day.
"Ariel, grab onto that."
"Flounder, get her to that boat as fast as your fins can carry you."
I'll try!
I gotta get to the sea king.
He must know about this.
- Wh-What about me?
What about me?
- You!
"Boy, what a night!"
I'm so glad that is over with.
"- Oh, well, nothing lasts forever."
- In sports...
Together forever.
- Together forever.
- What a nice surprise.
Together forever.
Hey!
"So, what's up?"
I think we both may have said some things I might regret.
- Together forever.
"- Gosh, your eye is pretty."
"Look, I know you're upset, so..."
Why don't we just sit down and discuss this!
Then they ate me.
They're gonna do that all the way home.
I gotta go.
They were my ride.
Wait a minute.
"If they eat you, how is it that you're still here?"
Did you not say this was a true story?
Busted.
"You made it up, didn't you?"
I...
"Hey, look!"
Lord Farquaad's ghost!
Doody heads!
And then there were three.
Who else wants to step up?
"I, too, have a terrifying tale to tell."
It was a dark and stormy night.
We got from now on to celebrate.
"- I'm not hungry, Mrs. Grogan."
- You've got to eat.
All you had for lunch was a can of tomatoes.
Go on and eat.
"- Oh, don't worry."
I'll be over this tomorrow.
- You will if you stay home tonight.
- Yeah.
"- Never mind, I'll get it."
Hello?
Oh.
"Just a moment, please."
"Ed, it's for you."
Mrs. Danvers.
"- Thanks, Betty."
"- You're welcome, I'm sure."
Hello?
"Hello, Eddie."
"Oh, I'm fine."
I just wanted to find out how you were.
Huh?
"Oh, gee, that's too bad."
"Say, it must have been the gin chasers."
It couldn't have been the beer.
"Oh, I just called up to tell you I'm not mad about what you said last night."
No.
"Well, you know, about our not having any more dates."
"No, I've forgiven you already."
Uh-huh.
I couldn't stay mad at a swell guy like you.
"Well, that's fine."
Why won't these people let me do my job?
I know!
What's that stuff you're always playingwith?
"""Silly Putty""!"
It calms me down.
"'Hobos on a Grassy Knoll""?"
I love them.
- They're the best band!
"- You know ""Hobos on a Grassy Knoll""!"
"Totally! ""The Americans"" is my favorite song!"
"That's impossible, no one in the States knows them."
I saw them when they went to London last March...
- in Cambridge.
- That's insane!
I was there!
Get out of here!
You were there?
That's crazy!
I worship this poster.
Where did you get it?
"- Well, I designed that, actually."
- Do you know them?
Bob Green and I went to Eton together.
"Paul, I've been looking everywhere for you."
"Everywhere except my office, I guess."
I heard you were in the shitter.
Roxanne needs you to discuss the concept for the cover shoot...
"Pardon me, Jocelyn."
"Hey, cut it out."
You can't go through his drawers.
- Does he not smoke?
What is this?
"Because I should feel terrible, and I don't."
"And you're right, it does feel good to say that."
Dam... broken!
Go-to guy!
"Hey, girls!"
I did it.
I broke this dude's dam.
"Hey, I'm going to bed."
"Okay, I love you."
You can sleep outside if it makes you feel more comfortable.
"Oh, and make sure to close the window so the alarm sets."
I got it.
See?
Go team!
"Uh, or you can just keep it open, in case there's a fire, so you can just throw me out of it."
I love you.
Ugh.
"Oh, balls."
"Oh, my God, a squirrel!"
Aah!
"Okay, calm down."
I...
I can't.
You know I hate rats.
"Okay, it's just a squirrel."
"No, no, squirrels are just sexy rats."
Everybody knows that.
"I think it touched my leg, ugh."
Where is it?
"I don't know, I don't know, all I feel is a squirrel touch, ugh."
"Okay, it's fine, all right?"
"It is much more scared of us than we are of it, all right?"
- Lucy...
- Yes?
"Lucy, I..."
"I don't know what you're expecting tonight, but I..."
I...
I think you should know that...
"Mama, I do know."
"Goodbye, Mother."
"Goodbye, Daddy."
Bye.
"Billy, you missed your tea."
"And you, Faber."
Have something at the pub.
- Thanks.
I'll just have a wash.
- See you there.
"- Freddy, can I come?"
- I don't know about that.
- You in the army yet?
- Tell him about that miracle cream.
"Oh, yeah."
Will you tell Mrs Garden I'll be late?
My mate Harry's got this cream that takes all the pimples off...
"Mr Faber, I've kept a nice piece of meat pie warm for you."
- We mustn't let that go to waste.
"- Not with this rationing, we mustn't."
I'll be down in a minute.
"24 hours isn't very long for a honeymoon, is it?"
We can start right now.
There's a bottle of bubbly down there.
So there is.
- There we are.
I believe that my prayers will be heard there!
How can the medicine work when you are hungry?
Are you hungry?
You are starving for last two days.
And you claim that you are not hungry?

"O God, I have looked for him everywhere!"
But I couldnt find him.
I dont know how he is doing now.
"God, you have bestowed me with everything."

My mother says she's well.
Has she eaten or not?
"Yesterday evening, she took her a meal."
She didn't touch it.
My young uncle fed her.
He's fallen out with my mother.
They don't speak.
Why?
He wanted to feed her?
No.
They fell out a long time ago.
"Why is he your ""young uncle""?"
- How many do you have?
- Three.
- Are the others older?
- Yes.
Bravo.
Where are they?
"One is in Ahwaz, the other in Kermanshah and I don't know where the third one is."
Don't they visit their mother?
"Yesterday evening, my uncle told my mother that his holidays were over."
But they've fallen out.
How did he tell her?
My uncle speaks to her but my mother doesn't reply.
- The others aren't coming?
- No.
"Yesterday, my uncle told my mother that he has to go back."
He's leaving then?
Yes.
What about us?
I don't know.
I have exams that I have to take.
Lamaze.
Is that where they do the breathing that ease the pain?
"Yeah, it actually works."
"You know, you breathe fast and then slow, you know, like..."
"I don't know, like-- like a dog or something."
I wouldn't touch that line with a road crew tour bus.
Do you remember everything you've ever touched?
I'm just saying.
"Gentlemen, seriously, this has been a pleasure."
"Don't hurt yourselves tonight, all right?"
Take care of yourself.
"All right, Morgan--"
All right.

"Come on, let's go."

The body is lying outside
"Dad, don't know who did it this time?"
"Brother Y an, you see!"
You see!
Who killed him?
Who killed him?
Who did that?
"Brother Y an, what should we do?"
"That's right, Brother Y an, what should we do?"
What should we do?
Let's go!
"Go, go!"
"Wait, it'll be dangerous for us to stay here!"
What do you mean?
"If we stay here, we'll be killed all the same!"
I guess we should leave tomorrow!
T omorrow?
Now!
The bad guys of the boxing world
"I'm sorry, did I scare you all?"
How come everyone is here?
You want to flee?
Leaving Y an Qingwang here all by himself?
He'll be lonely!
So it's you!
It's too late now to know!
No wonder you look like a pig!
"Y an Qingwang, why are you so late?"
You should've come sooner to see my act
"You bastard, since you're here!"
My brothers died suddenly
Okay.
Action.
Careful.
The kid's pretty messed up.
Kept talking about some broad called Nancy.
I guess that must be you.
To which she replies...
Ooh.
I'm Rose.
This is Nancy.
The Nancy.
To which you say...
Rose...
"Do you know, if one were 20 years younger and differently inclined, one might almost be tempted."
Cat-
- Catrin...
Catrin!
"Cat, don't make me run."
"They're always gonna be like that, aren't they?"
"Younger, in awe of you, like I was."
"Oh, come on, Cat, you had a choice."
You didn't choose me.
I'll come back in a few days and move my things.
"Oh, for God's sake, the flat's yours."
You're the one who pays the rent.
"Anyway, I'm going to Manchester tomorrow."
They decided to take the exhibition on tour.
"It's a success, then?"
It's a success.
I'm glad.
Hmm.
"You know, the first time I painted you outside the steelworks... maybe I shouldn't have shown you walking away."
"Please, come in."
We can do it like this.
I wouldn't like to bother you.
I have a plea for you.
- For me?
"Please, come in!"
Let's not stand here.
It's maybe inadequate.
The thing is delicate.
"They're not dangerous, aren't they?"
No... please come.
"Sit, please."
You just speak.
I don't know where to start.
Excuse me...
Have we met before?
No.
I wouldn't say so.
"You see, this is a bit..."
Would you rent me a room?
Me?
- Yes.
Have somebody send you to me?
"It's a mistake, then."
"No, I come by myself."
I heard in the neighborhood that you're a loner.
"I'm a loner, too."
"I was living in Trešnjevka, Gorjanska street."
It's a very similar street to this one.
So I thought...
I know Gorjanska street!
"You see, I was living there for two years, and now I got fired."
We need a new set of jerseys for the under-fifteen lads.
They've all grown bigger since the start of the season.
"Here, we'll take a few for Sharon's snapper, will we?"
That's a very good idea.
No!
"Here you go, Georgie."
Here.
There.
"Thanks very much, lads."
That's great.
"Oh, give a little."
Helps a lot.
- Gobshite.
- Absolutely.
Listen...
Do you think she'll get married?
What's that?
"Oh, no."
No.
"Jesus, no."
"They've more cop-on these days, eh?"
"I mean, would you get married... if you were that age again... these days?"
- What?
- I think I'm going to cry.
"Anyway, I wouldn't want Sharon getting married that young."
She's her whole life ahead of her.
Exactly.
Unless she drinks an iffy pint.
Having a baby's the most natural thing in the world.
- That's right!
"- Oh, good shite!"
"Olé, olé, olé, olé"
-...on your memorable family experience.

"Just a reminder, though, this is going to be worth half your final grade."
Leave him alone.
WYATT:
Don't screw it up.
"-Shh, I'm going for a record."
WYATT:
"Um, what you write about...."
I said leave him alone.
WYATT:
--than how you write about it.
I wanna know how--
"You wanna take his place, midget?"
WYATT:
"I'm looking for the brutal, funny..."
-Yeah.
Sure.
-...maybe even the painful truth.
WYATT:
"Okay, everybody, if you have any questions?"
"All right, let's get started."
Good luck.

[BOY MOANS AND GASPS]
Sorry.
I meant the other Mario.
I've abandoned him to his fate.
- He behaved very badly.
Did you send him the bill?
- I don't think now's the time.
"Do you think, they'll condemn him, Sir?"
- It depends on who defends him.
If it gets into the hands of any old pettifogger..
- He's toast!
"Poor Mario, he was so nice!"
- Isolina!
"Noble Ophelia, get thee to a nunnery!"
"No thank you, Sir."
I don't smoke!
"- Oh, sorry."
"- Excuse me, sister."
These clients are serious.
- Yeah?
- They have a ton of money.
They have the fuel.
- Praise God..
May he always be praised.
- Always!
"Bye, Dad."
- We must go now.
"Yes, sister."
"Be strong, Isolina."
"Blessed sister, you don't know what it's like to have two husbands."
"Be brave, daughter."
You'll see that you too will find peace here.
I have great need of it.

Ignore her.
She's been doing that all morning.
What a nutjob.
"So, how about you check with the local dermatologist."
See if there's any medical records on Heung-guk or that woman.
"Stop it, you tramp!"
I can't believe this.
"It's important, you idiot!"
The rash is the link here.
"Come on, hurry."
Stop it!
You could hurt somebody!
Community Health Center
"Oh, my."
You're really getting on my nerves!
Where do you live?
Are you from this village?
Hey.
Don't come near me!
Dammit!
The lady killed them all.
What?
In there.
In that room.
What are you talking about?
"The old woman got a shaman to do some ritual, but the lady refused."
That's why they all got killed.
Are you a family member?
"No, I'm not."
Then who are you?
Come with me.
Hey!
I envy you. with the nonsense that comes out of their mouths...
Makes you wonder the whole point of it all.
Shit.
Don't worry.
We won't need it.
Stay here.
Mr. Munson.
What brings y'all this way?
Why don't you ask your boys? right?
I have an easement with the previous owner of your property.
Huh.
Bullshit.
"Previous"" being the operative word."
Who's this?
Just a guy telling you to get back in your nice truck.
Go play Okie dickhead somewhere else.
Carl it looks like Mr. Munson hired some muscle.
Looks that way.
He's a friend of mine.
A friend with a big mouth.
I hear that a lot.
too.
More than I'd like.
Then you know the drill.
I'mma count to three and you're gonna start walking away.
I got rights to this water.
One.
I have a lawyer now.
Two.
- Three.
- Ah.
Ah.
What's it take to get a menu here?
"Okay, I'll handle it."
That's all right.
I'll handle it.
And ruin your popularity?
"You know what, why don't you guys just sneak out the back?"
What's going on with you two?
Hey!
How's it going?
Hey!
Front door.
Hi.
"Hey, guys."
How you guys doing?
"You like the food here, too?"
It's pretty awesome.
"Shut up, queer."
"Well, at least I don't shave my chest."
What'd you say?
"Luke, come on."
I just said you look nice in a sweater vest.
It was a compliment.
"Do you want me to break you, Cohen?"
Hey!
No way.
Look who's back.
"You know, you're a little far from Eight Mile."
"Luke, don't!"
"What are you, like spokesperson for geeks of America or something?"
You know what I like about rich kids?
Nothing.
That was awesome!
Okay sir.
Want to hear their death cries?
Listen.
- No one should escape.
"- Gocha, my father  my people."
Tell police not to shoot them.
Hello... hello...
There are little children.
Hello... hello...
Do you think I will cry  beg you?
Those who are in the bus are your men not mine.
You said Konda Reddy called us.
But you are taking us elsewhere.
"If you're a smart ass,"
I am a much smarter ass.
I know you will do such a thing.
You said you framed them.
I changed everything.
There is an important guest in the bus.
Do you know who it is?
Where are you trying to escape?
Why are you leaving us?
Police?
Go  catch them.
- Listen.
- Go fast!
Those who kidnapped the marriage party are running away.
- Who are you?
- I am Konda Reddy's brother.
I know Konda Reddy's brother.
I am Gocha's son-in-law.
Does this dirty face need Gocha's sister?
- I have one ready.
Give him milk when he wakes up.
Try not to excite him.
"Thank you, Doctor."
And now you'd best have a look at this rump.
- You've humiliated me.
- Good.
You'll be too embarrassed to speak of it.
No-one must know what's happened.
"- Gentlemen, do I have your word?"
- Yes.
"And you, monsieur?"
"After all the time we spent together, how could you?"
In cold blood?
It was easy.
You're a menace to the future of art.
Goodbye.
Remember what the doctor said.
Try not to excite him.
- He needs peace.
- I know what he needs.
Go home.
Paint something dead.
- Aurora?
- Yes.
I feel very weak.
- Have I been wounded?
- No.
No.
"On the contrary, you wounded him."
"In his shooting arm, too."
He never even had time to fire.
H i.
Very funny.
So I guess you've heard.
Sharon's dad is okay.
That's great.
"No, I hadn't heard."
I'm obviously the last person in Pittsburgh to hear.
- So you're friends with Sharon now?
"- Well, so, you are, right?"
Look.
"We all know what's going on around here, okay?"
- Which is that you are jealous.
- What?
And you.
You are totally flipped because...
Rayanne finally did something nice for once in her life.
Which she did by taking Sharon to go visit her dad.
And now both of you just want to be sure that you both still are friends.
Which you are.
So shut up!
Let's kill him.
"Say a prayer, Vasquez."
I'm going to kill him.
"- l've been knocking, but..."
- What?
Your mom let me in.
I came to drop off your bag.
- What are you listening to?
- A group you probably hate.
"Okay, I'll go."
I'm glad your dad is going to be okay.
My father almost died.
That's how I ended...
That's how I ended up here.
My God.
That's why I'm here.
He was right.
Who was right?
You saw Leek.
- He was part of the warning.
- What?
He was part of the warning.
"Stop, stop, stop."
I didn't want to scare you.
He said...
He said the messages are real.
Something terrible is gonna happen.
"Connie, please."
We have to leave here now.
I will not live my life like that.
I will not make decisions based on messages from Indrid Cold.
He may be real to you.
He's not real to me.
"Okay, I'm going to Charleston."
I'll be at the Marriott.Get yourself reassigned.
I don't want you anywhere near the plant today.
What if nothing happens?
What if there's no great tragedy?
What'll you do then?
- That's not the point.
"- Well, I think it is the point."
- Gordon believed what he heard too.
- I am not Gordon!
I know.
"By erasing Simeon, you made space for me."
I fill him now.
"More than snow, more than Simeon - even this old body is strong in my control."
Argh!
Do you feel it?
Winter is coming!
Argh!
Winter is coming!
"No, you must fight!"
"Hang on and fight, boy, you can do it!"
Captain Latimer...
your children... they are afraid.
Hold them.
It's not really my area.
It is now.
What's happening?
Doctor!
The globe.
It's turning to rain.
"All of it, the snow, look."
He's dead.
What happened?
"The snow mirrors, that's all it does."
It's mirroring something else now.
"Something so strong, it's drowning everything else."
There was a critical mass of snow at the house.
If something happened there...
Salty.
Salt water rain.
It's not raining.
It's crying.
"The only force on Earth that could drown the snow, a whole family crying on Christmas Eve."
Faiz is in danger.
They will kill him.
Why are you'll looking at my face?
Go and call for the priest!
Go!
"Where are you, priest?"
How long will you take?
This marriage should happen today.
Talk to the priest later.
"Tell me where my brother is, first."
Did you mortgage him to me?
Listen you prince!
"If something happens to my brother, I shall destroy your world."
Threaten someone else!
Kayyub!
Come on!
Come on!
"Come on, inside!"
Brother we have put the girl in the vehicle.
"Your ""Would be"" bride shall be with us."
"Give me my brother and take away your ""Would be"" bride."
- Come on!
- Away!
Away!
"If something happens to my brother, everyone shall be killed."
"Brother, the girl!"
Sit in the car!
You'll attack us?
Get up!
Get up!
Don't beat!
Shadab!
I have decided this!
Let Yawang do it.
"And go to the location immediately,"
- to know more about the environment!
- Yes.
"Mr. Qu, Shanhua Desig n Garden Company is here for the design plan."
"Thank you, Mr. Qu!"
"You are new staff in Shanhua Gardening, right?"
"Yes, I am ."
Your attitude is not bad!
Excuse me!
"I have to deliver the plan, and leave now!"
Good bye!
Thank you!
- See you tomorrow!
- Yawang!
No way!
You shouldn't ask me to work like a slave!
Don't play around!
Do you want this job?
Or you can leave!
Not like that!
I just pout to get your sympathy.
My body can not afford to work any longer.
I want to cry!
Oh mine!
"Each one of you, having done so little work, are leaving so punctually!"
Who is her?
"She is our Department Manager, eho resguested male trainees included you to work in this site."
Hi.
My name is Zhang Jingyu.
I am Yawang's friend.
Leave Ringo alone.
Who the hell are you?
Let her go.
"Wait, you're him?"
Ringo...
You really are beautiful.
Mister...
You're Casshern!
No doubt about it!
They say the Ruin will stop if we eat you.
"Well, that story's too dumb for me to believe."
"But, I understand why some would want to believe it."
I've never seen a body as brand new as yours.
"But I'll never get to see it again, once I smash you--"
What are you...?
!
Mister...
S-Stop!
Don't.
I don't... wanna... die...
Ohji...
Stay away.
I don't believe my eyes.
Crying in sadness as you bid farewell.
"I thought it, but now I've seen your true colors myself."
Your ability to kill like that is impressive.
Yours is the lowest form of existence!
It always has been.
Do you know my past?
Enough to know that I want to kill you.
Tell me.
What am I?
I don't want to let them down.
"No, of course not."
"Well, I leave on Monday, and I'll be back in London for the exhibition."
I suppose it's not so very far off.
"No, it's not so very far off."
And I'll come and visit as often as I can.
"Right, then."
Veal's off.
I've ordered cutlets Milanese... and semolina... pudding.
You are Mr. Ambrose Hilliard?
Yes.
"I'm Sophie Smith, Sammy's sister."
Ah.
His office.
"Last night, he was working late."
It was bombed.
They have asked me to identify him.
I am unable.
Mr. Hilliard?
Mr. Hilliard?
"I'm afraid, my dear, someone has made a mistake."
I almost did so myself.
"You see, Sammy Smith has two fingers missing from his left hand."
"I'm sorry, we try very hard to... to make a whole person."
For the relatives.
Oh!
Is it him?
Is it your friend?
My agent.
Yes.
That's him.
"You can stay with us, if you like."
"Oh, God."
"Oh Albert, I love you."
Do it this way.
Oh yeah...
Oh Albert!
(wistful cello music)
That'll be nice.
You can pick me up at the airport Charles de Gaulle...
Anna!
I met this guy...
"I look forward to work with you, too."
"No, I talked with them yesterday."
Thank you.
"OK, goodbye."
Au revoir.
- I met this handsome guy at the gym.
- So Albert is history now?
No.
"But he needs a place to stay, so I said my flatmate was going away."
"That's fine by me, as long as you take care of it all."
"Thank you, God!"
This guy will make your mouth water!
Tell Mr Mouthwatering that he can rent my room while I'm away.
He can pick up the keys on Saturday.
I love you!
If I'd known the true identity of this Mr Mouthwatering -
- I'd never have said yes.
- I know a trick.
- What's keeping him?
- What if he can't find it?
- Relax.
He's smart and he's gorgeous.
What?
It's no good.
I can't understand a word you're saying.
And don't get artistic.
Just peel the bloomin' thing.
Harris tweed.
Your father had a suit not dissimilar to this one.
I remember.
It lasted him for years.
"It's a lovely colour, Janet."
Hmm.
That's as may be.
That's it.
"You don't think it a little heavy for the summer, Mr. Penhaligan?"
"No, the advantage of tweed, Miss Widdington, is that it allows the wearer to breathe, as it were, because of the openness of the weave."
- I see.
- I like it.
It's also very hard wearing.
And the price?
Um... just over three guineas.
"Oh, good Lord."
[Whispering]
"Oh, yes."
And that includes an extra pair of trousers.
And without?
"Zip or button fly, sir?"
"Zip, please."
[Penhaligan]:
2 pounds and 15 shillings.
Fine.
Shirts?
Certainly.
What are you...?
Nothing.
Oh
"You know, it's okay if you don't wanna be my girlfriend."
You don't have to make stuff up...
- Can't we just keep things the way they are...?
- Yeah.. sure...
Well...
Do you... have to... do anything special?
when you go steady...?
No.
-So everything's the same?
- Yeah...
Okay.
- We can go steady.
- Really?
Yes.

Really?
"Well, listen."
"Since I already lost my deposit and all, maybe we should light up."
"No, thanks."
You sure?
"Well, is it cool if I burn one?"
Maybe you'll change your mind.
"Do what you want to do, I guess."
Hey.
What'd I say?
Nothing.
"I just have to go, is all."
What's this?
My 18-month chip.
I'm in recovery.
"And you know, pot is, like, stepping stones."
Recovery?
That's cool.
Right on.
I respect that.
"You know, I don't really burn much anymore."
It's just a sometime thing.
"But no more, like, in the house."
"So, you want to go grab some some dinner?"
I could really go for some Chinese.
"No, I better hit it."

Hey.
I didn't think I'd see you again.
"Look, I wanted to say thanks for the other night."
You always drink like that?
I thought you left.
I did.
I am.
"Ryan, we're all set."
You ready?
"Hi there, Marissa."
What are you doing?
Nothing.
We're just hanging out.
"Oh, look, it's somebody's birthday."
I guess my invitation probably got lost in the mail.
It's my friend Summer's birthday.
Summer's birthday is not till Wednesday.
That's what I heard.
I don't know.
That was a guess.
You guys are up to something.
"Dude, what did you tell her?"
I didn't tell her anything.
I think the black turtleneck in August tipped her off.
"Okay, I was going for stealth, and also it's slimming."
We should really go.
Have fun at your party.
You should probably be off.
Newport social scene awaits.
"Oh, yeah?"
Why won't you tell me where we're going?
This is pretty far away.
The Wu-tang Sword is really fierce.
Please stop or someone will get killed!
How come?
We're good friends.
"Mr. Wong, this way please!"
Let's go!
Shaolin and Wu-tang are really so fierce.
"Yes, Your Highness!"
I saw them fight myself.

If only...
"Your Highness, that's easy!"
We have gyms of both martial arts schools here.
We'll bring them here!
Wait.
- Sung Chi!
- Yes!
Invite the master of the Shaolin martial arts school here.
I have an idea!
Cheers!
I've always admired Shaolin kung-fu very much.
"Especially your kung-fu, Mr. Liu!"
"Not at all, Your Highness!"
"I just know a little, you don't have to praise me."
I haven't exaggerated it.
Your fist is really marvelous.
"Of course, if my master's kung-fu wasn't good,"
I wouldn't be his student.
Shut up!
"Please excuse her, she's spoiled!"
She's right.
-All right.

"He didn't lie to us, he lied to his father."
Huh.

I'm scared.
"Look, whatever's going on, just come home."
I can't.

"Alex, you do know that relationships between Pure Bloods and non Pure Bloods is frowned upon."
To speak nothing of a... financial arrangement between Erebus ans the House of Chthon...
Trust me.
"No one knows I'm here, this is strictly between you and me."
"So... take the money, buy whatever you want, but let Chase go."
You're buying me.
I'm rescuing you.
There's a difference.
"Yes, there is."
You're right.
"Since Berlin, I'm just not the same."
"Fine, go."
Let me say goodbye properly.
"Pour us a drink, Chase."
Let's toast to our new lifes.
To endings and beginnings.
Sorensen?
"Irene Bentley, I'm arresting you under suspicion of assisting an offender."
Excuse me.
Have you seen this man recently?
No.
"Thank you, sir."
Yes?
"- Excuse me, sir."
My name's DC Ashton...
No.
Excuse me.
Have you seen this man before?
"- No, sorry."
- Sure?
"Yeah, I'm sure."
I didn't know you were back.
We've brought in Renee Bentley.
I came back to join the manhunt... but I've just been sat in here for half an hour.
You need to see this.
Hudson and I found it in the Bentley lock-up.
It matches the bracelet Julie-Ann was wearing when she died.
"Yes, sir."
Understood.
Absolutely.
"Thank you, sir."
Super's finished the next-of-kin visit.
Think I'm gonna head off and see 'em myself.
Could you pass these on?
"It's the Guv's watch and wallet, and his warrant card."
"- Sarge, if you need a WPC..."
- Tennison...
"Like you said, I need to keep busy."
It's his wife and kids.
SlPOWlCZ:
"Ernie, listen to me."
- What?
- Was there anything good?
- What do you mean?
"If you stop now and nobody gets hurt, you won't have to go away."
"But before any of this, was there anything good in your life?"
"Yeah, I had my chair set up how I wanted."
Chicky and me had some things worked out.
"All right, you got your chair back, and I'm going to put Chicky in jail but I never noticed any shortage of whores in town."
"Now, come on, Ernie."
"What do you say, huh?"
"Come on, Ernie."
Come on.
Just take it easy.
Just relax now.
Come on.
That's it.
And he has to absolutely speak to me?
"Okay, I'll be right down."
KELLY:
You okay?
"- Yeah, thanks."
How you doing?
No fun busting this guy.
I think he's gonna get ROR'd.
- The booking's clear.
- Thanks.
DONNA:
"Detective, here's your file."
- I gotta take you to get fingerprinted.
- Thanks for the coffee.
Well ...
- Liar!
It is in vain ...
That's nice of you.
Addons For question 2.
"In addition, compared with a tattoo on the back"
"Addons have pircing on the scrotum, created three years ago."
How nice ...
You know that I love.
- This is not good.
- Looks good.
"I'm not sure about that, Dave."
Addons For question 3.
Amy girl in the photo.
"Addons A student from France, study in the UK."
"Addons you know that last week, You slept with him."
Addons And you have to live with until the next morning.
"Addons you might have marked the night, But today you print anything."
Addons In short:
Tri and EMS in life and in the race.
A large dirt.
Addons
"- Jo, you are taking."
- Cheers.
It will be interesting.
Addons Question 1:
"Protocol þinând account bar,"
Addons How many units of alcohol a virtual drink a week?

I have not been calculated.
Addons Question 2:
Farewell.
Tahile?
"You think you can escape from us, the Magic Knights of Estabul?"
What's happening?
An enemy raid from Estabul!
Red-armored knights are flooding in!
They're attacking us...
Red armor?
The Estabul Magic Knights?
"All hands, retreat!"
"Run into the woods, fall back and regroup!"
Sion!
Are you safe?
"No, not Tahile..."
He had left to fetch water.
He said we'd be safe as long as we stuck with Sion!
- What happened to Kiefer?
- I don't know.
Let's split up here.
"Tony, Fahle, you two go ahead."
We'll stall them here.
Sion!
Don't worry.
Go!
"There may still be survivors, including Kiefer."
You're going to save them?
It's impossible!
It does seem that way.
- See them?
- No.
What's wrong?
"Hurry and run, Roland brats!"
Turn the cannons on them!
Turn the cannons!
"Break them, Lo!"
What's happening?
I can't see what's happening to my boys!
What's happening to my boys?
"Major, give me your glasses."
There's a rebel.
Take him prisoner.
"Will you help me up, please?"
"Sir, could you tell me what your name is?"
Who you are?
I would like to see General Hancock.
Do you know where General Hancock may be found?
"I'm sorry, sir."
The general is down.
- He's been hit.
- No!
Not both of us.
Not all of us.
"Please, God."
"Sir, we're having a surgeon come as quickly as we can."
"Can you hear me, son?"
"Yes, sir."
I can hear you.
Will you tell General Hancock that General Armistead sends his regrets?
Will you tell him how very sorry I am?
"I will tell him, sir."
I will tell him.
"General Webb, sir."
"Let go of the horse, Major."
"Major Sorrel, I said let go of the horse."
I need you to come to Emperor Land.
Bring as many of your kind as you can.
BRYAN:
Why?
- To dance.
You know...
[ALL SNICKERING]
"Now, why would I wanna do that?"
- To free the penguin nation.
"- Oh, yeah?"
- There's been a catastrophe.
- Right.
The entire population is trapped.
BRYAN:
Uh-huh.
MUMBLE:
By huge walls of ice and snow.
Hey!
Bryan!
"Look, I'd love to help you, sport, but you've come at the worst possible time."
"Maybe after winter or something, okay?"
"No, that's too late."
Way too late.
Bryan!
You gonna fight or what?
You said you owe me one.
"But right now, I got problems of me own."
"Everyone's cranky, looking for biff."
The multitudes need me to keep the peace.
"If you don't come now, multitudes will die."
Here we go.
You saying it's my fault now?
And to determine the degree of infiltration.
-Infiltration by whom?
-Alpha Draconians.
-Draconians?
Jaelen!
"Jaelen, what's happened?"
Jaelen...
"-They took it, Robert."
They took our baby.
-Alright we gotta... we gotta go.
- I'll take you to my house.
- That'd be perfect.
-It's safer.
- Our army is coming here to establish complete dominion.
It has always been our intent to shield you from this threat.
But we are entrenched in war and we haven't the means to bring the fleet here to protect you.
It is to be your darkest age.
"- Man, look at that."
Look at that.
Look at that.
That's amazing.
-Open that one.
-Wow.
-Open that one.
That's amazing.
Wow.
- We're gonna set the world on fire with this.
-And I think soon.
"- There, I got it."
"- Dude, we got a helicopter."
Right behind there.
See?
Your people thrive
The dignity of toil To stay alive
It seems to me we may have met
Your face is not a face I would forget

He disappeared

"You know, alcoholics are often a little coagulopathic."
How was your little sit-down with Weaver this morning?
She was telling me and Dr. Clemente how charming we are.
"-Oh, really?"
-You don't think I'm charming?
I think you're extremely charming.
I just also think you're--
-Aah!
-Whoa.
"Oh, crap."
Spilled my coffee.
"She was telling us that we have to get along better, you know..."

"-Well, you still think I'm full of--"
Oh!
Active duty servicemen can get married the same day.
Bingo.
Watch where you're headed.
"I mean, I realize it's all sex now, but 20 years down the road..."
"Alex, what are you doing here?"
So nice to see you!
"I was dropping off some contact sheets and I figured I'd stop by... and say ""hi""."
How are you doing?
Holding up?
Barely.
I just about to transfer... the Western shoot all day.
Yee-haw!
- Do you wanna get some coffee?
- I can sneak out of here for... five minutes before I have to get back to this closet.
- Cool.
- Let me just get my coat.
"Jocelyn, I'm sorry you had to work late."
Hang in there!
Paul.
"John, Simmon, How sweetie!"
Hello there!
- How art thou?
"- Good, what about the Yuri?"
- Brutal!
- Brutal...
I can't even think about it before breakfast.
"- Jocelyn, you missed it!"
- What?
Raw brilliance!
Helmets...
- helmets.
- Helmut Lang?
Safety is chic.
Living is chic.
Helmut Lang.
"Helmets... for motorcycles, mopeds, vespas and scooters, even."
- Hold on.
- What?
I hope this is the fever talking.
This lack of compassion and tolerance is very disappointing.
- That is not the little girl I raised.
- You guys are disgusting.
What was that?
"I told you, we should've had more Jewish friends."
[Whispers] You never told me that.
"Yeah, you suck!"
We're friends of the Jewish people!
- We don't have any.
- We've got a couple.
"No, not one."
Nick is half Jewish.
Who's Nick?

"Vanessa, hey, it's Nate."
"I need to... oh, shit, this guy is rich."
"Hey, uh, uh, I need to know if you sent that product, okay?"
"It's very important you call me, so pull your head out of that big mound of coke and..."
- [Beeps]
- Hold on a sec.
I think this is you.
Hello?
- [Laughing]
- Hello?
Vanessa?
"So you still coming down to Fort Lauderdale,"
Why can't they see that?
Those fools!
It's me.
What!

I'll be right there.
"Chief, the medical team reports that Miya Shikitani has regained consciousness."
She's conscious...?
Dan...
Gai...
Oh...
Is it that time already?
Shall we go?
You haven't changed at all.
"I was just about your age, too."
How strange...
"For the past 17 years, you and I have lived together as one..."
From that day I first met you...
All this time...
Who... are you?
Protect it...
What is this?
Dangaioh.
Dangaioh...?
- You're almost there.
"Yeah, you got that."
Areyousure it's okay that we came here ?
"Well, it is now, but ifwe're going to keep on doing this, we're gonna have to fiind someplace else to practice."
Did you always want to be a doctor ?
Who said I wanna be a doctor ?
Chenille.
Everybody.
Right now!
Geez.
It's 11:29 at the tone.
Bing!
That's 56 minutes.
That's my best time yet.
"And I know I could do better on the road, because this last stretch of beach is all soft sand."
"What do you think this is, a gymnasium?"
"Hey, man, you stay in pretty good shape, huh?"
About how many miles do you jog a day?
Only eight.
Eight.
Hmm.
Mm-hmm.
"Uh, you swim a lot too, huh?"
Now and then.
I bet you can ride a bike pretty good.
Bicycle?
"T.C.,"
I am not in training to enter the Iron Man contest.
Honest.
A guy'd have to be crazy to do that.
"First you swim five miles, then you marathon 26 miles, then ride a bike a hundred miles all in the same day."
"Yeah, this is Rick."
I bet you could do it.
No bet.
Okay.
"Thomas, that was Jimmy at the gate."
There's a woman here to see you.
This has gotta stop.
"I mean, as Higgins would say, this is a private club, not an office."
Not an office.
My aunt was a Grimm all these years.
I didn't even know it.
Look.
I can show you film right here that will blow your mind.
[Door closes]
Juliette!
I know how this sounds.
This is why I didn't want to tell you.
This is why my aunt told me I shouldn't be with you.
"You need to talk to somebody, Nick, but it's not me."
"Juliette, I'm trying to explain."
Okay.
"Okay, remember that hair you found on the horse when it was attacked?"
You couldn't figure out what it was.
That is what I'm talking about.
You need professional help!
"No, Juliette."
"Look, yes, I understand why you're saying that."
There's one more thing I can do to prove to you--
"- Nick, please."
"Stop, okay!"
- You're really scaring me!
- I don't want to scare you.
I just want you to know the truth.
Come with me.
Just give me this one last chance.
"Hey, Nick."
Juliette.
What a pleasant surprise.
I think.
Come on in.
All right.
Tore it apart.
"All right, I'm on my way home."
"If he hit your place, he's probably going to hit mine."
Is Juliette home?
- No.
"- Well, don't let her go home."
- She's in the hospital.
- What?
What happened?
- Is she okay?
- I don't know yet.
But I can meet you at your place.
"No, you stay."
You take care of yours.
All right.
Then call for backup.
"Come on, work with me here."
I enjoy The Strand magazine as much as the next man but I am perfectly aware that Sherlock Holmes is a fictional character.
Get out!
Do you have a goldfish named Colin?
No.
Thought not.
Now...
Ooh!
I see this is one of your business cards - it says so on the front!
Who are you?
What are you doing here?
This.
"Wakey, wakey!"
"That is highly valuable equipment, you must step away now."
We are the Intelligence.
Oh!
Why aren't you in uniform?
It doesn't fit me anymore!
He must be a right fucking bastard!
I know what I'd have told him.
He blushed.
You should've seen him.
"Just 'cause I said ""toilet."""
"Is he good-looking, Sharon?"
"Ah, you're joking me."
You know Roland the rat?
"Well, he looks like him, only not as nice."
"He asked me why I wasn't wearing me uniform... so I stuck out me belly... and I said, ""It doesn't fit me anymore!"""
"You were dead right, Sharon."
You should've stuck one of your tits... in his mouth as well.
You should see the state of me nipples.
Jesus.
"Frank Kinsella's a ride, isn't he?"
- It wasn't him.
- I didn't say he...
It wasn't him.
It wasn't his brother.
It wasn't my brother.
It wasn't Bart Simpson.
It wasn't anybody.
"Now get off me bleedin' back, will ya?"
I'm sick of it!
- She didn't...
"- You keep out of it, right!"
"He is a ride, though, isn't he?"
Frank Kinsella.
Bitch.
"What's that that's on, Sharon?"
All rise.
"For his excellence, inquisitor general don Tomás de Torquemada."
I must send you on a mission I wish I never would've had to send you on.
(WHISPERS) Look.
It can't be.
Do you care for my daughter Amelia?
Of course I care for her.
"I'm here, dining with you."
(ISABELLA I OF CASTILLE) What is this?
Abraham Levi is under my protection.
"I believe that there is only one possibility left, and you know what I'm referring to."
Run!
Guards!
Obey.
No man will be left behind.
(SALVADOR) What do you think?
that I don't wish he were here instead of burning at the stake.
(WHISPERS) Destroy the diary this very night.
Quick!
She's here!
"Quick, hurry up!"
"- Hello, everyone."
- Hello.
Am I late?
No.
"I'm even early, it seems."
So...
Is everyone here?
"Oh, no..."
I see that...
Our own Philippe.
You're late!
The last 15 minutes..
"I've been a fucking roller coaster of emotions, mate."
I didn't know if I was ever gonna see you again.
So I lit some of this.
"I fired on my nerves damn you, you know?"
And there you are.
It's okay.
You've just lost power.
Come on.
"Hey, bring me some of this strong Russian shit, girls."
"Okay, now where is that ... pump?"
Where's that?
Did you get it?
Did you get the fucking...?
Yeah?
"Fuck you, no!"
This is it.
"This is it, yeah."
Okay.
"Okay, hold this, lady."
Shit.
"Okay, we gotta get this little fucker in there."
Whom I kidding with?
I'm not in condition to do this.
"I'm sorry, I'm in no condition to do this, mate."
I'm in no condition.
I'm sorry.
I'm in no condition to do this.
What's wrong with his hand?
Who is he?
Is he a robot?
[Phone rings]
Hello?
Who is this?
"Oh, Detective Burris."
"No, it's all right."
I needed to get out.
What would you want with the dog?
"All right, then, but she's not here."
Hester took her to the vet.
You'll have to pick her up over there.
"No, just bring her here after."
And Mr. Burris?
Take good care of her.
[Dogs barking]
"Detective Burris, this dog's a pussy, let me tell you that."
There's no way that I'd ever make her a violent.
"When a dog acts like that, she's never going"
To have a killer instinct.
"Well, thanks a lot."
You just shot my best theory right in the ass.
"Come on, Greta."
"Let's go, girl."
Come on.
There we go.
[Dogs barking]
Oh.
Going a little fast.
"OK, Greta."
"I'll go buy you a hamburger, all right?"
"[Dog barks, kids playing]"
Think you let me win today.
I never let anyone win.
I didn't do nothing.
I don't know what you're talking about.
"Stacey, put up that gun and listen."
You're sunk.
"I know it, big boy."
I just want you to listen to what this rat's gotta say.
Remember what happened to Limpy?
"In about two minutes, you're gonna get worse."
"Honest, Stacey."
I ain't done a thing.
"In two minutes, you're gonna get this .38 between the eyes."
"Don't shoot me, Stacey!"
I didn't never snitch on you.
I ain't talking about you snitching on me.
I'm talking about something I learned from Shake Edwards.
"No, I don't know nothing."
I'm talkin' about you framin' Ross into this joint.
Honest.
We never framed him.
[SCREAMS]
Start talking.
I can't.
I don't know.
"Wait, wait."
I'll talk.
Okay.
This is a confession without coaching.
"And it's gonna spring Ross, so remember it."
"Okay, canary."
Start singing.
Who framed Ross?
I did.
(HORSE WHINNYING)
PORTHOS:
What's wrong?
Wait.
- (WHINNYING)
- Look at the horses.

- Me neither.
- Did you see that?
- No.
Opposite roof.
"- No, no, no, no, no, no, no."
- Shh!
PORTHOS:
"Not the wine, not the wine!"
(GUNSHOTS)
"Well, that answers that."
How many do you reckon we got?
I'm not sure but I think we can assume it's more than two.
PORTHOS:
Yeah.
- My ammunition's out there.
"- Yeah, mine too."
- How much have you got?
- Not enough.
(GRUNTS)
"When you were, uh, searching before, you didn't happen to..."
No.
"No other entrances or exits, and there's no way we're getting through these windows."
"Of course not, because that would be to our advantage."
Okay.
(INHALES DEEPLY)
- Why not?
Because I beat him at table tennis.
It destroyed him.
You can't do that!
That was in Italy.
That's Da...
Jørgen.
Was I silly to bring them?
"No, I'd like to see them all."
What happened back then?
Why didn't you come home?
I just didn't.
We had broken up.
"And you were drunk all the time, right?"
Yeah.
And you did her friend?
"Yep, I think I actually did that."
- Would you like dessert?
"- Yes, please."
"Jacob, I am glad you came anyway."
I thought it all through yesterday   and I became convinced we must continue.
You would like to continue?
As though nothing's happened?
"Yes, it fits even better now."
"- Well, let's try then."
- Are you hungry?
We need some lunch.
We're going to lunch.
Wasn't it strange meeting her again...
Helene?
Yes.
Don't you think she's ageing well?
Dale!
They threw gas bombs in through the gates.
All the guys ran up in the north cell hall.
"Now, the National Guard's out there with machine guns and gas masks!"
Did I say a picnic?
You two guys get in that cell.
Okay.
Why don't we give it to them right now?
We may need 'em later.
[GUNSHOTS]
Any of you guys got a shiv?
He's got one.
Swell.
Screws with machine guns all over the joint.
We'll make out.
Out where?
"Why, through the back door."
"We pick the screws off the wall, get some rope at the twine mill and lam out!"
Let's go!
STACEY:
"Come on, get going."
Come on.
You guys go ahead.
What about you?
Don't worry about me.
I'll make out.
I got something to take care of.
"Go on, beat it."
Put him in that cell.
He's done.
[GUNFIRE]
"We all go together, Stacey."
I'm not dating...
I know.
I get it.
"What about you, smart guy?"
Did you really think this one through?
"Well, I have a right to display my art."
"Oh, give it up."
I'm gonna have to side with chloe on this one.
I wanted it in my show. it's my best picture.
There's a red dot on it.
Who bought it?
"oh, god. that feels weird."
Nobody bought it.
"I didn't want anyone to have it,"
"So i-i put a ""sold"" sticker on it."
Yeah.
Maybe.
Out of my way!
you!
"Oh, pooh. you're late. sorry you missed all the fun."
Oh!
not really.
I brought my own fun.
"Hello, andrea. come in early tomorrow."
Do you mind?
I want to show you your new office.
i think you're gonna like it.
"If you need to make a copy, it's super convenient."
"Okay, so you don't like practical jokes."
That's good to know. that's how a friendship grows!
Come on.
I'll walk you out.
[ENGLISH ACCENT] ...hello?
"- Oh, good, Portugal's here."
"- We saved that wall for you, Christine."
"Oh, great."
"Oh, I get the whole wall."
Okay.

[CLEARS THRO AT]
[CLEARS THRO AT]
Exports.
Imports.
Portugal.
"Yeah, you know, Christine, you don't have to stay."
I'm sure you have a shift to run off to or something.
"Oh, no, no, no, I don't work shifts, Marly."
"I assign shifts to people, because I'm the boss."
I have a corporate credit card.
I've got 35 points accumulated.
"Two thousand more, I get a flashlight radio."
[LAUGHING]
[CLEARS THRO AT]
So you wanna open up the bottle of port?
Heh.
It's 8:30 in the morning.
Oh.
"- You don't have any vodka, do you?"
"- Yeah, where's Russia?"
[LAUGHING]
You know what would help?
If you could set out the plates for the international feast.
"Oh, sure."
"So, I have this new guy cooking for us."
Others?
I do not know.
Are all there ...
It is sad.
Addons last question ...
"Addons What's the first, purchased by you,"
"This site us, and why?"
How the hell do you know?
Buying goods online.
Addons Let me refresh your memory to tell you.
I've never bought anything like that.
What's this?
"Addons you score ""zero"", Max."
I've never bought anything like that.
Addons The correct answer is ...
Addons 1: you are at level 1.
You fall for the exam 7 times.
Addons 2:
"Profile of the most frequently visited is ""Leeps Jennifer""."
Addons And you've seen pictures of 234 times.
Now obviously.
Addons Question 3:
Your order solution genitals.
Addons Once you come from Poland.
He was 17.
"Addons short: dirty people like you, interesting disease."
Well done.
Confidential.
I do not buy it.
"Addons Gwen, your question starts now."
I do not think that there is a game.
Problems that are too personal.
"I was 20 bucks up, but with only enough time for one more pick-up before the bars closed,"
I needed to make sure I chose a wealthy client.
[ Cellphone rings ]
"""Honda Civic."""
I'll forward that to Rut.
"I wanted a bigger tip, so I held out for another car."
And I'm glad I did.
"Oh, my gosh!"
I don't even want to know that.
Woman #2:
It's crazy.
[ All talking at once ]
No!
"No, no, no."
I can't even begin to guess what they're talking about.
Yeah.
It's a package.
I'm just saying.

I am out of my element.
He was weird because I went to his...
"While Rut was off driving a cheap Civic, my last pick-up took me to the Castro district, and I was looking for a big tipper."
Hi.
Did you guys call Zingo?
- We did call Zingo!
- I'm Adam.
"- Ah, Bobby Pin."
- Bobby Pin.
I called 1-800-babe.
Is that you?
"No, but thanks for asking."
- Okay.
"""Una poco de gracia. """
Shut up!
"For once in your stupid and pointless life, shut up."
"I'm in love, mate."
Do you know what it feels like to be in love?
Have you ever been in love?
That ain't a trick question.
Have you ever loved anybody?
Anybody whose name isn't Mercer?
"# Bamba, Bamba"
# Bamba... #
"We're going to the seaside, pack a bag."
"# Bamba, Bamba"
Me llamo Calum.
Me gustan los churros y las chicos.
You forget about the sea sometimes.
Yeah.
Reminds me of biscuits.
Really?
Why's that?
"When we were just little kids, Mum and Dad used to take us to the seaside."
"Me and my sister would sit in the back, eating digestive biscuits."
"John, listen..."
I've never done what you do.
I know.
Just ask him for the time or a light or whatever.
You can do that.
I'll do the rest.
Do you want some fudge?
I've eaten tons.
I suppose I'd better save some for my mother.
You OK?
I'm just trying to deal with this shit. I didn 't ask forthis.
"What, and I did ?"
I climbed on top of myself and got pregnant ?
You want me to take him to my mother's ?
I'll take him.
Get his shit ready.
Get him ready !
"Oh, no."
You're not going now here with my son tonight.
"Not on that temper, and not with that attitude."
"Look, you know what ?"
Fine.
"Then, I won't take him. I'm outta here."
"Go ahead, leave."
That's what you're good at !
Your son ain't seen nothing but your back since he was born !

[Woman] Shawana Clarke.
Shawana Clarke.
Do you want me to take him ?
No.
"[Woman] Travis, come here."
"Come here, Travis."
"Travis, put that down."
Excuse me. I have been here for an hour and a half.
Am I gonna be able to see a doctor anytime soon ?
"I've already told you, we'll get you in as soon as we can."
My appointment was an hour ago.
I already got here early.
We are doing the best we can.
We have a lot of people.
I don't want a dime extra.
And you're not gonna touch him again.
You hear me?
I hope he doesn't give me a reason to touch him again and I hope you don't...
I don't give a crap if he gives you a reason.
"You're not gonna touch him again, just say it."
"Billy, let's go."
You need to calm...
You need to tell your little brother...
"Listen to me, you fat son of a bitch!"
"You're not gonna touch him again, you understand me?"
How's Jackie?
You don't touch...
Billy!
Billy!
You're barking up the wrong tree!
Hey!
Get out!
You are barking down the wrong tree!
Billy!
Go!
"Jesus Christ, Billy!"
"What are you thinking, man?"
Get in the truck!
"Barking up the wrong tree, Billy!"
He's got a gun.
He's got a gun.
Just get in the truck.
Keep your little brother away from me.
Start the truck.
Start the truck.
I'm trying!
Segovia?
"Yes, to the jail."
The jail?
Yes.
I need to see Benigno Martin urgently.
I know it's irregular but it's a matter of life or death.
The Director is waiting for you in his office.
For me?
Where's his office?
The officer will accompany you.
This way.
On the right.
"Empty your pockets, please."
"Hey, wait, don't run!"
Wait.
It's there.
At the end.
Good morning.
I'm Marco Zuloaga.
Benigno Martin left this letter for you.
"Dear Marco,"
It's still raining.
I think it's a good omen.
When Alicia had her accident it was raining.
I'm writing minutes before I escape.
I hope that all I've taken is enough to put me in a coma and reunite me with her.
You're my only friend.
I'm leaving you the house
I prepared for Alicia and me.
"Wherever they take me, come and see me, and talk to me."
"Tell me everything, don't be so secretive."
"Farewell, my friend."
It's the station.
Excuse me.
Wesley.
- Prentice here.
- And Hull.
- Yeah?
- We found the body.
Can you be more specific?
Sid Thomas-Haye.
Guy who escaped from the hospital.
"Found him in a Yukon XL, single shot to the head."
"Okay, nice work."
"Not so nice for him, but could be good for you."
We found his phone.
"A burner cell... clean, except for one missed call, so we ran that number."
Name came up as part of the Harris investigation.
What's the name?
Morgan Lewis.
Got any ideas why this Sid guy and Morgan might be connected?
Sid had a charge for possession.
Maybe he was Morgan's dealer.
We got probable cause.
"Morgan, you home?"
Morgan?
"Frank, I got something."
Yeah?
What do you got?
Car service receipt.
Looks like Morgan took a cab to the Larimar Hotel last night.
Maybe he got drugs and a hooker.
One last hurrah.
I know that look.
"Me, too."
"Money or not, I'll stay."
I'll need a third.
"Sorry, Captain."
I have a family.
I'm not crazy.
"Captain, three men can't hold off a party of Ree, much less some boys."
"Besides, $70 ain't gonna buy nobody a new set of ears."
"A hundred, then."
This man is the only reason we're still alive.
We were 45 men when this started.
Now we're ten.
Almost nine.
HAWK:
He's my father.
He can have my share.
JIM:
"Mine, too."
He can have my share also.
All right.
"If Mr. Bridger feels the same way,"
I'll lag behind with them.
You?
Yep.
You already lost my share of the pelts so I got no choice but to make it up by some other means.
Sticking around for another day or two don't make no difference.
$300...at least I get to go home with something.
"Glass is to be cared for until, understood?"
Yeah.
You have my word.
I understand.
HENRY:
Thank you.
This is good stuff.
Real good stuff.
Why are you driving me nuts?
Know how much I cried waiting for you?
You did?
I'm sorry.
Know how hard it was for me?
I was crying on the porch because of you.
Let me ask you something.
Please be honest.
Please.
"That night, when I was outside, what were you doing in the room?"
I'm getting sick of this.
It's that again?
I don't know.
Don't know anything anymore.
"Joongrae, don't lie to me."
"Please, don't lie."
Do whatever you want.
What did I do so wrong to deserve this?
What did I do?
I'm sick of it all.
"What's wrong with you, Moonsook?"
That's not important.
Somebody walked over me.
"You two walked over me, huh?"
"When I was outside, you two walked over me."
"I thought I was dreaming, but it was real."
I don't believe this.
"Walk over me, did you?"
How dare you?
I heard that you were in an accident...
How are you feeling...?
As you can see...
So you're okay...
I'm good.
I'm a little itchy.
This body has allergies.
So...
You have a lot of rocks in the house.
Oh...
It's a hobby of mine.
So people collect rocks too...
That's something.
Ouch!
You shouldn't be touching those...
These rocks represent my family
The large black one...is me.
The pretty white one is my wife.
The nice smooth one is Da Ran!
And this tiny little one...is Choong Sik!
"It's a rock family, a rock family!"
Dad rock...
Mom rock...
Child Rock!
"(The way it's pronounced, it sounds like Idol)"
Yeah...
"Well, since you're a part of our family too now...."
Let's find your own rock that we can put next to Da Ran together.
No thanks!
Why would I want that?
Shall we look for one?
A son-in-law rock?
What?
What?
"Ah Eiji, sorry to keep you waiting."
That Echizen sure is slow.
Get someone to bring him here.
Why don't you go?
Why me?
"Damn late, Echizen!"
"Ah, my apologies."
You see we are not open for business today.
"Ah, dozo."
Sorry about it.
- Come back tomorrow.
- But they're eating...
But they're eating...
"No, no, no."
That is just a minor incident.
Don't worry about it.
Carry on.
It is okay.
It's okay.
- Taka-san.
- Yes?
Good accuracy.
What about Higaki?
Don't worry.
There's a reason to make Higaki lose.
To control him better.
If this carries on it might lead to the damage of your whole body.
Rest for a year without playing tennis.
Concentrate on your therapy.

You're Deputy Special Agent Finnerty?
"Oh, you're Jenna's favour."
This is Emily.
"This is Em, my daughter."
My father is a very special man.
It's nice to meet you.
I paid her to say that.
- Let's get started.
- Okay.
I don't know.
Just...
"Sorry, I gotta ask."
"You didn't marry Jim Finnerty from Sigma Chi, did you?"
- That guy was--
- An asshole.
"Yes, he was."
"This is my colleague, Special Agent Todd."
Standard Secret Service protocol requires a two-agent review for every interview.
You're not to look at Agent Todd.
"- I'm sorry, I just looked at him."
- You're only to look at me.
So we just-
- Okay.
The subject is John Cale.
"Born 1980, grew up in the District of Columbia graduated Hill High in 1999."
Looks like you've bounced from job to job.
"Mechanic, limo driver, construction."
Is my credit score in there?
"Yes, and you should be ashamed of yourself."
"It's a recession, okay?"
Married Melanie Schopp in 2002 and had a child six months later.
Filed for divorce in 2005.
No.
You're not wearing pantyhose.
It's hot.
Take them off.
No.
Ridiculous.
I'm so sorry.
"Oh, my god."
Where have you been?
"We just wanted to make sure everything was set up, you know, perfectly at the reception and the dinner, and it's great."
Wow.
You look amazing.
You look like a princess.
What's wrong?
Don't cry.
"It's just, I've dreamed about this day my whole life."
Since my first communion.
Is that weird?
"No, hon."
We've all been dreaming about our own weddings.
Now that I'm here this doesn't feel right.
Everything will work out as it... should.
The future kind of has a funny way of doing that.
You just have to wait and see how it all unfolds.
Deep breath.
Yeah.
Take a deep breath.
Hey.
Wait.
Picture.
No.
No pictures.
I need you to sleep at the loft.
Lily.
Jenny Humphrey.
"Uh, yeah?"
You bitch.
"You told me you were selling me oxy,"
But those pills were antibiotics.
"Yeah, I didn't get high."
I got a yeast infection.
¶...
For an audience of one ¶
¶ ooh ¶
Dad.
"Look, I can explain."
I came here to tell you.
"Jenny, please save your breath."
Like I'm gonna believe a word out of your mouth.
Get your things and come with me.
We're going home...
To Brooklyn.
"¶ ooh, ooh ¶"
What did you want to talk about that couldn't wait?
"The producer from CNN just flew into town,"
And I'm gonna meet her for drinks in 20 minutes.
I want you to take the internship.
"Come on, Dan."
I don't want us to be making decisions based on fear.
All right?
"So whatever happens, we'll figure it out."
Thank you.
"I, uh..."
Got you some stationery
This is your night.
You've worked so hard for this.
That's not what I work for.
"-No, But still."
Sometimes it's good to take a break and enjoy the achievements.
It does not help to look back.
"Here, keep it."
You can get it.
I do not care who you were with.
Just get your ass down here now.
"But Aksel, you should have seen her."
A gorgeous blonde.
Her tits is the size of melons.
-Beina is as long as my dick.
"Fuck you, Degang."
"So, ScanBrazil?"
People all over the earth tremble enough in his pants now.
"Dispose of CDN, Genergy, Oxon and the European branch of Mintec."
Can anyone make some coffee for us?
It's going to be a long night.
Talk Pronovo and Sandelman.
Buy what you can.
"Go, go."
And I need a clean shirt!
Look here.
This is how champagne is opened.
55 million so far.
They supply them now.
I love the smell of bankruptcy in the morning.
"Quiet now, Degang."
-What Tsirk?
-There is Belarus.
"I don't mean that, but there's a..."
"Well, there is a certain way to do it."
"Oh, you mean little girls come with a set of instructions?"
No.
"No, what I mean is there are different kinds of kisses."
There.
Is that clear?
No.
Unless you mean little girls and little boys should kiss like this.
"Yes, yes, that's it."
Is that what I was doing?
"No, I'm..."
I'm afraid it wasn't.
You mean I was doing something like this.
Yes.
(STUTTERING) Yes.
That looked like what you were doing.
And I should have been doing this.
"Yes, that's it."
Now I'm all confused.
I forgot what I'm not supposed to do.
Wilbur.
"Oh, yeah."
I remember now.
(STUTTERING) That's enough!
"Hello, Bob."
Hello.
"Look, you stick to the little ones."
The big ones are mine.
"Now, don't... don't be silly."
I was just telling Willy here how to protect himself.
I don't think Wilbur needs protection.
"Yeah, well, I fucked up."
After that night on the bridge...
I blamed you for Jimmy.
"Yeah, I blamed me, too."
- I looked for you at the funeral.
- I couldn't deal with it.
An empty coffin like my mom's...
The river took half my family.
"It never gave them back, either."
I was wondering what happened to that picture.
"You, me and Jimmy at my dad's cabin."
All going to be cops.
- Brilliant idea.
- Look at us now.
I'm a dropout.
Jimmy's dead.
- And you're one of those...
- Water dogs.
It wasn't your fault what happened to Jimmy.
He had something wrong with him.
"He did, like my mom."
"Nobody noticed it, until he beat that suspect."
But I noticed it...
I never did anything about it.
You did the right thing.
- Fuck 'em.
- Fuck 'em.
"- So, are you back now?"
- I'm back.
- You want to get something to eat?
"- No, I've got to meet a girl."
Danny...
and it can lift up to two or three persons.
I can't believe you have to be armed with such things.
Emergency alert!
An armed group of intruders have been spotted at excavation site one.
All defense units and medics are to report immediately!
So they've come.
I'm going to try these babies out right now.
What's going on?
Damn!

How dare you act so vulgar!

It's a pity Ominae..!
Did you lose your abilities when you joined Arcam?
How come?
How come?
What's wrong with you?

Bastard!

"Hey, Sarge."
"Having a ball, huh?"
Did those meatballs ever figure on you coming in with six stripes?
"(laughs) Knocked them over, huh?"
"I went over big, yeah."
"I had the suit pressed and everything, all real sharp."
Yeah.
"Big, big."
"Hello, Sarge, Rocco again."
"Listen, the motor pool is in great shape, so just relax and have a ball."
"Hey, Sarge, they really flipped, huh?"
"Look, this is costing you guys a fortune."
You better hang up.
I'll be seeing you soon.
Take care of yourself.
Give my best to the gang.
"So long, Rocco."

"If she catches us cuddling,"

Lovely.

"As we're almost related by marriage,"

Not the easiest place to stick a plaster on!
G--Granville!
Fetch your toolbox!
"Oh, dear."
Where's y--your vest?
What are you doing out without a vest?
"Now, don't start."
I'm finished with all that clobber.
What is it?
What's wrong?
"Sorry, it's just..."
Didn't know I'd put it on.
Old habits...
It's cooler.
"Yeah, it is, isn't it?"
It is very cool.
Bow ties are cool!
"No, the room."
The room is getting colder.
She's coming back!
What's she going to do?
Is she going to punish me?
Uh... uh...
She's learnt not to melt.
"Of course, she's not really a governess, she's just a beast."
She's going to eat you.
Run.
"Children, what is exp..."
Who the devil are you?
!
What are you doing in my house?
It's OK!
"I am your governess' gentleman friend, and we've just been upstairs... kissing!"
"Captain Latimer, in the garden, there's snowmen!"
"And they're just growing, out of nowhere, all by themselves - look!"
"Good evening, I'm a lizard woman from the dawn of time and this is my wife!"
This dwelling is under attack!
"Remain calm, human scum!"
So!
Any questions?
Nevermore.
No.
No.
Here you go to believe.
"Do not believe this about me, major lord!"
Towards a dawn Mariska's limbs started becoming stiff.
Ágika was refreshed again.
He was Tót in the baddest state.
His brain rumbled.
His sense organs stopped working.
He hallucinated.
It was light.
"I think, his time to go to bed."
This was superb one.
We felt very well.
- I hope for it tomorrow we continue.
- Of course.
Good night.
- Good night.
- Major lord.
Sweet dreams major lord.
"Sleep tight, Ágika."
Mom.
He kissed my forehead.
What do you say to this?
"We have to go to bed, my sweet good Lajos."
"Ow, my Gyula, my Gyula."
My small son.
"Well, not wonderful, mom?"
He was not tired.
"With regret inform it the Hungarian Red Cross, that yours son, Tót Gyula is an ensign in the fight against the enemy, died a hero."
(Field post 809/3)
I want action plans on my desk in one hour.
Stay vigilant.
I'm not losing any more of you.
Now I got to go call krzeminski's wife.
I'll call his girlfriend.

I thought I might
Tell you about my day if you have a moment.
"Yeah, that would be a nice change."
I got plenty of time on my hands.
All ears.
"Uh, it's just that..."
One of my co-workers died today.
"Geez, peg."
That's too bad.
Right there on the job?
"Yes, it was sudden."
I know how you feel...
blindsided.
Like when my cousin ralphie got hit by a bus.
"Granted, he did just knock off a newsstand, but still."
Big shock.
Shit.
All the cameras are down.
Audio's on a separate file.
- Yeah.
- Pull it up.
Here.
Nothing.
What time was that?
- One hour ago.
- Earlier.
Fuck you!
Do you wanna be a fucking hero?
Go back further.
We just gotta hold out a couple of hours till Emerson gets here and then I hope...
- Quiet!
- Get off of me!
- Where is she?
- Fuck you!
You go get her.
Tell her to come out.
Tell her to come out right now!
Take a fucking seat!
We know you have to open the door from the inside.
Can you get her to do that for us?
It'll be a lot easier.
Fuck you.
I need to get inside the broadcast room.
I need the girl to open the door.
I need her to take care of some numbers for me.
Now this is something only she can do.
And I'm kinda on a tight schedule.
They didn't know about the change in schedule.
Would you please just admit it?
I taught you about loyalty.
I fought tooth and nail with your mother for your custody.
Me.
Good old Dad.
And I am not the kind of man who would hurt my family.
"Now, I am disappointed in you for even thinking it."
"L""m hurting."
"Oh, my God."
"Daddy, you""re lying."
Lying right to my face!
"Oh, my God!"
- Keep your voice down.
"- How could you cheat, Daddy?"
How could you cheat on Clara?
Get out of my house.
"Clara, honey, patients are waiting."
"You know, Lisa hasn""t shown up in four days."
I guess whatever she has is contagious.
"- How""s David?"
- Fine.
- Are you okay?
"- Why wouldn""t I be?"
I fixed the scratch.
"The Mercedes the other day, I fixed the scratch... but now there""s a rattle."
"Driving to work this morning, it was rattle, rattle, rattle."
"L""m sorry."
"It""s all my fault."
"Of course it is, you son of a bitch."
"I mean, do you love her?"
- Do you love me?
- I want to come home.
Okay.
Thanks very much for calling us.
Yeah.
Appreciate it.
- Hi.
- Hi.
( Clearing Throat )
Mikey Trenton and Ben Owens won't be in class today.
There was an accident at Ben's house.
Is Ben all right?
"Ben's all right,"
- but his sister's boyfriend is dead.
- What happended?
Some bizarre accident.
He was electrocuted in the jacuzzi.
I've been doing research into Mikey Trenton's background.
I really need to talk to you about this.
"Yeah, okay."
You go to your class.
I'll meet up with you later.
Okay.
"Eva, I'm gonna come back after my next class to check on that fax."
"""Electric chair""?"
We were so stupid.
"Putting the radio so close to the edge, that was so stupid."
He was probably just changing the station or something.
I went in to answer the goddamned phone.
Do you believe there was some pervert on the line?
I'm glad you're not dead.
God!
I wish I was.
Maybe it wasn't an accident.

Shall I play something else for you?
Give me.

[Woman from outside]:
Bravo!
Encore!
Encore!
[Woman]:
Forgive me.
I simply couldn't help responding to such marvellous playing.
Was it you?
It was neither of us.
"Well, whoever it is is extremely gifted."
"Yes, they are."
Now if you'll excuse us.
- You don't think that was rather rude?
"- No, I do not."
[Speaking German]
It's no good looking at me.
Who was that then?
I don't know.
Never seen her in my life before.
Would he like me to leave me fiddle?
"Oh, that would be very kind, Adam."
"You can be assured, it will be well looked after."
It's all right.
You can hang onto it for a bit.
[Speaking German]
"Well, now."
- Did Iris come in at a bad time?
Maybe.
"Okay, then next time!"
"Next time you cry, be sure to show me!"
Didn't you have a report from Ryner and Ferris to give me?
"Oh, yeah."
Here you go!
"The dog is Ryner, and the angel is Ferris, I take it?"
Yup!
"The wild beast and the dazzling beautiful avenging angel, Sister Ferris!"
"Same as always, hm?"
What's this?
"Um, they dug a hole and pulled out a dagger-looking thing."
"They had no idea what it was and threw it, and a dragon suddenly came to life, they said!"
A hero relic?
They really existed?
- Your Majesty.
"- What is it, Miller?"
Have a look.
You're certain of this?
The information comes from him.
"You know who I mean, I'm sure."
Iris.
"Sorry, but would you mind returning to Ryner and Ferris immediately?"
"Okay, Ryner."
Take care of today's portion.
"Dango, dango, dango, dango, dango!"

"Hey, mate."
I want a shot to get it back.
"Fuck you, Commodore."
I won this money.
All right?
"It's all right with me, pal."
-Good meeting' with ya.
"-Come on, Jim."
Wait a minute.
Let's play.
Did you see that good-looking girl that I was talking to leave here?
"No, I don't know where she went."
"Okay, you can turn 'em on."
I told you we shouldn'a hooked this up in the rain in the first place.
"Finish up, already."
-You check the connections?
"-Yes, I checked the connections."
-Did you check the switch?
-I checked the switch.
"Well, go check the hookup."
"Your boss say, ""Sign work both day and night."" I wanna lights on."
"-Want a cup of coffee, Nick?"
-Turn 'em on.
He's checkin' the hookup.
"Well, hurry up."
I wanna see lights on.
Turn on.
"Where the hell is it, anyhow?"
"Go around there, he said it's around to the left."
"Yeah, I think I've found it."
He would have found us anyway.
"It's a morning thing, right?"
When you wake up?
You work too much.
Sure.
Excuse me.
"Oui, mon ange."
"Yes, sweetheart, I know."
"Yeah, yeah."
"Daddy will call you back, but now I'm... wait, hang on."
Would you excuse me a second?
Yeah?
Uh-huh.
"Honey, I can't talk to you now."
"Rachel, check out that guy for me... now."
Of course you're coming for vacation.
Sure you are.
"No, honey, I can't come get you."
"We'll do just like last time, I..."
We'll see.
"Okay, I'll call you back."
Love you.
Don't ever do this to me again.
Ever.
I've got a screwball in my office.
"He may be a screwball, but he wasn't lying."
He's head of a department at St. Louis.
Ross didn't tell you anything else?
"No, nothing."
"They say the swan sings only once, just before dying."
"Yes, I know."
"He senses he's going to die, so he sings."
It's not because of the pain.
"Once she starts, she'll never stop."
- How true!
"It's so different, seeing it in real life instead of just reading a book about it."
This goes on every evening at our place.
He just comes home from the orchard...
"Let's not forget, hydroponic agriculture only started in the 21st century."
Back in this century they couldn't even control the weather.
Gee!
My dad!
"- Bye, then."
- Bye.
Didn't I tell you to get home earlier?
What's that in your hand?
Give me it!
Fido!
Fido!
Adam!
Can you hear me?
I'm talking to you!
Give it to me!
"Dad, I didn't..."
I just...
Fido!
Dear God!
This dog is driving me crazy!
Look what he just did!
"You're the one who should look, at all these women!"
- Take it away!
- It's disgusting!
Wasting time on this instead of studying!
- My dear son!
- This kid will never amount to anything!
Huh?
[ Gasps ] I'm falling!
"Oh geez, I'm falling."
Guys!
"Yeah, but if he did have a jet pack, he could just put it on upside down!"
"Uh, they still cant hear me!"
My phone!
I dropped my phone!
Why do my powers just keep coming and going?
I was just so happy to be home.
Wait!
That's it!
Happiness!
My floating power's tied to my emotions!
"[ Groans ] Right, just like all my stupid powers!"
Ooh!
"Okay, right, I can control this!"
I just have to think happy thoughts and no negative thoughts!
"So, what makes me happy?"
Donuts?
"No, I'm not gonna get any."
The beach!
"No, that's where I'm going to die."
[ Thud ]
Mom?
"Oh geez, those feelings are complicated."
"Come on, come on, brain, time's running out!"
I just need something that makes me happy!
Something I can always depend on to cheer me up!
♪
My guys!
They spent all night with me just to keep me company.
J.D. :
There.
There he is.
[vin GRUNTS]
[BOTH grunting ]
We've got some unfinished business in Texas.
JOSlAH:
All right.
Take him away.
I know you wanted him alive.
You did what you had to.
I can't clear my name if I'm dead.
Well...
"... youwin,Mother."
You alwaysdo.
"Well, of course, darling. I've known you since you were an itty-bitty baby."
That's always gonna be my trump card.
That's a mother's advantage.
"Now, come here and give me a kiss before I leave."
EZRA:
You're leaving?
But your place is a gold mine.
It's booming.
"Well, that's the whole idea."
You buy a depressed property.
You get it going...
... andsellit at  the height of it's popularity.
I made a fortune.
"Spend it in good health, Mother."
"Oh, I already did."
I reinvested it in another very depressed property.
You aren't.
- Huh?
You must have gotten somebody else.
Nobody hates the army more than Klinger.
He's spent his entire career trying to get season tickets to Section Eight.
"Gee, I don't know."
"This Klinger... dark, hairy guy, big beak."
Let me see that.
"[Chuckles] When I saw him in the ""O"" Club... crying in his beer over some skirt named Laverne..."
[Fingers Snap] It was all over but the signing.
"Vickers, you're a vulture."
"Doctor, you operate your way."
I'll operate mine.
[Clicks Heels]
See ya.
"- ##[Jukebox. ""Harbor Lights""]"
"- Klinger, come on."
Get up.
- Huh?
- Get up.
The maid wants to put fresh linen on the bar.
"Oh, please."
"Didn't you read the ""Do Not Disturb The Dead"" sign?"
- This is no time to let a sleeping drunk lie.
- ## [Stops]
Oh!
Don't!
All I have left of Laverne is that song.
"Klinger, do you have any idea what you did last night?"
- Last night?
"- Last night, yeah."
- Last night.
- Last night.
He doesn't mix with dirty Arabs like you!
Dirty Arabs?
Reminds me of waterboarding.
You got a bathtub in here?
Buildings and Investments operate through the Pole Pot Bank.
"Forget the bank, I want the banker!"
"Apart from banking, what does the banker do?"
Walk his dachshund through the park?
Rare?
Medium?
Well done?
Overdone?
The theater.
He took a shine to some piss pot actress.
Care to impart her pseudonym?
Aglaé.
Gla Gla!
That tip would have saved your hide.
"Unfortunately, I have a kiss from Mary."
- What can I do for you?
- Nothing!
Why do I make a show of it?
Because... you're my friend.
"You know what I feel, right now, here?"
I'll tell you.
I'm gonna barf.
What am I good for?
Nothing gives.
Makes a void inside.
You got religion?
No!
Here.
But those days are done.
- Oh.
- Mm.
Huh.
"Well, I guess I'm not in control of everything, am I?"
"Funny, isn't it?"
"You can try and try, but in the blink of an eye..."
You can lose everything that matters to you.
"Dad, are you okay?"
Don't you all see what's going on here?
Dad really wanted that milk.
I almost lost you guys today...
All of you.
- Aw.
- Just like that.
"Aw, daddy."
"Oh, honey."
"You spent the whole day trying to control everything, and I spent the entire day trying not to, and neither way worked, did it?"
Nope.
"I may fight you on this, but I'm gonna need you to make me get rid of Jolene two."
- She's a biter.
- I know.
As soon as we're done with this hug.
"Hey, whatever this is, I need to get in on it."
I almost died today.
- Grandpa.
- Daddy.
"- Aw, dad."
- Hey.
Come here.
- Aww.
"- Come here, you."
"He is, but do you know him?"
"Of course, I do."
"He's incredibly kind, generous--"
My dry-cleaning guy is kind and generous.
Where's the prednisone?
Left bottom shelf.
I know him. I do.
Does he fold the newspaper inside out when he reads it...
... andthenforgetstoputitback when he is done?
Clips his toenails in bed?
-Drips when the toilet seat's down?
-Abby.
-Likes jam on his grilled cheese?
-l can learn during the marriage.
"-Yes, but I don't think that's-- -l love Michael..."
... andI couldusealittlesupporthere.
"I am very happy for you, I really am."
"And, of course, I'll stand up for you."
I wouldn't miss it.
-Great.
-Okay.
"Dr. Pratt, you got a moment?"
-Sure.
-Walk with me?
All right.
"This young man, K.J. Thibeaux?"
You've been sponsoring him as a Volunteen.
Yeah.
"He got in the surgical floor storeroom, stole a digital video camera."
-What?
Get out of here.
-l don't wanna make a big issue...
"Yeah, true."
Might as well.
How'd it go with the sponsors?
Not well.
They love you.
They just don't think it's a great fit.
What did they say?
They weren't impressed with your last fight.
"I told them you were sick, but the real issue is the stuff with your dad."
Ryan.
"What the fuck am I supposed to do about that, Lisa?"
I already went to fucking prison.
I know.
I think it's just getting people to understand what you've been through.
It's none of their fucking business.
That's personal.
I don't want to talk about that.
Maybe there's a way to do it that doesn't suck.
Let me think about it.
All right.
[Indistinct chatter]
Alvey:
Yes?
[Door opens]
Mario Goldsmith's here.
"Oh, yeah, send him in."
- The poison pen.
"- How are you, Alvey?"
I'm great.
I'm great.
Have a seat.
Thanks for coming.
Someone]
Whoa!
Nana!
How you doing?
Looking hot in the tracksuit.
Gym's on the second floor.
[J.D.] Date time.
Dude.
There you are.
Two things.
"First, aliens are here wearing tracksuits."
"- Oh, no, that's Nana."
- Second...
I got a job.
- Nice.
"- If you hadn't pushed me to do that extra mile stuff, that wouldn't have happened, so thank you."
You got a hottie waiting for you at the bar.
You go get her!
- Where were we?
- Do I smell banana conditioner?
"That's one of my conditioners, yes."
"[J.D.] As great as this was, I couldn't stop thinking about what Turk said..."
This girl really digs hair.
It's hard getting what happens at the hospital out of your head.
Ah!
How was your first stress-free day?
Horrible.
You?
Worse.
Let's make a baby.
"If it doesn't work this time, I'll kill myself."
Not helping with the stress.
"Nadine, I'm sure you recognize Acacio... and this is Gordo, his manager."
Gordo is more than my agent.
He's my buddy.
"In English, please."
- Sorry.
- Hi.
How's it going?
Acacio's going to play in England.
I know.
I saw it on TV.
Speculation.
Nothing's signed yet.
- Twelve million is cheap.
- You're crazy!
Acacio was the top goal scorer in the last two Rio championships.
"If I were him, I'd only sign for 1 5."
Acacio was the top goal scorer in the last two Rio championships.
She's right.
Twelve million is too little.
Acacio is a great player.
"Thanks, but I don't need anyone to defend me."
You watch and see if he's not the best.
Senor Juan.
That's me.
Can we talk for a moment?
"Of course, Mr. Vermont."
Have you finished the American contract?
Not yet.
It's almost ready.
"You know, Americans are sticklers for details."
I come from three generations of tailors.
- Details are my specialty.
Sound?
Sound rolling.
Speed.
"Dunkirk film, scene 17, take one."
"Good luck, Lieutenant Lundbeck."
Action!
"- Here, boy."
- Here.
"Come on, boy."
"Don't be a fool, Johnnie."
There's a sniper out there.
And he's got a friend.
It's a Karabiner 98 Kurz.
Best damn gun since the Win chester 73.
I'm most awfully sorry.
I'm afraid I've lost my line.
Cut.
Jesus.
Twenty-three takes.
We only stopped because we ran out of film stock.
The War Office wanted him.
The distributors wanted him.
And no one thought to give him a bloody screen test?
"Well, can't we replace him?"
This film has a significant part to play in putting the national case to the American public.
- He's the template.
"- If that lump of Yank stays, the film fails and the national case with it."
He is a brave boy.
Would you or I be so brave?
Is Mr. Baker all right?
- He lost one of his grandsons.
- Oh...
"I said, all right, Horace."
"I called a time out so you can go take a leak, all right?"
"I mean, what am I gonna do?"
"He's my nephew and he's crying, right?"
"So I said, okay, honey, go to the toilet, I'll put Ralphie in right field, all right?"
So you can go take a pee pee.
"And he's crying, just standing there."
"I said, what's the matter with you?"
I thought you had to go make a pee pee?
Now go make a pee pee!
"And he says... (high pitched) Uncle Pete, Uncle Pete, it's too late!"
I look and he's got piss all over his pants!
His pants are covered in piss!
"Remember that, Horace?"
Remember when you peed your pants in little league?
Where you going?
"Oh, come on, you little crybaby!"
"- Don't cry, little Horace."
Horace:
He's all right.
"He's all right, Pa."
man:
"Oh, Jesus."
"- Hey, Horace, didn't your other boy play baseball, too?"
- Yeah.
"Yeah, Little Pete's good."
- Yeah.
"- He's on a team, he's great."
"Shortstop, and he can hit it."
Fantastic.
"- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey."
Where you been?
"Higaki, we're counting on you."
- We are counting on you!
- We are counting on you!
Isn't this what idiots say?
Don't be jabbering around me.
Apologize Higaki.
I can't forgive what you said just now.
"If I lose, I'll kneel on the floor to apologize."
"Higaki, you know what you gotta do?"
The day I lose to that chibi is the day I die.
I'm a pro.
Sixth match.
Hyotei's Higaki against Seigaku's Echizen.
You... are the pillar of Seigaku.
"Ah, you don't have to be so bothered, it's just a tennis game."
"But chibi, it doesn't matter what kind of genius you are, I won't give any chances."
I'm the real genius.
A dog that doesn't bite barks the most.
Hoh!
A kid like you wouldn't know.
"Weak, huh."
Love - 15
- Out!
- 15
- All
30 - 15
That fellow.
40 - 15
Game Seigaku.
One game to love.
Seigaku leading.
"Damn kid, dares to look down on me."
Enough.
"Come on, what the hell has gotten into you the last couple of days?"
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
You think I can't do this by myself?
You think I'm on something?
"- ""On something""?"
- Yeah.
- I never said you were on something.
- Then don't.
Don't start.
"Hey, now we're talkin' here."
She's a killer.
You're goddamn right I'm a killer.
You look like a Holocaust victim in pageant makeup.
"- I will eat your babies, bitch."
- Bring it!
- Nobody's eating babies.
"- Hey, you lookin' to spar, little girl?"
- No.
No fight.
She's not ready.
"- Oh, I'm ready."
"- No, you're not ready."
- I'm ready!
Let me eat her babies.
"- What about next Friday, huh?"
- Yeah.
How's Friday?
- You're crazy.
- How's Friday to you?
"What's the matter, ""Frankie Fat Hands""?"
- You're afraid she's gonna get knocked out just like you did?
- That's good.
That's not what I said though.
- What do you mean?
- When you were... born.
When I was born?
You mean changing diapers and things?
- I did that.
- I know you did.
"Remember, once I went out into the road... and you waited, and you gave me a spanking... for going out in the road?"
- Do you remember?
"- Oh, I remember that one too."
That was a tough -
- And you -
- That was a tough corner.
And you used to take me fishing?
Right?
"Oh, I did."
Every week.
Every week we went fishing and horseback riding.
Remember?
- Do you -
"- Well, I liked doing those things."
- We enjoyed ourselves.
- We did enjoy ourselves.
I'm still livin'.
Yes.
And I'm glad you are.
"- I'm not bad, eh?"
- I think you're great.
You still look pretty handsome to me.
[Chuckles]
- I'm not bad.
That land was already sold to the state when you planted your mine.
No one's taken that trail in 50 years.
Hauser.
But thanks for telling me where to dig.
So have you found the twin tree?
It's you.
You're here.
And so are you.
"Officer Hauser, the twin tree..."
any leads?
Not yet.
But I'm working on it.
- Day and night.
"- Well, I'm here to help."
In those shoes?
"Well, I thought we could start with you asking me to dinner."
I found the twin tree.
And Petty's last bomb.
So much death from something so small.
You know her methods?
Fix her.

"Hey, Trent, quit twerking."
Don't look at me while you're twerking!
- Don't look me in the eyes while you're twerking!
- He's looking at me!
Tell me where you pawned Candace's ring please?
Oh the ring.
News flash.
I never pawned it.
- You turned it into a tongue stud?
"- Oh, my God, it's perfect!"
All right.
You're gonna give that diamond back
OK.
"As Matthew McConaughey would never say, all wrong, all wrong, all wrong."
Trent says no.
Trent smells so good.
"OK, OK."
I got this.
I got this.
Come on.
You heard the lady.
- The diamond belongs to Candace.
- What are you gonna do about it guv'ner?
"Well, I think that speaks for itself."
"Sorry, guys."
You're never getting this back.
"Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go show my capitalism."
Capitalism's what I call my dong now.
"Hey, Trent."
You're on the main stage in five minutes.
Watch out.
"No matter what I do, this kid just won't stop."
And now they're gonna be in a show together?
!
"Jesus, it's all over for me."
They'll probably even have a kissing scene!
What did I do to deserve this?
And what am I supposed to do now?

- To come down here and discuss your options.
- I will try anything... anything.
"I will try an experimental drug, uh, uh, more surgery."
"Uh, anything!"

I-I can't pass up lobster.

I'm a fellow traveler here.
"Uh, Larry..."

Do you like lobster?
"Well, my... my religion forbids shellfish, but I-I-I'd be happy to take you."
You just wait right here.
I'm just gonna get my coat.

And you.
"Look, you Boss told you to give me something in this replacement."
Then give me and go.
"No, How could I give you that?"
"It's not your age, Age not concerns."
"You know, how many little people has gone there."
"Look, I can't raise you up."
"I am saying, Sorry."
"I am saying, Sorry."

"Kill me, please!"
Kill me.
Let me go.
What you've done?
We stop him to go.
"Don't touch him, He is my Laxminarayan."
"No, he's our Laxminarayan."

"He's our piece, He's not a piece, he's Laxminarayan."
"He's ours, He's mine."
"He's ours, He's mine."

"Yes, Madam, Where are you?"
You know Laxminarayan was coming on 11:00.
"Yes, Madam but how could he?"
He's lay down here.

Thank you very much.
Federico?
It's Max.
Were you having dinner?
"Well, don't worry."
It's not urgent.
"No, I just wanted to end the other day discussion."
Because...
I think you cut the conversation in a very frivolous way.
Yes.
You said I was a fanatic intellectual..
From the 17th century searching for the absolute truth.
Well...
I'm not trying to sermonize you.
I just wanted to end the discussion.
"Okay, go eat your dinner."
But don't think that's an end to this.
You and your bitch will regret this.
Mark my words.
- Right.
- OK.
I need a drink.
Aargh!
Hm.
Your name is reynolds and before that it was knealy.

You just don't understand.
"If it makes me act the way you've been acting all your life,"
- I hope i never get it!
"- Whatever, mama!"
And you know how you're always giving me those bible scriptures
And those quotes from famous people?
"Well, here's a bible scripture for you..."
"""The wealth of the wicked is laid upon the righteous."""
"Well, i am the righteousness of god."
"- Why didn't you give me that scripture, mama?"
- Oh.
Oh.

This not Khurana's stuff.
This is my wife.

It's Khurana's stuff.
He sells this cheap stuff.
Why the police?
Stand in line everyone.
Open your bags.
- l know.
"Why don't you take that note, give it to the American Consulate, and let's not get any more involved, please."
Why don't you get the key?
I'll take care of the driver.
Alright.
"Say, uh... you know a Mrs Drayton?"
- English lady.
- That's right.
Did you see her coming from the marketplace in the last hour?
"- No, sir."
- Wait a minute.
This is very important.
- She had my little boy with her.
"- No, sir."
- What about Mr Drayton?
- Mr Drayton checked out.
- He what?
- Checked out.
- But he couldn't have.
"- Yes, sir, he did."
"Mr Drayton, the Englishman with the horn-rimmed glasses."
"Yes, sir."
He checked out.
"(Sighs) I don't know about you, but I'm exhausted."
"I'll call Mrs Drayton, tell her she can bring Hank back."
"- Just hold that call a minute, Jo."
- Why?
Because I asked you to!
"Ben, are we about to have our monthly fight?"
I hope not.
"Well, then stop acting like that."
I merely said I was going to call Mrs Drayton.
"She loved me, you must understand."
"What, you think I don't understand love?"
It's better for the other.
- What's next?
- For what is above.
But you talk to God?
Could you not remain just for two minutes?
It would be sad.
- What isn't?
Open your eyes.
- I don't know how to see.
- But I know inside and I see later ...
- And have I came inside?
Young.
Want to check?
- So I'll be like your bitch!
"- No, you would not do."
And is this what you want?
"You are truly a beautiful asshole, cousin."
It's André.
"André, that's my cousin Leon."
André is a guy who fucks good.
"It is well established by my mother, and I was placed in his lap."
"Marivaux is nice, but side slut, he prefers me."
And once in America that could be done?
Mr. de La Fayette will give the instructions.
Aglaé!
- Aglaé!
- I come!
There is Simon there?
Who has two ...
There are two ...
Shit.
"Okay, go to promo."
The breaking news appears to be...
"Higher, higher!"
"...That, ah, for some stupid reason"
I have become the suspect.
"Hey, easy flatfoot."
I am with child.
Ow!
Ten thousand years old...
I can't take this.
"Welcome to ""Ends of Days Exercise."""
"Let's start stretching, shall we?"
Breathe.
And breathe.
Breathe in the darkness and let out the light.
You're letting go of life.
Feel that stretch.
"And now that we are nimble, let's do some cardio."
Start running on the spot.
This is good;
"it makes us feel like we are only 1,000 years old."
Let's get your seven hearts beating.
"Let's get your heartrate to over 3,000 beats per minute."
"Coffee, miss Gablechuck?"
"No, thanks."
So I'm sure you've heard about Heather Weather?
"Yes, that she was murdered."
"No, that she'd been shaving her age."
She's really 62 years old.
"Wh- oh, um..."
I'm not surprised.
What's yourshow tonight?
"Here, this is formaking a Zenne out of me."
You're a natural.
"Take this, idiot."
Go to my apartment and take whatever you want.
I don't need yourfilthy stuff.
Ah OKthen...
Don't you everwear colorless clothes again.
I don't want to see you in white ever again.
I'll miss you too.
Answerthe phone.
Please.
You sneaky little cunt.
"You faggot's daughter, you!"
My brotheris saving himself from you.
Your God left you a cripple.
You're gonna die here all alone.
Dad.
"One, two, three, four..."
"Five, six, seven, eight."
"Ahmet, raise yourarms."
Ahmet?
"Follow him, son."
"Ahmet, raise yourarms..."
"Four, five, six, seven, eight."
And we neverforget to smile.
Abig round of applause.
"That's one, two, three solid leads."
Three.
We'd need 30 private contracts to make up the kind of revenue we're out.
"Hey, we're doing our best here."
I don't think he's alive.
"We've gotta do something, or that bastard will get us first."
Shut the damn door!
What's in that jar?
Which one?
The one with the red lid.
It's just soy sauce.
Bring it over.
"What, are you deaf?"
"Out of the way, come on."
Stand back.
What is that?
I'll be fucked...
It's a real wicked spirit we've got here.
"You don't want to leave, do you?"
Let's
Stop it!
Hyo-ijn!
"Come here, you!"
You met up with something recently you weren't supposed to?
I don't follow you.
Did you disturb someone?
"Of all the evil I've seen, this is the strongest."
You disturbed it.
"Oh, God!"
What do we do now?
Who is it?
Who did you disturb?
Tell him.
A Japanese man...
I knew it.
That's no man.
You asked how long we've been friends a minute ago.
Oh yes...
Alright.
- We met in a hospital.
- In a hospital?
Yea.
"It was that dull hospital over at Lexington, know it?"
No.
We were doctors.
"I mean, surgeons."
Violet tells me to say surgeons.
"Working at the hospital never gave me bad dreams, that's for sure."
"Anyway, she's my best friend ever."
I'm kinda worry about her sometimes though.
"Half the time, I wish I was more like her."
And then...
What?
I don't know.
She reminds me of my daughter.
Is that her on the phone machine?
But it's not important.
"It is, but... don't let it distract you."
- What's with that?
- What's with what?
The numbers you two have.
- This?
- Yes.
"Oh, that's our rank."
Officially I'm killer number Nine and Violet's killer number Eight.
And how do you move up?
Makin' hits.
Vi says it beats dead entries.
"No, no, that ain't the woman!"
I ought to know!
"- Curly ought to know, too."
"- You're screwy, Curly."
That's just somebody who looks like her.
"You ain't going to work the boy over, are you?"
"That all depends on you, Joe."
You wanna talk?
"Listen, boy- You're not mine, see?"
"They just think you are, see?"
"So no matter what they do to you, you can take it."
I know that you can.
"Just like your old man, see?"
I don't know what you're talking about!
Let me go home to mother and dads!
"Don't let them throw you, Joey!"
Start him off.
"I think you'll decide to talk, Joe."
"Start walking, Sonny."
- What ?
- Get a move on!
Walk!
Pick them up!
Feet!
Feet!
"All right, my son."
Dad's at breakfast.
"You're not going to sleep all day, are you?"
"Oh, always throwing your things around."
Don't you want to eat breakfast ?
Paul!
Paul!
"Oh, Rache ..."
Why did I bother?
That does not bother to.
"We both miss him, John."
- I gotta go.
Talk to you later.
- Okay.
OK.
"- Hey, thanks for your looking for."
- No problem.
I never listened to?
Newer attırdım their signature.
Will be very famous.
This is a great Rook ...
Many are not my favorite kind.
You will understand what the hell is?
Shall I wear something on me.
Then they go to Sam to figure out.
"Tell your father, the latter one."
"After that, the file will not be another, right?"
"Losing it, Rook."
What do you mean?
Do not count on this halledebileceğime?
Jade told me to do.
That's it.
Asshole ...
The sculptures of pure heroin.
"Calculates according to the head, the value of $ 20 million."
"- It's beautiful, is not it?"
- Seems to be crying.
"Yes, I know."
The flows of goods.
I was always different.
My mom is an angry woman.
Life was neverthe same.
When I moved to Istanbul for university... she hired Zindan.
"Even so, she destroys my clothes... if she doesn't like them."
Why can't you be honest and tell the truth to yourparents?
Honesty is the easiest.
You don't understand.
Honesty will kill me.
"No, I can't understand."
What could possibly happen?
They are your parents.
They love you.
My mom is obsessed with cleaning.
I am not clean.
"What ever happens, happens."
We can change it.
We're going to the police.
"Tomorrow, OK?"
"Sir, we need to ask you a few questions."
Yourson Ahmet filed a complaint.
These youngsters...
You know how my wife can get...
Nevermind.
"Hello, you're still sleeping?"
Don't shout.
I need a driver.
"Can, have you gone nuts?"
Yourfoolish aunt didn't tell me...
"Thanks to Ahmet, she doesn't know."
Come in...
Come in.
Don't you talk about Haziya.
At least use a decent knife.
What's wrong with you?
Unbelievable.
It's Isabelle Moretti.
So answer already.
"Remember, only Ricky talks."
She gave us exactly 15 minutes.
- Hello.
- Hello.
"Come in, you can leave the gate open."
Are you the one I spoke to?
- Are you Jonah's son?
"- No, I'm her daughter Dorona's husband."
- Pleased to meet you.
- Pleased to meet you.
"- And these are her sons, Natanel..."
- Pleased to meet you.
"Pardon me, I'm religious."
- And Shai.
- Pleased to meet you.
"At first I thought you were an Israeli producer, that's why I said I don't make movies there."
I don't like the Mideast any more.
Your smile looks like Jonah's.
- Did you know her?
"- No, but Maurice showed me a photo once-."
How is she?
She died three weeks ago.
I'm so sorry.
I thought her children wanted to bring her and Maurice together but I guess that only happens in movies.
Come.
"- Leon, Maurice Leon."
And now I'm here.
- So you want money from me?
- Money?
"Earn it, yes."
Together with you guys I wanna earn money.
Work together.
I thought it would work out in a more respectable way but I've been a fool.
"Now, I'm here."
What am I supposed to do?
Play a barrel organ?
"No, I'd rather be a thief."
I did the best I could.
"But that is over, forever."
Even if I lose my head now.
- So that's your new attitude?
- No no no no!
I did the best I could!
Now I'm here and I will stay!
Now you can think about it.
- What are you doing here?
"- Franz, come home please!"
What happened to you?
- What happened to you?
- None of your business!
It's gonna be allright.
Do you really think so?
I've been starving and freezing and it all turned out just fine.
You are Mieze.
I used to be Franz's girlfriend.
I'm Cilly.
I really know nothing about Franz.
You look very pretty.
- Capote.
- Capote?
- Capote.
Sweet tooth.
"Straight-up fag, Mr C."
- Flaming!
"- Thank you, Mr Ricard."
We can now promote you up to kindergarten.
Anybody else?
"Once, twice..."
"Miss Johnson, I apologise if any of this is over your head."
"If you see me after class, I'll give you some chapters."
Anybody?
It's a non-fiction novel.
"Capote mixed true events with things he couldn't know, so he made them up."
He created a new genre.
White folks back then felt safe.
Capote scared them.
He took hardcore crime out of the ghetto and placed it in America's backyard.
That's what makes the book special.
"Yes, that's part of it."
That's all of it.
We got a debate going on now.
Capote wasn't first.
Richard Wright and James Baldwin did the same.
"Wasn't nobody trying to read them, though."
A lot of people read them.
A lot of people like who?
You?
Didn't think so.
"Hey, yo!"
"Mr C, Mr C."
"Are you all right, Sharon?"
"Are you all right, Sharon?"
- Now?
- Yeah.
"Aw, God almighty."
"Jesus, Sharon."
"You'll soon be the same shape as me, what?"
Thanks very much.
Now I've got to know what is and isn't mine
He's coming!
He's coming!
If you received my letter
We should have met him at the airport.
Not at all.
Then you'll know just what to do
If you still want me
If
You still want me
"Well, tie a yellow ribbon"
'Round the old oak tree
It's been three long years
Do you still want me?
Still want me
If I don't see a ribbon
'Round the old oak tree
I'll stay on the bus
Forget about us
Put the blame on me
"Craig, love."
Sharon's having a baby.
Is that right?
"That's right, yeah."
- Come on.
"- Oh, my goodness."
Are you getting tired?
You want me to wheel you?
- No!
- All right.
- Absolutely no.
- All right.
This is a big place.
Do you know where you're going?
When we come in the first building - You come into the building -
One second.
Could it be over there?
"- Yes, it must be."
- You think it might be there?
- Yeah.
- 'Cause there's more than one entrance.
- But we're gonna look at them all.
"- Well, there's a fence there."
Let's have a look.
Do you see it here?
"- No, not here?"
"- It's downstairs, where you come in."
All right.
Let's go to the other entrance.
I think I know which one you're talking about.
This way.
- I'm thinking it might be along here.
- It's in the entrance.
"Well, let's - let's have a look here."
And he never even told me it was there.
- He didn't tell you?
-Of course you're sorry.
is that your signature?
We record the receipt of all documents.
What about phone calls?
You keep a log of them?
"Take a minute for me, please."
Look up the dates of Frank Anselmo's calls to this office.
"You're in the wrong pew, Mr. Calhoun."
Frank Anselmo never called this office.
What about the mayor?
"He's in his dressing room, Mr. Calhoun."
Where you been?
I was looking for you.
Trying to get to Senator Marquand.
"Well, he got through to me."
They're moving the convention to Miami.
Miami?
Why?
They like Miami.
Glamour.
"Whoopi Goldberg, Madonna just bought houses in South Beach."
Maybe we can nominate them.
I thought it was all cut.
"Cut, not cut."
Politics.
Nothing's cut.
Where you going?
I'm gonna pay my respects to Nettie Anselmo.
Do you think that's wise?
-What's wise got to do with it?
-The perception--
Fuck perception!
- His doctor?
I don't know.
"Oh, wait a minute. it could be a Dr Kessler."
"Yeah, Dr Kessler is a cardiologist here."
"- Could you check with him, please?"
- Sure.
Let me check.
'Dr Sigapelli to Cardiology.
Dr Sigapelli.'
I went to the market for five minutes and he's gone!
Where is Saul?
"- Take it easy, Lena."
- Rick won't tell me nothing!
- What's happened?
- Saul may have had a heart attack.
"- Oh, God, no!"
- It's all right.
We don't know yet.
- Is there any word?
"- No, not yet."
"Dr Kessler will be here in a moment, but he knows nothing of a Mr Greenberg suffering a heart attack."
And international Life Support haven't dispatched an ambulance since last night.
Where is he?
What happened to Saul?
Where is he?
"Please, where is my husband?"
"Oh, Thomas."
- Please be calm.
- Why don't you go and find my husband?
Why don't you just go and find my Saul instead of torturing me!
- Lena!
Officer?
Just hold your horses.
POLICE RADIO:
Something came in for you at 3813 Hanover Lane.

Who is she?
Electrocuted.
She was electrocuted in the bathtub.

But how did the curling iron fall into the tub?
There's no shelf or anything above the tub.
It's funny.
"When I saw her, I thought she was healthy."
Saw who?
Who was in there?
"- What, you got bumped?"
- No.
"Mm, they, uh, found a girl with better hobbies."
Would you quit?
No.
I decided not to be on that list.
Because...
"Well, just because."
Don't feel like you have to cancel your blind date.
I'm not going on that date.

I have to fine you for speeding.
"Make it fast, I don't want to miss the sunset."
"You know, when the sun goes down into the sea?"
hello Ma'am.
I came to say hello.
- I'II make you some good coffee.
- It's not forthat.
"Here you are, would you Iike some?"
"No, if I may, this time I'm bringing you something."
"It's a specialty from my area, smell the fragrance."
"- ""Invernizzi Gim""."
- It's gorgonzoIa.
- You'II like it.
- Thank you.
"It's soft gorgonzoIa, excellent for appetizers."
It should go in the fridge.
I'm off.
"- Wait, some coffee."
- Duty calls.
I have to work.
"Oh, come on."
Who'd check out some gorgeous hottie walking down the street?
- Thanks.
- I was talking about me.
Alex... there's no reason to get paranoid.
But just to be on the safe side...
- What?
- Just go with me on this.
Who was that?
No idea.
I'm really starting to like this hiding thing.
- Don't answer it.
- Not planning on it.
I have to answer it.
It's my assistant.
"Hey, Molly."
"Okay, calm down."
I'm on my way.
I have to go sign some contracts that were dropped off at my apartment by mistake.
Can we pick this up a little later?
It's not like I'm a faucet.
You can't just turn me on and off.
Step.
Step.
We're just going in there to pick up some documents.
Fine.
- And make out a little.
- Works for me.
Surprise!
"Scott, this is everybody."
"Everybody, you all know Scott-- the enemy."
Molly... you did all this for me?
"Normal saline, wide open."
"Four milligrams morphine, IV Push, PRN."
"Immobilize that spine with a collar, side head supports, and straps."
Be very careful.
"Okay, that's a roger."
The respiration is rapid and shallow.
"Oh, yeah."
Easy.
Did he say anything about who hit him?
"No, man, he didn't say anything."
Easy.
There we go.
Sugar.
"Ollie, he's going to crump on me."
Can you...
Do you want me to pull over?
"I got it, I'm styling."
Just get us there.
Watch for Mary.
Listen for her bell.
It's a death bell.
"I'm bagging away here, but I'm getting airway resistance."
Has his trachea deviated?
"Big time, to the right."
Fudgebar.
He's going V-Fib.
"The fun never ends, huh?"
Clear.
"Come on, Danny."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we're back."
"Liz, get a cutdown tray ready for chest tube insertion, please."
You okay with this one?
And... and you're right.
You're right.
It's not... it's... it's not just about you and me anymore.
And being a good mother means doing what's best for your child.
"And you may not understand this, and you may never... forgive me for it, but I..."
I walked out that door tonight to do what's best for Lucas.
This is what's best for Lucas.
You're what's best for Lucas.
This is me being a good mom.
Violet?
Violet.

I had a dog like him once.
I went to have him put down.
He jumped out of my arms at the vet's and took off for the park.
Sometimes I still think I see him out there...
... watchingme...
... gnawingonan oldbone.
Excuse me.
"Hello, Nettie."
Can I help you with the basket?
"No, no. I didn't know Frank was expecting you."
Due espressi?
.
Maybe later.
"99 out of 1 00 times, we can beat something like this."
I don't like the odds.
We go back a long way.
"I know, I know."
"I tried to close the door, Frank."
Couldn't get it shut.
-What do you want me to do?
-Take the pressure off yourself.
Here's the thing.
They'll tell you:
"""""Yeah, yeah, sure."
You have the key to the cell.
"Go ahead. """""
But you won't be able to open it without singing.
You're a singer.
"Give me a chance, and I'll show you how quiet I can be."
"It's out of my hands, Frank."
"Do the right thing, will you?"
-Make it easy for yourself.
"If she doesn't pay, it comes out of my pocket."
Why call the police?
We'll make her parents pay.
Do you really need the police?
I feel bad for her.
"What, are you willing to pay what she owes?"
"No, but..."
"She won't tell us her address, she's a runaway."
Hey!
Let go of me!
Let go of me!
Hey!
He's not coming back.
"He hasn't replied yet, right?"
You were tricked.
Shut up!
He said he's not doing that anymore.
He tells that lie to everyone.
Get your hands off me!
What're you doing here?
Ow...
Let's go.
He went and fought for her.
What about you?
They must be in round two.
Take it easy.
I have to go.
"Does your husband do this to you, too?"
"No, he won't even lay a finger on me."
Sergeant Fujita must be asleep with your kid now.
Don't...
"You're a naughty wife, leaving the kid to your husband."
You watch your job!
I don't understand him.
What's this man talking about?
"Come on, boys, don't be crazy."
Because of you all the gang is at a stand-still.
"-Boys, come on."
-No boys.
Look.
-Reproduction artists.
"-We are starting a new life, boss."
"-Here is the agreement, master."
"-""Group Biceps""."
-We are going down the artistic road.
-Therefore... we can fuck this job.
"Cursed, fucking job!"

And now we will play for our Rose from the canteen.
This is a magnificent feeling!
Splendid.
Indeed.
How does it work?
What's wrong with you?
"Well, what's up?"
Nothing.
I'm working.
"Well, you're working, but this isn't working."
You're right.
And does yours work?
I can't see a button anywhere.
Maybe it's centrally controlled somehow.
A kind of central control.
Hallo!
Have a nice life.
Françoise.
Thank you.
Thomas.
You hate me.
Is that it?
You must stop calling me.
File a complaint with my insurance.
I will still call you.
Yeah.
I'll never file a complaint.
It's not my style.
I wouldn't have complained to your boss either.
You don't say.
It's obvious you love your work.
What?
I love my work?
As if fucking the disabled was a vocation.
No one forces you to do this.
- Yes.
They do.
How can you be forced into it?
I did some things.
What things?
Illegal things.
I can't talk about it.
I was given a substitution sentence.
Wait a second.
You were sentenced to being a prostitute for the disabled?
You don't have to insult me.
- No.
I'm a hostess.
-Everybody to Hawaii!
-wonderful!
-It will be a great holiday!
"-Grandma, Iet's go!"
"Let's go, please!"
Wait!
My mother also wrote...
"""Dear Grandma, Suzujiro told us to stay at his home."
"""No sense staying at a hotel."
"""We decided to take advantage of his hospitality."
"""It is such a big, magnificent residence."
"""We are just loafing around."
"""The garden is beautiful, and nothing is better than the ocean-side view."
"""Grandma, please do come!"
"Yoshie."""
Look!
It's a gorgeous home!
It looks just like a hotel!
Here's another letter.
"It's from clark, Suzujiro's son."
It's written in katakana.
"Here, can you see it?"
"""Dear Aunt..."
"""I am the son..."

"- Oh, the setup is all wrong."
I'm bound to wind up behind the eight ball with you.
What do you mean?
"Well, by your standards, I'm a wrong guy."
- You're the sweetest guy in the world.
"- No, you don't know what I mean."
- You don't know my racket.
- I don't care about your racket.
You sure?
"Not now, I don't."
Hello?
Mike.
That guy gets in your hair.
"- Hello, what do you want?"
- I'll tell you.
- You better get down here fast tonight.
- For what?
This Joe is on the loose.
They're stringing with him.
"I'm telling you straight, the guy threw me out."
You're frozen out.
Tell him to get here.
Tell him what he tried to do.
Louis is burned too.
He said Joe tried to hold him up today for cash.
"Oh, yeah?"
"Well, listen, you tell Louis I'm getting right down there."
"- Yeah, right away."
"- Yeah, okay."
"- What's wrong, Patsy?"
"- Oh, no, nothing."
Nothing at all.

- Get back.
What are you going to do with these people?
"Mind your own business, priest."
"- Father, what do these men want?"
- Begin.
No.
"For heaven's sake, no!"
No!
- You're insane!
Bloody murderers!
- Get back!
Carrasco used you so that he could escape.
"- Come on, take out two more."
"- All right, Coronel."
Get up!
Come on!
"Have you got a cold, Ed?"
I didn't have a minute... didn't have a minute ago.
"Scratch me there, will you?"
- Here?
-(sneezes)
"Boy, this usually only happens when I'm... when I'm around dogs."
(sneezes)
- You got a dog?
"-Uh, yes, I have, Ed."
- Maybe you'd better go.
-Huh?
"Oh, no, no, no."
I'm all right.
"It's just, uh, the..."
Whose dog is it?
It's mine.
I got it at the pound.
But please don't say anything to Ralph about it before I do.
He doesn't think we should have a dog in the apartment.
"Oh, no, no, no, I won't."
I won't.
I won't.
"I'd like to look at the dog, if you don't mind."
"Well, do you think you should, Ed?"
"Oh, I'm-I'm all right."
It's just... (begins to sneeze) ...just after the initial attack is over then I'm all right.
I want to look at the pooch.
Where is he?
"Hi, there, little poochy boy!"
"Oh, what a beautiful dog this is."
Hey!
Hey!
Carl.
Carl?
Carl.
"Oh, no!"
"Oh, no."
Someone's taken Carl's brain!
That is what I've been trying to tell you.
Really?
"Well, you haven't been very specific about it!"
I know I haven't.
"Because they says if I tell anyone,"
I'm gonna lose my job dancing in front of the car wash.
"Well, I'll tell you what, we're gonna do something about it right now."
"Look here, we can keep this cool, between us 'cause, look, this the third job I lost this week."
Come on y'all.
We're gonna go get us a car wash.
Are you outta your mind?
They take your brain out!
I know that!
They take your brain out over there.
"Here, I got a coupon."
"That's okay, Carl."
I got the employee discount.
Free triple foam polish with UV protectorant.
"Come on, Shake."
I'm trying to create a show here.
I'm a show.
What time the show come on?
Brain:
"Brain Slave, report to Brain Quarters."
"Brain Slave, kindly report to Brain Quarters."
Brain Slave!
- There's no problem?
- No.
Where's my camera?
"Ali, where is it?"
I haven't seen it.
Look in the glove-box.
- Wait for me.
"- Farzad, put the bread there."
"Hello, engineer."
Hello.
"Farzad, wrap up the bread or it will dry out."
Would you like tea?
"Yes, thank you."
My colleagues are sleeping.
We'll have a walk and come back.
Off you go.
Which way's your school?
This way and that.
You have two schools then?
"No, there are two paths to school."
Where's the square?
This way.
You don't mind.
"Come this way, I'll get my camera."
What a handsome white village!
"Why is it called ""Black Valley""?"
The ancestors called it that.
"Can't you call it ""White Valley""?"
"No, we have to call it by its name."
It has to stay that way.
That's how it is.
"""When you're fahed ho be black..."
[Brakes Screech]
[Cloudy] Here.
I'm pretty sure that was the frog.
He made me too.
He lives on four.
He went up to six.
He's cute.
Real cute.
The other guy's a frog too.
He checked into the Edison.
- Had a hooker sent up.
- You could have collared him right there.
- Who's on him?
- Klein.
- How 'bout Sal?
- We put him to bed for the night.
"Why don't you do the same, Doyle?"
You look like shit.
- [Cloudy] Come on.
- Look.
My partner and I made this case.
You know?
Originally.
We don't want any feds screwing' it up.
Case?
So far you haven't showed me a damn thing.
"You keep shootin' your mouth off, I'm gonna knock you right in the middle of next week."
"- Aw, get out— - [Cloudy] Knock it off."
"- Don't tell me to knock it off, goddamn it."
- We don't need this.
"Now, cut it out, will ya?"
For Christ's sakes!
We're cleared here.
Surveillance had them all going inside 45 minutes ago.
- Did anyone bail out on the perimeter?
"- No, ma'am."
All secure out here.
"Boss, this isn't a meth lab."
So why an escape tunnel?
Need to take a look at this.
Hotchner.
When?
Did they raise the terror alert?
"No, that's probably best."
"All right, get everybody in now."
I'll be there in a minute.
What's going on?
Nothing.
I just have to go to the office.
"It's 6:15, and you're talking about a terror alert?"
"It's bad, isn't it?"
I don't know yet.
Please don't lie to me.
It might be.
I may not be home tonight.
"I mean,"
- I might be home late.
- I know.
Shoot.
I forgot.
Tomorrow is the day we... scheduled to take Jack
- to have his pictures taken.
- Don't worry about it.
- I'll reschedule.
"""Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!"""
Now just pump the brakes right there.
- I got a question.
- Have at 'er.
Then I got a comment.
"Well, let's hear it, good buddy."
"Now, my question."
"When have you ever heard a girl go,"
"""Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes."""
- Well...
- Other than in a porno.
- I don't believe I have.
- Me neithers.
That's because we don't say that.
- Well...
- Not unless it's in a porno.
WAYNE:
Now my comment.
"You see, the way Dary did the ""yes, yes, yes, yes, yes's"""
"is not the way they do the ""yes, yes, yes"" in pornos."
That's the way they do it.
"The girl gets all excited, and she goes,"
"""Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes."""
"Yes, but the way you're doing the ""yes, yes, yes, yes's"""
"is not the way they do the ""yes, yes, yes, yes, yes."""
DARYL:
It is the way they do it.
"They go, ""Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes."""
- That's exactly how they do it.
- WAYNE:
"No, they don't."
What they do is they find a super-high pitch for those first four yes's.
- Really?
- Sure did.
"So, what made you just call me out of the blue like that?"
"Oh, well, Gary told me you said hi."
- I didn't say hi.
- You didn't?
"No, I told him to send you my regards."
I didn't say hi.
- Regards?
"- Yeah, regards."
"Anyway, I admit I was dumb to go to the bookstore to tell him I didn't say hi, but he didn't have to act so smug."
"Oh, I hate smugness."
Don't you hate smugness?
Smugness is not a good quality.
"Oh, my God, that man over there."
I think he's wearing glasses that look like Jake's.
Pull over.
Stop the car.
Here.
I think I've got a way of getting back at my ex- boyfriend.
Good.
Revenge is very good.
Excuse me.
- Excuse me.
Excuse me.
"Sir, sir?"
- Yeah.
"If you don't mind my asking, could you tell me where you got your glasses?"
- Malaysia.
- Malaysia?
Yeah.
"Look, I know this'll sound odd, but can I buy them from you?"
Alex looks nervous.
"Oh, God, I hope I'm doing the right thing."
I think you are.
"Ladies and gentlemen, the party is about to get started."
The dance floor is all yours!
"Okay, girls, lick your lips."
Come in close.
It's good to see ya.
Tell Claire I'm looking for her.
Your husband's a lucky guy.
- Mmm.
- Oh!
- Waiter!
Can we have more dressing?
- We were separated at birth.
"Two more drinks when you get a chance, please."
That would be nice.
This looks delicious.
I'm so happy.
I can't believe he's married.
I can't believe he chose Claire over you.
- I can.
- I told you not to introduce them.
"Well, she already had a husband."
I thought it was safe.
- How are you handling all this?
- I've learned my lesson.
No more fantasies about good-looking men.
You never know.
There's a guy out there somewhere for you.
"Oh, yeah?"
Who?
"Hey, Allie, my girl."
"Oh, how are you, sweetie?"
"Daddy, this is Luke."
"- Hi, Luke."
"- So nice to meet you, sir."
- I've heard a lot about you.
- You too.
And this is my sister.
I'm Lucy.
Hi.
Is anybody hungry?
Is anybody hungry?
"Luke, something wrong with your dinner?"
"No, no, no."
"No, everything's great."
I will guard the bathroom.
Just eat.
So the doors are off because...?
"Long story short, a few years ago, I locked Allie in her room and tried to strangle her with a nightgown."
I totally get it.
"Uh, my brothers and I used to fight all the time."
- It's not like your brothers.
- You don't know my brothers.
"Ha, ha."
"So your sister tried to kill you, why?"
The smoke detectors told me to.
Why they didn't just tell you to bake muffins is anybody's guess.
Did the smoke detectors talk to you?
"Yeah, mostly, back then."
Ahem.
"Luke, did Allie even tell you that she had a sister?"
"Yeah, yeah, but just that you were in law school."
-ls the mission possible?
"- lfwe were given this mission, it is possible."
Do you understand what all this might end with?
"If everything is all right, I'll get the USSR Hero Star."
Posthumously.
"No, everything is all right, comrade mayor."
Everything is OK.
Everything is all right.
is the line from the Chapayev movie?
And I'm not good at singing.
Neither am I.
Join in.
-And I do not know any more lines.
- Neither do I.
Still go on singing.
Let's go overthe same line again.
"Marysya, sweetie!"
is it him?
"-Misha, is that you?"
"- Master, it is us, Grisha and Valera."
Bloody hell!
"Folks, you are wet to the bones!"
"Take this, warm up a little."
"Take, please."
-What about yourfriend?
- The friend can not afford this.
Why so?
"Everything is all right, auntie."
"Comrade captain, we are sorry."
"Please, do not get offended..."
But we will not untie you so far.
"Okay, pal, hold it, hold it."
"Look, it's 14 to the right, then you go twice around to the left 'til you come to 22..."
And then back to zero.
What about the bodyguards and your lady friend?
"Those two bums, that fuckin' whore..."
They took off.
Is there anything else I should know?
"Hell, no..."
You kiddin' me?
"Hey, look, I swear."
"If you're lyin', I'll be back."
Hold on!
"You gotta be kiddin', buddy, I got your message."
"This fuckin' guy's crazy, man."
Wait until I get that fuckin' Johnny and Tony...
I'm gonna cut them both off.
Somebody get me out of here!
Get me out!
[Mourning dove calling]
[Dog barking]
[Dog growling]
[Electric knife whirring]
[Dog whining]
[Coughing]
[Water running]
"Hey, wait-wait a minute..."
"No, no, what are you doin'?"
Are you crazy...
Don't do that!
Stop it!
"Jesus Christ, don't!"
"Please, please, don't do that."
There's been a breach in the sim room.
JEANINE:
Get me a remote feed.
I wanna see who the hell is in there.
"The cameras are down in the sector, too."
I'm sending guards there now.
Let's go.
Bring up every cell.
Now.
Show her.
Tori finally found a way to get 'em out safely.
EVELYN:
How many others?
Every last one.
Let's go.
SOLDIER:
"South corridor, 40 yards down."
Tris?
"Tris, come on, we gotta move."
"Tris, we have to move."
I can't.
I can't.
My mom died protecting whatever's inside of this.
I have to open it for her and I think I know how.
"Tris, if we don't leave now, we're not gonna get outta here."
I have to do this first.
"Look, I know it doesn't make any sense, but you have to trust me, please."
"With my life, apparently."
MAN ON PA:
"All security teams, be advised, breach in..."
Do it.
MAX:
What a pleasure.
Good to see you.
"Good to see you, Bob."
"Dad, um, do you have a second?"
I want to talk to you about something.
Sure.
Please sit.
¶ not to let it go ¶
"You know, the contest that I won at boarding school..."
It was for drinking...
"Absinthe,"
And that was probably one of my-my tamer nights.
"The truth is I-I've had a pretty wild past,"
And I've been a part of more than one scandal.
"Serena, I don't care about any of that."
¶
I know.
I guess I was just...
Scared that...
"Once mom gets better,"
You...
You may not wanna stick around
If you knew the real me.
¶
"Honey, I want nothing more"
Than to be a part of all of your lives again.
I'm trying to figure out how big a role I can play
Without stepping on anybody's toes.
Yeah.
"You know, I love Rufus..."
But you're my dad.
He's not.
We had you in the top three for St Trinian's with Ricky from Kaiser Chiefs.
Did he do it in the end?
Yeah.
You weren't available.
LAUGHTER
Cheers(!
) That was a narrow miss.
Yeah.
What did you do before you became fabulous?
You were a beautician?
I was a beauty school dropout.
"Oh, lovely."
From Grease.
Now you're getting down to my level.
So that means you can look at people and make judgments.
Be very honest.
OK.
"Noel Fielding, Rob Brydon."
Two out there guys.
If you had to...
Give me a minute.
"If you had to pick, if you had to single out one for being a little bit styly..."
"Oh, I don't know."
It depends whether I like smart guys or Camden guys.
Suddenly there's a rivalry between us.
I like a bit of both.
Do you?
Oh...!
LAUGHTER
Did I?
"I wasn't, was I?"
I just didn't imagine I'd be having a threesome with Rob Brydon.
"Now, if somebody comes around your little sister and starts talking like that, you just gonna stand there and smile?"
No.
"You're gonna ask him to stop, which I did."
"And if they don't stop, what?"
You're not gonna do anything?
So are you saying you should not have apologized?
Not the way he's talking.
So that's a yes?
He didn't deserve an apology.
He deserved worse than what I gave him.
I should've messed him up worse.
"And with that latest salvo from Smash Williams, it appears the Dillon Panthers problems are far from over."
"Turn it off, will you, Crowley?"
"Hey, hey, hey!"
Hubby's home.
"How was your day, darling?"
It was...
It was good.
It was good.
"I sold a car, so..."
What?
You did?
Out-freaking-standing!
"Oh, man!"
You did!
Whoa.
"So, what?"
"You're like, you're like a car salesman now."
You're like Willy Loman!
"Yeah, you a salesman, huh?"
Yeah.
I guess I am.
The new Brain Slave refuses to report!
Ain't nothing but a brain.
"As are we, Son."
And we do our job!
"You right, Daddy."
You right!
"Go on and fetch this Brain Slave, and kindly ask him to be on bug removal!"
Permanently!
"Customer, Daddy!"
Get my blue fright wig at once!
"Greet them with a smile, Son."
A hard plastic smile.
"We got a free dashboard cleaning, get the lint balls off your car, free tire shine!"
You'll get all that with a free brain removal.
Carl Brain:
"Moron, don't tell them!"
I meant to say car wash.
Now gas them!
Quickly!
"Look, I just came by to tell you that I've told the police about your little brain operation here."
"Yeah, and they didn't believe us."
"No, they didn't."
Then we shall call them and show them pictures!
"That's a good idea, Daddy."
It is a very good idea.
Where's Carl's brain?
I am Carl Brain.
"No, Carl's Brain."
I am Carl Brain.
"No, no, no."
"Different carl, okay?"
I am Carl Brain.
I will take this further if you wish.
"- It's over, as far as I'm concerned."
"- Are you sure, Mrs. Coyne?"
"Yes, Captain Dreyfuss, I'm sure."
"Oh, excuse me."
You didn't come back.
"The shore, The Far Rock."
I walk there every day.
"That's how I know, but... you must feel free to walk there."
"The lough, this place, it's for everyone."
"You have a young fella out there, Michael, you might want to..."
You're not welcome here.
Surely to God you know that.
"I just got posted, sir, all right?"
I'm due to depart for England real soon.
I just wanted one last drink with my pal here.
"Michael, let him in."
The lad's off to do his duty.
Go on.
One!
Noches!
"Hey, Noches!"
"Give me a hand to redd up, will you, Barney?"
Noches!
He went home a while ago.
- Mr. Coyne.
- Lieutenant.
"I'm, er, you know, I'm, er,"
"I'm really sorry for what happened, sir."
I-I didn't mean any harm.
"Go home while you're still ahead, son."
Good luck to you.
You didn't tell me about Amiri.
What's that got to do with it?
The difference between us is that I don't bug you.
Hide as much as you like.
"No, Dorona, the difference between us is that Ricky is crazy about you, God knows why."
"Amiri, on the other hand, just doesn't love me."
That's why he left.
"And yes, I'd love to be a surrogate mother for you if I could."
"Sure, sure."
"Look who's here, Elijah the Prophet."
Raziya says it's okay.
What?
You could have asked what my size is.
I asked Haziya.
You can come in it's a public place.
- Why did you come?
- To the sauna?
I'm cold.
To Paris.
Was it my brothers' idea?
- Then why?
- Because I love you.
- Those are just words.
"- True,"
- but they're kind words.
- For who?
- You're so beautiful.
"- Yeah, sure."
You're naked!
So what?
This is Europe.
Everyone goes in the sauna naked.
Oh.
I'm sorry.
"- No, no, no."
That's all right.
Do we have an appointment?
"Actually, I wanted to make one."
It's about next semester.
"Uh, oh..."
Could you come back tomorrow?
After class?
My head is swimming.
It's hot.
Put your head between your legs.
Pretty girl.
Very pretty.
With all that make-up?
"You don't wear any, do you?"
"I'd still look like me, only in color."
You're too smart for that.
"You're a confident, no-nonsense woman."
- I sound like an airline.
"- I'm sorry, I'm probably saying it wrong."
"It's just that you don't need any of that, Rose."
Thanks.
How's your head?
- I think food will help you.
"- Pizza, maybe?"
Where can we go?
Dancing?
Why did I say that?
There's that great dessert place.
All delicious things are fattening.
It was a brand-new cigar.
You stay here.
"If you notice something odd, whistle."
Whistle?
Don't you get it?
I gotta get out of here!
- Shut up!
- I gotta get out!
- Who is that?
That isn't one of our cars!
- Another car!
Someone ratted us out!
- Seems to be the police.
- Police?
"Get out, rat!"
He's not gonna rat us out again.
- He has learned his lesson.
- I told you he's gonna cause trouble!
"What was that, Karl?"
"A big bump, even for such a bad road."
I can't see anything.
- Who is there?
- Just open up!
Took longer than usual.
Where is Franz?
- What is she doing here?
- She even wanted to call the cops.
You caused us a lot of trouble with your man Biberkopf.
- What happened to Franz?
- They snatched him.
Who?
That can't be true!
Don't hurt my daughter!
Let her go!
Deepa!
"Had you given the money, you would've saved a life."
"Trying to be a hero, are you?"
Go to hell!
"You moron, I'll kill you!"
If you even think of going to the police...
You will be inviting trouble for yourself.
Deepa.
Varun...
Varun...
Stop.
What happened?
Where were you?
What happened?
Every last piece of gold jewellery bought for the wedding is missing!
I called you N number of times.
Aunt told that you left the house this morning with a bag.
All the jewels are missing.
And you turn up like this now!
What happened?
Mom...
Deepa...
- Her again?
Why bring her up again?
What happened?
Deepa's dad met me yesterday.
He said Deepa was kidnapped and asked for my help.
So...
"So, I took the jewels to save her."
But everything went wrong.
No trouble.
- It's all good.
- All right.
Are you sure?
- Is there something I should know?
"- No, no."
Everything's good.
It's just a status check.
"Don't dawdle, stay in touch."
Kirk out.
He's fine.
So is Myka.
Okay?
Put it down on red 15.
- I got nothing.
- Nothing's going on down here either.
They're still winning and I'll be damned if I know how.
I know.
I am.
I just think that's...
- What if you put those two together...
- I don't think that's gonna work.
- What about what we tried in...
- What is that?
It's just something I whipped up.
- What do you mean?
Just now?
- That's right.
"Wait, wait."
- What are you doing?
- I'm opening a line of communications.
CIA uses laser mics to read vibrations off windows to hear what's going on on the other side of the window.
- You haven't invited alfred?
- I'm afraid so.
Do you think it'II be a disaster?
Why do you laugh?
This will be judgement day for George.
She should pay for her sins like any other fallen woman.
She can't avoid everything by being a man.
That's not alfred at all.
This gets better and better.
- Who is it?
- FeIicien MaIIefiIIe.
- He's the children's tutor.
- He can discipline those two savages!
"I wonder where I shall put him, though."
"In George's room, of course."
That's what he's accustomed to.
No!
He is a handsome brute!
How does she merit all these men?
(Marie) He looks angry.
I don't think he appreciated being left behind at Nohant.
- George!
- George!
I'II give you a horse to ride back to the inn.
- There's something I must confess.
- Drat!
We've been seen!
Shit!
(MaIIefiiIIe) George!
"Not that one, monsieur!"
He's a devil!
By God!
"Goodbye, gone."
When do I start?
Let's go.
"- Listen, this isn't a great time for me right now."
- Oh.
"- I'm sorry, I apologize."
"- Oh, Iâm sorry, just give me ten minutes, though."
"Just give me ten minutes and then you won't have to see me again 'til tomorrow, at work."
Horace.
- You want an interview now?
"- Yes, please."
"I mean, that's what you said and I'm in a hurry."
I have popsicles in the car.
Popsicles melt.
And then it's juice.
"Who likes juice, Horace?"
Please?
"- Sure, have a seat, would you?"
- Thank you.
- Okay.
"Now, I know this job starts tomorrow, but Iâm gonna need next weekend off because Iâm gonna go to Chicago."
They're having a bit of a--
"Like, a little party thing that I want to go to."
And I like going to parties.
- In Chicago?
"- Yeah, in Chicago."
"The land of pizza, yes."
This is a nice place.
Do you have any termites?
Everything's wood.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
General Zavros has a point.
"Let's go, professor."
The Treasure of Atlantis awaits.
Lord Cleeve is right.
We cannot afford to have you follow us.
"Oh, MacGyver!"
"Kelly, try to get this rope over your head."
Come on.
Ohhh!
Come on.
Oh!
You okay?
I can't believe Atticus would do that.
Oh.
"His passion, Cleeve's greed."
It makes sense.
I'm sorry.
I know you looked up to him.
Used to.
We did exactly what Cleeve wanted us to.
"Now he and Zavros are going to steal the Treasure of Atlantis, thanks to us."
Maybe not.
Cleeve's estate.
Let's find it.
Kind of looks like they're planning a trip.
We can't let them take off with the artifacts.
I know.
Wait here.
Just look at it.
Unlike anything the world has seen in thousands of years.
It is truly magnificent.
Probably the finest item I'll ever acquire.
"Union or no union, if you,re not ready, you,II pay!"
"- We,II see about that."
"- Yes, we will!"
"We,re not afraid of the minister."
"I,ve got a few things to tell him."
If you bother the minister with your problems -
This is the control room.
"hello, Schneider."
Did you drop something?
"This is Dr. GoIdberg, eminent psycho-futuroIogist, and his assistant, Mr. -"
Very interesting.
What happens here?
"That,s what we,re here to show you."
follow me.
This is our team.
"It,s an honor."
What is it?
"You're a Brahmin who's here to cook for Jai, right?"
But Jai is a non-vegetarian!
How will a Brahmin cook that?
That's between Jai and me.
Why must you interfere?
Okay.
I have something else to say.
What is it?
That's between Jai and me!
"I'll tell Jai, of course!"
"Atleast you tell me, Ratna."
"I will speak to Jai, too."
Okay.
Sit here and wait for Jai.
I'm off for a bath.
Higaki!
Careful not to get hurt.
The match will start in a short while.
We are currently preparing the court lightings.

- Love
You still don't know how I play?
Stand up!
Is he trying to break his leg?
Ku'so.
Echizen.
Echizen!
Fight!
Oi!
You guys are noisy.
You alright?
Show some respect!
Oi!
Shut up!
Let's go.
What is it?
Don't be too bothered about what the doctor said.
Don't force yourself to talk.
"Those words will come naturally, okay."
Our dead parents will want that.
If it's about money you don't have to worry.
Ku'so!
There are many better players in the country.
Try playing with them.
Experience it yourself.
You'll... be the pillar of Seigaku.
Someone has entered valid launch codes.
Captain on deck!
What the hell is going on?
All 24 of our nuclear missiles went live.
This can't be right.
"Sir, we have nuclear missiles spinning up on the Albuquerque."
"If our allies see us launching a full scale nuclear strike, they will respond."
Russia and China will launch.
We'll have World War Ill..
unless you level the White House.
Four minutes to target!
I need a final gonna go for payload delivery.
God forgive me.
Go.
Go!
"Raptor Alpha 1, Operation Free Castle.."
..is a go.
Copy that.
Dropping to attack altitude.
"Cale, Walker's trying to launch a nuclear attack."
"If he does, it'll start World War III."
Youhaveto stophim .
What?
Cale?
Cale?
Head to the South Lawn!
Almost there.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on!
I'm gonna enjoy this.
Bandar Abbas.
Father?
I don't understand.
you're...
You're his son?
"If my son were alive, he'd be 34 years old."

There's another one of those things out there.
Look what it did to Zaddik.
I say we go after it now!
No one's going anywhere.
We'll handle this.
Stay calm.
How is he?
"I've given him something for the pain, but his injuries are too severe."
He's not going to make it.
This can't be happening.
It's not possible.
I'm sorry.
Don't blame Ellia.
It was my idea.
"You... have to understand... that when I found her,"
I'd just lost my own wife and son to a fever.
"She was just lying there, helpless."
"When I saw her, I knew what I had to do."
"As I told you, in the beginning, she survived on food and water like any young girl."
xxx
No.
No!
It's all right.
Take what you need.
I can't.
"Yes, you can."
"Oh, thank you, dear."
"Yes, I'll be right over."
Of course.
Goodbye.
What did you find out?
Cause of death?
Drowning.
Her lungs contained water.
But it's hard to tell.
"Cardiac risk occurred about the same time,"
Caused by electrocution.
Signs of struggle?
None.
"She was burned somewhat, but that's"
Consistent with electrocution.
Was it an accident?
"Well, I don't know yet."
"Just, uh, let me know if you find anything, Doc."
Anything at all.
"Well, there was something else."
Maybe not much.
There were a couple of hair in her hand.
Looked like animal hair.
Get those to the lab.
"And, Cliff, I want that report fast."
I'll do my best.
Thanks.
"Come on, Greta."
[Door creaks]
[Ominous voices echoing]
[Pet squeaking]
[Owl hooting]
"Oh,for crying out loud, I'm not gonna shoot you here."
"Besides,I need you."
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S GOING TO TELL ME WHERE DOUG IS.
"OH,HERE."
YOUR CAR IS IN THE CAMPGROUND PARKING LOT.
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO TO RESOLVE OUR PROBLEM?
"WELL,I THINK OUR PROBLEMS ARE A LITTLE DIFFERENT,"
"BUT,YES, LET'S RESOLVE THEM."
"YOU KNOW,YOU AND I HAVE A VERY SPECIAL CONNECTION."
I'M NOT EVEN SURE WHO I'M TALKING TO.
"OH,WE MET, IN A MANNER OF SPEAKING --"
ISTANBUL ABOUT SIX YEARS AGO.
"JULY,SEVEN YEARS AGO --"
YOU TOOK OUT THOSE TWO DIPLOMATS.
YES.
YOU KNOW HOW CLOSE YOU CAME TO CATCHING ME?
"NOW,THAT WAS IMPRESSIVE."
"AND EVER SINCE THEN, I'VE KEPT TABS ON YOU."
YOU MIGHT SAY I'VE BECOME A FAN.
I HEARD YOU GOT BURNED AND GOT THIS GIG IN MIAMI.
SO THE STARS JUST KIND OF LINED UP.
I LIKE THE NEW LOOK.
"AND YOUR BRUISE,IT HEALED."
"YEAH,WELL, THAT WAS TEMPORARY."
I'VE BEEN STUDYING UP ON YOU.
IT'S NOT EASY WITH SOMEONE AS SECRETIVE AS YOU ARE.
"BUT,OF COURSE,THINGS GOT A LOT EASIER WHEN YOU GOT BURNED."
YOU'RE NOT CLASSIFIED MATERIAL ANYMORE.
LUCKY YOU.
'CAUSE I LEARNED SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR EARLY YEARS.
"YOUR DADDY WAS MEAN,HMM?"
SO I FIGURED AN ABUSIVE HUSBAND
YOUR OFFICES JUST KEEP GETTING BETTER AND BETTER.
"IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU, MICHAEL."
WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN UP TO?
"A LITTLE OF THIS, A LITTLE OF THAT."
HAVEN'T YOU BEEN GETTING YOUR REPORTS FROM YOUR FBI BUDDIES?
I DIDN'T TELL THEM
ANYTHING THEY COULDN'T FIND OUT FOR THEMSELVES.
"IF YOU TELL THEM,"
"THEY DON'T HAVE TO FIND OUT FOR THEMSELVES, DO THEY?"
"UH, I..."
YOU WERE THE ONE THAT TRAINED ME
IN THE DELICATE ART OF GIVING PEOPLE USELESS INFORMATION.
"I SAID NICE THINGS, FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH."
THANK YOU.
YOU HAVE A JOB FOR ME?
"A WOMAN I MET, EVELYN."
SHE HEARD I WORK SECURITY.
SHE ASKED ME FOR HELP.
I GUESS HER EX RAN OFF WITH THEIR SON.
"WE RAN CHECKS, CREDIT CARDS, AIRLINES, GOT NOTHING."
SOMEBODY'S GONNA HAVE TO DO SOME LEGWORK.
BUT A JOB THAT SMALL -- NOT REALLY OUR THING.
YOU THOUGHT OF ME?
I WOULD CONSIDER IT A FAVOR IF YOU TOOK THE JOB.
AND THE MONEY'S NOT BAD.
MONEY'S NOT THE PRESSING ISSUE.
WHY?
WHAT DO YOU NEED?
IDENTITY.
NOT FOR TRAVELING?
"MICHAEL, IF YOU LEAVE MIAMI,"
I CAN'T HELP YOU WITH THAT KIND OF THING.
All right.
He's the one I'll go after.
Wait a minute.
It's cold outside.
You'll freeze.
Here.
I'll lend you my fur.
Hasn't she prettied up the place?
"Wait till you see how gentle she is, and good as gold."
You have everything you need at the bar.
Enough about the bar!
Here she comes!
Hide and don't make a sound!
"Stop right there, Mieze."
You have to swear first.
Swear you won't look behind the curtains.
"""I swear..."" Come on!"
I swear.
"""I swear I won't look behind the curtains."""
- Fine.
- Good girl.
"You got me another present, didn't you?"
Don't buy me any more presents!
"Why not, sweetie?"
We have everything we need.
I have my dress.
You have your things.
Why do we need more things?
Because they're nice to have.
What is it?
Franzie...
I have something to say.
I just want to see what's going on with him.
You catch a vibe?
I've seen him at two different fire scenes.
"Chief, if we got a firebug here, you know it's next to impossible to prove anything."
Can you just spend some time with him?
See what we find out.
"Yo, Ernie."
Don't let Mills here make you do all the work.
He's what we call a candidate.
You know how there's all those rungs on the ladder?
He's the bottom one.
- Oh.
"- Come on, I'll give you a tour."
"Hey, heads up."
"Hey, what are you doing here on Thanksgiving?"
Reinforcements.
"[Alarm beeps, buzzes] Truck 81, ambulance 61."
Multiple gunshot wounds.
1542 Elmwood Park.
"Hey, would you put the turkey in?"
- Sure.
- Thank you.
This meal is very important.
"- Kid, you should stay--"
- Forget that.
Come on.
- Chief.
"- Yeah, I got him."
"Ernie, stand here."
"Let's go, let's go!"
[Engine starts]
[Engine starts]
"I'm not prying or anything, but as the manager, I should..."
What's with the rubber bands?
"An inmate in a Tokyo prison put 11 rubber bands around his neck and managed to commit suicide,"
so I wondered if that's possible.
Turns out it kinda works.
"Oh yeah, you could die."
You okay?
Yeah.
This is intense.
"We're done filming, thank you."
- Thank you.
- Thanks.
"Kim, they're done on floor 2, so grab some guys and clean up."
Miyu.
What?
"Porn wasn't... your first time, was it?"
First what?
First time having sex.
"No, of course not."
Someone you liked?
Yeah.
Glad to hear that.
But he died in the tsunami.
"We're leaving, Azusa."
Okay.
See you.
Maybe I'll come again.
"No, don't come."
"We're staying overnight, right?"
"Yeah, choose any room."
"Any room, really?"
The cheapest is fine.
"I'm his wife, I have to be here!"
-We'll take care of Migs.
-His blood pressure?
"Just stay here, we'll take care of this."
We still can't be sure of the extent of the damage but he's still lucky he didn't get a fracture in the skull.
"-Doc, when is he waking up?"
-There's a lot of possible outcomes.
But I promise...
"Whatever happens to him, I'll still take care of him."
Is there anyone looking for me?
.
No one.
But I already found the man I love in the whole world.
How's Migs?
He hasn't waken up yet.
I'm sure he will wake up.
Aren't you going to visit again?
.
"You know, I'm not supposed to be there."
My son!
My son!
Brother!
Come here.
Come.
How are you feeling?
"Come, one more."
There's Joy.
Who are you?
.
I'm your wife.
I'm Joy.
I don't know her.
"I-I am, however, very sorry that you had to know that Mommy does those things to Daddy."
Heather!
Daddy does those things to Mommy.
Okay.
Yeah.
_
Yeah.
Lark just would not stop crying today.
- Yeah.
"- And 45 minutes later,"
I found out her shoe was on too tight.
How am I supposed to know that?
"I know, it's gonna be so much easier when she can talk."
"Like, we won't feel like we're, like, on a Japanese game show we don't know the rules to."
Hey.
- Is that Sam?
- Yeah.
"Hey, Sam, what's up?"
"Hey, Uncle Greg."
"Move, you're blocking the view."
"Oh, of what?"
"Oh, the security guard stuck against the wall on a Segway?"
"No, we're spying on my boyfriend."
You have a boyfriend?
Irving Rosenblatt... he's the coolest boy in the class.
He's been acting weird.
I'm not even sure if we're boyfriend and girlfriend anymore.
He liked three of Lexie's pictures on Instagram.
"Oh, I hate her."
Unless you're Lexie.
"No, I'm Jenna."
Lexie's a monster.
"I mean, it's neutral."
- Mm-hm.
- Yeah.
So it could be whatever.
"It could be an office, it could be a guest room a gym, a baby's room..."
[LAUGHS]
"Wait, did you mean ""neutral,"" or ""gender-neutral""?"
- I don't know what you're talking about.
"- Oh, really?"
I know we said we'd wait to talk about it.
BEN:
Uh-huh.
- Mm-hm.
But I think that we're almost ready to start talking about it.
[UP-TEMPOED MUSIC PLAYING]
JARRAD:
So that's the last time I do anything pro bono.
[GIGI LAUGHS]
"Well, ladies, I guess I have to get back to the office."
You go back to the office after happy hour?
What's happy about that?
I met you.
I would love to call you sometime.
Do you have a card?
- Of course.
"- Oh, great."
Here is my info.
"- Nice to meet you, Janine."
- Nice to meet you.
"Look forward to hearing from you, Gigi."
"Oh, wait."
So how are we doing this?
"How you doing back there, Sam?"
"Not good, Mike."
We think he was out too long.
"Okay, clear."
Yeah.
"Come on, buddy."
"Come on, buddy!"
Clear.
"Come on, Schmidt!"
"Come on, man!"
Wake up!
Wake up!
Oh!
There we go!
There we go!
"He's back, Mike!"
We got it!
"J-j-Jabbar -- Jabbar, is he --"
Don't you worry about him.
We're wrapping his sorry ass up right now.
Was I -- was I dead?
!
You really want to know?
No.
"No, I'm good."
I'm good.
"But...just a little -- yeah, you were a little dead."
You were dead.
Counterintelligence usually starts as a subtle game of cat and mouse.
"Your adversary pretends not to be watching you, and you pretend not to notice, but the longer it goes on, the more inevitable it becomes that you'll end up in open warfare."
"Afternoon, Mrs. Westen."
Oh.
What?
"We're gonna hitch you up to Bessie, and you're gonna pull her nice."
You gotta be kidding me.
You start there where the road begins.
You finish down there where the road ends.
Holy shoot!
"Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
How long is this gonna take?
"Well, fella does it right, should take him about five days."
Five days?
But I should be in California schmoozing Dinoco right now!
"Then if I were you, I'd quit yapping' and start workin'!"
"- Hook him up, Mater."
- Okay-dokey.
Freedom!
Maybe I should've hooked him up to Bessie and then...
then took the boot off.
Whoo-hoo!
"Goodbye, Radiator Springs, and goodbye, Bessie!"
"California, here I come!"
Yeah!
"Oh, feel that wind."
Yes!
No.
"No, no, no."
"No, no, no, no, no."
Outta gas?
How can I be outta gas?
"Boy, we ain't as dumb as you think we are."
"But how did, how did... you...?"
We siphoned your gas while you were passed out.
- Ka-chow.
"Hello, this is Kim Na Na."
What... me?
I'm qualified?
"Yes, thank you!"
"First of all, welcome to Cheong Wa Dae (Blue House)."
But...
"Don't assume that by coming into Cheong Wa Dae, (Note:"
Cheong Wa Dae
- Blue House) you can afford to slack off and relax.
You must give 100 percent and do your best.
Who are you?
How can a security officer be late on his first day of work?
Why are you dressed up like that?
I'm not a bodyguard.
"Then, who are you?"
They told me to come here.
Dr. Lee!
You're here.
This shameless person has a doctorate?
The National group of communication network is not here.
You have to go to the next building.
"Oh, it's the guy with a doctorate from MIT!"
MIT?
You are... 10 000 Won?
I'm right?
"So, you are a Blue House security guard."
No wonder you're so strong!
Do you know each other?
- Yes.
- No.
He has come a long way... he got his phd from MIT.
He has achieved a lot and he is only 28 years old!
- All right.
Come here.
All right.
"I'll allow this but if you start making strain noises,"
- we're breaking up.
- We should go.
- I'm sure she's fine.
- She should just move on.
She falls all the time.
What do I care?
What we need to be concerned about is getting that diamond back.
We need someone to kiss Trent.
- Can you do it?
For Candace?
- Oh no...
I'm not into that kind of thing.
"- Yep, that's Trent"
- I'll do it.
I don't like seeing you all torn up like this.
You know what?
You know what we could do to cheer you up?
Let's do that thing where we pretend to be an old couple that's been married for 50 years.
Come on.
"I'm coming for you, stud-muffin."
Hot wheels.
Almost there.
Sweetie...
This usually gets me going.
My heart's just not in it.
Guys.
The fight with Danny is killing him.
I know.
He's in a hospital in Miami.
"He had a stroke, but recovered okay."
Your bodyguard is dead.
I asked about Fredo.
I think he got out.
He must be somewhere in New York.
All right.
I want you to get in touch with him.
I know he's scared.
Tell him everything is all right.
Tell him I know Roth misled him.
That he didn't know they would try to kill me.
-They can come in now.
-There was something else.
What?
What?
Come on.
Kay had a miscarriage.
-Was it a boy?
-At three and a half months...
Can't you give me a straight answer?
Was it a boy?
I really don't know.
"Poor little Fredo, he's got pneumonia."
"Young man, I hear you and your friends are stealing goods."
But you don't even send a dress to my house.
No respect!
You know I've got three daughters.
This is my neighborhood.
You and your friends should show me some respect.
You should let me wet my beak a little.
I hear you and your friends cleared $600 each.
- Goodbye.
- Hi!
What faces!
- We were worried.
Knowing you were around here alone...
The town's dangerous.
- It's not Iike milan.
- Not at all.
- Where were you?
- Around.
- Here?
- I was looking for a perfume shop.
"There aren't any here, there's a town store."
- The NannineIIa.
- It's not a perfume shop.
"- If you ask, what'II she say?"
"- ""No, not on yourIife."""
"What can you expect, we're in the South, right?"
"In CasteIIabate, right?"
"And I'm an idiot, right?"
"Darling, wearthis, they might shoot you."
Think she knows?
Get out of my sight.
I tried to tell you the truth so many times!
"- The alcohol, friends, mandolin?"
- What?
"It's true, cholera, threats, ""I sacrifice formy family."""
- I said what you wanted to hear.
- I don't get you.
"We've created a strange magic, it's been better since we separated."
"So, we'II continue being separated."
You have to forget about Chicco and me.
- I'll call you back in an hour.
Bye.
They belong together.
They've danced for the Pope.
What kind of music is that?
They brought it with them.
Who would want to listen to that?
The Pope?
How would I know?
"Man Viktor, I wanted a singer."
Ask them if they can sing.
Excuse me.
Do you have a song prepared?
"Singing, songs!"
What's this pop shit?
What's this one's name here?
-That's Angie.
"Angie, Bring me a soda."
That's going to take a little while...
"First, I have to finish up the glasses, boss."
We could forget about the girls and just do your uncle's quiz show.
Why can't she just bring me a soda when I order a soda.
She likes to do one thing after another.
"Listen Viktor, let me tell you something."
Even if the quiz show works out...
Which we have no idea about yet...
It will work out.
I want a number here with a singer.
High class!
Alright.
High... class!
I'll take care of it!
"Oh, God!"
Tasik!
- What is it?
"- Maria Vasilyevna, you're wrong!"
- Roll out of here!
- Naturally.
"I have no other choice, but you're wrong."
"Why did you fall, Tasik?"
Now let's be serious.
Please tell Nina that from now on I'll never set my foot in this house!
- We'll survive.
- Naturally.
"But time will tell who's right and, as we know, time is for us!"
"- Step aside, please."
- What?
"- Step aside, please!"
- You're welcome.
Who needs you?
"Well, that's it..."
"Oh, damn it!"
"Shame on you, Maria Vasilyevna, a simple Russian woman."
I think your daughter...
Don't come near me!
I'm standing.
"She won't forgive you that, neither will my daughter."
- Look...
- Don't touch me!
Ciao-miaow!
Let me through!
Hello?
"No, I didn't chase anyone."
Just turned my son-in-law out.
Sex with a minor was all they could get him on.
Why was that?
She wouldn't cooperate.
Said he was a genius and apparently that's what geniuses do.
I wouldn't know what geniuses do.
I'm just a dumb arse cop.
I know nothing about art.
"Sleep well, Mr Greene."
(Door opens)
(Door closes)
I hear you had a big win.
"Oh, for God's sake, Barney."
Alright!
He was a man that I met at the Adelaide conference.
He's English.
And he is now safely back in Devon with his wife and he will never ever come back here.
What's his name?
Does it matter now?
You don't know him and I'm never gonna see him again.
OK!
OK.
John.
Bartrop.
John Bartrop.
There.
You happy now?
Bleeding saints.
Recognise this?
Guido Reni.
In six months the streets would have made him ugly.
He would have died in a crack haze down some lane.
"I gave him that, his moment of absolute perfection."
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.
"Ready, set, go!"
"Hi, Harvard."
Going to invite me to the big game?
If it isn't my childhood sweetheart.
How are you?
Take a look.
Draw your own conclusions.
You've certainly improved with age.
Things must've been dull for you these past months.
You're right.
"Come on, let's take a walk."
What would your father say?
"Look, Betty, I don't care about that."
- Come on.
- Outings leave me cold.
"Let's grab some sandwiches, I've got a pint and go down to Crystal Pond."
"Hey, you can think for yourself once in a while, can't you?"
Okay.
"Hey, let's go get a hot dog or something."
- Okay.
- Good.
- Let's go swimming or something.
- Okay.
Okay?
- See that.
- What?
"Allison and Norman on their way to Crystal Pond to swim, all by themselves."
So what?
"They're young, happy, maybe in love."
What trouble can they get into?
!
"The same woman, twice, and she died both times, the same woman!"
"Doctor, what are you talking about?"
"Something's going on, something impossible, something..."
"Right, you two stay here, stay right here, don't move an inch."
Are you coming back?
Shouldn't think so!
But where are you going?
"To find her, to find Clara."
Ha-ha-ha!
But Clara's dead.
"What's he talking about, finding her?"
"I don't know, but perhaps the universe makes bargains after all."
Where are you going?
Short cut.
Through there?
I hate this place!
Don't you think it's creepy?
"No, I don't believe in ghosts."
Clara!
Oswin!
Oswald!
Watch me run!
Ha-ha!
Miss me?
Who the hell are you?
I'm the Doctor.
I'm an alien from outer space.
"I'm 1,000 years old."
I've got two hearts.
And I can't fly a plane.
"You're running away with a space man in a box, anything could happen to you."
- No.
- Huh?
Are you goin' sick?
- No!
"What do you say we ""popeye"" down to the Chez and have a couple of drinks?"
- I'm beat.
I'm gonna go home.
- All right.
One drink.
- Drink this.
- Whip it out. [Laughs]

[Gasps]
Daddy?
I consider myself a reasonable merman.
"I set certain rules, and I expect those rules to be obeyed."
"But, Dad, I..."
Is it true you rescued a human from drowning?
I had to...
Contact between the human world and the mer world is strictly forbidden.
"Ariel, you know that!"
Everyone knows that.
- He would have died.
- One less human to worry about.
- You don't even know him.
- Know him?
I don't have to know him!
They're all the same.
"Spineless, savage, harpooning fish-eaters incapable of any feeling..."
"Daddy, I love him!"
[gasps]
No!
Have you lost your senses completely?
He's a human.
You're a mermaid.
I don't care.
"So help me, Ariel, I am going to get through to you."
"And if this is the only way, so be it!"
Daddy!
No!
No!
Please!
"Daddy, stop!"
"I said, it's not mine."
You know anything about a Japanese man living in the village?
You're dripping water all over the place.
Answer me.
Do you know him or not?
Did you meet him?
Answer me.
You're scaring her.
Get out for a sec.
"Come on, this is serious."
It's you and me.
Daddy is a policeman.
I'll know if you lie.
Did you meet this man?
Tell me.
Tell you what?
Everything.
"Where you met, what you did."
Why should I tell you?
Because it's important.
What's so important?
"Answer me, girl!"
"I said, what's so important?"
What's so damn important?
What the hell... is so damned important?
You don't even know what's important.
"Stop grilling me, goddamn it!"
Fuck!
What are you doing?
I thought you were sleeping.
What the hell?
Yanking up your daughter's skirt in the middle of the night?
There are no other customers.
Why do they keep adding up bills and cooking noodles?
Why would a small shop like this hire so many workers?
"White Tiger, there are 17 criminal cases against you."
"Even if you're in GuangZhou, we still have to arrest you."
"Bounty hunters from both sides of the rivers, ZheJiang, SanXi, GanSu and Hubei, all join forces to capture us."
You want us to turn ourselves in without a fight?
Come and get me.
Watch out!
Think you can get us?
Fat chance!
Husband!
Husband... run.
Boss Wong!
Boss Wong!
- What?
- I'm here to collect the laundry money.
Come and get it.
I just sent him away.
He's such a coward.
Lucky I've not been bitten by that dog with rabies!
Big Mouth.
- Big Mouth.
"- Yes, Boss?"
What can I do for you?
Get Ah Seng to dress me.
Big Mouth.
Still memorizing your script?
Where were you last night?
What's with the make-up?
Hurry up!
Don't take advantage of my good nature!
No cameras.
It's the perfect spot.
"See if you can track down Lily-Anne Lau, his daughter and heir. (WHISTLES)"
"Harry, wait."
I need more.
I just crossed a pretty scary line for you.
You owe me a proper explanation.
I owed Freddie Lau money.
Gambling debts from his casino.
But this has got nothing to do with me.
"I don't care how you get your kicks, Harry."
"But if I'm going to have your back,"
I need to know it's coming from the right place.
(BUZZER)
It's Harry.
(BUZZER)
"- Hello, Josie, is he in?"
- Mmm.
Harry's here.
JOSIE:
Napoleonic.
Used by a marshal in the 1806 war against Prussia.
Me and your brother fired them on the heath last night.
Half-brother.
Is this official or unofficial?
You better come in.
70 grand.
I need you to um... look after it for a while.
"Who does it belong to, Harry?"
- It was in transition.
- From you to...
A man who died this morning.
"I was little, but I was so angry."
That doesn't sound like you.
I've got to cram for my lit exam.
PDA in the hallway.
It's adorable.
"Don't you have, like, everything to sign up for?"
First day.
You got a lot to do.
It is my first day.
I don't know where anything is.
- Okay?
"The cafeteria, the office..."
- I'll...
I'll show him around.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.
- He's a pain in the ass.
- I'm standing right here.
Just dump him at the office.
They'll take care of him.
"So, it must be weird starting at a new school in the middle of the year."
Used to it.
We move around a lot.
Living in one place your whole life isn't all that it's cracked up to be.
"So, yesterday, in the hall..."
Yeah.
Right.
I was wondering when you'd bring that up.
- You knew who I was?
- ‭Yeah.
And you chose to screw with me because...?
"It was more fun than ""Hey, I'm Eli."" ""Hey, I'm Emma."""
"You could use your influence, I'm sure."
"And of course, you'd know your secret would be safe with me..."
Servalan.
I'm sure it would.
But I don't submit to blackmail.
There's always a first time.
And it's better than being executed.
"After all, how many people have you killed to conceal your secret?"
You mean now?
Twenty-six... so far.
"You can't afford not to believe me, Avon."
- How the hell did she get off the Liberator?
- I don't know.
"Look, we both saw her."
It was Servalan.
You're just running away from the truth.
"All right, I believe you."
I didn't want her to die like that anyway.
I need... to kill her myself.
- Yablonski.
- Ho.
Hutchinson.
"Hey, Hutch, this is your lucky day."
They finally forwarded this from your old unit.
- I'd glad I got it before I go home.
- Horner.
"Klinger, Maxie."
Mulcahy.
Maxie?
Maxie.
Maxie.
Whose idea was it to run him off without a wedding?
Shut up!
"Look out, sire!"

"- Hey, Ponch."
Wake up.
- Why?
What are you doing?
Clocking a sparrow?
She's beautiful.
"Tall, tan, legs up to here."
You better keep your eyes on the car in front of you.
She wears these short shorts and little flip-flops.
And she's even got sexy feet.
Feet?
- How long you known her?
- She just moved into the trailer park.
I haven't met her yet.
Did you see what almost happened to me?
"It was only almost, Ponch."
I'm gonna give that bozo a piece of my mind.
And maybe more.
"What's wrong, officer?"
I was only going 45.
Maybe 50.
Okay.
"It's possible that I was going over a little more, but it's..."
- But...
"- Hey, mister."
"- When you're on the freeway, you..."
"- Hey, Ponch, the traffic, okay?"
"-We have to evolve, Bill."
Progressing ...
"Out of nowhere, took millions years to get here."
"Watch and learn, little brother!"
I will use natural selection.
"No, no, no."
The taste is very aromatic.
"You bit his ass, do not let go his head."
Instead I'll climb on his head.
-It is now!
"Forward-up, my friend."
"New delights, await us."
"Penguin, are you?"
Penguin.
Bravely go where was never a krill.
"We become legend, Bill."
That something important!
How much longer?
It's close.
"Hey, you idiot!"
Are you the licks kelp!
I guess I was wrong I thought you were ... a cruel machine to kill.
Want to try a penguin?
"Back, Bill."
The animal will pick up!
He's a warrior!
"But soon, he will fall, he is seeing death in the face."
"Good morning, handsome."
I'm sorry.
It was a mistake.
-Boys.
-Father worked.
- It can't be!
- Stinkmeaner?
!
"- Close, nigga!"
"It's the clone of Stinkmeaner, nigga, and I've been waiting here to tell you, you's a bitch-ass, faggot-ass, punk-ass, pussy-ass, bitch-ass nigga!"
You know what?
I'm sick of this shit.
You came back to life again?
"Fine, I'll kill your punk ass one more time!"
"Well, let's go, nigga!"
"Come see what this blind, old man got for your ass!"
Ohh!
Unh!
"Oh, yeah!"
"You wasn't expecting all that was you, nigga?"
!
It's a black nigga samurai!
Ha!
Agh!
Agh!
Yeah!
What's wrong with y'all?
!
Somebody help me!
The police!
Thank God for the police!
"The good news for you is, he's not pressing any charges."
He's not pressing charges?
!
He attacked me!
I want to press charges!
"There were at least 53 recordings of the incident, Mr. Freeman."
"Me, when I go to the movies, it's just for the music."
And I'm in love with the prettiest babe in the world.
"Me, I've never been in love."
I've only been sick.
What's the difference?
Me...
I was locked up in a mental hospital.
"I was yelling in the streets, because my father, see, was put in jail."
- Did they bang him up?
- Five years times two!
- As for my father:
One times even equals seven!
- My name's Léo!
"You're kidding, that's my name too!"
But my father was top dog... a King!
- Mine was only a Prince!
- Mine was old school:
"Poet, Jew, writer!"
Me not...
"Hi, my name is Mickey!"
Delighted.
My brothers:
"François, how French can you get,"
"- Antoine, even worse..."
- Don't push it too far.
Ferdinand the Baron.
"This guy's just an idiot, can't you see?"
Wanna see her face?
What do you make of her?
She craves warmth.
You'll do it.
"I was there, gawking like the rest."
It's simple.
"This is our home, and this is my grandmother."
How do you do?
-You're all right?
Need a doctor?
"-No, thank you, I feel fine."
All right.
"Then, go home!"
"In a minute, Grandma, as soon as he's had his coffee."
How does it look?
What would Marco say?
Mark would say he should go home as soon as he's had his coffee.
I'm sorry.
-Who's Mark?
-My fella.
He's coming home from Europe tomorrow.
"I mean, today."
"Rosa, why did you do this?"
Why did you bring me here?
What was your first idea on it?
That I thought you were pretty?
It looked as if they were gonna turn you into tomorrow's headlines.
I thought it might be messy for your wife.
It was awfully nice of you.
Shame on you!
It's 4:00 in the morning.
4:00!
I have to attend a meeting at 10:00.
"I'm supposed to be as sharp as a tack, and as clear as a bell."
But you're not worried about what Mrs. Bourne will say.
-Mrs.
Bourne will be very understanding.
It won an Oscar.
Rocky IV has Stallone in it... and he bashes a Russian's face to all smithereens.
"Lifting anvils and shit, and pulling trucks through the snow."
Million Dollar Baby is totally unrealistic.
- Girls can't fight.
They don't have muscles.
- It's true.
"Okay, that is a horribly sexist thing to say."
It's not sexist.
It's just truthful.
Girls can't pull trucks through snow.
- Can you pull trucks through snow?
- I absolutely could.
- You can barely walk in the snow.
- Excuse me.
Time out.
Is the truck parked in neutral?
- Hey!
"- What, dude?"
Empty your pockets.
- Now.
- Okay.
"Hey, let's just all stay calm."
Nice friends.
Maybe... one to two inches of snow?
- One to two inches...
- And a Ford F-150.
Right.
"In park, but no emergency brake."
Maybe I could pull it four feet.
- I'd give him four feet.
- I'd give him five.
"Yes, your son was saying a similar thing."
Stepson!
I didn't realize that you two were close.
We were talking about the collection.
"I was interested, of course."
"100,000 Euros,up..."
Sorry?
I was just saying... no matter.
Georgina!
Have you seen Dawn and Sophie?
I've lost them.
"No, sweetheart, I haven't."
"I'm sorry, you were interested..."
Are you ready to talk?
You can't do this!
Christos...
You're psychotic!
Maybe.
Give me the bloody key!
"First, tell me..."
Tell you what?
Give me the key.
Give me the fucking key!
Christos...
"What is it, what do you want?"
"Ok, for starters, I have Jeffrey Anderton upstairs eyeing out my collection like it's a fucking yard sale."
Anderton!
Is that what this...
"Fucking idiot, it's called evaluation and you're insane!"
Those are my paintings.
Give me the fucking key!
I met John Brandeis.
Undercut me.
Send me broke.
That's what you thought.
Undercut me.
Send me broke.
That's what you thought.
Mate.
"No, no, no, no."
Mate.
"No, no, no, no."
"It was just a spur of the moment, just...stupid piece of insanity."
"It was just a spur of the moment, just...stupid piece of insanity."
OK?
"I mean, where am I going to find Chinese White?"
Huh?
OK?
"I mean, where am I going to find Chinese White?"
Huh?
You're the only guy that customers want to deal with.
You're the only guy that customers want to deal with.
(LAUGHS) I've got nothing to worry about?

"Hey, not a thing."

I can count on your loyalty?
I can count on your loyalty?
Cross my heart and hope to die.
Cross my heart and hope to die.
Cor!
"(LAUGHS) You scared me, man."
Leave now!
Now what?
Why don't you answer your phone?
Answerthe damn phone!
The papers are not interested in warphotos anymore.
I'll see what I can do.
Do something on kids.
Kids always sell.
People want to see hope.
"OK, I'll ask the fixer."
Send me something in two days.
"Why are you so late, my son?"
School ends around this time.
"It's been half an hour, my eyes were glued to the clock."
What's half an hour in Istanbul?
What's this radio station again?
Radio 'Holy Water'.
I am scared.
Istanbul is a dangerous place.
I know...
You called me 26 times today!
I can't wait to see you get out of this filthy place.
"As if ourhometown were cleaner, look!"
Neverdeny yourroots.
I wish I could.
May God forgive us.
You're beyond mercy...
Allah has struck you already.
"Allah be praised, I'm fine."
Sure.

What a magnificent horse.
Must have been a great hunter.
Yes.
Yes.
"I'd invite you to my home for a drink, but I've got a house full of fops."
Guests of my wife's.
I won't let her move to Paris so she's trying to bring Paris here.
"Still, it's her money."
And I love her for it.
(LAUGHS)
"Where are you staying, lad?"
At the inn?
That is either Monsieur Chopin or Monsieur de Musset.
- You haven't invited Alfred?
- I'm afraid so.
Do you think it'll be a disaster?
Why do you laugh?
This will be judgement day for George.
She should pay for her sins like any other fallen woman.
She can't avoid everything by being a man.
That's not Alfred at all.
This gets better and better.
- Who is it?
- Felicien Mallefille.
- He's the children's tutor.
- He can discipline those two savages!
The day you die is just like every other day.
You wake and dress and eat and drink.
Just like every other day.
You don't see death coming.
Or hear its approach.
Because you are too busy living.
(CONSTANCE MOANS)
Too busy enjoying your life.
Sating your appetites.

It doesn't care about any of that.
It cares only that this is your time.
Your day... to die.

(BLOWS AIR)
And this is the Musketeers' day.
(SPITS)
(FERON SNICKERS)
No mistakes this time.
(GRUNTS AND PANTS)
We don't talk to the priest.
Just between us.
Sometimes he says something.
But that's it.
But I'm not the priest.
No.
You're my father.
I come here once a month and you always end up interrogating me.
Sometimes I'd like to slap you face!
No.
Better hit me with your belt!
Like Elena's father.
And who's Elena's father?
"A beast, who else."
"Well, let's calm down."
I'm calm.
I assume I was bad at you.
But you were too.
Me?
Why?
You never give up!
You're mad because I'm going out with Daniel.
If he were 15 you'd be so happy.
15 is a much more similar age for you.
That kid who came to eat with us one day was 15.
He seemed nice.
Normal.
Do you think we talk in the same way with an adult?
Then when there's someone older you guys lie?
And you lie to me?
Tell me.
You lie to me.
"No, they'll think I liked you."
"Thank you, sir."
Bloody silly place to die.
Captain Murray's dead.
Bury him.
"And what then, him?"
"We're lost, aren't we?"
So we'll be heading south towards Lisbon and home.
My orders are we continue north.
What for?
What are we doing up here anyhow?
"Did you ask Major Dunnett or Captain Murray to explain their orders, Harper?"
No.
"But with all due respect, Captain Murray and Major Dunnett were proper officers."
"Now they're dead, there's no shame in going home."
We go north at dawn to Casa Antigua.
"Carry on, Harper."
We've been having a chat.
We?
Me and the lads.
And?
We're not continuing north.
We want to go south.
MEN Aye
- What the hell do I care what you want?
Eh?
who the hell do you think you are Harper?
Do you think the British army is a bloody d-d...?
"Democracy, sir."
Comes from the Greek word demos.
It means...
"Shut up, Harris!"
"One, two, three, four..."
"Five, six, seven, eight."
"Ahmet, raise your arms."
Ahmet?
"Follow him, son."
"Ahmet, raise your arms..."
"Four, five, six, seven, eight."
And we never forget to smile.
A big round of applause.
Are you taking care of yourself?
Are you eating properly?
"Yeah, yeah."
I don't believe you.
Your voice tells me otherwise.
"Oh, stop!"
You're not my mother.
I am also not your girlfriend anymore.
But I am your agent.
This is about ourclients and a lost photojournalist.
Oursoldier is the greatest...
He's the bravest!
What the fuck is your hurry?
Sweetie you're digging yourself into deepershit.
The cops will find you here.
"What's up, girl?"
Are you bringing yourboys here now?
You disappeared again.
"Why, did we have a fuck date?"
Fuck you.
I won't have to weara uniform anymore.
How did you get out of it?
You look beautiful tonight.
I'm not just saying that.
You really do.
I heard you.
Why don't you have some coffee?
I'll go find Claire.
"Claire, where have you been?"
Alex is looking for you.
"- Oh, brother, it's starting already?"
- Come on.
How could you do this?
I may never forgive you.
I may never forgive you.
That's another story.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Yes.
Yes.
- Yes!
- I'm Professor Gregory Larkin.
I'm calling about the response to my ad.
Is this Professor Morgan?
"No, this is her sister."
Rose doesn't even know I answered the ad.
"Well, then maybe we shouldn't be talking."
No!
"Please, it's just that Rose would never answer an ad herself."
"I mean, some of these guys are such creeps and losers."
"But when it said you taught at Columbia, something just clicked inside."
"- You have seen her picture, right?"
- Yes.
- And?
"- Rightthis way, ladies and gentlemen."
- [Audience Applauding]
"It's foryou, it's forme."

"Ofthe United States, Richard M. Nixon!"

"You throw a hell of a party, Jack."
The party ain'teven started yet.
I've asked these gals outto the ranch for a little private thing.
"We're gonna have some fun, I guarantee ya."
And there's some fellas I'd really like you to meet.
Trini and I gotan early plane.
We're hoping to be back in New York for...
These guys are real interesting.

Whoo-hoo!
[Giggling]
Elsa --
"Elsa, I got to ask you something that I don't want to ask you."
Can we have your car?
Of course.
What -- what happens now?
"Once we bust out of here, that CIA team is gonna be all over you, so just...tell them that we stole your car."
"And just tell them that... that you don't know me anymore, okay?"
Can you -- can you tell them that?
"I'm sorry, Elsa, but it's just not safe."
"I mean, they're gonna be all over us, so --"
"I will try and figure something out, okay?"
I promise you.
"Coast Guard's almost on top of us, Sam."
"Sam, we got to go."
"Fine, Mike."
Just start the car.
"Bye, sweetheart."
Stay beautiful.
"I'm sorry, Sam."
"I don't want to hear it, Mike."
Just drive.
"Mike, the window's closing up there!"
I see it!
I see it!
Just hold on!
It's them!
"Mike, you're not gonna make it!"
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!
They're gone.

"Who's up to it, who's not?"
"Who's up to it, who's not?"
- She's messing with you.
- Ha-ha-ha.
I kept texting her telling her you insisted we bring something.
- Where is Daddy?
"- He'll be here, a few minutes."
"Which reminds me, I should finish dinner, huh?"
"Luke, would you take our bags up to my room?"
"It's the first one on the left, the one with the Hello Kitty poster."
Allison.
We sleep together.
I'm not gonna be a hypocrite.
"No, no, of course not."
I didn't raise you that way.
It's sweet that you care what I think.
Come on.
"So, what do you think?"
- I think he's really nice.
"- I know, right?"
And cute too?
He's adorable.
"Oh, honey, hand me the meat thermometer, would you?"
I have not made a roast chicken in I can't remember how long.
This thing does not look done.

"Oh, at 150 at least, don't you think?"
Mom.
When?
Heh.
Tonight.
Are you freaking kidding me?
Tonight?
I'm not going to help you.
This is hilarious.
She's also dating an astronaut.
Wow.
That's very impressive.
Yeah.
"But Leonard's impressive, too."
Thank you.

Thank you.
Will the two of you excuse me?
I need a hug.
"Sorry, I have company."
"Come on, Sheldon, open the door."
I don't want to hug you.
"I don't want to hug you, either."
I was just feeling blue.
"Blue, as in depressed."
"Well, not so much depressed as lonely."
I don't know what color lonely is.
- What?
- Red is angry;
yellow is frightened;
green is jealous;
and blue is depressed.
Perhaps we can assign a color to lonely.
Nothing rhymes with orange.
It's probably lonely.
All right.
They'll be coming up soon.
"So just slow down a little, Dale."
"I'm pumped, man."
Pumped!
Stupid cops.
- Stupid!
- Couldn't stop a snail on a salt bed.
- You see him yet?
"- No, not yet."
"- When you see him, tell me quick!"
- I will!
- Now...
- Yeah?
"When I give the order, you ram him hard into the guard rail, Dale."
- That'll stop him.
- I'm a road warrior!
"- I know you are, Dale."
- I am.
"Time to stop those yuppie punks, Dale!"
"- Dude, are we gonna be on TV?"
"- You know we are, dude."
- That's hot.
- You know we are.
Did either of you ever actually kill anybody?
Not yet.
I did.
How did it feel?
It didn't feel like I thought it would.
It felt shitty.
It felt wrong.
But what can you do?
"Partner, there's nothing you could do."
"A moment, please."
Get out.
Get out of my life.
Get out of France.
But you have everything you ever wanted.
And more power than you.
I'm your mother.
I am ruling scotland
For you...
Do that.
"And mind me, do it well."

You just happened to have a layover in Seattle?
"Well, I've always wanted to check out the Space Needle."
I understand you can see mount Rainer from the top.
"Oh, really?"
Anything else you want to check out?
You gonna take me or not?
"I got back-to-back surgeries, ma."
You gotta give me a little more notice.
"Yeah, yeah."

I know the drill.

I think you're actually the first kid in history
To ever do that.
"come on, you have to be a little bit excited."

I was screaming!
It was so good!

- Shut up lowlife!
- I am not saying I am not guilty.
- Enough!
- I am guilty because I didn't stop them.
"- Back off, or I swear I'll kill you."
"Catch a disease, nonsense..."
"Alright, we won't be disturbed here"
"Thank you, Loulou"
"Ohlala, I need to pee, I need to pee"
Go
Is it coming yet?
"Oh, that's good"
"Careful with the pants, though"
"Stop talking to me, you're distracting me!"
It's coming alright?
"Yes, it is!"
"Great, byyyeeeee"
"No, Jean!"
"Stop, Jean, stop!"
It's been a long time since we last went to a club!
Huh?
"I was saying, it's been a long time since we last went to a club!"
Yeah yeah
"Brings back memories, hmm?"
Yeah yeah
Which memories does it bring back?
Yeah!
Alright well I'm going to hit on every guy here and sleep with the first one I meet
"Jean, go screw yourself!"
Cool
"But, Loulou, can you hear what I'm saying?"
"Yeah, yeah, you told me to go screw myself and that you were gonna sleep with the first guy you meet"
"Alex, just because the music is loud doesn't mean what you're saying suddenly became interesting, you see?"
It's boring
Do you have a mint?
Want one?
"No, that's for you"
Look.
What's he doing?
- What..
"Everything's lost, Kanji."
Only thing left is this Godrej safe.
Rolex.
It's a Rolex.
- Nah.
Mr. Dinesh. lsn't that a Rolex watch you're wearing?
Must be worth 1.5 -2 lakhs.
It's worth 10.
Mr. Kanji.
I am sure you read the terms and conditions.. ..before reading the policy.
"Not at all, sir."
Your officer asked me to sign at the places marked.. ..and I did so.
How irresponsible you are.
"What happened, sir?"
"Your policy insures you against.. ..accidents like theft, fire, fraud."
Right.
That's what we opted for.
But not against Act of God.
Act of God?
"See, it's written here clearly."
Conditions apply.
My glasses.. - ln the event of loss or damage to the property.. ..the insurance company is not liable to pay.. ..any amount if the damage is caused by act of God.
And here are your signatures.
It's written in such small letters.
And nobody reads that.
What is 'Act of God'?
lncidents that are not caused by humans.
Like?
"- Like earthquake, Tsunami, Thunder."
Hey!
Do something about this bag...
"I packed, but I'm not sure."
"Take a look, hyung-nim."
That's alright.
I will be back real soon.
I will buy the things that I need.
"By the way, what is going on?"
Why suddenly..?
I don't know.
"Get going. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;The phone is turned off, you will be linked to voice mail after the beep."
Her phone is turned off.
Who?
Man Ok.
Stylist Jang.
"Today, she went with Tae Ik for a scheduled radio broadcast."
Radio?
Why does the stylist have to go along for radio?
Today is a live-broadcast radio.
"Last time, Tae Ik went dressed in anything and around fifty thousand malicious comments were posted."
"""A Date in the Middle of the Day""."
"Today's guest is the cool guy from &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Take One&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;, Lee Tae Ik."
We will shortly come to you with live radio.
Commercial!
"Your style is fabulous today, Tae Ik."
Am I okay?
Good.
[In Korean].
Good [In English] 5 seconds before we air.
Stand by.
"The chic guy who has captured the hearts of women,  he is more charming every time you see him,"
The most popular among the popular!
He's TlNY!
"Even the mythical creature he's based on, the Tsuchinoko, is typically described as around 10 to 30 inches long- tops!"
"But in the official games, little Dunsparse is- er-"
WHAT?!
4 foot 11 inches???
But. . .uh
Why you make him so little?
I-I don't understand.
"Joining Dunsparce in the things-that-are-way-longer than-you'd-think club is Dratini, another serpant like Pokémon."
He's the first pokémon in his line so I've always thought of him to be the little guy.
WRONG!
5 foot 11 inches.
Longer than the average height of humanity.
"Also, this was always weird to me."
Dratini:
6ft long.
Dragonaire:
13ft long.
Dragonite:
7ft long.
Where?
Where does it all go???
Let's check out some spherical pokémon.
"I've always pictured guys like Glalie, Fortess and Gastly to be around a foot long or a little bit bigger than a basketball."
NOPE!
These guys are actually all 4 to 5 ft long.
See this guy?
See that giant ball?
That's a 5ft beach ball! and THAT is what your Glalie is gonna look like in real life.
"And yes, It is terrifying!"
"At last, at almost 48 feet long, Wailord is by far the longest pokémon in existence- over 17 ft longer than the second longest, Steelix."
"But weight-wise, Wailord doesn't make ANY sense."
I do not understand.
What are you talking about?
Ayten did not wantto answer the phone?
Certainly something happened to her.
quick Recovery.
"Thank you, sweetie."
"Ah, that life is strange.Look at him..."
You will never understandthe extent to which this manturned the game in my favor!
"What are you talking about, Serra?"
Mahir?!- Father!-Son!
"Get awayfrom the defendant, let's go!"

"That little refreshment,Mr. Nazif..."

Judge?
"No, was brought byMrs.."
Bahar.
"Thank you, soldier."
Since whendidn t she come?
"Since yesterday,mr."
I have the gold. supply the goods to these people.
You all can leave.
"Thanks, shekhar!"
"- Thanks, shekhar!"
"No! shekhar.. till the time I don""t see the gold.. ..l can""t believe you."
You doubt the party.
Forget all this!
We have been exposed.
The police are searching everywhere.
Anything can happen in the future!
Even thieves should be honest! shekhar!
"I don""t tolerate my humiliation!"
"Tiger too can""t tolerate disobedience!"
What do you care?
"I can""t work in this party!"
"I can""t work in this syndicate! settle my account!"
"Account! kaka sir, I have to settle many scores with you! congratulations! syndicate""s message!"
A big deal!
What deal?
"Whose message is this? sheikh.. king of smuggler""s message!"
"What""s the message?"
"Gold worth crores are coming to lndia from Bangkok. very good! chhota sheikh, very good!"
Now you people will have to seize the gold from the ship!
But.. nobody besides Tiger can do this.
"The syndicate is broken, kaka sir! chhota sheikh, where are you going?"
Talk about the deal with me.
- How can l?
"lts syndicate""s rule that the deal.. ..should be discussed only with Tiger."
Goodbye!
"Tell me, sheikh!"
"Tiger singh, kaka sir pleaded a lot with me."
"But I didn""t pay any heed."
Hey!
Do something.
Build a wall.
Do you know my father?
- Yes we know.
"Hey, Salim!"
He is coming this side.
There is an auto coming behind.
Stop the auto.
Take it and go.
Will the meter work?
It will cost 5 rupees more than the meter.
Ok bye.
Good night.
Did she go?
"- Hello Salim, how are you?"
"Hello, Mr. Ranga Rao!"
Are you fine?
Do we look like thieves who steal rings?
No.
Because we sell the rings before you can steal them.
Did you get your Anarkali?
"Yes sir, by your grace?"
So are you daily going to the movies and parks with her?
Even that happened just now with your grace.
When is the marriage?
That too will depend on your grace.
"That is, should the girls father not agree?"
Why should you worry about the girls father?
I advise you to elope with the girl.
That will fix the father and you will enjoy the thrill.
"Sir, do you know what your greatness is?"
Ok.
Ok.
How are you holding up?
Oh.
I'll be fine.
"I'm not here to get my mom back, I'm just here to get her help."
So I hope you guys are hungry.
"'Cause, uh, food has always been my go-to icebreaker."
You have a really beautiful home.
You're so sweet.
Just like your mom.
You knew my mom?
Miranda was my best friend.
So you had a daughter and a best friend and you still left?
My best friend is why I left.
"15 years ago, a vampire came to town."
"Looking for you, Elena."
Looking for the doppelganger.
"No one could manage to kill him, so I lured him out of town and cast a spell to desiccate him."
Mikael.
He was an original vampire.
It took every ounce of power I had.
Almost killed me.
I recovered.
But my magic didn't.
My powers never came back.
And neither did you.
It wasn't that simple.
It wasn't?
"You cast a spell, put Michael down, then..."
What?
You had to teach Jamie how to drive?
"Cemre, you're back in your old neighborhood."
We'll see each other more often now.
- Don't say words that you will regret.
- Go to hell.
"You're nuts, girl."
I'm telling you.
Bye bye!
What are you doing?
It's so not like you.
Why do you even argue with her?
She does this just to annoy you.
And you swallow her bait.
She says Sami Amca insisted.
It's her who is dying to go there.
"Mom, sometimes I want to jump down her throat."
Let me tell you beforehand.
We can't give you February 14.
We're fully booked that day.
"Oh, what is on 14th of February?"
Valentine's Day.
Everyone wants to marry that day.
That's why.
"Okay then, give us any day that is available."
Not the 5th of the month though.
Kuzey's trial will be on that day.
How about 4th?
"No, let's do it after 5th."
So that Kuzey will be with us as well.
Of course.
13th of February is available.
But since 13 is considered unlucky... ... people don't want to marry on that day.
What is unlucky about 13?

Beth Seaton:
Hi.
Welcome to Spotlight.
"I'm Beth Seaton, director of sponsored projects here at Western illinois University."
"We're here at Knoblauch Hall, where we are going to visit Dr. Win Phippen from the School of Agriculture."
"And hopefully, the director of the School of Agriculture, too."
We're going to talk to Win a little bit about a program that has been funded here at Western illinois University.
Beth Seaton:
Hi Win.
Win Phippen:
"Hey, Beth."
How are we doing?
Beth Seaton:
Good.
I wanted to come over and talk to you a little bit about your new project.
Tell me a little bit about your new USDA project.
It's so exciting!
"It's like a half a million dollars, right?"
Win Phippen:
Yes it is.
It's a quite a coup for the University.
Beth Seaton:
It is.
Win Phippen: ...and my research program.
I'm quite excited about it.
It's very unique.
"It's not a hard core, sort of, science research project."
"It's more plant-breeding education, and with a component of science related to it."
And the real neat thing about it is that is has
Just to feel better about yourselves
Ahmed from the Bank
Hello?
Yes Mr.Ahmed
What?
When did this happen?
Okay Mr.Ahmed
I'll pass by
Thanks
What's wrong?
Dad took all his belongings from the bank
What?
"I don't know, let's go where to?"
To see why dad did this
Mr.Sameh
What's wrong?
I wanted to tell you something before you go
Just say it!
I entered the room and saw him in the bathroom
"His bag was open, I don't know why, and I found a lot of contracts and papers and thought I should tell you"
What contracts?
Donating the car and this house after he dies and he's gonna sell our land
Oh god!
And when did he do that?
The dates took place the same period when he was gone
And where are these contracts?
Upstairs in his bag
What have we ever done to deserve this?
Where is he now?
Upstairs
No...we need to put an end to this
Come on lets go
Tonight I am hanging out with Emily. woman:
Okay. man:
But I was planning on telling her exactly how I feel about her.
And then I don't know.
So I was calling my mother to see-- what should I say to this woman?
[woman laughing]
Okay.
I don't know.
"I just think that, you know-- just concentrate on the fact that, you know, you have very, very high feelings of esteem for her, that she's somebody that you've always admired. man:"
"""Esteem""?"
Is that the word I should use?
Esteem?
You think she'd like that? woman:
Yeah.
Whatever. man:
I just don't know if that's-- woman:
You hold her in very high regard. man:
Ok--I don't know if those-- woman:
She's a special person in your life. man:
Okay.
I'll try all that.
Hey.
I am on the train now.
This is my friend Emily.
[romantic music]
"Uh, hello, ""Life In A Day."""
"I'm still with Emily, and we're still hanging out in Chicago."
"Um, this is..."
"We--we just came out of this place, which was cool."
"But, uh, I'm gonna leave this thing on in case anything gets climactic."
man:
"Theresa, look at me."
"They probably make it up just to make people afraid of it,"
'cause they're mean.
I like it because it's so scary.
It's so fascinating about the whole mythology stuff about it.
"There's mystery behind it,"
"'cause you don't know if it's real or not, kinda like Bigfoot."
It's a whole community.
People can talk about it together and whatever.
I think it's a way for people to connect.
"(Finebros) One of the main things people do with this game is they'll film themselves playing it, and then upload their reaction to the Internet."
"So, we're gonna show you a quick montage of people playing ""Slender."""
(man in video) ...just to get me.
"Oh, dude, it's safe."
Safe.
- Aah!
"Oh, my goodness."
"- God, scared me."
(people in video screaming) (laughs)
"- Destiny, please."
"- Tobuscus, yeah."
- Aah!
What the hell?!
No!
- (laughs) I feel you.
- (groaning) - PewDie-- PewDiePie.
- (screams) - (gasps)
I'm happy these people reacted worse than I did.
"(man in video) Oh, God."
Open the (bleep) door!
- (laughs) - What the (bleep)?
What is this?
- (screaming) - His head.
Anybody want some granite?
"My name is Randy Raisides, and this is Kenneth V. Fletcher's house."
Giant I-beam... basket with grapes... pipe bender... a billion boxes.
He's kind of a hoarder.
"I moved here four years ago, a terrible drug addict."
"And in four years, Ken has done two things."
"He has sobered me up, and he has lost everything."
Good morning.
Ken:
Good morning.
Randy:
Kenneth V. Fletcher.
Ken:
Loser.
Enabler.
What else?
Destitute human being.
Randy:
"Tomorrow Ken leaves for the Canary Islands, where he has gotten a job as a massage therapist."
"And I go back to Nebraska, where I'm going to be living with my folks."
He's one of those guys that has a billion ideas and never completes any of them.
Ken wanted a piano as a kid.
Ken couldn't get a piano as a kid.
"So three years ago, we looked on Craigslist all summer and went over to the Twin Cities and got pianos!"
[Ken playing mid-tempo melody]
The man's a genius.
He just never quite had the time.
It looks like the auctioneer's here.
[creaking]
[crash]
man:
What's in my pocket?
"Bonnie, you're about to see your mom for the first time in 15 years."
I'm not letting anyone ruin that moment.
"Yeah, but he's going to keep at it until I pick up."
Fine.
What?
Where are you?
Bonnie and I are going to spend the night at the lake house while we wait for sheriff Forbes to give us some more addresses.
"You're kidding me, right?"
"No, Stefan, I'm not."
We need a night off from your insanity.
Klaus is getting antsy.
He knows I'm stalling him.
We need to move faster.
"Well, we're doing everything we can."
So could you maybe not call every 5 minutes?
"Sure, Elena."
Whatever you say.
How's life on the road?
- Scenic.
- How's life in Mystic Falls without any hybrids?
Boring.
For now.
"If you want any of us back, you just have to say the word."
There's no need.
I've been making friends with the town's civil servants.
"There's a deputy who's awfully chatty, but useful nonetheless."
Are you clear on what you need to do?
I've got it covered.
Can I help you?
Abby Bennett Wilson?
That's me.
Cute house.
Welcome to Tea Time.
(whispering) I have something really important to tell you.
(whispering) So come close.
(whispering) Closer.
(whispering) Closer ... (whispering) Ok!
(whispering) Today.
Is.
My ...
BlRTHDAY!
YAY!
Today is my Birthday!
I am so excited you're here to celebrate with me!
I have a very good idea.
Would you like to do a special birthday dance with me today?
You would?
I would be so excited.
Thank you!
"First, I have to put on my special birthday tiara!"
Great!
"And secondly, I'm going to teach you the birthday dance moves."
"First, we're going to take our hands and we're going to put them on our knees."
And we're all going to bounce like this ...
Bounce ... bounce ... bounce ... bounce
That's good!
"Next, we're going to take our hands and put them right here by our face."
Cheese.
And you're going to wave from side to side like this ...
Good job everybody!
And for our last dance move we're going to turn in a circle.
Can you turn in a circle without getting dizzy and falling down?
I bet you can!
Let's try it.
"Madam Noh, please help me."
Please help me find my daughter quietly.
Do you know who took your daughter?
That...
You should know him as well.
The one who was killed as an insurgent.
The illegitimate son of the Interior Minister!
Hong Gil Dong!
Is he still alive?
You must find her quietly for me.
She is the only daughter of the core of all power!
No one must ever know she is with him.
And everyone that is found with her...
Silence them forever.
Do you understand?
So the one who blocked the police was Hong Gil Dong?
Did the prince know this?
He told us that someone would block the police so that we can attack Choi Chul Joo.
I am sure he knew.
So the reason he gave up the explosives and stopped the ship was... ... because of Hong Gil Dong!
He has interfered with our plans yet again.
- Go and find the Councilor's daughter.
"- Yes, Madam!"
The illegitimate son of the Interior Minister and the only daughter of the Second State Councilor...?
We may have found a better weapon than the explosives.
- Search the area carefully!
"- Yes, Sir."
- Search the empty houses too!
"- Yes, Sir."
Hurry!
Miss Eun Hye!
"For you, I will lay down my life!"
"The thief shouldn""t escape. stay awake."
I saw.. and along with that inflation.
It affects each and everyone.
"Don""t cry."
Because of this..
"Because of this, l never got married."
I never got married. keep a close watch. stay awake.
"The thief shouldn""t escape. stay awake."
"Hey, mister."
Whenever you will become the minister.
"Hey, mister."
Whenever you will become the minister. keep a close watch. stay awake.
You are asleep.
And the enemy is alert.
Wake up. otherwise you will be in trouble.
Hey!
That country will be robbed.
"That country will be robbed, where the guards go to sleep."
Where the guards go to sleep.
The green signal has been given.
Jamal Pasha has the goods.
Leave immediately.
31 1 .
3 North.
7.
"lt""s gold worth 5 crores."
- I will leave immediately.
No!
"The goods won""t be delivered through the port."
Already the police are after us. so what?
The police are in our fist!
"Don""t talk nonsense!"
Someone's coming!
So this is where you've been?
Shall I paint you a portrait?
It's for free.
Can't you take that off?
Wait!
"Okay, I'll paint you like that."
"But next time you'll take it off, right?"
Take it off?
This punk...
He's got a weird taste...
You punk... what are you smirking about?
- Aren't you hot?
-Wouldn't you be?
- I'm roasting in here.
"- If I were you, I'd take it off."
I'm dying of curiosity.
Are you a man by any chance?
There are plenty of guys with long hair.
And lots of guys have pretty legs.
Right... men don't wear bras
"All right, stop it."
You little cutie... don't be so shy.
I know...
Your face is really ugly!
I'm joking.
You're so cute.
This is what I like about my job.
Jin-woo...
"If you don't show up, we're through."
We apologizes to customers that the fire alarm has begun.
Please evacuate to the...
Front side of the building Don't move
I'm five seconds away 4 seconds 3... 2...
What are you doing here?
Huh?
Are you okay?
I thought you were going to propose!
I thought you wanted a nice dinner in a fancy restaurant.
And we never play games with fires.
How could you not know that?
What?
"Hey, Lee Jin-woo..."
The movie's starting.
Shhhh.
"Hwi-chan, look at me."
Did you do your homework?
Then you better go home right away and do it.
Don't play on the computer.
"Do the homework first, okay?"
I have to stay here for a few days.
"You'll be fine on your own, right?"
You won't?
When have I ever not been alone?
"Yes, my Hwi-chan can do great on his own."
Your mom will do well too.
And I'll try to do better once I get out of here.
But you need to promise me one thing.
Show me your diary every day.
After school I went to the hospital to see Mom.
"Mom is hurt, so she has to stay there a few days."
Tomorrow I'll go to the hospital and show Mom my diary as I promised.
It's nice...
"Now Mom doesn't work late, she doesn't drink, and I can see her whenever I want."
"Well, let me say first of all thank you for haveing my mama at the White House [oh, yeah] for the Easter, that was a beautiful event and she was so [applause] and she was so thrilled to be there."
It was great having her [applause] she's terrific

It was my mother's dying wish.. ..to take the entire 'Bhajan Mandli' group along with their family.. ..on a trip to Badrinath.
Please do come.
Of course.
Please join us on the trip.. ..and pray for my mother's soul.
My mother.
Why do souls become restless after they die?
"I mean, once you're dead it's the end of all problems."
Why become restless?
That's not it.
Suppose the deceased has a unfulfilled wish.
Then his son will fulfil it.
You won't go on the trip.
Get that.
Her mother was in the hospital for two years.
And he didn't even come take a look.
He was making dollars in America.
This charade is for the world.
Not for his mother's soul.

Ohhh...

"ThorZaiN moving forward, eating another Psionic Storm in the hands of a High Templar."
Another High Templar!
"Doing a nice Psi Storm, but ThorZaiN is trying to dance out of that."
He has a lot of Ghosts and EMP here.
"Dropping two EMP's, checking out that Dark Templar actually."
"But MC is coming back with a scary force, that is going to sandwich.."
-	Cloak!
-	And look at this!
"The Ghost goes trying to drop EMP, and they do on the majority of the units."
"This is about as good as it can get for ThorZaiN, doing some drop ship micro actually."
Taking..
Oh My God!
-	Ohhhhhh....
I think we should just have a moment of silence and hold hands at what we just saw here.
What is going on!?
"- Alright, we have Medivacs loading."
- Oh my God.
"Watch this, he is going to drop all over the mech army, this is going to be so sick cool!"
"Oh, I am so excited."
SlayerS BoxeR!
You are the funniest player ever!
- He is moving out.
"He unsieges, he may siege up again, but when he sees that many Vikings, he is going to have to land the Vikings!"
- He is..
Here comes the Medivacs!
- Oh my God!
"- Dropping all over those Siege Tanks, just crushing trough!"
"SlayerS BoxeR has out strategized GanZi, completely!"
-	Marines really want to catch the Corruptors.
I am happy that I could fulfil my promise.
I won't survive for long.
I might not live until your release from prison.

From Ram Prasad Saxena.
You are my Moon.
You are my Sun... you are the apple of my eye

"And some day, I will be envied for having mothered you"
You are my Moon.
You are my Sun
It's ready.
Take it.
"What are you looking at, son?"
- Nothing.
I think that... you should come along with me.
I?
What will I do there?
This the happiest day of my life.
Won't you come along on this day?
Your mother and Renu will be accompanying you.
You will have to accompany me.
- I told you that I'm not coming.
All right.
If you don't come along I won't go either.
You shouldn't fuss.
I'm ready.
Let's go.
"- Renu, she is accompanying us."
It is your responsibility to get her ready.
I'm waiting in the hall below.
"Don't go this way, go that way."
"Down, down, down, drive on the road."
"Faster! - "" Go...go...go...Govinda. """
That was a narrow escape.
"Now, take me to Brahmanwadi."
"Go straight then take a left, then right and another left."
"And you'll be home, go on."
"You brought me this far, so drop me home as well."
My job's to show the way.. ..it's your job to get to the destination.
Fine.
Keep it.
Thank you so much.
You're so kind.
- Thank you.
"Take care. "" Go...go...go...Govinda. """
Papa!
- Sushila.
ls everything fine?
"Go up and take a look in the house, you'll know."
"Thankfully we survived, otherwise.."
"No, I'll talk to the police."
Don't worry.
They hurled stones and acid bottles in our house.
I don't care lf I die.
But the children.
lf Jigna would've been hit by that acid..
I won't let anything happen to them.
I am their father.
Please.
"So, understand the duties of a father."
Withdraw the case.
- You're a fool.
Don't plan the plan if you can't follow through.
All that matters is taking matters into your own hands.
Soon I'll control everything.
Hey!
Hey!
My wish is your command!
Stand back everyone!
Nothing here to see!
The rest are for you Okay?
Damn you!
Landal， what are you doing?
He said...
No， he taught me to play the piano， but I failed
I'll take my leave
Lisa， he...
I forgot to say goodbye to you
Thank you.
Come and drink soup some other day
Outrageous!
I'll win her over for sure
Landal， what are you doing the whole night?
Go and see a doctor tomorrow
What're you doing?
I told you to my underpants but you're watching the landscape
Appear before me when I count up to three 1， 2， 3
Sister wants you to go down to have dinner
Your potbelly is protruding
Let me take you somewhere to reduce weight
I'm hefty
What's wrong?
"Sister, you've been beaten out of shape."
Go now
Move. . . move!
Can't you hear the horns blaring?
Can't you hear so many horns blaring?
Thief?
Where is the thief?
Who died?
- No one died.
"Not thief, I said blare."
Are you deaf?
"You speak loudly, and very fast."
So I don't understand anything.
Your moustache covers your mouth.
Move your lips slowly.
"When I see your lip movement, I'll understand."
I don't understand easily.
God !
- What did you pick?
Show me your hand.
I didn't pick anything.
"You've met me here, don't meet me in heaven."
You live in that building?
Which floor?
The traffic has got jammed because of you.
Look!
Why are so many vehicles parked here?
"So many horns are blaring, can't you hear?"
Are you deaf?
The traffic has got jammed.
Are you blind?
Who called me blind?
Looks like a gang who calls me blind is out.
Who are you calling blind?
"That was that then,-"
- No!
It is ... another!
Hahahaha!
I am going absolutely crazy.
People were so excited about Grant's new product that he started getting requests
left and right for his glasses wipers and spray nozzles.
"So, he started to keep a"
list of everyone who would want a pair very soon.
"By the end of 1 day, 36 of his friends had begged him for glasses wipers and 11 of those people each said that they would also like a pair of nozzles to go with their glasses wipers."
"It's... the pop... from, uh, the pizza place?"
It's -- looks like a person.
He matches the color of the restaurant.
That is the coffee logo.
That is a parade elephant.
That is the Disney.
Those are... little... worms.
"That looks like an ""M""."
"But upside down, ""M""s are ""W""s!"
That is the Apple Store logo!
It has a bite of an apple in it.
"Ooh, looks like the 'merican flag."
A bell.
"Uh, outside space."
Looks like a shooting star?
With a planet.
An eye.
"Chili, and it has an ""S"" next to it, and chilis are spicy."
That looks like a beach ball.
Beach balls are very colorful.
The GE logo.
That's where my grandpa works.

Amy:
Oh no!
DG:
Good morning!
"I'm Professor Vacinski, Director General of CERN."
DG:
This meeting has been called because last night there was an emergency beam dump.
(Crowd whispers furtively)
DG:
Here we see a monopole magnet in LHC Sector 7G.
DG:
Beam sensors have detected that an unknown event caused this magnet to quench and triggered an uncontrolled shut down.
DG:
If this happens again the results could be catastrophic.
DG:
"Due to the special circumstances, Dr. Niven is taking a team into the LHC tunnel to investigate the cause, and see what damage there is."
The LHC will be in shut down until at least the end of the week.
DG:
Since Dr. Niven will not be available we will need 4 volunteers to be on shift in the control room.
Connor:
We'll do it.
Amy:
(Quietly) What are you doing?!
DG:
"Ok, you four."
Lisa:
"Oh, I'm going to be at a conference in Barcelona."
DG:
"Uh, very well."
You... you then.
Matt:
"Uh, I have an analysis note due this week, so I'm not going to have time to do this..."
Enjoy this short life.
"Cemre, her mommies one and only."
My dear.
"Sweetheart, my fortune."
"Be so happy, I don't want anything else in this world, Cemre."
Be happy with the man you love.
And have joint purpose with him.
But have your own purpose as well.
"And have a beautiful girl, like I do."
What if it's a boy?
"A child is a child, canım."
"Boy or girl, doesn't matter."
But have your child from the man you love.
Like I did.
So how did it go?
You saw Kuzey?
Sami Amca gave him the cookies and the letter.
We didn't have a feast like that in a long time.
- Thank you brother.
- Afiyet olsun.
Thanks to everyone who helped bring these to our table.
"Come join us, brother."
Come sit with us.
"Don't feel left out, come on."
"Well, since you are our guest here."
I will accept your invitation.
Let's make the best of your short stay.
"God gave us our punishment, anyway."
"Let us not punish each other, too."
"- Come sit, let us eat böreks of peace."
- Thank you.
- Come sit.
A cheater!
"Today, before Damodar arrives... ...I'll tell you everything true."
What do you want to tell me?
Go on.
"Actually, I'm..."
I'm not your would-be son-in-law.
A charade has been played with you.
And I'm forced to play a role of fraud son-in-law.
"Actually, your would-be son-in-law is someone else."
Who's he?
- Today's race winner.
Jackie!
- No!
You can slap me or kill me.
I'll get the punishment of my deeds.
But this is true.
Mr. Bharat Singh has thrown a big party for Jackie's victory.
And Jackie and Radha are also taking part... ...in a stage program of that party.
And you'll be made a chief guest of that program.
I would like to see this truth.
I'll attend the party.
I'll definitely go.
Has father come here?
Radha!
I don't want you to sing with Kishan in the party.
There'll be a big confusion.
I'll sing.
"- Radha, father has come to known everything."
And no one else other than you could be there behind it.
"No, Radha."
I promise you.
I'm yours only.
Who is Rajesh?
My best friend!
"My school and college""s friend!"
"No matter how much I praise his friendship, its less."
ls that so?
You have never mentioned Rajesh before.
How can I mention him?
He has joined the police force!
"And I am just working in the shipping company. seema, when you are in front of me, I forget everything."
"Now don""t talk too much."
And come with us for a picnic!
Picnic?
- Yes!
How can I come for the picnic?
He is coming after a long time.
"He will feel so dejected if he won""t find me here."
"Good luck, sir!"
Good luck!
"lt""s the sign of your promotion."
"This is the first time that this jeep""s tyre has got punctured."
Rao.
"- Yes, sir."
"Don""t talk nonsense."
"Take out the jack from the jeep. sorry, sir!"
There is no jack!
There is no jack!
"Take out the spanner. sorry, sir."
"We don""t have that too."
"Take out the screw driver. sir, we can take out the screw."
"But it""s difficult to take out the driver. otherwise who will drive?"
"Rao, I am fed up of this!"
"How does your jeep work? sir, it""s a police jeep. lt works on its reputation."
I have turned into a horse.
Know what she gave me for breakfast today?
Egg shampoo.
You are laughing?
Thank your stars she served you egg shampoo.
She gave me a white handkerchief in my milk as cream.
Take this file.
Go through it.
- Is this the file of your murder case?
What did you say?
"I meant, whose murder case file is this?"
A man named Manish will strike a deal in diamonds worth millions. . . in Hotel Blue Diamond.
Then let him strike the deal first.
- Why?
Because law says that until someone commits a crime. . . you cannot nab him.
"As soon as he strikes the deal, you will catch him red handed."
Both saw the time.
Both jumped in.
Something fishy.
Even I will jump in.
I won't spare you !
I won't spare you !
Where are you going?
"- Girls, what are you doing?"
"I am on duty, let me go."
Where are you hiding?
Come out soon !
Did you see?
- Yes sir.
Sexy figures in the pool.
"Not that figure, you fools!"
Look.
"Oh, I get it."
"You wanted this anchor job for yourself, and this is your way of getting back at me."
You'd let your own sister go down in flames just to satisfy your petty jealousy.
All right... but this is the last time I bail you out.
You're the greatest.
"Afterwards, I'll tell Collins you wrote the stories."
"He'll see how good you are, he'll let you write all my stories."
Me in front of the camera and you behind.
We could be a team.
"*Good morning, Sweet Valley.* *Today's top story...*"
Jessica.
Have you seen Elizabeth?
Nope.
"Ten minutes, people."
"Jessica, I need to proof your copy."
"Sorry, Mr. C. Liz is still Xeroxing it."
"OK, looks good, Camera One."
"Camera Two, zoom out."
Camera Two?
"Hello, Camera Two?"
"What is that, Manny?"
"Oh, sorry."
"Elizabeth, where have you been?"
I need my stories!
These are blank.
They are?
Silly me.
I must have mixed up the stories I wrote with the ones you wrote.
Is there some kind of irony here?
How can you stand there and pretend you don't know what I'm talking about?
Practice?
"You knew how much I wanted to be anchor, and you switched the tapes just so you could get the job."
There's a place where you throw in coins and make wishes.
I made many wishes.
First wish was 'Please let B.A.P have a hit.'
Second wish was 'Please let our hair designer get married'
And the third wish was 'Please let our make-up artist get married too'
"I wasn't going to say this but, honestly, I wished for many chances"
To see many BABAz.
I think I threw in coins worth about 5 dollars.
"Well most importantly, the MV has to come out well."
We have to finish off the concerts in
Korea and Japan successfully too.
Take this energy from Central Park...
This is awesome.
None
Americans seem to know how to appreciate the small things in life.
We're so used to internet and machines.
We should stop getting used to them
And become appreciative people.
"I will try, too."
We're going to Time Square now.
Yong Guk is filming his scene at Time Square.
I've only seen it on TV.
Like in 'lnfinite Challenge' kind of TV shows. or other entertainment programs.
I've always wanted to visit.
And I get to go today.
I'm excited.
"Yo, New York City."
"We're here, in NY."
There's so much to do.
"Hogwarts kid, move."
We're here in NY.
I said move Hogwart!
Okay what page am I on?
"Okay, oh okay."
Sorry.
"There, okay, ready, ready."
Okay.
"A, is the following."
Negative four on the diagonal .
"Ready, ready."
This is what makes it complicated.
Once.
An occasional zero.
"And then 1s, and then, an occasional zero."
Okay.
We'll get it though.
"By the way its the same over here, one's occasional zero's, zero's one down from here."
So this zero.
Is in that first M by M block.
Sorry.
No its not.
"It's, one over."
Sorry.
That zero.
"There's an N by N block there, and then a zero, and then 1s."
"Okay, so fourth, and this one here, zero is, one down here, ones, so I got three rows."
Six more to go.
"Alright then we have these, this is all due to periodic boundary conditions by the way."
Why these appear.
Then you have these 1s on the corners.
And then these ones over on this corners.
Got five diagonals.
"Then I have some ones over here that continue, there."
Then I have some ones.
"You don""t fear the public."
"You don""t fear your parents."
At least fear the police.
ls it a crime to love?
"Hey, lover boy!"
Why do you love openly?
Think about the people!
"What happened, constable Rao?"
You both too come here!
"What happened, constable?"
"Don""t ask!"
lf I had not come on time today then.. ..your image would have got tarnished!
This ruffian was going to kiss your daughter!
"What""s the harm in kissing?"
Young people should indulge in kissing!
- Yes! shut up!
lf my daughter starts giving free kisses.. ..then who will give me dowry?
"Look, Mr. Rao."
"lf you can give me 4000 gm gold, then you can stay! otherwise leave!"
"You don""t worry, papa! l will load you with gold!"
"Don""t trust this ruffian!"
"Look, if you want to get your daughter married.. ..then get her married to a decent, reputed, educated guy."
Even if he is of my age.
"This is something to ponder over! sorry, sir!"
I am one minute late.
1 minute late.
- Yes.
I got to know 1 minute prior. oh!
"Then it""s a great loss, sir!"
"ln this one minute, I could have.."
At this age?
"- Yes, sir!"
There is no beyond.
"Now, it is time to see the sun."
We won't give up our hopes.
We will see beautiful days.
"Narin, how are you sweetheart?"
I talked to the man in the Ministry.
You should have seen how he attended to me...
He will take me to the lunch soon.
Hello?
"Narin, do you hear me?"
This is under the shadow...
Let it see some sun...
Come on...
Mmmm!
Smells so good!
Right out from the oven...
"Who eats gets fat, who doesn't eat becomes sorry..."
"Doctor Bey, since you said you would leave early, I packed yours."
Thank you very much.
Enjoy.
No matter what we have done all this time He only showed some reaction to Narin.
Looks like he recognized her from the picture...
Huh!
"Come, come Duriye..."
You don't have any strength anymore.
Take a sit.
"Mom, are you ok?"
"Duriye Hanim, would you like to have a cold cherry syrup?"
Yes...
"Maybe, it will calm us down a little bit."
There is nothing to do Yasar.
"After all this time, if he only recognized Narin from a picture..."

Government is releasing Jackie six months early... ...because of his good conduct.
"Inspector Varma, if government will allow me... ...to commit one murder, I'd kill Jackie first."
That snake can bit us anytime.
Damodar!
Keep an eye on him.
"Yes, I'm eyeing him, uncle."
I'm eyeing him.
But now I'll keep strict watch.
Strict!
Who?
Jackie?
You mean Jaikishan?
He left 2 hours before.
"""My love, my beloved..."""
"""My darling... my love..."""
"""My darling, my Romeo."""
"""My Romeo... my honey..."""
"""My love..."""
"""I'm your dream-boy."
"You are my love."""
He's panicked as well.
He'll probably say what I've already told you.
I wasn't going to answer him anyway.
I don't want to talk to anyone.
"Don't go, man."
It's okay.
I got it.
Don't talk to anybody.
"And tell the girl not to, as well."
"Thank you very much, Cemil Bey."
Much appreciated.
We're done here.
Thank God we had a connection here.
We don't have to wait anymore.
Your visa is in your pocket.
Let's go book a flight now.
So that you'll waste no time.
Every day you spend here is against you.
- Hello.
"- Good evening Meryem Hanım, how are you?"
How am I...
I am packing his stuff.
Maybe he'll need them in Istanbul.
I've spoken to a friend of mine who lives in Istanbul.
"You know, the one I mentioned before who might help Kerim out."
"- Oh, thank you."
- I explained to him the situation.
"- Of course, only the bits he must know."
- Thank you.
"Thankfully he said ""I'll help him, make him call me."""
He'll find a place for him to stay.
I'll give you his number.
"Remember, it's all in the presentation!"
"Piece by piece, snip by snip"
"Croup, dock, haunch, shoulders, hip"
"Bolt by bolt, primmed and pressed"
"Yard by yard, always stressed"
And that's the Art of the Dress!
"Oh, Opal."
These are the ugliest dresses I've ever made.
Okay.
I did exactly what each of you asked for.
Now don't hold back.
Let me know what you really think.
-Oh my!
-It's... perfect!
-It's cool!
Wow.
They're the best duds I ever did see.
It's exactly what I asked for!
"Thank you, Rarity."
Are you as happy with the as we're?
"Well, I'm... happy that all of you are happy."
I'm just relieved to finally be done.
You are never gonna believe this!
You've heard of Hoity-Toity?
The bigwig fashion hotshot in Canterlot?
Uh-huh.
He heard about your fashion show.
"Well, maybe I happened to mention it to him..."
"He's coming here all the way from Canterlot to see your work, Rarity!"
"Whoa, Nelly!"
You could sell a ton o' dresses to this guy.
You business will be boomin'!
She'll escape.
"The day she tries to escape, shoot her."

Good luck!
What is it?
- I too dont know.
That is what I call extra speech.
I did not like your face.
"Salim, the scooter is not getting started."
Please kick start it.
If he likes someones face he will make..
Why does he have Shailus ring on his finger?
I had a similar ring made for my daughter.
She lost it somewhere.
Did you find it by any chance?
I was joking.
This is a girls ring.
Not good for you.
Your luck will be reversed.
Take it off.
"Oh, is it love!"
You must have that much passion.
But be careful.
If that father knows.. ..he might have your hand or leg removed.
His head will be removed before.. ..he decides between hand or leg.
His Anarkali is my daughter?!
Then why will she agree to become an actress?
She will not.
All of you come here.
Listen all of you.
"If all my debts have to be repaid.. ..and if you have to breath free air, then I must die."
Oh God!
Im coming to you.
How are you?
Bring some water.
What?
"On February the 4th, when the trial is over and you are free."
"I will hug you so tight, that... ... no one will be able to untie us."
Take care until that day.
I love you so much.
I love you so much.
If you want to be my girlfriend then you won't hold a weapon again.
- Zeynep.
- Let us go.
I said let us go.
Do I stick it in here?
We'll leave a row empty.
Then we'll add 4 rows.
Okay.
- Am I doing alright?
- You're doing wonderful.
"""Don't wait for me tonight."
"It's impossible for me come."""
"Now do the turns, and finish the crossed parts."
- How does it look?
"- It looks beautiful, canım."
The idiot dropped it at the house when he was fighting Kuzey.
I forgot that I kept it so that it wouldn't get lost.
Then I found it again in one of the boxes as I moved to my new place.
So I brought it  thought maybe it's something important.
You did well.
This was my father's.
Atilla Sinaner's.
He had bought this specially to give it as a present to Güney.
That fool couldn't hold onto it.
- One more?
"- No, I will go."
- Where?
Let's hope the best for them.
Amin.
"I told them, they shouldn't come all the way back here."
"So, I'll just have what will be delivered to Kuzey."
And I'll take it to them.
Boot licker.
That's good.
You thought well.
"Actually, Sami Amca wanted me to present at the jail as well."
"He said, it would make Kuzey very happy even if I'm just waiting at the door."
"But, I'll see."
Where did Sami Amca say that to you?
In your dream?
"Cemre, what are you talking about?"
Silly girl.
"I got used to it, Gülten Teyze."
This is just a sample of our dialogues with Cemre.
I bet you took a day off from work for this.
"Dear, why don't you go and put the cookies in the oven?"
I got some other stuff to do as well.
You don't worry about me.
"- So give me what you have, and I'll take it to them."
"- No need, I'll do it myself."
"What, are you going too?"
Come on...
"But mom, it's not ready anyway."
What should I do?
- Rush it while Zeynep is poising over me?
"- Well, I can't wait, if it's not ready."
"Also, she might put it into trash or change my letter."
"I won't take the risk, thanks."
"Okay, Cemre..."
Am I not dead?
You may stop me today and tomorrow.
But I will go one day.
No one listens to what I say.
I will listen to you.
Swear by your mother that you will listen to me.
Okay I will listen to you.
Will you become a cinema actress?
"No, no."
You must pose like this.
Are you a director?
You are shooting a photograph like a movie.
My money is hard earned..
Excuse me.
No smoking sir.
I am the father of the heroine.
Even then you cannot smoke sir.
"Let the movie succeed, then I will take care of you."
"Hi, Salim!"
What are you doing here?
I came for Anarkali.
Where is your Anarakali?
Dont play games.
Then give your daughter to me.
I will look after her very well.
I dont even know your name.
My daughter is a star.
She will be a heroine.
She cannot be the lover of a loafer like you.
There is a lot of gap between you and my daughter.
"Hey, you cannot even touch her shadow."
What?
I won't kill when they tell me to... ...or risk my life just bacause that's an orders.
That's sheer dumbness.
The most important thing is to yourself with skills.
That's my style.
You mistake us... we're ordered to collect our money.
Stop bullshitting me!
Where're you from?
We're from the Bank of Canton.
last time because I was late... it selling my account in a couple of days.
They were just do their job.
I just lost 2000 bucks to you.
Shut your fucking mouth!
Move!
"We didn't do anything wrong, did we?"
You want us to take off you?
Move!
Move!
Isn't it right?
Serve them right!
"Come on, go back to your room."
Serve them right!
Wait a second!
Who are you?
Mr.Wing sent me to collect his money.
What money?
Take a look at this!
Have you finished?
You think it's fake.
Just wanna make sure it's not.
"What's wrong with you, Sylvester?"
I know what's on your mind sex maniacal
What do you mean?
You crazy?
"Besides, the wardens will open and read it anyway."
Why wouldn't I?
Abla.
We're running out on detergent.
"Okay, dear."
Cemre...
Don't write silly things in the letter.
Remember the wardens will read it first.
"And don't write anything regarding the future, like so eager."
"- Just leave it to time, will you?"
- Okay mom...
It's Sami Amca.
We're gonna be late!
It can't be him at this hour.
Maybe it's the water guy.
Why would water guy come now?
What do you want?
- Good morning Zeynepciğim.
Come in?
"- No, thank you."
Sami Amca said you made some things for Kuzey.
I'll deliver it to him.
What do you mean you will deliver it to him?
- Are you going as well?
"- Are you, too?"
"No, I mean, they don't let him see people from out of the family."
Why do you go?
Sami Amca asked me.
So I must definitely go with him.
"And he went to the registry office to make application, with Aynur Abla."
"Oh, really?"
So sorry
But
I'll buy tuna sashimi if you come.
The best kind
The best!
I'm dying for fresh tuna
I'm sorry
I'm really sorry
She never went out once with us in over a year
She's a Hikikomori
- She doesn't shut herself at home - Someday she will
"- We're having tuna, right?"
"- No, sausages"
You can't mess with tuna like that!
Come on!
I want tuna!
The best!
"I'll buy tuna, then!"
"A big can, that is"
Roll it around
"Happy birthday, Sweetie I sent a gift"
What Mom?
- A husband - What?
I signed you up at a marriage agency to meet men
You didn't have to do that
How's work?
When will you become a magician?
It's just a part-time job
How's everything there?
Good
Great air and nice people
It's so beautiful here
"I don't think you have any, I don't seen Corel draw ."
"You know, I don't think that we focused."
"In that case , I mean Painter, which is actually used for children's publications."
"Oh, really?"
"Yeah, we haven't, I don't think that we ."
"Oh, no."
You do have .

"And we have um, finished shooting, um."

So that will come out in November.

"Okay, great!"
"Yeah, yeah."

Exactly. .
"Uh, that's good."
That's good.
That's good.
"Um, okay. ,, ."
"Uh, do you have any questions for me or anything that you would like to add that you feel would be particularly helpful for us as we look at 2013?"
Um.
No.
Bye.
Excuse me...
My brother?
- What's the matter?
- Where is he?
Tell me what's wrong.
I talked to the doctor and he told me everything was okay and he was stable in a coma.
Was his condition serious?
I haven't been told anything about a transfer.
"Shit, Malena."
- What's the matter?
- Son-of-a-bitch!
You son-of-a-bitch.
What is it?
I feel fucking fine.
What day is it today?
September 10.
"2001, right?"
"I mean I didn't sleep til 2007 or anything, did l?"
You were out for 2 weeks.
You know what?
I have a feeling things are going to get better from now on.
"Shit, this is the 21st century."
We can learn from what we did wrong in the 20th.
"Starting tomorrow, the world will be a better place."
Trust me and you'll see.
"Pablo, there's something I haven't told you that you should know."
THE APPEARED
We are just doing future value of annuities.
"And I'll show you now, why this is such a cool thing."
"And what I'm going to do is, I'm going to do two examples, both for future value of an annuity."
And whats the other thing we do?
- On 18th of February.
Sinaner Holding will make the opening.
We will ring the bell that morning.
- Shall we drink the coffee in my room?
- I need to attend to a meeting.
I need to make a few phone calls.
Then I'll be with you.
See you.
"Güney, don't you dare break Banu's heart."
- What do you mean?
"- Today, I saw you and Melda kissing."
If you want to continue your existence at home and in the company... ... you need to be careful.
Or you'll have no where to go.
You dodged a life there.
Geçmiş olsun.
Are you okay?
Thank you.
"God forbid, you could have died."
I could have.
"But I didn't, again."
"Pity, you failed again."
What are you talking about?
- Our case isn't closed yet.
- I know it isn't.
I'll talk to you about the photo-montage thing later.
- I will not stop until I expose the truth.
- That's enough.
What are you trying to say?
You know exactly what I am saying.
Don't forget that.
- What photo-montage?
"- Just leave it, he's being ridiculous."
It is an earthquake!
(RUMBLE!
CRASH!)
Come on.
You'll stay with me until you get back on your feet...foot.
"Wait, he was so close with his mom."
"No, Denise."
It's genetic.
"Oh, no you're not!"
I am.
Our short webseries tells these stories.
Real stories.
You married the whiny bitch.
"Well, we made them up, but they'll remind you of folks you know."
Speaking of horse c*ck
This seriously hurts my titties.
Mine too!
She has a condition.
She does.
It's so wet!
A Series of Unfortunate People
We're gonna need back up.
The walls are closing in on me!
Now.
Mekong:
Watch That River!
This is the Mekong
One of Asia's major rivers and the 12th longest in the world
"It nurtures a great deal of life in its waters and in the wetlands, forests, towns, and villages along its path"
The Mekong's long journey begins in the Tibetan highlands
"It flows through China's Yunan province and then across Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia before entering the sea from Southern Vietnam"
"It's a journey of nearly 5,000 kilometers or some 3,000 miles"
"Second man, out of shot:"
"Look at his face, this filth."
[One man laughs.]
Another man:
They shot us with live ammunition
Cameraman:
One bullet in his leg and one in his stomach.
Another man:
"For God to bless you, put him in the morgue."
Man out of shot:
Pick him up with me.
Several voices:
"Slowly, carefully."
"A soul, a soul."
One man:
"This is a human, in the end this is a soul..."
Another man:
"Arrange his arms properly, arrange his arms."
Cameraman:
Was he shot yesterday?
Or today?
It looks like it was from yesterday.
Another man:
Where are his ID cards and stuff?
Cameraman:
"I don't know, search his pockets...the guys must have taken them."
Another man:
"He's not Libyan, I don't think he's Libyan."
Cameraman:
"He's stiffened, you can't arrange his body properly."
"It must be from yesterday, not today."
[music]
"They say Budyonny thought of that, honest to God!"
Here they come...
"And now, the fair-haired Josie!"
Never shall I forget
That wondrous night -
Our two hearts pledged
To a future bright.
You laughed at the fears
That did harry me...
You promised... that night...
To marry me.
"The night flew by, the night flew by,"
The morning brought a leaden sky.
"Night again, night again,"
"This night, alas, a night of rain."
"That night is gone,"
That night is gone.
I cannot believe
That all is over...
The romance is ended.
Sing some more!
More!
Dance for us!
"What's so funny, you apes?"
So you caught the kid.
"Your pa was quicker than you, wasn't he?"
Didn't hurt yourself?
"Come on, let's have some kvass."
You think that Sidor Lyuty's heart don't ache for you war orphans?
It aches all right.
But in times like these we can't help having orphans.
Know how many of my pals your pa did away with?
I got a variety dream last night.
In that dream both of us were married.
Surprising!
I too had the same dream.
But first night was with Salman Khan.
I will never get married in this life.
What if I reject?
There are many other girls in the city.
If I am not agreeable to the below average beauty like you.. ..how could I expect any girl to like me?
I think I was a wall in my previous life.
That is why.. ..everyone is throwing dung cakes on my face.
"Jagan, come with me."
Where to?
- I will tell you afterwards.
Come with me.
Are you going to hit me there?
What happened?
You should not see.
Remove the hand uncle.
Sorry.
I know you very well.
That is why I said we will sit outside.
Please wait for a while.
We have to select the cards.
We can do that sitting outside also.
I wont do anything.
Come on sit down.
We should not believe this men.
Is this card nice?
No.
Look at this card.
Remove it.
"Ah yes, yes."
I feel like I'm getting permission from you.
You did well.
Good Job.
"Ha Ni, it is my first piece of work."
So try it at least once.
"Eat it, okay?"
Okay. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I feel sorry towards Joon Gu... &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;but I'm really happy about being able to be next to Seung Jo again. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I'm excited but nervous at the same time. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Will I be able to do a good job?
Oh.
Where did it go?
I know I brought it in.
Is this yours?
Mine.
You took it didn't you?
Dummy.
It was on the ground right here.
Who would steal childish panties like those?
I only wear them once in a while.
I usually wear ones that have a lot of lace.
You don't have a body that can be considered sexy though.
Even the A Cup must be too big...
Did you stop growing after elementary school?
What did you say?
Hey.
"Seeing you like that, and not thinking of anything..."
Isn't that a big problem?
Is it that fun to make fun of me?
"If you don't like living with me, you can just say it."
You just grumpily keep making fun of people.
I'm grumpy?
Yeah.
Why am I doing that?
"You don't want us to call the police, do you?"
"Doctor, he's going to kill my brother."
"Calm down, Malena, please."
The doctor isn't pressing charges.
Why not tell me what happened?
My father...
I don't know how he can still be alive...
"Excuse me, but you didn't get my message, did you?"
"After you left, your father's brain activity shot up."
"He's in a coma, of course, but his brain's active."
What?
I'm telling you that we didn't disconnect your father yet.
He's alive!
God!
The son-of-a-bitch...
The son-of-a-bitch!
"Calm down, Malena."
You have to think of your brother.
That's what I'm doing!
Please let me go.
He's going to kill him.
"Pablo, do you understand?"
Please.
Please.
Wait.
What is it now?
How can anyone hate like that?
And hurt another human being without feeling remorse?
What do you mean?
"I'm talking about the torture, the diary... the photographs of you with my father."
Let me go.
I said let me go!
When I saw Suraj I realised that he was your son.
Arun's son.
But when he mentioned his father's name I kept silent.
He still doesn't know that I am his mother.
Promise me that you will never tell him the truth.
He won't learn from me.
But if there is a God he'll surely learn of his real parents someday.
"Hello, mother!"
- God bless you!
Come in.
Suraj's mother has come.
Hello!
Please have a seat.
"Sit, my dear."
I'm pleased to meet you.
"Renu, fetch some tea."
"No, that won't be necessary."
Sit beside me.
It is customary to offer something to a guest.
I have come to meet you as it is customary to do so.
You are the girl's father and I am the boy's mother.
Both of us should consent to this alliance.
Times have changed.
In these times the girl and the boy decide for themselves.
The parentsjust need to give their blessings.
Our happiness lies in their happiness.
For the sake of their happiness we should set the date immediately.
It is my wish too.
She's feeling shy.
- She's a child.
"Vandana, Suraj's mother has come."
She is my sister.
He wants a lot.
"He has big demands, boss!"
He wants 1500 gm of gold.
"You don""t worry."
I have said yes on your behalf!
Fool!
Will your father bring 1500 gm of gold?
Go and bring breakfast!
Bring breakfast for 2 people!
I have come to meet you!
- I was waiting for you!
But sP is always busy!
I wish I was Tiger singh.
You would have then followed me thinking me to be a culprit.
Under this pretext I would have got.. ..the chance to meet my friend.
What do I tell you?
I had come to arrest Tiger singh!
And I myself have landed into trouble.
What trouble?
- A beautiful trouble.
Where did you find her?
- ln your city.
"I couldn""t stop looking at her when I saw her for the first time."
"When I saw her for the second time, I lost my heart."
"When I saw her for the third time, I lost my senses."
Where does she lives?
- ln my heart.
"When we were in London, you would never take.. ..any decision without consulting your friend."
And here you fell in love without informing your friend.
"Till the time I don""t fix the alliance with her parents.. ..how can I give her name to you?"
"Then give me the girl""s father""s name."
Diwan Dinanath!
"Recently, thoughts of you just fill my head."
That's what I wanted to say. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
Dad!
What?
"Oh,"
Did something good happen today?
Huh?
"No, what good thing?"
"Aigoo, I wish something good happened to us."
Why? &amp;lt;BR&amp;gt;&amp;lt;BR&amp;gt;Did something happen?
"Oh, it's not that..."
I think it's going to take a long time to build the new house.
I can't get insurance on it since it's done by natural disasters.
And the company who was supposed to construct are just shrinking from their responsibility.
"Then what should we do, Dad?"
"Ah, don't worry."
"It will be resolved, but it will take some time."
"Although it might be uncomfortable, plan on staying here for a while."
Yes.
"I am sorry, Ha Ni!"
What's there for you to be sorry about?
Don't worry about me.
I am fine.
Okay.
Welcome!
-Hello!
-Hello!
"Oh, you two came?"
We didn't even open yet!
Sit!
Sit!
What are you doing here at this time?
Where's the fourth?
Show me!
"Well, ehh, here's the thing."
They can't.
It's not here.
What did you do?
"Well, Bonnie gave me the head's up."
"I mean, I didn't have enough time to get all four, but I did have time to get one."
I will tear you limb from limb.
"And only then, when you are a writhing mass of blood and flesh, will I rip your heart from your chest."
Sorry.
Same rules apply.
Leverage and all.
I know you want your family back.
But something tells me you want what's in that coffin a lot more.
You want to tell me what you're up to?
You talked to Damon.
"Yeah, I did."
He wasn't supposed to wake up so soon.
I used enough vervain to sedate him for hours.
"Well, he drinks it, every day."
To build up an immunity so people like you don't get the jump on him.
"I'm not crazy, Ric."
Really?
Then what are you?
Watch your back.
You really want to know?
Stick around.
Is that bill Forbes?
Aaah!
I'm just trying to help!
"Just get it out, Elena, please."
This one here gets shifted up.
Ready to shift some stuff?
"Remember, we only have to do this once."
Right?
So its an upfront cost.
Okay?
It's your investment.
"And then, once you have it, you can have this forever."
"Anybody ever asks you, hey, I need to take with [inaudible] boundary conditions."
"You'd be, like, dang, I gotcha."
"You just take this matrix which you built in 2011 and you can apply it at any time in your life, okay?"
"Show your grandkids,"
Whatever.
All right.
Yes.
[inaudible] where that needs to go in there?
This one here?
Yeah.
Dang it.
"Didn't, did I?"
Where did it put it if you don't put it in there?
That's a good question.
"Let's just put it in, don't ask hard questions."
Alright.
That one's supposed to be there.
"No, no, no."
M minus one.
That's where it's supposed to go.
"I, I think it put it."
"Well, who knows?"
"That's, that's, sorry."
There we go.
What has happened to my son?
I've often told you not to join the Air Force.
You are my only child.
By God's grace your life was saved today.
If anything happens in the future what will I do?
Wasn't I right?
"Mother, nothing has happened to me."
Go home and make offerings at the Lord's temple.
And this also won't happen again.
- Quiet!
You speak as though you know what will happen.
God bless you!
Who is she?
The doctor has forbidden me to speak in excess.
You tell her.
I am Renu.
My father is a retired jailer.
Oh!
So you are Renu!
He had written to me about you.
"But, whatever he had written was not sufficient."
Do you know what the doctor has said?
He said that unless we marry soon I won't get better.
Oh God!
I'll go and fix the wedding date right away.
"Yes, of course."
I have selfish motives.
Once you are married you won't risk your life so readily.
Touch mother's feet again on my behalf.
Touch my feet when you are my daughter-in-law.
Vandana!
You!
I've seen many skateboarders since yesterday. our youngest Zelo also likes to skateboard.
"Board shop, board shop!"
"Here, it seems like a routine."
"Just as we go bike riding, people here seem to enjoy skateboarding."
Look at the camera.
None
"Since the U.S. is a really big nation, the roads and buildings are all big"
I can tell why Americans are so relaxed.
"I heard in America, people eat burgers and shakes together."
There aren't many people yet in Korea who eat like that.
"- Yes there is, Yong Guk."
"- Yes, Yong Guk eats like that."
We will give it a try today.
"At Shake Shack, they eat burgers and shakes together."
"Usually, people drink coke."
"Well, that's what they say."
Why don't you all try it too?
I hear strawberry shakes are delicious.
I felt this last time too...
The clouds in America are so beautiful.
I think I can see them more clearly because there aren't too many tall buildings. one two three.
We're in America.
"one more time, one more time."
"Hurry, one more time."
"oK, the red light is on."
I'm at a coffee shop.
"This is a mango smoothie, sold only in this store."
None
I don't know where everybody else went.
oh!
There's Zelo.
"Yo, what's up!"
Once I've asked my senior here
You will be sorry.
"Miss Mu, under the circumstances earlier..."
"You had no choice, and needn't worry about your oath"
"I've sworn,"
I can't take my word back now.
"If you don't like me,"
"I will have to kill you, and then I'll kill myself."
Do you want to be my husband?
I'm willing to marry you.
"Good day, my master."
Good day.
Master?
What kind of a master are you?
"It took us a while to locate you,"
let's go back to the palace.
I was about to bring Miss Mu to meet my parents.
Go ahead and tell them first.
We've found our master.
What kind of a master are you?
Be patient.
"After we've reached the bottom of the hill, you'll know when you see my welcoming party."
Who are you?
"We had a deal earlier, remember?"
"After we've reached Dali city,"
I'll tell you the details.
Senior.
Where's Tuan Yu?
Senior.
"Tuan Yu has killed the Red Python, sucked up its blood, and has now acquired ""Red Dragon Soul"" style."
I was no match for him.
What?
Are you sure you want.......
Bad Horse!
Bad Horse!
Bad Horse!
Bad Horse!
He rides across the nation the thorough bread of sin.
He got the application that you just sent in.
It needs evaluation so let the games begin.
A heinous crime to show of course.
A murder would be nice of course.
Bad Horse!
Bad Horse!
Bad Horse!
He's bad!
The evil league of evil is watching so beware!
"The grade that you receive will be your last, we swear."
So make the Bad Horse prideful or he'll make you his mare.
"You saddled up, there's no recourse."
"It high ho silver, signed Bad Horse."
- I don't know.
- Are you kidding?
This is great!
I'm about to pull a major heist!
"You know, the Wonderflonium that I need for the freeze ray?"
It's being transported tomorrow!
Armored car?
Courrier van.
Candy for a baby.
Do you need anything dampened or made soggy?
Thanks but... the league is watching.
I gotta do this alone.
Will you lend a caring hand to shelter those who need it?
God always supports true lovers.
Let's see how much he supports us.
Now you go.
Listen!
My mother had given this locket to me in my childhood.
Radha!
"""You are my love, my dream-boy."""
"""You are a Hero of my love story."
"You are a hero!"""
"Yes, Damodar!"
"Uncle, Jackie has surrendered!"
- What?
"""You can take away my youth..."""
"""But return me my childhood's innocence."""
"""Ever since she has returned, she's silent."""
"""Wonder what could have happened in these 16 days."""
"""That young boy... and this young girl."""
"Aunt, stop it now."
"Since yesterday, we've cried enough."
Don't make her cry more.
Why would I do that?
Society will make her cry when they'll refuse her alliance.
"Sister-in-law, I'd suggest you to get her married... ...before the matter becomes public."
"""That paper boat..."""
Radha!
- Yes.
It seems you are hiding something from me.
"Yes, sister-in-law."
I'm carrying a burden in my heart.
Sister-in-law.
I can't hide anything from you and brother.
I want to share everything with you.
How does he know?
Yes.
What you want?
When can we expect the rain?
Not at present.
- Why?
Because the pointing finger was selected.
Tell me correctly.
During the next 48 hours the state will not have any rainfall.
"You can dry clothes, dry chips under the sun etc."
Can we apply beer to the hair?
Do whatever you want and leave me.
Will there be rain at least after 48 hours?
This is a difficult question.
Wait a minute.
Select one finger.
Yes.
"There will be rain after 48 hrs, 6 minutes and 8 seconds."
Is the rain guaranteed?
"Yes, without doubt."
My finger never cheats me.
Since you asked so many foolish questions.. ..can I ask you just one?
- Go ahead.
You are inquiring so much about the rain.. .what seeds did you sow?
He is asking what seeds we sowed?
Tell him that it is the seed of love.
- The seed of love.
What?
The seed of love?!
Put the phone down.
"Hey guys, it will rain after 48 hours."
We all heard that.
I don't feel I'm driving.
I can't wait til next family gathering.
"Friday, 5pm., I'm sure  I'll get there on time."
Especially wishes.
"Wow, a good driver..."
I bet it's a woman.
"Damn, we spend so much  money on legal music and software."
If I was a driving examiner  I'd also give him a driving licence.
He's driving really well.
I can't wait til I can use toilet in the train.
30 MPH on the fast lane?
Great!
I can't keep up with those  new faces in politics.
"Easy, elderly lady can go."
I'm not in a hurry.
"Damn, my train is too early again!"
Cart is full but I still have  so much money in my wallet!
Vodka?
Not today.
I have to clean after my dog.
I'm driving.
"You know, I love my boss."
Are you crazy?
I'm working tomorrow.
Good that I finish full-time studies.
At least I have a job guaranteed.
I don't remember when  I last ate pork chops.
I'm sick of this sun!
I've always been interested in  tennis and cross-country.
Even when we weren't successful.
I'm sure that everything I study  will be useful on labor market
Socks and sandals?
My poor daughter!
What am I doing?
"He wants to be the king, but what is he doing?"
You mean the one who's stopping the ship is Sir Moonlight Black Hat?
"Yes, he's the one who helped both of us."
He's so cool!
So that's why he couldn't reveal his identity to me!
"This is all secret, so please do not let on that you know."
I'll be on my way now.
Wait!
Take me to him!
I don't think just anyone can meet him.
"In that case, please deliver a message for me."
"She says she respects you, Sir Moonlight Black Hat."
"You told her to not do anything, right?"
"Yes, but she said she wants to meet you."
She can't.
It won't be good to be involved with me.
We can't meet.
I really want to meet him again.
He seems like such a cool person!
"If I knew it'll be like this,"
I should have asked me for a business card!
So such a man existed?
He must be a true Joseon hero!
He disguises himself in the moonlight and rescued civilians in need!
I wish I could be like that too.
Then why don't you disguise yourself and go out in the moonlight?
How could I do that?
Why not?
You're a warrior who knows how to fight.
He's Sir Moonlight Black Hat.
"We don't know who's in it or what's in it, only that I think my dream's telling me to help kill Klaus."
What the hell are you doing?
I needed her to know about the coffin.
"And I needed you to keep her out of it, Bonnie."
"So what are you going to do, Stefan?"
Are you going to kidnap me so that I won't tell anyone?
"Don't tempt me, Elena."
"I think I know who can open the coffin, Stefan."
And I need Elena to help me find her.
Find who?
What are you talking about?
I couldn't place her face at first.
Then I realized...
"Oh, my God, Bonnie."
Who is this?
It's my mom.
Los alamitos?
"Um, too old."
Honolulu?
"Ugh, I wish."
How many of these are there?
A lot.
I asked the sheriff's office to pull up every single Abby Bennett in the country.
I know we haven't been able to really...
That things have been weird because of Jeremy.
So thank you for helping me with this.
I know you have a lot to deal with.
"There's nothing more important, Bonnie."
It's surreal.
Having to track down a woman who bailed on her own kid.
"You know you don't have to, right?"
Let Stefan obsess over opening up the coffin.
""" ln my body. """
""" Don't look now. """
""" My eyes are spitting fire. """
""" This sight looks so colourful. """
""" You're so talked about, you're so unique. """

Just one more place left to visit.

You call me from Kashi for a day.. ..and make me travel the entire day.
It's a small area.

Let's go.
Come on.
Zuek kasu asko ikusi dituzue kontsultak antolatu zenituztenetik.

"Ikus dezakezunez, síntoma ohikoenak dira eztarriko gorabeherak, zehazkiago, eztarri minbera."
Hirutik batek aipatzen du arazo hau.
"Bigarrena da sudurreko odol jarioa, %20 inguruk daukate."
"Ez bakarrik haurrek, baina 30, 40, 50 edo 60koek ere, edozein adinetakoek."
"Hirugarren síntoma ohikoena, diarrea."
Eta ondoren neke handia.
Kausak ez dira identifikatu oraindik.
Baina kezkatu nintzen ikusi nuenean 500 jendeotatik bakoitzak antzeko sintomak zituela.
Zer uste duzu emaitz horiez?
"Begira, Txernobyl inguruetan leku kutsatuetan bizi diren haurren artean sarri ikusi ditugun sintomak dira."
Horregatik ez nintzen harritu.
"Ez da harritzekoa, zeren eta gure gainean sekulako erradiazio kopurua erori baita."
Japoniako doktoreak ez daude ohituta gorputzean arnastuta edo irentsita sartutako errazioarekin.
"Horregatik, norbait ohartzen denean zerbait ari zaiola gertatzen osasunean eta erradiazioagatik dela... ... ospitalera jotakoan doktoreek esango diote urduriegi dagoela, edo ez diote entzungo."

"Ospitaleko diagnostikoarekin ez bazaituzte konbentzitzen, hobe duzu sospetxatzea zure arazoak erradiazioarekin duela zerikusia."
Batez ere orain.
Ez da harrigarri guri emailak bidali dizkigutenetatik gehienak ospitalera ez joan izana.

Ezta jarioa handia bada ere.
Ospitalera diarrea larriarekin iritsitako askori diarrea birikoa diagnostikatu zioten.
Baina birusen testak negatibo ematen zuen.
Quite a few people came home with the cause of their problems unidentified.
"As has been the case with ""A-bomb bura bura disease"" and Chernobyl-related health problems, medical tests don't reveal any abnormalities for such symptoms."
"If you take a blood test, nothing abnormal is found."
But the medicine you got won't stop your diarrhea.
"So the doctor, not knowing what to do, keep giving you stronger medicines or antibiotics."
"But if the cause is radiation, medicines are hardly effective and the mdical tests don't reveal any abnormalities."
"- All right, all right!"
- Come on.
- What are you reading?
- Chekhov.
- Why?
- He's funny.
- You laugh too much.
Go read the Counsellor's Magazine.
Deal with your inexperience.
- And here's the Queen of the Fields!
"Maestro, music!"
"- Well, hello there Corn!"
- Did you win a cake at the factory?
- Yes I did.
- And a cake from the post office?
- Yes I did.
"- And you'll win a cake here, too."
- Indeed.
- We sure won't be giving a cake to some Puss-in-the-Boots.
"- Comrade Dynin, these days the legumes are mentioned a lot."
- Maybe the bean pod will be better?
- Then they would have done so at the factory.
Don't you worry.
- Same old costumes all year 'round.
So tired of seeing them!
"- Well, don't look at them, then!"
"- Seriously, why can't kids make their own costumes?"
"All you need is some construction paper and glue, that's all!"
- And our pride?
Are we so poor that we wrap kids in construction paper?
"Let's better pick who should be our ""queen of the fields!"""
- That's easy:
Look.
Kundan is just a friend.
I never thought about him like that.
"Mom, dad, at least don't fight tonight."
"Bunty, who would you prefer to stay with?"
- Katrina Kaif.
"Bunty, I am talking about the both of us"
I am divorcing your mother.
- That's a lie.
Actually I am divorcing him.
"- Very good, very good."
"You guys have fun, I am leaving."
Bunty.
Bunty.
Friends.
To make this celebration of a 33 year old mistake memorable.. ..I request Mr. Kundan Lal to sing a song in twin voices.
"Come, come."
Ladies and gentlemen.
I made this song for my dear friend.. ..Mala for her marriage with Kishen.
So can we change the mood now?
Clap.
"""Now you can do it like this."""
"""Take it to the left."
"Or you can do it like that."""
"""Shake it to the right all my ladies &amp;amp; my man and my men &amp;amp; my ladies."""
"""All my ladies and my man and my men and my ladies."""
"""You can do it like this."""
When my mom and dad didn't have any love story.. ..then what was the theme of the song?
"""Shake it to the right."""
Which song would suit such an unromantic couple?
How would both of them look singing together?
"""You can do it like this."
It's all a disgraceful lie.
She came into my office and tore off her clothes.
Who's to believe that?
I'm disappointed.
What you did was inadmissible.
I've worked here night and day for three years.
- I sacrificed my marriage.
- Your divorce changed you.
I was just congratulated on our sales.
Which you owe to colleagues like Ms Limmer.
Don't you get it?
Ms Limmer wants my job.
"You're paranoid, Mr Fuchs."
Now what?
The consequences are quite clear.
You want to fire me?
I'll take you to court.
I know of similar cases.
You don't stand a chance.
Who do you think you are?
I won't stand for this!
Leave my office at once.
What if he goes to court?
He'd be in more trouble.
"Brigitte, don't forget you stand to profit too."
Ms Limmer.
- Are you feeling better?
"- Yes, I'm all right."
"If you need anything, you can call me any time."
That's very kind.
Thank you.
I don't think Rex has earned his ham roll today.
Thank you.
Standby.
Just one camera is enough to entertain us.
The outfits for today are very extreme.
"For three members, their outfits match the song."
For the other three...
Like this.
Up and down like this...
I want to do that again.
Cut!
Great work.
The end!
Great job.
"""Coffee Shop"" MV is over."
"""Coffee Shop"" is over and ""Hurricane"" is over too. our PAClFlC ToUR in 4 cities of America is over."
We're heading back to Korea tomorrow. our trip in America is now over.
I have many mixed emotions.
It was a long time in the U.S.
I'm glad everything finished well.
"""Coffee Shop"" and ""Hurricane"" music videos will come out well."
I'm looking forward to them.
Great work.
It's really over.
2 weeks have come to an end.
We're done.
"But really, the last shoot was the grand finale."
We were filming in the rain. on the rooftop.
"Which makes me feel better though, to think"
I tried my hardest up to the very end.
All or our schedules in the states are completed.
My clothes are all wet.
But I'm still very happy we're done with everything in the U.S.
We're in New York. other members have to shoot but I finished my part in D.C. yesterday.
So Jong Up and I went shopping.
The jumbo screens assure me that this really is Times Square!
B.A.P has finally arrived at Times Square.
It's an honor.
It really is an honor.
I still can't believe it.
Times Square.
This is Time Square.
I've only seen it in pictures.
This is my first time here.
All this fanciness.
ls that a celebrity?
Who's that?
one two okay. one two.
The weather is awesome today.
The buildings around here are tall so usually this street gets less sunlight.
But today the sun's shining so much.
"(Very satisfied) Wow, good."
That dog looks happy too.
"Yo, New York City."
We're headed to the set feeling like we're VlP.
"Today, we're filming at MTV in Time Square."
We'll be customizing shoes and painting murals.
Time for some cultural activities.
It feels more like playing rather than working.
You know what I'm saying?
I'll be styling my own shoes.
I'll be making one-of-a-kind shoes.
This looks like a really famous shop. for street artists.
It seems many famous street artists have come through here.
I wanted to make my outfit or shoes with this printing.
The view is great.
When I earn a lot of money
It'd be nice to visit with family.
"There's a pool, a gym with treadmill, a spa,"
"A great view, and so many rooms."
Haven't you all been to places like this?
When I travel with family or with friends
I've been to places like these so I'm quite used to it.
How many rooms are there?
I'm used to this.
"Please be quiet, curly head."
What is Zelo's concept today?
How awesome.
"Zelo's concept is a Chopin, Mozart, Beethoven kind of feel."
The prime of music!
Not Rome...
"Zelo is to be a composer from Vienna, Austria."
He can't hear.
"He can't hear, but he's writing out what's in his head."
I don't think he can play the piano.
Why are you filming my feet?
I'm embarrassed...
Dae Hyun has sexy feet.
He's a man with sexy feet.
My feet turned ugly from dancing.
I have calluses.
- That's what's pretty.
- The trace of life!
It's beautiful.
My feet have gotten dauntless.
Zelo has flat fleet.
- I don't have flat feet.
"After about a week, you won't be able to notice the cut."
-Baek Eun Jo  -No Ri.
Thank you.
My parents... are coming up on an evening flight.
Uhmm..
They must have been very surprised.
The doctor complimented you.
He said your quick actions made the surgery easier.
"If you hadn't told me how,"
I wouldn't have been able to do anything
It's a type of obstruction to the intestines.
I had no idea.
I really... had no idea that such a scary thing could happen.
I will call my dad.
He must be worried.
Oh Ha Ni!
"Ah, my cellphone and my wallet... where did I leave it all?"
"I, really..."
How old am I that I'm already...
You know..
That rumor with Kyung Soo sunbae...
He explained everything to me already.
Thank you Oh Ha Ni.
I was afraid... that I might do something wrong.
"So, something might go wrong with Eun Jo."
Everything is alright now. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; It's the first time that I heard.. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;warm words from Baek Seung Jo. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Since my anxious feelings were all relieved... &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;My eyes and heart... &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I cried so much they nearly melted away.
Hello!
Hi Eun Jo.
Omo!
You made it today.
The flowers smells good.
It's Oh Ha Ni again??
There are so many careless drivers in the world.
I have seen many different sizes of fly.
"In North Africa, smaller fly than here."
"And Turkey, smaller fly than here."
But this size is same fly in Korea and in Japan and China.
So I feel very emotional.

You're taking away my girlfriend?
"If you do, I'm going to shoot you."
This is great.
-Look at that.
"-Oh, that's a legion of elephants."
I'm going to enjoy a real safari after not having one for a long time!
Huh?
Are you guys really going to shoot real elephants?
There was a passage behind the waterfall.
We can just say that we thought this place was also a part of the park.
Atom!
Don't cut in.
This is the place for perfect aim.
Pura!
Zora.
Good!
Zora!
I'm going to fight you!
"Here, Pura."
Now it's time to say goodbye.
Go ahead.
You can be happiest when you are with your kind.
I had no idea there was this kind of natural passage behind the waterfall.
I should have investigated it more thoroughly.
"I just didn't know about this passage, but Pura's mom was..."
She's beyond recovery now because of Zora.
"No, it's all good now, Doctor Hura."
"Ah, that's right!"
Let's build an ocean safari next time.
It will be a great item!
Cannibal whale this time?
Don't invite me.
Atom!
Dal-rae...
Yes sir?
When did you meet Ji-hwan?
Um...
It was during 2nd grade... over ten years already!
"Dal-rae, Can I ask you a favor?"
"Yes, of course."
Actually...
I thought of a novel seeing you and Ji-hwan
And?
Stories of you two may be helpful.
They're not that interesting.
"So why don't start? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;When he was young Ji-hwan was often ignored.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;He's now a rascal but then a quiet kid who'd fight a lot&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;so other kids avoided him a lot.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;As your teacher, I want to know&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;more about my loving students.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"

Did you see them?
The drawings all over.
You have runny nose.
"Here, wipe it off."
"Keep it, or throw it away."
Thanks.
Got something for you too.
It's not coming out...
Oh god.
Smells awful.
"Uninteresting, right?"
This is a great topic.
Became friends while removing scribbles.
But... who could that been?
Scribbling high up like that...
Dharamdas!
"Ma""am, not Dharamdas. l told you to call me DDT."
Where is your boss?
Fine!
Fine!
"I didn""t see boss going out."
"Which culprit are you searching for, sP?"
Who will be a bigger culprit than you?
You left me alone for 2 months!
Where did you disappear?
I and sister-in-law were waiting for you since a long time.
You should have peeped in your heart!
I see!
How was your journey?
- It was beautiful! open your suitcase and tell me what have you brought for me? open the suitcase!
And take whatever you like! - ls that so?
There are many things in this too! only saris in this!
I am sure this has something for me! only two suitcases?
"We didn""t get any time for shopping, Rajesh!"
"But since when did you take custom officer""s duty?"
You are searching it thoroughly.
I thought you must have brought many things for me.
"But I didn""t find anything in this. shekhar, I will leave now."
- No!
"Have tea! sorry, shekhar!"
I am on duty!
Nowadays you are so busy with your duty!
"What do I tell you, friend? lt""s all because of Tiger singh!"
"Bye, sister-in-law. see you, shekhar. shekhar.. hadn""t we brought 4 suitcases?"
"Yes, seema!"
I gave two suitcases to kaka.
Listen!
"Yes, I'd be doing them a favor."
I'd be doing good.
Yes.

It is my belief that hunger will soon become a serious concern.
"With your permission, my masters..."
"Yes, a craving I have!"
For taquitos and cheese dip!
I've heard legends of a taco... ...made entirely out of Dorito.
If it exists we will find it.
"Master, sir."
I heard Yoda talking about midichlorians.
I've been wondering... ...what are midichlorians?
It's herion.
"Come on, boy."
We have located the Jedi.
We have them right where we want them.
Good.
This is almost over.

"Then, we're all going out"
I have stuff to do at home I'm sorry
No exceptions this time
That was strong
I have to do the laundry and feed my dog
"That can all wait, can't it?"
My dog goes crazy if she misses a meal
"Then, let it go crazy"

That doesn't make any sense What's with you?
I don't want to go
You have to
- No - Why?
Not everyone likes to drink

Drink Coke instead!
How can I drink Coke with beer in front of me?
Looking good

"Which way do I go? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;If you go in that direction, you will die.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;You shouldn't go there!&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
In that case...
What if I go the other way?
"If I go here, will I live?"
I...
Then I would wake up and cry again.
I really couldn't go on.
"I swore to forget about Gil Dong, so that I could live."
What could I do? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;It's not like he went somewhere I could follow.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
I found myself being able to live each day.
Then someday I wouldn't even think about Gil Dong at all.
That's how I lived.
But you know...
I'm so dumb.
I forget sometimes that I'm not supposed to think about him.
"When that happens, my heart hurts really badly."
I can't go on!
I wish I'd just become really stupid.
I can't see you like this anymore.
Do you remember any big event twenty years ago in the fall?
"For example, a rich noblewomen running away with a daughter?"
- Twenty years ago?
"- Yes, the year the late king passed away."
How can we remember something that long ago?
This...!
This is Chunmyungdan.
Try it.
"Doctor Heo, please help us."
He's the son of the Interior Minister.
Please take him home for us.
We're short on staff.
Please?
The son of the Interior Minister?
He must be Gil Dong's older brother.
- I just want one more drink.
- Please be careful.

"If you hang up, I will resign his job.. .. and become a wayside astrologer."
You are not fit even for that.
O God of rains!
Till today I thought.. .. that only farmers pray to you.
But now even lovers are praying to you.
"Dont you have mercy, O God of rains!"
The moment we hung up there is thunder and lightning.
This means that there will be rain.
Hurray!
It is raining.
"Hey, stop."
She said that she will meet when it rains.. ..but did not tell when and where.
I am getting tense and cannot understand what to do.
It is me who should understand.
Why are you overacting?
Shut your mouth.
I know where to go.
Grandmother!
Did I not tell you?
The rain is here.
Yes I see that.
Leave me.
What is the use of holding my hands?
Go and hold the hands of that boy.
Where will you meet him?
You did not even decide on a place to meet.
I dont understand.
It is me who has to understand.
Not you.
I understood completely.
I will leave now.
Bye.
(intrigued) Oh.
There's the first one.
- (pulsating echo) - Ah.
- (pulsating echo) - No.
"No, I remember now."
"Oh, now he's gonna come."
"- (pulsating echo) - (gasps) Oh, my God."
It's thundering.
- (pulsating echo) - (whimpering)
- (faint static) - What is that?
Uh-oh.
Please don't be in here when I get out.
Is this it on the wall?
What is that?
- (Finebros) I don't know.
"- Do I go straight? - ♪ (jolting chord) ♪ - Oh, God!"
- (headphones clatter) - (high-pitched static)
- (pulsating echo) - (footsteps crunching)
- (claps) - (Finebros laugh)
My fault.
Messed up the microphone.
- At least I got one.
- (Finebros chuckle)
"I was about to quit, too, man. - ♪ (jolting chord) ♪ - Oh!"
What the (bleep)?
(high-pitched static)
"Am I going the wrong way, you guys?"
"I'm, like, shaking right now."
"I don't know if you can see it, but I'm kind of shaking."
I'm not liking Slender Man.
"I haven't even seen him, but I already don't like him."
Why does it have to be so dark?
"Of course, I got carried away a little bit after that."
No harm or nothing done.
It was just innocent.
We thought it was just normal innocent stuff.
"What about the music, speaking of the dance."
Who played music at that time around here?
That would have been
Jule Gillespie and Pat Bonner and
Walter McCauley.
"Maybe Robert Palmer, Edward's brother."
"Russell, one of the [?] guys or something."
There's a lot of people - a lot of them can make music
Family type stuff...
Jules - Mary's mother...
Mary can sing.
Mary Palmer.
If you can ever get her to sing.
"Richie Gillespie is a good singer, if you can ever get him to sing."
"He used to - twenty years ago him and Rich [?] could - you name it, they'd play it."
Richie'd sing as good as anybody you've ever heard.
"But Jules's wife, she could sing too."
She was a real good singer.
What kind of music?
Just the regular stuff that you hear on the tapes.
The country type or whatever you want to call it.
Were anybody left that actually did any step dance?
Mm-hmm.
The Dodie guys would just ... wife here a couple weeks ago...
Uncle Joe [?]
"Gallagher, and Uncle John he lived over where [?] is."
He was a big guy.
"Not quite like me, but big guy."
"Welcome, sir."
You can go to bed.
I will attend to my guest myself.
"Of course, sir."
Good night.
"Wow, this place is super."
You like it?
I can't believe it.
Cemre must be stupid to leave this place.
"Yeah, and she left for another stupid person."
She turned her back on me because of stupid Kuzey.
"""My daughter, Cemre..."""
"""... if you are reading this letter..."""
"""... that means I gave my last breath."""
"""And that I left this world with a great guilt of conscience."""
"""Last time we spoke you said you didn't want to see me again."""
"""You were rightfully angry at me."""
"""I didn't have much to say back then."
"As don't have now either."""
"""After all those years, I know it is too late to--"""
"Okay, I'll read it later."
Thank you for coming here.
- It was my job.
- You did your job successfully.
Kazım Bey...
"I don't know what he told you and in what degree, but... ..."
I have never asked anything from him... ... for neither myself nor my daughter.
- I know.
- As I told him back then as well... ...
I wanted to Cemre for myself.
And that's the best thing I've ever done.
"No money, nothing could match it."
Such a smarty!
Is that important?
This story should be... a mystery with a fabulous ending.
"Popular these days, you know."
For example...
"In reality, the one scribbling was an alien."
No wait... better make it an angel.
"Huh? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;The angel, helps an ignored kid to find his friend&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;by scribbling all over the street.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
Add the foreshadowing by showing a glimpse of a feather.
"And at the end, Voila!"
"The angel appears, angel!"
Oh my...
Stop pretending to be nice.
"How, can you smile like that in front of me!"
Stop there!
Okay... who can tell us what the problem is here?
"Come on, she's shaking."
Maybe she's got her phone on vibration mode.
"So awkward, even for the audiences."
Who are you?
Never seen you before.
Yes!
"A third-year Taekwondo major, my name is LEE Ji-hwan!"
"Heard that, as an acting teacher you are the best in the country"
So I dared to sneak into your class!
Such a dignity for someone sneaking in!
Sure.
But don't talk too much.
Quiet!
"Yes, thank you very much."

He is still a child.
His mind works like a child's mind right now.
"As a matter of fact, his mind doesn't work at all..."
I will take his mind in such a way that...
"And he is like this not because of his mind,  but because of electic shock and drugs..."
"Hey, pal..."
Let it go...
Come on...

For God's Sake...
I swear...
"Ok, Bahar Hanim, we go one day."

I mean... we don't want people to hear it.
"Just a minute Asil, my brother..."
"When Bahar Hanim visited Mustafa in the hospital,  didn't he have a fever and then went into coma?"
"If we take her there, maybe he will remember something."
Eh?
Isn't that possible?

"I family matter. &amp;gt; I'm sorry..&amp;gt; Okay, thanks."

And get out!
Returning today Rajesh!
"If I'm to know my boundaries again, I need to have a last time."
I'm not a fool.
I'll go back behind my boundaries after that.
"Young Master, why are you following me?"
I'm not following you.
I'm just walking.
But Yongmun is all the way over there!
I don't want to go there right now.
Have you run away?
Or are you in trouble with Madam Noh?
"Well, you're higher up than her, so I guess you won't get in trouble."
Did you have an argument with her?
Madam Noh cannot argue with me.
"You know, I was always curious, but how come you're higher than Madam Noh?"
You're younger and don't do much.
Why do you order her around like that?
What is the relationship between you and Madam Noh?
Madam Noh is like a mother to me.
"Who are you anyway, Young Master?"
I've known you for over a year.
But I don't know what you do.
I don't even know your name.
"Like you said, I've run away."
But I have nowhere to go.
"I don't do much, so I won't be missed."
Why don't you teach me how I should spend the day?
"If so, I'll tell you my name."
"First, my surname is Yi."
Young Master Yi?
I'm hungry.
Shall we go eat something?
"Great idea, Young Master Yi!"
Keep them under your pillow.
Just eat your fucking breakfast.
"If this happens again, I swear on my mother I'll beat you to hell."
"- It won't happen again, abi."
- Shut up.
Pour the teas.
Fucking idiot.
- Abi.
- What?
I'll wash clothes once the cleaning is done.
- Give me if your clothes need washing.
"- It's okay, young one."
I can paddle my own canoe.
But this is our tradition here.
It's my job.
I am not good with traditions.
Thank you.
Is this why your neck is thick?
Because you do things on your own?
I don't know if my neck is thick.
But my hand is heavy.
"Oo, tough guy."
Leave him be.
- You turned on the oven?
- It's on.
"Did you have to do this, I mean, as if you're racing Sami Bey."
You're making cookies for him.
- His father will be offended.
- It's not the same thing.
I want him to eat something I made with my own hands.
If your cooking improves until Kuzey gets out maybe we should open a pastry for you as well.
He won't be staying for too long in there.
"I'll tell you what, Chris: as long as you have that book in front of you, do me a favor, turn to a year outside of the 1900s, either into the 1800s or way into the 2000s -- that'll be a much greater challenge for me."
AB:

(Laughter)
"Good, thank you very much."
(Applause)
(Applause ends)
But I'd like to wrap things up now by alluding to something from earlier in the presentation.
There was a gentleman up here who had a 10-digit calculator.
"Where is he, would you stand up, 10-digit guy?"
"OK, stand up for me just for a second, so I can see where you are."
"You have a 10-digit calculator, sir, as well?"
"OK, what I'm going to try and do, is to square in my head a five-digit number requiring a 10-digit calculator."
"But to make my job more interesting for you, as well as for me,"
I'm going to run away...
"Are you crazy, Mahir?How will you escape from prison? no"
I'm running away from the hospital!
"Enough talking,Gentlemen!"
"Come on,Get back!"
Come on!
Take it easy.
Feride?Are you crying?
"This is due to Mahir, right?Now you cheer upAfter you've seen it, I know it..."
How can such a big lovefinished in a minute?Is this possible?
"Feride...listen to me,I know you're very angryat Mahir, but trust mewhen I tell youthat Mahir loves you!"
"Everything is explained,he did everythingto save his father..."
He did not intendhurt you... . trust methat he is a very good man.
"Maybe it's becausewe want to bevery good man, Bahar!"
Maybe he deceived usin fact we believe that he is good?How can we be sure?
Maybe he hidits darkness in the same mannerthat he hidhis real name?
He was shot in the street...no one knows who did it... he deals with the gangsters...
And above all he is accused of so manyillegal stuff!
"But, he said,it's all justto rescue his father!"
Feride
"You should have listened to him,certainly there is an explanationfor all."
I do not want to hearhis voice or seehis face ever...
Okay.
"As you wish,All right."
I'm going to bringsome water ..
"Ayten,It ""s me , Neždet!"
Are you okay?
"Ayten, you're very worried about me,are you okay?Why do not you answer?"
Get out!
Ayten
"Go I'm sick,go..."
I'll sleep hereif you do not open.
"- I left it in the hotel room. oh, you left it there?"
This is the point!
None
"I found out from my fan cafe, that they thought these were arm warmers."
"But guys, these aren't arm warmers."
I just put this mask on my wrist.
(Simple-minded)l didn't want to lose it.
I lose things pretty often...
So I try to always hang my belongings on my body.
- My camera - Did you shut the door?
of course you did.
Hi.
It's been 3 days in America.
- What are we filming today?
- We're filming for the MV.
"I want to live in a house like this one day. &amp;lt;""Coffee Shop"" MV First main character Dae Hyun&amp;gt;"
I'll have a wife and kids.
My wife will be cooking breakfast and I'll be playing with the kids.
"We'll eat delicious food together, and take a walk with our two puppies."
I'm glad the background looks nice.
At least I won't look tacky.
The place for my MV is the best.
The weather is fantastic.
How do I look?
It's me over flowers.
I can't really smell well because I'm sick.
But real flowers do smell good.
Do I get to rest now?
I was worried because I didn't get good sleep.
But the weather's so good it's very healing.
I'm done.
I took some pictures since I came to America.
You will die in my hands!
But I swore I wouldn't get involved with you again.
"I said leave me, leave!"
I don't use any opportunity .
I don't look at anyone's wife or girl either.
Put this in your goofball head.
Did you get me man?
EPlSODE 5 - Leave me !
What can you do man alone?
"Come on, do it!"
"Mira is my friend and whenever I want to be with her, i will be ."
Got it?
Now get out!
Don't dare to come here again!
What's going on here?
Nothing...
"I came to thank him for helping in the club, but... alas..."
I forgot that we don't talk the same language with our friend.
"It'm not at fault, but I'm sorry for disturbing you.Good night."
What did we talk with you Yaman?
This man came to my door.
What's his trouble with you?
"It's okay, nothing."
"- If you're right you will tell what happened, why do you keep quiet?"
We've solved it already .
There is nothing to tell.
"Come on Ender, anyway we have more important things to do, let's go and talk with Faruk."
Come dear...
Subtitles brought to you by Ebb and Tide Team @ Viki
Thank you.
"What is it ,dear Ender?"
"As soon as you heard ,did you also come to ask for your money?"
"It's not this, but it's your imagination."
It's a big difference.
[sighs]
Now do this again.
Again.
How do you feel now?
I don't know.
Playing stupid?
I'm not playing stupid!
I don't know the right answer.
"You see, ""I don't know,"" this is playing stupid."
You did something with your heel there.
It's very chance [indiscernible]
-No.
-No.
Okay.
"No, but your hair and your features go along with the feeling I had about you earlier."
I had a feeling I could be afraid of you.
And you're the type of person that seems
"like you demand so much respect, and you're...[sighs]"
Please tell me.
I demand so much respect.
Play this what you just saw.
"Well, you know how smart I am."
"I know more about psychology than you do, Gloria, so anything I say of course is right."
Can you say the same as Gloria?
Something similar as Gloria?
Or like the same as Gloria?
I demand respect because...
I don't know.
You don't know?
"No, I don't."
These people will be like this only.
What a big house this is?!
You have seen only the outside.
Now see the inside.
It will be great.
What is this?
"I am afraid of dogs, sir."
Thieves must be afraid of dogs.
Why should you be?
That is why I am afraid.
He is counting notes by the heap.
The boss is coming.
"Boss, this mans name is Kona Ranga Rao."
A good friend of mine.
He came to seek your help.
Dont be afraid.
A blood relation started between us.
Ask him.
"Sir, I tried various businesses in different parts of the state."
I also tried different precious stones.
"When I was that my fate would never change, I met you."
Ask him a loan.
"Sir, I need some financial assistance from you."
Uncle!
The God has granted the wish but the priest created hurdles.
Take this.
"Sir, you helped me as soon as I asked."
If you please visit my home for dinner.. ..
I will repay your kindness.
"Hey, why will he come to your house?"
Stay within your limits.
"Uncle, he made the request himself."
Come to the front door.
"Yes, I entered from the chimney, I'll exit from the door."
Let's do it.
Great.
Aleykum selam.
How is it going?
- (?) Kuzey Bey.
- Hands off.
Don't pounce at me like hound.
I'll tell you something though.
There's a security vulnerability on that building.
Looks like some people broke the cameras in the yard.
Especially the walls surrounding the guest mansion.
"Don't be so stingy, man."
Spend some money to get those fixed.
- Kuzey Bey.
"- Telling you, people could walk right into the mansions."
- Salamun aleyküm.
"- Aleykum selam, bro."
Mission accomplished?
"Great, let's go then."
Your people got worried mad about you.
They kept calling me.
"- Nah, they are used to it."
"- Well, I don't know."
"They gave me headaches, asking me where you went off to after the trial."
"Why does everyone who can't reach you, call me?"
I don't know if I am a phone operator or a missing person office.
"You are my accomplice, what else do you want to be?"
"- Always, bro."
Don't worry.
- Thanks.
From here it looks very small.
"But when you're in front of the statue, I hear you only see the body because it's too big."
That building there is where the 911 terror took place.
So they're rebuilding a new structure there.
"Come to think of it, what's that on the very top? on top of that building there's something like a fork-crane."
The person operating that - must be so scared.
- He must be very scared.
He must have more than one life or something.
I'm sad.
We're heading back to Korea the day after tomorrow.
I wanted to tour more before leaving.

"Everyone, can you hear me loud and clear?"
My son was supposed to be cleaning his room yesterday.
Really?
Then why did.. - Marry you?
"Yes, tell me, why did you marry me?"
Don't keep taunting me.

This servant.
Who can't even dream of doing any work!
Be thankful that you at least got him.
Stop it
What is this?
It took you 20 years to realize your dream.
To turn your hotel into Bollywood Caf.
For this?
So that you can utilize every nook and corner of this place to argue.
"For god sake, your staff laughs at you"
"'God, please show me a way to stop mom and dad's arguments forever.'"
"Why did you bring me here, Tanya?"
So that you can explain to my grandpa.. ..why you're allergic to marriage.
Didn't the government ignore this fact even though reports were made?
We have suffered great losses in this as well.
We did this under your instructions as well as for the good of the people.
Please overlook our involvement in Choi Chul Joo's death.
Then I will ask you one question.
Some people were blocking the arrival of the police.
Do you know who they were?
- Did such a thing happen?
- Were they involved with Yongmun?
Why would we block the police's arrival?
We sacrificed a great deal because the police arrived too late!
He can't be caught!
He'll be killed!
- I feel like I'm going to die with worry!
- How will we find him on a day like this?
Young Miss!
Young Miss!
Gomi!
It's me.
Let's go!
"Gomi, come to your senses!"
Gomi is acting strange again?
Gomi!

The police are headed this way.
We should get out of here.
I'll head them off.
You take care of Gomi.
- Follow him!
Run!
"- Yes, Sir!"
"First explosives, and now strange fellows."

"..how are you? ah, well welcome"
I'm so happy to see you again.
"And you still, you still moving."
"I'm trying to, trying to move."
"You're moving it, you're doing it."
You still got the moves.
It's all about movement.
Let's move.
"We're trying to get people up and dancing, dancing is a great way to lose a little weight, be healthy be healthy, be happy."
You are demonstrating it every day.
"I, I try to promote it every day."
I like to move.
"It doesn't matter how well you move, it's just moving."
You're good though.
"You're, you're a good mover."
"But, still I, I think maybe still better than your husband."
I hate to say it.
"I, I'm sure of that."
[laughing]
Yeah.
He tried to dispute it when he was here.
He's rural.
"Yeah, yeah."
[laughing]yeah.
I think we have proof.
Yeah
We do have proof.
"No, you're definitely a better mover."
"Ahm, well"
Absolutely.
"What do you mean by ""work"", Keung?"
You won't understand!
I'm doing it for love!
Tell me.
I've became a different person ever since I met her.
I've do whatever she ask me to.
She wanted me to find a job.
I found a job.
I've ask her to marry me and she promised!
"Unbelievable, isn't it?"
"You just love her big tits, don't you?"
You jealous?
"Hell, I'm jealous!"
"In the past, I would have boasted myself so much... not anymore!"
I've something for you...
Organic Contribute Form
What?
It's out of your mind?
Read it first!
Ms Lee gave it to me the other day.
She looked at me in my eyes and said...
"""Keung, for guys like you who are in this killing business..."""
"""...life may mean nothing."""
"""But by completing this form..."""
"""...you'll be able to do society some good."""
"""You'll be saving someone's life even after you're dead."""
"""By doing this, you'll make your life worth living."""
This Ms Lee whom Keung's talking about is a social worker.
God knows what she sees in Keung that made her love him.
It's just fuckingly incredible!
"Here she is, doing her endless research!"
"I'm afraid that uh... ...that you're going to have such a direct attack that uh, you're going to get me in the corner, and I'm afraid of that."
I want you to be more on my side.
"You said I'll get you in a corner, and you put your hand on your chest."
-Mm-hmm.
-Is this your corner?
"Well, it's like...yeah, it's...like I'm afraid."
You know.
Where would you like to go?
Can you describe the corner you'd like to go to?
Yeah.
Uh...it's back in a corner where...
I'm completely protected.
And you would be safe of me?
From me?
"Well, I know I wouldn't really, but it feels safe."
[overlapping]
But while you're in this corner you're perfectly safe now.
What would you do in that corner?
I'd just sit.
-Just sit?
-Yes.
How long would you sit?
"I don't know, but this is so funny you're saying this."
This reminds me of when I was a little girl.
"Every time I was afraid, I would feel better sitting in a corner."
Not panicky.
Okay.
Are you a little girl?
"Well, no...but it's the same feeling."
Are you a little girl?
This feeling reminds me of it.
Are you a little girl?
"Because well, it's very important!"
Come on...
We're going to Ankara.
"- Perihan, you get prepared, too."
- I'm not coming.
- What do you mean you're not coming?
We should be there as a family.
- I am not coming!
"I can't lie, looking in their eyes."
You go.
What are you waiting for!
Go!
And you go find out if it's that journalist who put it on the Internet.
"Go, we're doing all this for you."
It's all in vain...
It's too late.
Everyone will know it by tomorrow.
I don't know how we'll recover from this.
Make a call and sort out the tickets.
So that we depart as soon as we get to the airport.
And tell Perihan not to talk to them.
"If they know we're going, they might refuse us."
"""It's on the news and Internet... ... we've got to talk!"""
They are gone.
They ran away.
"""Münir Telci Law Office."
We can't answer your call right now.
"Please leave your message after the tone."""
"God damn you, Münir Telci."
This is ridiculous.
Throw dirt and hope it sticks.
"You've been doing that to the Yaşarans for years, I know."
The Lord's so lucky.
Look at the things He's getting.
"Earlier, people would keep it in a covered platter.. ..in front of Him."
But now they're feeding Him.
Let Him enjoy.
It's your fault.
"Mumbai just experienced a slight earthquake tremor.. ..of 3.5 Richter scale, which didn't cause.. ..any harm to life or property."
See.
Heard that?
But a shop in the flea market has collapsed.. ..which was closed at that time.
Must be Mohammad's shop.
According to our sources.. ..the shop was registered to Mr. Kanji Lalji Mehta.
"It's really surprising, because.. ..there are other old shops in this market which are still intact."
But Kanji Lalji Mehta's shop has been completely destroyed.
"This is Shweta Tiwari, with cameraman Vaibhav Mishra, ABP News."
"Sister, switch on ABP News quickly."
We saw.
Brother-in-law's shop is gone.
It's collapsed.
Pravin!
"- Calm down, father."
"No, sister."
Come there with the children.
I'm coming there with father and the others.
- Yes.
"Yes, we're coming."
We're coming.
The idols of Gods have gone underneath.
The shop is completely ruined
Doesn't seem like there was ever a shop here.
What are you saying?
We had goods worth 25 lakhs.
It's insufficient as much as I would thank you.
"869 01:11:20,359 --&amp;gt; 01:11:24,475 That day when police took me, I begged so much to Mr. Selim saying 870 01:11:24,475 --&amp;gt; 01:11:28,437 I entrust you my son."
"By God, God bless you!"
"871 01:11:28,500 --&amp;gt; 01:11:31,500 You're really good people!"

"877 01:11:55,400 --&amp;gt; 01:11:59,400 He can gain the possibility for a 100% scholarship 878 01:11:59,700 --&amp;gt; 01:12:03,000 This is it!"
This is it!
This is it man!
"879 01:12:03,010 --&amp;gt; 01:12:06,749 But if he isn't involved in trouble again... 880 01:12:07,600 --&amp;gt; 01:12:08,800 What do you say?"
"881 01:12:08,800 --&amp;gt; 01:12:13,800 What can he say?"
He says God!
Oh I thank you my gracious God!
"882 01:12:13,800 --&amp;gt; 01:12:15,300 Yaman."
"883 01:12:15,400 --&amp;gt; 01:12:19,508 What can I say, of course it's great, but only if it's 100% scholarship, 884 01:12:19,508 --&amp;gt; 01:12:20,971 if I succeed in exam 885 01:12:21,000 --&amp;gt; 01:12:23,758 You will succeed dot com dot tr (.com.tr)."
That's all!
"886 01:12:23,800 --&amp;gt; 01:12:27,500 As school is close to here you can continue staying here now 887 01:12:27,600 --&amp;gt; 01:12:30,400 No, I will come and go."
"888 01:12:31,200 --&amp;gt; 01:12:35,400 Here is the possibility for you."
Work and win!
Ok?
"889 01:12:35,500 --&amp;gt; 01:12:37,200 Okay..?"
-Okay.
"890 01:12:37,400 --&amp;gt; 01:12:42,100 My God, what kindness did I do for you that you brought these people in front of my son?"
"891 01:12:42,200 --&amp;gt; 01:12:45,500 Ah thanks God!"
Thanks God!
"892 01:12:46,800 --&amp;gt; 01:12:49,600 God bless you..."
"893 01:13:11,000 --&amp;gt; 01:13:15,100 Everything is ok, right?"
There is nothing to be taken or given.
"894 01:13:15,300 --&amp;gt; 01:13:18,400 This time you beat the rap Mr. Faruk 895 01:13:18,422 --&amp;gt; 01:13:23,704 but we won't be so tolerant with you next time."
"896 01:13:25,200 --&amp;gt; 01:13:28,200 There won't be a next time."
"897 01:13:40,200 --&amp;gt; 01:13:43,485 Wow, did you dress?"
I will get prepared right away.
Admit Rajesh in the hospital.
"Boss, where is Jaggu?"
- I have killed him.
And you saved this enemy?
Have you decided to kill your men? - shut up!
The one who locks horn with Tiger singh.. he will be killed.
Do you know war has started in lndia?
This is the golden chance to become rich.
"Gold""s price is going to increase four times. so we will return to lndia today itself. come on."
"To save lndia, donate generously for defence fund."
"Today lndia needs gold desperately. kaka sir, we too need gold desperately."
"Mr. Anwar, come."
- Greetings. come.
"Have a seat. kaka sir, luckily there is a war."
And war is a good chance to make ourselves rich.
And our country is ready to pay any price for gold.
"That""s the misfortune, Mr. Anwar."
I am telling the truth.
I would have given you the gold.
But what to do?
"I don""t have the gold. kaka sir!"
You will get the gold.
Fix the deal with them.
Mr. Anwar!
We have gold worth 7 crores.
What price do you quote?
I am ready to give double the price! - okay!
"But we need opium, cocaine, marijuana."
Where are the goods to be delivered?
Near Lakhaidi island.
Bring the gold.
And take your goods.
"See you later, L.A."
We're going to San Francisco.
"See you again, L.A."
We just arrived in San Francisco.
"Before MV filming, we're going to San Francisco hamburgers."
"Tigger here, Tigger there."
"Lately, fans have been sending a lot of Tiggers."
We have so many Tiggers at home.
"Tigger staring at me here, Tigger staring at me there."
I'm freaked out.
They look like they're alive.
It looks like they're alive and staring at me.
oh my gosh!
This street is called Union.
The weather's kind of chilly here too.
None
It's a different feeling from L.A.
San Francisco feels a little more antique.
"Very vintage, and each building has its own character."
lf I were to choose between the two cities
I'd pick San Francisco because it's more put-together.
"L.A. is nice too though, it's very casual."
I wish my neighborhood were San Francisco.
This place has a different aura to it.
They're in the same country but they feel different.
"It's a city that goes well with our song ""Coffee Shop"" too."
Just a little bit ago there wasn't this much sunlight.
Thank goodness the sun came out.
Zelo is filming right now.
It's a relief the sun's shining brightly.
I have a feeling today's shoot will be a good one.
I'm done.
- Is that so?
- I'm sorry.
It must have been precious to you.
"No, it's alright."
"It was used to save lives, so I'm sure its owner would have been glad too."
But the frame should still be there.
I should go find it.
At this hour?
You should go when it's light.
That's alright.
I'll be going now.
You're really as impetuous as he said you were.
He?
Do I know that person?
Everyone's gone now.
We should go too.
"Gil Dong, do you want to wear this and go to the brothel for a while?"
- Shall we?
- No one will recognize us if we wear this!
You're right.
I haven't been to the brothel in a long time!
I am filled with past memories!
- Then I'll wear the black.
- Go ahead.
"I look great, don't I?"
"Are you sure you'll be alright, half-balls?"
You may be ready for the brothel yet.
Let's just go back.
How do I look?
Let's just wear this to scare the kids.
- You handsome fellow!
"- Hey, Sir Moonlight Black Hat!"
My legs. . .I cannot climb a mountain.
Can't my legs be cured?
"Ofcourse dear, your legs will get cured."
You have me.
Why do you think I drive the rickshaw?
I'll collect lots of money.
I'll get you treated by the best doctor in the world.
"You will walk, run, walk in step with the world."
Can't you see?
Are you blind?
Who did you call blind?
Me?
"You are blind, your father is blind. . . your whole family is blind."
Why are you looking there and talking?
I am here.
"Wherever you may be, for me, you are here."
I'll thrash you !
"I'm sorry sister, did I hurt you?"
"- That's a pole, not a lady."
"I know it is not a lady, it is a pole."
You mind your own business.
What's wrong with the municipality?
They put up poles everywhere.
It's quite a huge pole - Are you blind?
"I am not a pole, I am a woman."
Woman?
"I'm sorry sister, I made a mistake Forgive me."
I think he is mad too.
Someone help me cross the road.
- Who is this?
I am blind.
Help me cross the road.
We activate the protocol she signed before the marriage.
"Yes, exactly..."
All her obligations will be put in effect.
"If she wants to divorce, she has to pay me all the compensation written in the contract."
Let's see if she can divorce me now.
He will be even more hostile towards you now.
"He should thank God, that he still breathes."
Or I know what I would do to him.
"Okay, come..."
We have a lot to tell each other.
"Wait, wait..."
"Uhm, well..."
... could you turn your back to me?
- Why?
- Just do it will you?
Kuzey.
Don't lose it again.
I won't.

"Around Harrison, dusty workers smoked beneath a dusty blue Putzmeister crane."
I am very happy.
I have invested 14 crores in the movie.
If you had not brought her I would have been doomed.
Take these 10 lakhs.
I dont need 10 lakhs.
Only three lakhs is enough.
"Oh, you do not seem to belong to this age."
He is saying no to money.
I need to send this money urgently to Vizag.
Can you make any arrangements please?
When he is requesting us why do you stare with an open mouth?
Move now.
I will have it done.
Are you looking for Venkat?
- He is upstairs.
He is taking money from the producer for bringing you back.
He must have taken five or 10.. lakhs not thousands.
This is true.
I swear by my mother.
Dont try to cheat me anymore father.
You told me that he threw the ring down.. ..and I stayed away from him believing you.
Now you are telling me that he took money.
Even if he took money they would be the strong reason for it.
I will believe only Venkat and not you.
Why are you backing him?
Do you know how much trouble I took to make you.. ..a heroine?
Will you now go away with him?
What will happen to the movie?
Come with me.
Wait.
Leave her.
I left her.
SPEAKER 12:
"Take a cab, or drive in a car if I'm by myself."
SPEAKER 11:
Try to park my car close to door openings.
SPEAKER 8:
"And I just try to have a plan in advance, like where I'm going to be parking in relation to walking around campus."
SPEAKER 13:
I know where all the blue lights are on campus.
SPEAKER 2:
Like to try to make a mental note of where all the
little blue light box thingies were.
SPEAKER 14:
I'm just aware of my surroundings.
SPEAKER 15:
I'm really aware of my surroundings.
SPEAKER 8:
"I'm not talking, I'm not texting."
SPEAKER 15:
Look at who's behind me.
I don't like people walking behind me.
SPEAKER 2:
"Like if I'm walking by a shop window, I'll look in the window to see if there's a reflection of someone behind me."
SPEAKER 15:
"Because I pay attention to who's walking around me and behind me, especially at night."
SPEAKER 16:
Make sure I have my keys all out and ready for me to get into the house.
SPEAKER 17:
Don't talk to strange adults that you normally don't see around campus.
SPEAKER 11:
You never talk to strangers or guys or take rides or certain things like that.
SPEAKER 17:
I lock my doors.
"Ohh there is bazaar today, I forgot!"
If we enter we can't get out.
You go down on the right!
On the right from here!
"You come also, if you want."
"- No, I will wait in the car, you go!"
Don't hurry !
Good afternoon!
I wanted to move my registration
First let me find your registration here.
"You know how devoted I am sister. but really, i can' t endure Kenan's trouble anymore..."
"What can I say, you're right.- I gave him many opportunities, you know it.. but it's a must to break up."
He lost me.
Don't feel yourself guilty.
It's his choice..
I wrote a letter and send it to him.I told him everything was needed...
Did he ask me when he got into trouble?
Yaman was also angry with this.
"""How can you do this when the guy is in jail?"""
Do you talk with Yaman?
He calls sometimes to ask about you.
I wish you stayed with Yaman aunt!
You wouldn't be apart and your life would be better too.
My life can't be better.
My condemnation is until death.
I will be at ease when I close my eyes.
"Sister, who is Turunc Nadir?"
What? &amp;gt; Turunc Nadir
O don't know...
Who is it?
I heard uncle Hasan and Kenan fighting once.
Kenan threatened uncle Hasan with him.
That's the slight catch.
The job's in New Zealand.
- What?
"- Look, I know it's a big deal and I don't have to decide anything yet."
I really want to discuss it with all the family.
It's a bit of a shock for us all but your dad's not going to do anything we're not happy with.
"Oh, Dad, you should totally go."
What an opportunity.
Yes.
One less parent to deal with.
If Dad goes to New Zealand I can easily get around Mum and have my dream party.
"Now, I just need a plan to show Robbie I'm a natural born snogger."
"So, I've figured out what I've got that Slaggy Lindsay doesn't."
Hair on the back of your legs?
- The Angus advantage.
- What?
Get in!
"Inside, now!"
You will wait for the judge to sentence you.
The prison warden is coming now.
Whoever tries to escape will end up in solitary confinement.
"Don't you know that, Nazif Kara?"
"Why did you try to escape, old man?"
Running to your wife &amp;amp; daughter?!
Tsk Tsk Tsk...
Sit down now!
What happened Kibarim?
I don't know.
"I went out, they pointed the gun at me and caught me."
Who is the rat that told them?
Nejdet wasn't waiting for you outside?
That idiot!
"Find out what the favor she asked the official, and make sure it gets done."
I can't have another man have a flower that I can't have.
What's going on?
"The people you asked to help you, they came looking for you."
Really?
Sir!
Sir!
She's nowhere to be found!
She's disappeared!
Disappearing to where?
That doesn't make any sense!
"If she fell to here, she couldn't even manage herself properly."
"Now, are you aware of who you are?"
Who are you?
Don't you remember me?
We have seen each other in the palace grounds.
Don't worry.
You'll be safe.
I'm Seol Hye...
I was a colleague of your brother.
Brother Chun-Soo asked you to take care of me?
"Yes, that's right."
"After these events, he himself came to see me."
I think it will be difficult for Dong-Joo.
I'm sorry for delivering such news.
Forgive me for making such a hard request.
No.
I'm so grateful that you've come to me for help.
"If she's his sister, she's like my sister."
"Now, what can I do to help?"
Everything you need is in here.
"If Dong-Yi doesn't make it outside the city, then help that child stay alive."
Look at those dorms you've got!
Look at all those lawns!
Plumbing!
Television!
Gas cooking!
Greenhouses!
Flower pots!
Activities!
Children.
"You are ""masters of this camp."""
You are!
"What is required of you, my friends?"
- Dis-cip-line!
- I expressly forbade swimming to the island.
But Inochkin ignored the rules and did it anyway.
- They all probably have whooping-cough there!
- No they don't!
"- Quiet, third troop."
"- Try to be more like the second troop, will you?"
Who can guarantee now that Inochkin isn't infected?
Who?
"And it's not the first infraction from him, either!"
On his first day here he started fighting with sticks!
And after him everyone started doing it.
Even girls!
"At night, under his blanket, he lit a flashlight and started reading a book!"
"And everyone else started, too!"
And today he swam to the island!
"What now, is everyone going to swim to the island, too?"
What next?
Do we start jumping across the river?
And that's not all!
Don't tell the kids.
"Nick, who I found yesterday,  kissing a woman passionately in the street..."
He later claimed that woman was his wife!
[laughter]
Here's to the future.
Drugs... sex... divorce...
Death!
Who'd want to live anywhere else?
Here's to us.
[clink]
Try me again and I promise you  it'll be more fun this time.
"- Hey, everybody!"
Welcome to the Atheist Experience.
We're live.
"It is July 15th, 2012."
"Two days after Friday 13th, and one day after Saturday the 14th, and three days after Thursday the 13th, and they're all equally important."
I'm Matt Dillahunty.
Joining me this week is Don Baker.
Welcome.

"This is a live call in television program out of Austin, Texas."
We'll have the number up for you shortly.
"The announcement stuff has kind of been sidelined, and we're going to go ahead and let Don get started on his talk."
"How are you, by the way?"
- I'm doing good.
"I went to a holy place, believe it or not."
"- Holy to you, or holy to somebody else?"
It's as close as atheists have to a holy place.
I went to a great science museum.
"I went to the American Museum of Natural Science in New York City, where the Hayden Planetarium is."
"I didn't see Neil deGrasse Tyson there, but took in a great planetarium show."
Fire Alarm!
Look at you...
"Now that I'm sick, You seem to study harder and don't get into trouble."
I think I'm getting better because of you.
Really...
"Then Mom, can you come in front of our school?"
School?
Why?
You know how mothers direct traffic by the school.
Can you?
Sure.
I wish I were sick instead of you.
"If you ever say that again, you're not my son."
My baby is sick.
"Please, please let me be sick instead of him."
-Why do you make women cry?
- Huh?
"Oh, you saw it?"
"I didn't make her cry, kiddo."
"By the way, what's with your long face?"
Does your girlfriend want to break up?
"Or, you want to break up, but you're having trouble saying it?"
You're too young to be making that kind of face.
"When you get old, you'll have plenty of chances to be sad."
"Mister, what do you do anyway?"
Me?
"To keep the one I love,"
I make other couples break up.
What's that supposed to mean?
You wouldn't understand...
Here.
"Take this, in case you need it later."
Is it him?
I thought you guys split.
I sent him a message that I was in the hospital.
"You really like him, don't you?"
I don't know why I'm like this...
Wow this room is warm.
Wait.
I'm sorry about last time.
"Damn, look at your wounds."
"I told myself...that this is the last time so if you have something to say, please say it."
The last time?
Then why don't we do it for the last time before we go on our way?
Don't worry.
I can be careful so you won't get hurt.
Like this....
I went to an inn in the country and the woman next doorways screaming like crazy.
- I cracked the door to listen to her.
- Not interesting.
Not interesting?
Then I'll tell you another story.
Let's just do it once.
"A long time ago, I was going up the mountain..."
A woman...
Don't call me again.
"Fine, we don't have to see each other again."
Let's do it for the last time.
Come on!
Fine.
Do it.
Then do it.
Okay.

Doing as I'm told.What else could I do?
"As you said, we delayed the abortion.We'll do it tomorrow."
As if I don't have enough to deal with...
"But I am telling you, Münir.When this is done... ..."
I'll be done with this womanno matter how much money you offer me.
"Okay, okay."
I got it.
When is your trial?
"Okay, call me when it's over though."
You too.
"Who are you?Who are you, God damned man!?"
"- Stop yelling at midnight!- That bastard bought you as well, didn't he?"
God damn it!
You are Münir's man.God damn you!
And I thought... how that was the same body as the one that had... held me so many times before.
And... we didn't say a word.
They took him away again.
I remember I cried because they'd taken away from me the only thing that gave me hope.
"In 1982,"
I came here... to Tierra del Fuego.
I opened this storage room... and I... tried to forget.
"But... the doctors had nothing to do with that, right?"
"Yes, there were... military doctors making calculations."
They... measured the voltage people could take from the cattle prod.
"In other words, they measured the amount of pain a human being could take without the heart stopping."
It isn't here.
Come here.
You're alive!
You're alive!
Let my daughter go!
Let her go!
Let her go or I'll kill you!
I said let her go or I'll kill you!
Put that knife down!
- Put it down!
- Please let her go.
It's okay.
- Please don't take her.
- Where are the others?
Who?.
Please don't take her.
Let's get out of here.
Please don't take her.
"Let her go, you bastard!"
"It's okay, honey."
You'll be okay.
"I mean, I agree, but... aren't you supposed to be out, like, trying to decapitate someone..."
-with your lacrosse stick or something ?
"-Oh, sure."
Sure.
"You know, I know what people think."
"It's like,"
"""Oz, he's just this kick-ass lacrosse player."""
"You know, I also play football, by the way, but that's, like,"
"- that's not all that I am, you know ?"
"- Of course, I didn't--"
"I mean, it really bothers me when people try to pigeonhole me like that."
You ?
You think I don't get that ?
"God, it's like just because I don't get drunk and barf every weekend... that people say, ""Oh, look."
"There's this Goody Two-Shoes choirgirl priss."""
Yeah.
"So, like, what else do you do ?"
"Well, the same things you do,"
Iike hang out with friends and stuff.
- Why ?
What do you think I do ?
"- Oh, l--"
I just realized that I don't know anything about you.
- I was interested.
"- Oh, well, what do you want to know ?"
"You know, stuff... about you."
All right.
"Mom, I'm home !"
[ Chattering ]
[ Moaning ]
[ Moaning Continues ]
"Oh, yeah."
-That's impossible!
-How come?
That's the surveillance panel.
It can detect even a little bird.
Then how did the elephant enter?
We will investigate it later.
Later isn't enough.
Another similar accident will...
"Anyhow, you should hurry and finish rebuilding Zora."
I can't take it anymore!
"Doctor Hura, so you don't mind getting wild animals killed?"
"If I didn't invent animal robots, more wild animals would have been killed by humans!"
Help!
"Wow, Zora moved."
Help!
Help!
My gosh.
I can't do anything now.
It's beyond curbs.
Atom is the only one who can take care of this situation.
"Pura, not ready yet?"
It's evening already.
"Pura, do you understand?"
"I don't want Doctor Ochanomizu to worry, so I'm going to go tell him what happened and come back."
So please wait here for a moment.
I'll soon be back.
"You are late, Atom."
Sorry?
So Doctor Ochanomizu already went out with Doctor Hura to find me?
This is great.
Where would Doctor Ochanomizu be?
"Ah, that's..."
Please leave this place.
Shailu is mine.
Bhadranna!?
I can die ten times for Shailu.
Can you die once?
"I am ready, what about you?...Are you ready?"
"Uncle, why are you supporting him?"
I called you from vizag to convince him not to support him.
Why are you being hasty?
I will talk to him.
Why do you interact with that rowdy?
What is the necessity that you want the girl he loves?
He wants the girl I love.
Have you seen how arrogantly he is speaking?
Do one thing.
Leave this city and come to Vizag with me.
I will not come.
Dont talk like that.
Why do you want to stay here.. ..and have a dispute with that rowdy.
Why do you try to scare me?
What if he is a rowdy?
What is his specialty?
I am also a rowdy.. .. if anyone tries to interferes in my matter.
Beat me.
I kicked my mother when I was a kid.
She never beat me.
I kicked my father when I have grown up.
He never beat me.
You shouldnt have leaved him brother.
You must have killed him there itself.
What is the need for that?
He only announced that.. ..he can die ten times for her.
"Not to mention, your Jedi friends caused an unspeakable amount of damage!"
The bill must be paid!
"Oo, I have an idea, how about we DON'T pay the bill?"
"Qui Gon, you old piece of shit!"
How are you?
"What's the matter, old buddy?"
You face is crustier than a patch of wookie butt fur!
Gross!
"Whoah, you look terrible"
"Maybe you need a Viagra prescription... ...to turn on your lightsaber, you know what I mean?"
This kid doesn't.
"Seriously though, are you losing your edge or what?"
You're absorbing more abuse than a hutt tampon!
(sorry)
The Qui Gon I knew would have been kicking my teeth in right now.
"Hey, I'm just kidding, it's all in good fun."
Put 'er there!
(laughs)
"Alright now get out of here, you old creep."
Why don't you take this kid with you?
I know you're into that.
"Seriously though, kid, watch out for that guy."
He uh... he has a past.
Look at him.
Such a... bumbling creature.
So foolish.
He's made of so much skin.
I will make him part of us.
Yes!
I will wear his face!
Look how much the others hate him!
Almost as if they wish he was gone.
"And only after that call themselves lndian! very good, dear!"
I am glad to see your patriotism!
Ms. seema.. your patriotism has cast a spell on me. can I expect to have one more meeting with you?
"lf it won""t happen, then it will be my bad luck."
"You have come so close, that staying apart is out of the question."
Thanks a lot.
"Mr. Diwan, give me the permission to leave."
"Thank you so much for coming, Mr. Rajesh."
Thank you very much for the nice food.
Yes!
"- Hello! sP Rajesh please! sorry, sir! sP sir is not here!"
There is a gift for him.
You can take it. keep a close watch on all the trucks.. ..passing through Dharampar road.
"What""s your name?"
- A patriot!
Hello!
Today I have nabbed you!
"- What happened, constable?"
You will find out soon! search the truck! okay! - come on!
Why is this truck empty?
"lt""s not a crime to drive empty truck, constable!"
"lt""s a crime!"
This truck is used to deliver goods.
"And it""s a crime to drive empty truck."
"Henceforth I shouldn""t see it empty!"
Got it?
"Let""s go!"
"When I signaled you to stop, why didn""t you stop?"
I am sorry.
"I didn""t see the signal. okay!"
We will find out soon! constables! search the truck and frisk them! sure! sure!
Hey!
All I fucking cared about... ...was my reputation amongst the firms of England.
"I mean, you've heard all the stories about Millwall, yeah?"
"Last match I went to was Millwall, West Ham."
We're talking a good 10 years ago.
"I mean, we'd been waiting for this match all year."
At Millwall.
Yeah.
Stepping into their ground.
Completely outnumbered.
We were fucking wired from the start.
"Now, Tommy Hatcher... ...he was their main man back then."
He used to bring his 12-year-old boy to the grounds.
Tommy Jr.
"Always banging on how he brought his kid up, you know, to be like a little pit bull."
"Well, we lost that match."
Three-nil.
And those Millwall cunts started laughing at us.
And I just fucking snapped.
"I mean, I couldn't let it lie, you know?"
"So I assembled all our troops, and we hunted them down."
I saw that little lad go down.
Tommy!
No!
And I saw his skull get crushed under the boots of the GSE.
I never went to another match after that.
And I left the Major behind.
And that's when I met your sister.
She was my angel.
She really saved me.
Showed me a new life.
Helped me forget all this bollocks.
And she swore... ...she'd leave me if I ever returned to it.
Your bun has so much red bean paste!
Just give me one bite.
At least give me some red bean paste!
"Choose the cup, choose the cup!"
Double your money!
Double your money!
Choose the right cup!
One bet!
It's this one.
- How did you know?
- I have quick eyes.
- Well done!
Good job!
- That's enough.
Don't I look funny?
Funny!
Funny!
"This one must have married this one, and given birth to this one!"
Look at how plump they are!
The police has to know I'm alright so that they'll stop chasing him.
- Who are you?
- Your father has asked us to find you.
The Councilor will soon be here to fetch you.
Tell the police to stop chasing the thieves as I am alright.
You were kidnapped by the thugs that attacked the police.
Are you sure you're alright?
Don't you understand that my father wanted you to find me before the police so that there would be no rumors spread?
"If you tell Eun Hye that I know about Hong Gil Dong, you will not go unpunished!"
Eun Hye!
- Father!
- Are you alright?
- I'm alright.
It says Amy's biosim just finished.

Before the test begins we're going to determine hand and leg preferences.
Ready?
Can you kick the ball to me?
Ready?
I'm going to bounce it to you.
Now use one hand and bounce it back.
"Oh, nice job!"
The first thing we're going to do is use this pencil and I want you to take this car and draw a line and stay inside the row all the way down to the house.
Take your time and stay inside the row.
OK for our next activity
For this one we're going to take this paper and you see this line?
Fold it on the line just like this.
Can you do this one?
OK and now a big line right down the middle.
OK.
Do you see this square?
I want you to use this red pencil and draw the same shape in this square down here.
Just like that one.
I'll never meet Radha!
Never!
I just asked for Radha's hand in-marriage.
And not asked for her in alms.
Kishan!
"- See, how he humiliated us."
"At least have some shame, you insolent!"
"No, father!"
Don't do that.
He has given many tests of love.
He's really a noble man.
"If this will not happen, no body will trust love."
We've spent every year in tears.
Only... only for your prestige.
"Father, I'm begging for my love."
Give my love to me.
And you... is this the reward you gave me for my love?
Is this the reward of my love?
Tell me... tell me.
- Father!
Tell me...
Tell her that her father is dead.
He's dead.

So plus 5.
"5h plus 5, and that is choice C."
"And if you try it out with these points, it should all work."
"OK, next problem."
Let me see.
I think this cutting and pasting works out well.
I think I have time for at least two more.
"OK, let me clear this."
Clear this one right here.
Let me paste it in.
"OK, it says, some ordered pairs for a linear function of x are given in the table below."
It's kind of like the last one.
Which of the following equations was used to generate the table above?
Well we could do the same thing we did the last time.
"We could say OK, this is going to have some relation."
You know y is equal to mx plus b.
It's going to be a line and this is the slope y-intercept form.
And they tell us it's the linear function.
So that's why we can immediately say that's going to be a line.
There's no x squared or anything like that.
So a good place to start is just with the slope.
So slope is equal to change in y over change in x.
So let's see.
"When x goes from 1 to 3, what does y go for."
It goes from 1 to 7.
So change in x is equal to 3 minus 1 or just 2.
And what's change in y?
7 minus 1.
"So that is equal to 6 over-- oh, no."
Sorry.
Change in x was 3 minus 1.
Sorry about that.

"I think, did the job."
"And just, uh, all in a day's work."
[chiming faintly]
"I'm very, very grateful for these people that have treated me like..."
Just treated me so well.

Before any settlement, Naperville was home to Native American tribes. In 1641, the first Caucasian contact with Native Americans in Illinois. They were kicked out by the Potawami tribe that kicked out the Ilinewek tribe whom they had made contact with Native Americans. Naper arrived with his friends and family to what would be known as Napers Settlement. He was known for many things in Naperville as it was incorporated as a community in 1857. The county is named after the river, DuPage County. These churches were built by the early families of Naperville such as the Hobsons, Napers, and Scotts as they built seven churches. Naperville became an important stop from Chicago and Ottawa. By 1832, there were 180 residents living in Naperville whom they had built sawmills, stores, the Pre-Emption Hotel, and gristmills. Du-Page County was established in 1839 and Naperville became the county seat. Eight businesses in Naperville contributed to the building of the Southwest Plank Road. This was completed in 1851 and connected Chicago, Naperville, and Oswego."
Naperville grew and grew for the next century as stone quarries flushed providing building materials for Chicago after the horrible fire of 1871. The Stenger Brewery shipped beer across the region. The Kroehler Manufacturing Company became Naperville’s largest employer which shipped furniture by rail into Chicago and many dominant markets.
"Naperville became a city in 1890 with a population of 2,629 from the 1900s census. It grew to 12,933 residents by 1960. Between 1890 and 1920, residents began to receive basic city services like water, sewers, electricity, and landlines."

Origin of name.
"Then name ""Sasan"" was popular with the Indo-Parthian people. The origin of the name is not entirely known. David Neil MacKenzie and V.A. Livshits says that the name comes from Old Iranian, translating to *""Sāsāna"" (""defeating enemy""). It is also the name of a Zoroastrian deity."
Biography.
"Farn-Sasan went into the Indo-Parthian throne sometime in 210. They don't know what king was before him. They think it may have been Pacores. Farn-Sasan is not mentioned in any books. He is only known because of his coins. These coins all say ""Farn-Sasan, son of Adur-Sasan, grandson of Tirdat, son of the grandson of Sanabares, the King of Kings."" Farn-Sasan tried to make himself notable by his rule by showing that he was related to his great-grandfather, Sanabares, a famous Indo-Parthian king. He calls the King of Kings Sanabares the King of Kings. Farn-Sasan also called himself the King of Kings. This happened a lot in Achaemenid and Parthian rulers."
Adur-Sasan and Tirdat were never a ruler. This means that Farn-Sasan was probably from a cadet branch in the dynasty.
"On the front side of the coins, he is seen with a cap. On the other side, a fire altar is shown. The altar has writing around it. Farn-Sasan is the only king that is known to have a fire altar on coins that is also from Sakastan. Around the same time, Ardashir I () made coins with a fire-altar that looked like Farn-Sasan's coins. Historians are not sure if Farn-Sasan copied the fire altar or if Ardashir I copied the fire altar off of Farn-Sasan."
"Farn-Sasan and Sasanian Ardashir I share a similar name. Because of this and the fact that both of their coin has a fire altar, historians think Sasanians and Indo-Parthians may have had common ancestry. Historians say that Farn-Sasan and Sasanian Ardashir I were rivals. Both wanted to be the King of Kings. The Iranologist Khodadad Rezakhani argues that Farn-Sasan was a superior of Ardashir I. He said that Ardashir I was only able to say that he was the King of Kings after he defeated Farn-Sasan in 226 and ended Indo-Parthian rule."

Battle of Guam (1944)
"The Second Battle of Guam (July 21 — August 10, 1944) was the capture of Guam by the United States from Japanese control. Guam was a U.S. territory (in the Mariana Islands). The battle was during the Pacific campaign of World War II."
Background.
Guam is the largest island of the Marianas. It is 30 miles (48 km) long and 9 miles (14 km) wide. It had been a United States island since its capture from Spain in 1898.
"It was captured by the Japanese on December 10, 1941. This was after the Attack on Pearl Harbor. It was not as fortified as the other Mariana Islands, such as Saipan."
The Allied plan for the invasion of the Marianas was for heavy bombing by planes and then bombing by battleships.
"Guam was chosen as a target because it was big enough to be a base for the next attacks on the Philippines, Taiwan and the Ryukyu Islands. The harbor at Apra could take the largest ships. The two airfields were big enough for B-29 Superfortress bombers."
"The invasion of Saipan was planned for June 15, 1944, with landings on Guam planned for June 18."
A large Japanese carrier attack and heavy fighting in Saipan led to the invasion of Guam being delayed for a month.
Battle.
"Guam is surrounded by reefs, cliffs, and heavy waves. This makes Guam hard to attack."
"On July 21, the Americans landed on both sides on the western side of Guam. The 3rd Marine Division landed at 08:28. The 1st Provisional Marine Brigade landed to the south. Japanese artillery sank 20 Landing Ships. The Americans had many dead and wounded."
By 09:00 men and tanks were on both beaches. The 77th Infantry Division had to walk through the shallow water. Japanese guns fired at them.
"By nightfall the Americans controlled the beachs about 2,000 meters deep. Japanese attacks were made throughout the first few days."
"Lieutenant General Takeshi Takashina was killed on July 28, and Lieutenant General Hideyoshi Obata took over the command of the defenders."
Supply was very difficult for the Americans in the first days of the battle.
"The attacks against the American beaches, as well as the violent fighting, had tired out the Japanese. At the start of August they were running out of food and ammunition and had only a few tanks left."
Obata moved to the mountainous central and northern part of the island. He could not get any more supplies or get new troops because of American control of the sea and air around Guam.

William Bradford (Mayflower passenger)
"William Bradford (15901657) was a passenger on the ""Mayflower"" in 1620. He travelled to the New World to live in religious freedom. He became the second Governor of Plymouth Colony and served for over 30 years. Bradford kept a journal of the history of the early life in Plymouth Colony. It is called ""Of Plymouth Plantation""."
Childhood.

"Bradford's father died was he was one year old. When he was four years old he was sent to live with his grandfather. Two years later, his grandfather died and he returned to live with his mother and stepfather. A year later, in 1597, his mother died. Bradford became an orphan at age 7. He was sent to live with two uncles."
His uncles wanted Bradford to help on the farm but Bradford was ill and was not able to work. Bradford started to read many books. One of the books was the Bible. This may be where he started learning of a religion that was different from the church of England.
When Bradford was 12 years old he went with a friend to hear the pastor Richard Clyfton. Clyfton was a minister who did not believe in the Church of England. Bradford believed in Clyfton’s words. His uncles told him not to go to that church but he went anyway.
During one meeting he became friends with William Brewster. Brewster did not live far away and Bradford borrowed books from him about the new church.
King James I of England started to punish the people who did not follow the Church of England. They were called Separatists. By 1607 many members of the Separatists were arrested. Brewster was made to pay a fine for going to the church. Some members were put into prison and others were watched night and day. The people also learned that other Separatists in London had been put into prison and left to starve to death.

"In the end of this speech, King is talking about a story from the Old Testament. Moses was the leader of the Israelites (the people of Israel). The Israelites followed Moses because they thought he would lead them to a Promised Land. In this Promised Land, they could live in peace."
"However, before the Israelites got to the Promised Land, God spoke to Moses. God said he would let Moses see the Promised Land with his eyes. However, God would not let Moses enter the Promised Land. The Bible says:"
"Soon after this, Moses died. Joshua replaced him as leader, and led the people of Israel into the Promised Land."
"King is saying that like Moses, he has ""been to the mountaintop"" and seen the Promised Land a society where black people have peace and equal rights. He knows that he may not get to this Promised Land with them, because he might die first. However, he tells his listeners that, like the people of Israel, African-Americans as a people will get to the Promised Land."

And all above is azure bright — Australia!

"Where laughing corn luxuriant grows,"
Land of the myrtle and the rose;
On hill and plain the clust'ring vine
"Is gushing out with purple wine,"
And cups are quaffed to thee and thine — Australia!
There is a land where treasures shine
Deep in the dark unfathom'd mine
For worshippers at Mammon's shrine;

Devil's food cake
"Devil's food cake is an old fashioned chocolate cake made of chocolate or cocoa and baking powder. It is moist, soft, rich, and very good for keeping. It is a light-textured chocolate layer-type cake with a deep reddish brown color. The cake gets this bright red color from the large amount of red food dye used in the preparation. Devil's food cake is usually thought of in terms of dark chocolate, but originally it was red. Today cooks, using modern processed cocoa, sometimes add a touch of red food coloring to bring back the authentic color."

Black-legged dart frog
"The black-legged dart frog (""Phyllobates bicolor""), also known as the bicolored dart frog or Neari in Choco, is the second most toxic of the wild poison dart frogs. It lives in Colombia. Scientists have seen it between 400 and 1500 meters above sea level."
Appearance.
"The adult male frog is 32.1-39.5 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 35.7-42.7 mm. It has large disks on its toes for climbing. Young frogs have stripes on their sides. In some groups of this frog, the stripes go away when the frog is an adult. In other places, the adult frogs keep their stripes."
Poison.
Human beings who live where the frog lives have used the frog to poison arrows. The human can touch the arrow to the frog's back without killing it. Or the human can kill and heat the frog's body.
The poison in the frog's skin is a chemical called batrachotoxin. The frog gets the poison from the ants and other insects that it eats. So frogs kept as pets do not have poison.
Threats.
There are fewer of these frogs than there were. Scientisis think this could be because human beings change the places where the frog lives. Humans turn the forests into forms and take the trees for lumber. Human beings also catch these frogs to sell as pets.

History.
"The city was founded by Henry Flagler as a community to house the servants working in the two grand hotels on the neighboring island of Palm Beach, across Lake Worth. The original spelling was ""Westpalmbeach"", but it was feared that the 13-letter word would be a bad omen for the new community. On November 5, 1894, 78 people met at the ""Calaboose"" (the first jail and police station located at Clematis St. and Poinsettia, now Dixie Hwy.) and passed the motion to incorporate the Town of West Palm Beach in what was then Dade County (now Miami-Dade County). This made West Palm Beach the oldest incorporated municipality in the county and in South Florida. The town council quickly addressed the building codes and the tents and shanties were replaced by brick, brick veneer, and stone buildings. The city grew rapidly in the 1920s as part of the Florida land boom. Many of the city's landmark structures and old neighborhoods were built during this period."
"Originally, Flagler intended for his Florida East Coast Railway to end in West Palm but after the area experienced a deep freeze, he chose to extend the railroad to Miami instead."
"In the 1960s, Palm Beach County's first enclosed shopping mall, the Palm Beach Mall, and an indoor arena were completed. They led to a short revival for the city, but crime continued to be a serious problem and by the early 1990s there were not many people living or working in downtown. Since the 1990s, developments such as CityPlace and renovation of 1920s architecture on Clematis Street have brought people back to downtown for the entertainment and shopping district."

Taxi
"A taxi (taxicab or cab in the United States) is a car, or other vehicle which is used for public transport. People use them to get to where they want to go. This means there are no stops in between where they get on and where they get off. Many big cities have taxis."
"In most other types of public transport, such as a bus, tram, or train, the rider does not get to choose the locations where they want to get picked up or dropped off. These vehicles often take certain roads or follow a very specific route. Because of this, they usually do not stop exactly where people want to go."
"Riding a taxi is a lot like having your own car, but you don't drive it. You only tell the taxi driver where you want to go and he or she will take you there. How much you pay for the ride, in most cases, depends on how far you are going from where you get on. It is common for the price for a taxi ride to be more expensive than other forms of transport."
History.
"The first taxi-type system started in Paris and London in the early 17th century. These were carts pulled by (carriages) and could be hired. The monarchies that ruled these cities controlled the rules. In the 19th century, Hansom cabs were mostly used because of their higher level of safety."

Royal Thai General System of Transcription
"The Royal Thai General System of Transcription (RTGS) is the official system used to write Thai words into the Latin alphabet, or romanization. Thai has certain vowel and consonant sounds and other phonemic features that do not exist in English. This means that saying a syllable with a different tone or vowel length can make a completely different word. For these reasons, romanization in Thai presented many challenges. The RTGS only uses the 26 letters in the ISO standard Latin alphabet to spell Thai words. It is used on all documents that require words to be written in the Latin alphabet, including road signs, maps, applications, etc. However, it has many problems. The system does not show tones or vowel length, both of which are phonemic features of Thai. It also does not tell some of the consonant sounds apart."

"in the north end of the state, you've got that little narrow strip of West Virginia going up between Ohio and Pennsylvania"
Uh-huh.
Right at the base of that northern peninsula is my hometown.
Uh-huh
"Well, that's, yeah, that's interesting."
"So it's really up north in the country, really, ."
"Yeah,"
I guess so.
yeah.
"It's,"
"well, um, my parents' house is like three miles south of where the Mason-Dixon Line would have hit the Ohio River had it continued that far."
Gosh.
I see.
"So,"
It's pretty nice country up there?
"Oh, it's beautiful."
"Hills, or what?"
"Uh, well, from my neck of the woods, it's hilly."
Uh-huh.
"Um, you know, uh, maybe three hundred, four hundred feet elevation, uh,  type variations from the valleys up to the hills, the hilltops."
Uh-huh
Is it farmland?
"Um, not a lot of farmland there."
"Mostly it's, uh,"
"I mean, you know, there's, you know, individuals with their own, own uh, growing their own food."
"Uh, most of the agriculture, it's more in the way of, uh, sheep and cattle."
"Oh, yes."
"And even that's, you know, small time mostly."
Sure.
"Uh, the biggest chunk of what's going on there is, is, uh, industry."
Uh-huh.
It's coal mines and chemical plants and power plants.
"Designed,"
"so we could pour concrete and support it with a, a nice firm four by four posts."
"And, uh and then the rest of it I just did."
Yeah.
"A, a contractor friend helped me, uh, with some of the, uh, foundation work"
"but, uh, it was pretty,"
it was about four or five hundred square feet.
The same size as the addition that I just put on
so.
Yeah.
"That's pretty, that's a good size deck."
Yeah.
"So, yeah."
"That's,"
"It's, uh, not that expensive."
"I think it cost me three dollars a square foot and, uh, you know, no less than that."
Yeah.
"That's not,"
"cost me about five hundred dollars, six hundred dollars all together."
"Yeah,"
that's good.
That's not bad at all.
"Didn't  have to,"
Yeah.
the wood may
"it got surprising as to the fact that how much wood is, you know."
"To get, to get good lumber it costs,"
"I don't know about Dallas, but even in this little town, it's, it's not cheap at all."
I was surprised.
"I'd be surprised if it wasn't, uh, cheaper where you are."
It's probably more there.
"Well, yeah."
"but it was, it was saying don't do STAR TREK management style."
"And they were referring to, you know, Captain Kirk,"
"every time he left the Enterprise, everything went to hell."
Oh.
And nothing got righted until he got back up on the ship
"Right,"
"so he kind of was a cowboy type, too."
Uh-huh
Made all the decisions
"but, uh, Jean Luke does more of a, a, committee type of management."
"Uh-huh,"
"yeah,"
"uh, it's definitely a lot better A lot more realistic really."
What other movies have you seen?
"Uh, saw THE ADDAMS FAMILY last week."
"Oh, how was that?"
It was pretty good.
"Uh, there were a few things different than the old series,"
"but on the, on the whole, it was pretty similar. And, a lot of fun."
"Lots of little funny spots, huh."
"Oh, yeah,"
yeah.
Did they have Thing
"and,"
"Oh, yes,"
"in fact, Thing has a big, much bigger role than he does in the series."
"I mean, you know, there is lots of areas where Thing saves the day."
Really?
And he runs around a lot.
"How did,"
I've always wondered how he gets around.
"Uh, you know, just finger hopping."
I find it to be a good out
and I still enjoy the marching band
"and I still enjoy, uh, singing in the choir"
"so,"
Do you sing at choir at your church?
"Yes,"
I do.
Yeah.
"Yes,"
I do.
"That's,"
"in fact, that's about the only musical thing that I still do is sing in the choir."
Yeah.
"I tried out for choir when I was, think, in the seventh grade"
and they wouldn't let me in.
"So, I never tried again."
"Well, I sing in the choir,"
"I do know if they want me to or not,"
but at least I do sing in it
"Yeah,"
That's pretty good.
"Well,"
I never really learned the music or anything.
"I never learned,"
I got right to where I was figuring out where all the keys were on the piano
and that's about when I quit.
"I was at,"
"I actually went to the University of Texas at one time thinking that I would, be a musician."
I wanted to be a high school band director.
Yeah.
"But after one semester of that, I said no, no,"
this isn't for me.
"and he said take it home and bring it back if you want to,"
and I never did.
I just went back and signed the papers
and I knew nothing about my car when I got it.
Nothing.
I didn't know how anything worked.
"Well, so it was a completely new experience for you."
And I'm sure you enjoyed every minute of it.
Yeah.
"And I've had it,"
it's almost three years actually.
"And I've, I still love it."
I put the top down everywhere I go.
I timed it when I first got it
and it took twenty I mean twenty seconds
"and so, I figured there was nowhere I was to late to go that I didn't have twenty more seconds."
Right.
So.
"And, and you couldn't get,"
how long does it take to go back up? About the same time.
"Twenty seconds,"
yeah.
That's all it takes.
"I mean, it's just a button, that's it."
"You  release it right at the top,"
"Yeah,"
so
so you don't have to  get out or anything.
"So you won't get,"
Yeah
and twenty seconds you probably won't get caught in anything too substantial.
"Well I did, actually."
Yeah.
"You know something must be wrong as far as, uh, not just the teaching techniques but just motivation, within, within the schools themselves."
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
"excuse me just a minute, uh,"
Uh-huh.
I'm on the other line Karen.
I'm sorry.
"Oh, it's okay."
Okay.
"Uh, she, uh,"
"yeah,"
"well the, the results,"
"I, I hear what you're, you're saying about the results."
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, it's, what to do about it I guess is the, the big thing."
Yeah.
"I'm, I'm in a kind of an interesting situation in that my, my wife teaches school here in Plano."
Uh-huh.
"And, I know that, uh, the results that they get out of the system sometime is, is certainly not you know, up to what the effort they put into it, you know,"
"I've seen that for years,"
yeah.
"Right,"
"and, I know, uh,"
"I work around, you know a lot of teachers"
"and I I understand how, uh, supportive they are of their students and how excited they are,"
Uh-huh.
"but some how, I don't think the students are getting excited."
"Yeah,"
"I've often wondered if it doesn't come back to the, the home environment."
"Oh, yes"
"definitely,"
"wait a minute,"
we bought one in ninety.
"We've got three cars, of all things."
Uh-huh.
"So, uh, probably we'll be in at least a midsize, four door sedan."
Okay.
What kind do you have now?
"Uh, we have a, a Mazda nine twenty nine and a Ford Crown Victoria and a little two seater C R X."
"Oh, okay."
"Uh, it's rather difficult to, to project what kind of, uh,"
"we'd, look, always look into, uh, consumer reports to see what kind of, uh, report, or, uh, repair records that the various cars have"
Uh-huh.
"and then, of course, we look into the prices."
Yeah.
"And, uh, uh, we're not adverse to buying along in the summer when, when the cars could get to be discounted"
"because we keep, we've begun to keep them, uh, a longer period of time."
"Uh, I traded off an eighty-two Oldsmobile for the eighty-nine Mazda."
"Oh, uh-huh."
"So, uh,"
And did you find that you like the foreign cars better than the domestic?
"Uh, yeah,"
yeah.
"We, we've had thirty some odd cars in our married life,"
"and, uh, we, we've had a good many foreign cars."
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, they, they, uh,"
"I've been extremely,"
we've had three Mazdas.
We've been extremely pleased with our Mazdas.
"Oh, really?"
Yeah.
"We've always bought American made cars, mostly Oldsmobiles."
"I, I've been working,"
"we're going to have a baby this summer,"
and I'm not going to work anymore.
"Oh, how exciting."
Yeah.
"So hopefully, I think I'll enjoy cooking more, when I don't have to work all day."
I don't like to come home and stand in the kitchen and spend an hour fixing something and then have to clean it up
"and by then it's eight thirty or nine o'clock at night,"
so.
Yeah.
"Well I usually start about six and, an, and cook and then eat at seven. I mean, cook at five and eat at six, rather."
Yeah.
"Eat at six, yeah."
"Yeah,"
"and, uh, my family and I, we're a sit down together family."
"Oh, that's good."
"Uh, yeah,"
I don't like the run in and out part.
Yeah.
"And I like to be able to sit down after school and have them talk with me an, and my husband about what's happened"
"and, I think I, that was ingrained in me during my family time at home."
"Yeah,"
that's neat.
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, you know we could learn to talk about things"
and I think that's good.
"Yeah,"
that really is.
It keeps the family in touch with what's going on with each other.
Yeah.
"I think,"
Right now we eat in front of the T V
"Oh, yeah."
They get burnt off.
"They, they really do,"
Uh-huh.
and you have to be very careful to make sure you keep everything watered.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"Well, and that makes it bad too, because, uh, when more, with water being at a premium."
"I know our aunt in California,"
"they, they have really been rationed on their water."
"And it makes it real hard to have a yard or, uh, or anything like that, a their garden, their farms."
"Their farmers, I guess, are hurting because of that also."
Yeah.
"Well, my parents are now in San Diego,"
"and, and they've got pebbles in their yard because they can't, almost nobody there has, has lawns."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Well, they are not allowed to water,"
so what do you do?
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Uh, it is very, it is very rough on them"
"so,"
Uh-huh.
"Actually I think, I think it is pretty moderate here in Dallas."
"Because the, the Summers are extremely hot."
Uh-huh.
"But your humidity is different though than ours I think,"
"and it makes a, a bit of a difference, too."
"Um, what is your humidity like?"
"Oh, I don't know."
I think our humidity is higher normally than what it is in Texas.
"Uh, it seems to me, from what I've been able to find out."
"Yeah,"
good.
That's considered a pretty good program.
"It's nice and small, which means, you know, if you don't get the class this semester, then you've got to wait or three or four you know, anywhere from two to four semesters to get,  it again."
Huh
"But, uh, it's worth it once you get it."
"Well, yes,"
that's good.
"And probably a good, uh, student teacher ratio and things."
"Oh, yeah,"
yeah.
Yeah
Most the class are pretty small.
Good.
That works out real well.
"Well, I, I was wondering what, if you all were to get a pet, like if you were to move into an apartment"
"or a house somewhere, what would you get?"
"Uh, well, um, first off we'd probably wind up with a, a cat or maybe a puppy."
Uh-huh.
"I, I, I'm partial towards the larger dogs."
Uh-huh.
"Um, our last, we've, we've had a couple of cats before we moved on campus."
Uh-huh.
"Uh, had a hamster or two,"
"and they, they got,  to be a lot of fun."
A hamster.
"Oh, yeah."
"Uh, it's amazing how much character,"
Okay.
Your family have reunions on a regular basis?
"Probably, once every five years."
"and then slowly but surely starts to creep up when they start to take lessons,"
but it's well worth it and everything.
"Yeah,"
"uh, yeah,"
I think it'll be neat.
"Be a, be a great experience really."
You still there?
"Okay,"
I thought I was cut off there.
"You know, I don't have much to say about drug testing."
"No,"
I can't think of anything else to say about that either.
So you've done this ten times?
Yeah.
Did you get the booklet on how to get the gifts and all?
"No,"
"I don't work for T I,"
so I get cash.
"Oh, okay."
I didn't know what they were going to do.
"They sent us a little booklet,"
"I just got it a week or so ago saying, you know, so many calls will be something a prize and everything."
Right.
Well that great.
Well what kind of cash?
I've forgotten what they going to do.
Hm.
Was it five dollars a call?
"Yeah,"
five dollars a call.
"Well, hope they follow through and everything."
Well technically we're not supposed to talk about the phone calls while we're on them
"it's,"
the lines in there were just perfect.
"I mean, it was classic TREK."
"Now, does the old STAR TREK guys meet the new guys?"
"No,"
huh-uh.
"No,"
it's just the old guys still.
"Yeah,"
it was just a rumor that that would happen this time.
"However, the rumor is, is that it will happen next, happen next time"
"so,"
"You know, that I read in PEOPLE or somewhere, no, it was U S A TODAY"
Uh-huh.
that they said they weren't going to do anymore.
That was it.
Uh-huh.
"But,"
"Yeah,"
"uh, except that the rumor is, is that they still might,"
but it may not include the entire crew
and it will be a next generation meets this generation
Huh.
"So,"
"I'm not sure what the difference in light years between the new generation and the, the old guys was."
I think it's a hundred years.
Huh.
Somewhere in that range.
"Considering that Spock was on an, uh, you know, couple weeks ago and that the, the very first episode of NEXT GENERATION, they had McCoy."
"Oh, that's right."
Is that right?
He was a doctor still?
"You know, not so much at what the schools are teaching, but what they let the kids get away with."
"Um, uh-huh."
"You know, they, they see most, uh,"
"they're, they're quite upset about the, uh, the disruptive influence of school."
"Most of them would say, you know, those people should be removed from the school system."
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
"And in Japan they would be, you know."
Right.
"But, uh, here again, you get back into a political thing, where, uh,"
Yeah
"there's, there's,"
right.
"There's definitely too much leeway as far as,"
Uh-huh.
"I mean, I've only been out of, I've been out of college only two years,"
Uh-huh.
and you were saying that you don't appreciate education until you get out
"and I, I already, you know, I really didn't, I really don't see myself going back to school or anything,"
"but, I appreciate more what I had."
Uh-huh.
"And I had all these classes and all this knowledge and this big library across the street from my dorm,"
"Yeah,"
were you at Baylor?
and I just didn't take as much advantage of it as I should have.
"Yeah,"
did you go to Baylor?
"No,"
"I went to U T at Austin,"
uh-huh.
"Oh, oh, okay."
"I'm, uh,"
"I, I was pretty fortunate this Christmas"
"I didn't get in debt,"
so.
"Oh, that's good."
"I'm taking like, uh, sewing lessons to try to learn how to sew better than what I can"
Uh-huh.
so I won't have to go out and buy the ready-made clothes anymore.
"Oh, uh-huh."
It's so rare
you hear anybody doing that any longer
I know.
"I even bought myself a Surgery , you know,"
and I just love it.
I haven't learned everything to do on it yet
but I figure that will help me save you know.
Yeah.
"My, uh, roommate does sew some"
"and, and, uh, she hasn't sewed anything in a long time"
"but I, I'm sure that she could pick it up again."
My mother always sewed.
She tried to teach me when I was young but not interested
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"Well, see, some people are, some aren't"
"because  I have some sisters, I have three sisters"
Yeah.
and none of those are really interested in sewing.
Yeah.
"But that's a real good way to save money, though by doing that."
"Yeah,"
"and then I can also, you know, do some crafts and sell those at garage sales."
"Uh-huh,"
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, I know exactly what you mean."
"We are fortunate or, uh, we are on a, where we are we get flooded, it floods below us behind us."
Uh-huh.
"But we are, uh, we are high enough that our house itself we never, you know, have had any problem like that."
"Oh, well, that is fortunate."
Yeah.
It is an old farm house
"and, uh, we really like it here."
Uh-huh.
"Well, I, I like it, I like it here."
"Uh, I, I grew up here."
I have lived other places
"and, and, but I, I did grow up here"
Uh-huh.
and this is very much home for me.
Uh-huh.
"And,"
It is nice down there.
"I, I, I liked it when we visited there."
I hope you visited during the winter.
Uh-huh.
"One of my, one of my theories is that you always go to warm places during the winter"
"and you go to cold, cool places, that, well, I go to cool places during the Summer if I can anyway."
Right.
Right.
That is the best time to go.
Yeah.
"and usually it has been when we have gone, it has been nice."
"It has been hot,"
"but it is, it is hot to me in the wintertime down there."
"Oh, sure."
"Yeah,"
do you?
"Yes,"
that is great.
"Yeah,"
it's fun.
"And then there's a new one that started out that I've caught a couple of times called GOOD AND EVIL, I think."
"Oh, I heard they just canceled that."
"Oh, really?"
I read in today's paper they just canceled that show.
It is a real different one.
"It's, uh, it's, it's different."
I guess I watch it more out of the uniqueness of it and the time that it comes on more than the fact that I have to see it.
"But,"
"Have you seen the show, it's, it's new this year, called HOME FRONT?"
"No,"
I haven't watched that.
"Oh, it's, it's really good."
"It's, uh, I think it's on like Tuesday nights from ten to eleven"
Uh-huh.
and it's set in post World War Two times
and it's about how the servicemen come home and readjust to civilian life here and the changes everyone's going through.
It's really interesting.
"Oh, yeah."
It's kind of like a a nighttime soap opera type thing.
Sounds neat.
"It is, it's a good, it's really well written."
Yeah.
"Is that on, what what station?"
"Uh, I don't even know, to tell you the truth"
"Oh, okay."
What other shows do you like?
"Yeah,"
I drink beer.
"have you noticed that, um, that a lot of the, um, a lot of ..."
"Yeah,"
whiskey is in liters.
Yes.
"And, and the next,"
"yeah,"
"point seven five liters and then liters and then one point seven five liters,"
yeah.
"It's like a fifth, like fifths of whiskey I thought was always kind of strange."
Yeah.
What's a fifth of whiskey?
Yeah.
"I, I always wondered about that myself."
It was a marketing ploy.
"And, and they had quarts at the same time though."
Yeah.
"But the idea was, is that by, with five fifths, um, they could, uh, they could, uh, they could sell five"
"and, and, um, it was simply a ploy to, to get people, you know to buy, to buy more for,"
Yeah.
"it's, uh, I find that interesting."
It's ...
"But it's like, you know, the, the, the, the soda and this kind of things coming in one liter bottles"
Liters.
"and, um, I, I think it's kind of generational."
Yeah.
"It, it's, like I say, I work in a machine shop"
"and, uh, everything's still inches."
"Everything's still fractions of inches, or or tenths  or thousandths, or, or ..."
Yeah.
"It's, it's hard to think  though."
"Well, I know my folks live, uh, in Arizona there,"
"and, uh, you know, they just grow rocks"
Right.
"So. I know I was in, uh, Houston when I was working for a company once,"
"and we were taking care of lawns out there,"
"and, uh, that particular year they had just tons of rain, you know,"
it was raining continuously.
Uh-huh.
"And then, I know with all that moisture, a lot of the lawns get a lot of disease problems."
"Yes,"
that's true.
"Yeah,"
"Houston is a lot, um, a lot wetter than, than Dallas, Dallas area,"
"that's where Plano is,"
"and, um, and just humidity you know, just all the time, it's an awfully lot more humid."
Uh-huh.
"Are, are you, uh, able to get, uh, sometimes a double crops of, of certain things in your garden?"
"Yes,"
"uh-huh,"
I think people do.
Yeah.
"I don't have a vegetable garden,"
"haven't for, I guess I never have here, actually,"
"but, um, but, yes,"
"uh-huh,"
"we have Neil Sperry talks on the radio,"
Okay.
So what do you guys having up there?
"I haven't been up there since, oh, Lord, forty-eight, I guess"
Forty-eight.
That's a long time. Uh.
"Well, no,"
Yeah.
"I was very surprised that did do a slapstick movie, because that's, uh, not really the way comedies are right now"
Uh-huh.
"you know, all the comedies are more like jokes and, you know, gags and stuff like that"
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
there's not as much slapstick anymore.
"Well, I guess it was a, uh, a very successful movie financially,"
so we may see more slapstick.
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
"well, that's true,"
it's very cheap to make a slapstick movie.
"Yeah,"
"it is, it is,"
"and I guess you don't have to, but, you know, if you look at oh,"
have you ever seen any of the movies?
Excuse me?
The French movies that .
"No,"
"not really,"
"the last movie I saw I guess, uh, was, uh, uh, the one about the French, the Frenchman that leaves and comes back, and he's someone different."
"Um, he's, uh,"
"well, it's about a man, uh, that, uh, leaves his home and comes back to his wife,"
and his wife's all excited
"but the guy that comes back is not her original husband,"
"but, um. O'Gear um, I'm sure you've heard of it,"
Um.
"it was a very famous, uh, popular movie."
"Norman Gray,"
Norman Gear.
"No,"
I know .
"I mean, jeez if, if the judge was doing it himself, without any checks and balances  whose to say."
Yeah.
"It,"
there would be much more of that
Yeah
no doubt.
Are you involved in the legal system at all?
No.
"But I .  I tend to follow it just to, just to know what's going on."
Okay.
"Yeah,"
yeah.
I've got some friends that are lawyers
so.
"Yeah,"
I do too
so.
One of them just got his law degree.
"But, uh, to tell you the truth, I'm not real familiar with, uh, the system of jurisprudence the way it is right now."
No.
I really haven't studied it in depth.
Yeah.
"I know a little more about civil cases when, than criminal cases. Which is,"
Yeah.
"it's more in how you present it versus, you know, who's right."
I'm sure of it.
"Because a lot of those things, it's all, it's in, it's largely a matter of viewpoint. And who can argue their case better."
Yep.
"Uh, it's kind of weird."
"I don't know,"
you I always think about watching the PEOPLE'S COURT or something. And how weird those cases get.
And when he retires I'm retiring.
"Well, as soon as I get my quarters in, I'm, retiring period,"
Uh-huh.
"that's it,"
Yeah.
"you know, no more"
"Well, but, the,"
"did you, did you go to Florida in a van?"
As though
Uh-huh
"And we wanted to travel,"
"well, that was really nice traveling"
"but you know, I like to know more, I mean, hear about more people that have things like that you know?"
Yeah.
"And see what they think of them,"

"And this was with the air conditioner on and, and you know four people with, with luggage,"
Yeah.
"They don't get, you know,"
Huh-uh.
"and that,"
plus
and then we had a car expense like that same week.
"One of the cars died, you know."
All of this adds up
and that for savings really comes in handy.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I can see that.
"I can that,"

"What happens if something happens to a car, you know."
Right.
"Oh, well, nothing will happen."
Oh.

what type of things would you fix if you're having company come over?
"Well, I have a really great one that I make in the summertime because it's cool"

It's pretty much dumping things in and stirring.
Uh-huh.
And I like that.
"Uh, the only thing you have to do is cook the rice that goes in, in it"
"and then I, you're supposed to do chicken,"

Uh-huh.

we pretty much use them for emergency type things like transmission fell out on our car

Sales I find are a pain.
Yeah.
"I've, I've gotten, I've gotten a lot more away from, from credit cards,"

"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
"Well, it sounds good, you know."
"Like I said, it sounds like you're, you've really got it under control."
"I, I admire you for having, having that mind set for not, not even getting, you know, past the thirty days,"

"Right,"
uh-huh.
"you can do this,"
"you can do that,"
Uh-huh.
we couldn't do that then.
"And my cousins and I go, well why couldn't you"
"Yeah,"
"that's, that's why I say I feel, I feel really lucky right now, because I'm not married and because I don't have children."
"I'm out of school,"
"I'm twenty-three,"
"I can do anything I want to do, anything."
Uh-huh.
"And so, I mean even some days I'm looking for another job now,"
"but, and I get so depressed because, not because I can't find a job, but because I can't figure out what I want to do."
"And that's normal,"
"I mean,  I think that's the world today."
"And yeah,"
and I
"and I'm lucky though, because not a lot of people can sit there and go gee, I don't know what to do."
"I have so  you know,"
Right
that's
"not a lot of people,"
Yeah.
but it's depressing too.

"""There Goes Our Love Again"", the first official single from the album, was released on 5 August 2013. The song was played on the air for the first time on 18 June 2013, exclusively on Zane Lowe's BBC Radio 1 show."
"In July 2013, White Lies played three intimate shows at Hoxton Square Bar & Kitchen in London, celebrating the five-year anniversary of the band's first ever gig at the same venue. They played tracks from ""Big TV"" and some of their earlier songs in front of 300 fans each night. In August 2013, they made their Main Stage debut at Reading and Leeds Festivals. During their summer/fall 2013 tour, the band played more than 30 concerts in Europe and North America."
"On 29 July 2013, the band made the song ""Change"" available to stream on their official SoundCloud page."
"On 16 September 2013, White Lies announced that the next single from the album would be ""First Time Caller"", and they released an official music video for the song."
"""Big TV"" received generally favourable reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 64, based on 18 reviews."
"Matt Collar of AllMusic wrote that White Lies ""sound even more engaged and clear-eyed than on the ambitious, stylized ""Ritual"","" and they ""combine the urgent passions of their debut with the conceptual ambitions of their sophomore effort and by doing so, make the best album of their career"". Cai Trefor of ""Clash"" magazine rated the album 7 out of 10, and described it as leaning towards retro, but also sounding firmly in the present, ""utilising electronic samples with classic valve-driven guitar chords to accompany the trademark baritone of McVeigh"". The Line of Best Fit's reviewer Ryan Thomas noted the album's 1980s atmosphere but said that ""with influences visible, nods clearly marked, White Lies aren't just repackaging yesterday's hits as their own. Instead they're making use of abandoned utensils to create anew, achieving catharsis through resourcefulness. Yes, they are working with a previously-explored aesthetic, but they are molding it into a beautifully-original product, per a vision that refuses to forget music's former greatness""."

"After having a training session, Splinter (Hamato Yoshi) and the Turtles celebrate their 15th anniversary of being mutated, and Splinter tells them the story of how they came to be. After the story, the Turtles convince Splinter to allow them to travel to the surface."
"After taking a trip out of the sewers for the first time since being mutated, the Turtles witness April O'Neil and her father Kirby getting captured by The Kraang. Donatello develops a crush upon seeing April and concludes that the Turtles must save her and her father. The Turtles have a brief battle with the Kraang, but they are defeated since they aren't used to fighting as a team. As a result, the Kraang escape, with April and Kirby as their prisoners."
"Back at the lair, Splinter agrees that the Turtles must save April and Kirby, and picks Leonardo as the leader of the team, much to Raphael's irritation."
"While searching for April and Kirby, they meet Snake, a guy who works for the Kraang. Raph threatens to pour mutagen on him if he doesn't tell the Turtles information about the Kraang. Snake confesses, telling them everything he knows, before Michelangelo accidentally lets him escape. At the lair, Splinter tells Leo that failure is a possibility that every leader must face, and tells him the story of how he and Oroku Saki the Shredder were once friends, but became enemies."
"The Turtles eventually find the Kraang, and Snake accidentally gets mutagen ooze poured on him, and becomes a mutated plant. The Turtles enters the Kraang's facility, and begin to battle them, but before they can reach April and Kirby, they come across Snake in his mutant form, which Mikey dubs ""Snakeweed"". Snakeweed is seeking revenge against the Turtles for his mutation, and they go on to fight him. Donnie goes on to save April and Kirby while Leo, Raph and Mikey continue to fight Snakeweed. Donnie manages to save April, but the Kraang escape with Kirby. Snakeweed eventually blows up and the Turtles and April escape from the Kraang. However, Snakeweed's heart starts beating again, indicating this isn't the last they'll see of him."
"The Turtles made the news, but the Shredder watches the news back at Tokyo, Japan, discovering Splinter's symbol on the ninja star, concluding that he and the Foot Clan must relocate to New York to finish off Splinter."
"Max Nicholson of IGN gave ""Rise of The Turtles"" a rating of 8.5/10, saying ""The action sequences are fluid, fast-paced and exciting, and the dialogue-heavy scenes are usually peppered with entertaining slapstick."" Toon Zone reviewer Grant White gave the episode a positive review, saying ""Although I enjoyed this premiere, not everything sat well with me. There are some parts of both the writing and animation that felt poor and sometimes overlapped."" Noel Kirkpatrick at TV.com called the episode ""a tad on the bland side"". He cites that while there's plenty for surprises for the show's plot, ""in laying the groundwork, this pilot didn't really do anything new"". Matt Edwards at Den of Geek opined that the episode is ""so polished and ell executed,"" and praised it for its balance of comedy and action, stating ""A very strong start to the series, then, and one I’ve found myself revisiting frequently."""

He received his secondary education at Stratford Technical High School, where he was dux. With the help of the Taranaki Scholarship, he could afford to study medicine at the University of Otago, from where he graduated MB ChB in 1929. He was a medical practitioner, first practising in Kurow (1929–34) and then at 115 Highgate in Kaikorai, Dunedin (c.1935-36, after which the building was his electorate office to 1943, then again a medical practice after he had left parliament). The building was demolished after 1950 to make way for the Stuart Street extension."
"McMillan became involved with the Labour Party in 1923. In his view, good health extended beyond good medical support, but included educational, economic, and social factors."
"He represented the Dunedin West electorate from to 1943, when he retired. He was Minister of Marine (1940–1941) in the First Labour Government, and was responsible for much of the social security system introduced by Labour."
"In 1940 he ran for the position of Labour Party leader, being nominated by Arnold Nordmeyer, a friend from Kurow and a supporter of John A. Lee. Clyde Carr also ran, but the winner to replace Savage was his deputy, Peter Fraser."

"Lincoln was born on 5 May 1892 in Denver, Colorado."
"As a teenager working at the Colorado Museum of Natural History in 1909, Lincoln learned to prepare specimens from Alexander Wetmore (who was then a student working at the museum) and L. J. Hershey, the museum's Curator of Ornithology. Lincoln's interest in birds continued to develop, and he eventually went on to succeed Hershey as curator in 1913, a post which he held until 1920. He took time out in 1918–1919 to serve as pigeon expert in the U.S. Army Signal Corps. The professional relationship with Wetmore would continue: the two scientists took field trips together in Washington and Hispaniola and co-wrote eight publications."
"In 1920, Lincoln joined the U.S. Bureau of Biological Survey (at the time, a unit of the United States Department of Agriculture, and now part of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service ) and was given the task of organizing and expanding the bird banding program nationwide. The Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 had established federal responsibility for migratory birds; the result was that the North American Bird Banding Program took the place of earlier smaller-scale efforts by individuals and the short-lived American Bird Banding Association. During the period of his tenure, 1920–1946, Lincoln was highly influential: he improved methods for trapping and banding, developed record-keeping procedures, recruited banders, fostered international cooperation, and promoted banding as a tool for research and wildlife management. He proposed a means to estimate the continent-wide population size of a bird species, using reports from hunters and counting ""returns"" (birds killed that are wearing bands); this metric became known as the Lincoln index. He developed the flyway concept, a key idea in the management and regulation of hunting of migratory birds."
Lincoln joined the American Ornithologists' Union in 1910 and was elected a Fellow of the organization in 1934.
"Lincoln died on 16 September 1960 in Washington, D.C. and was buried in Arlington National Cemetery."
"Lincoln received an honorary Doctor of Science degree from the University of Colorado in 1956; in 1957, the Department of the Interior recognized him with its Distinguished Service Award."

"During the Second World War, Sturt combined with the Brighton and Seacliff club from 1942 to 1945, winning two premierships as a combined entity."

"""The Guns of Brixton"" is a song by the English punk rock band The Clash. It was written and sung by bassist Paul Simonon, who grew up in Brixton, South London. The song has a strong reggae influence, reflecting the culture of the area and the reggae gangster film ""The Harder They Come""."
"""The Guns of Brixton"" was the Clash's first song to be composed and sung by Paul Simonon. By the time of ""London Calling"", Simonon had learned to play guitar and started contributing more to the songwriting."
"The band, separated from manager Bernard Rhodes, had to leave their rehearsal studio in Camden Town and find another location. They began work on ""London Calling"" during the summer of 1979 at the Vanilla Studios in Pimlico. The band quickly wrote and recorded demos, and in August 1979 entered Wessex Studios to begin recording the album. Produced by Guy Stevens, who at the time had alcohol and drug problems and whose production methods were unconventional, it was recorded within a matter of weeks, with many songs, including ""The Guns of Brixton"", recorded in one or two takes. It was also revealed that while recording the lead vocals for the song, Simonon sang while staring directly at a CBS executive who had visited the studio during the sessions, giving Simonon the desired amount of emotion in his voice."
"A section of the song is sung by a very young Maria Gallagher, accompanied by her father Mick Gallagher on the keyboard, as a reprise at the end of the song ""Broadway"" on the 1980 Clash album ""Sandinista!"""
"""The Guns of Brixton"" predates the riots that took place in the 1980s in Brixton, but the lyrics depict the feelings of discontent in the area because of the heavy-handedness of the police, the recession and other problems at the time. The lyrics refer to a Brixton-born son of Jamaican immigrants who ""feel[s] like Ivan...at the end of ""The Harder they Come"""", referring to Ivanhoe Martin's death in the 1972 film ""The Harder They Come"". Simonon was originally doubtful about the song's lyrics, which discuss an individual's paranoid outlook on life, but was encouraged to continue working on it by Joe Strummer."
"""The Guns of Brixton"" was not initially released as a single, but a version of the song, taken from the remastered version of ""London Calling"" and remixed by Jeremy Healy, was released by CBS as a CD single, 7-inch vinyl and 12-inch vinyl entitled ""Return to Brixton"" in July 1990 (catalog number 656072-2). It reached #57 on the UK Singles Chart."
"""The Guns of Brixton"" was a mainstay in the Clash's live set. When performing the song live, Simonon would switch instruments with Strummer because he was unable to play the bass line whilst singing lead vocals at the same time."
"A somewhat heavier, faster version than the one found on ""London Calling"" appeared on the 1999 live compilation """"."
"Norman Cook (also known as Fatboy Slim) sampled the bass line for Beats International's 1990 song ""Dub Be Good to Me"", which became a #1 hit in the UK. Simonon, interviewed by Scott Rowley in October 1999 for ""Bassist Magazine"", said that he ""was surprised that it became number one that was quite shocking. And the fact that it was my performance that they had lifted. The smart thing would've been to copy it and change it slightly, but they just lifted it straight off. So, really, I have done ""Top of the Pops"", but I met up with Norman [Cook] and we came to an arrangement which was much needed at the time. But I thought it was a really good idea and it was quite reassuring for that to happen to my first song."""
"Cypress Hill sampled the baseline on ""What's Your Number?"" from the 2004 album ""Till Death Do Us Part."" The song also features Tim Armstrong on guitar."
"Jimmy Cliff covered the song on his 2011 ""Sacred Fire EP"", and 2012 album ""Rebirth"", produced by Armstrong. Will Hermes has called the cover ""the sound of history circling in wondrous ways"" because the song references Cliff's character Ivan from ""The Harder They Come""."
"Reverend and the Makers frontman Jon McClure stated that his band's song ""Nostalgia"" from the album ""ThirtyTwo"" was ""my attempt at a modern 'Guns of Brixton'""."

He went on to captain his side in three drawn Tests in 1968–69 but his career ended in controversial circumstances when he declared himself unfit for the third Test against Australia due to what he claimed was a back injury.

"The tributaries of the Jōganji River were found to be very attractive for hydroelectric power in the early 20th century due to their high flow and mountainous geography. This caught the attention of the electric utility of the time, the Etchu Electric Power Company, and for the purpose of electricity built a dam on the Wada River. At around the same time the Toyama Prefecture was considering a dam for purposes of flood control and irrigation. Construction of a prefecture managed dam began before World War II but the start of the war halted construction. Later, the Hokuriku Electric Power Company inherited the unfinished dam due to restructuring of the power companies. The plans changed to make the primary purpose of the dam electricity production and was finished in the 50s. It now contributes to electric power as well as irrigation and flood control."

It is one of the few Moog synthesizers to utilize MIDI from the factory (the others being the Minimoog Voyager and the earlier Memorymoog+). This allows for better integration in the modern studio and for live performance.
"On 9 September 2013, Moog Music announced the discontinuation of the Little Phatty analog synthesizer."
"There are currently four versions of the Little Phatty. Aside from a few cosmetic differences (and price), all units have nearly identical sound generation circuitry."
"The earlier 'Tribute Edition', a limited run of 1200 units, featured blue LED lighting, wooden side panels and Bob Moog's signature decaled onto the convex back panel."

Olivia FitzRoy was one of five sisters."
"The family spent their summers in Scotland, the setting of her books. They were there in 1939 when her father, a naval officer, decided that they should remain in Inverewe for the duration of World War II. The area was remote; FitzRoy wrote her first book, ""Orders to Poach"" (which told the story of the Stewart children receiving unusual instructions from their overseas father) to entertain her two younger sisters, Barbara (now Ormrod) and the late Amelia (now Jessel). It was published by Collins, as Billy Collins was a friend of the family. The second, ""Steer by the Stars"" and the third ""The House in the Hills"", were based in the same location."
"FitzRoy carried on writing when she began service in the Women's Royal Naval Service, though she was stationed as far away as Ceylon. After the war, she travelled with the 'Chipperfield Circus', which was the inspiration behind ""Wagons and Horses""; she then went back to live in Scotland."
Olivia FitzRoy married Sir Geoffrey Bates in 1957 and they had two daughters. She died aged only 48 of cancer in 1969.

"Hon. Patrick Perkins, J. P., (10 October 1838 — 17 May 1901), nicknamed Paddy Perkins, was a brewer and politician in colonial Queensland. He was a Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly and, later, a Member of the Queensland Legislative Council."
"Patrick Perkins was born in a humble cottage on a small farm in the village of Clonoulty near Cashel, County Tipperary, Ireland. He was the second son of Thomas Perkins, a farmer, and his wife Ellen (""née"" Gooley). He attended the local National School."
"Thomas and Ellen Perkins and their eight children (including Patrick) immigrated on the ""Persian"", departing Southampton and arrived in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia on 9 April 1854."
"In 1861, he married Mary Ellen Hickey in Victoria. They had four children born in Victoria:Thomas Hector (born 1864); Mary Eveleen, (1867-1942) m. Charles Seymour-Allan; Edgar Colin Francis (born 1868) and Lilly Eleanor Perkins (born 1875) m. Randall Macdonnell, m. George Wilkie Gray. They had two children born in Queensland: Patrick Harold (born 1878) and Helene Cicilia (born 1880, Toowoomba d 1965 Adelaide), Sr Margaret Mary of the Dominican priory, Adelaide."
"Patrick Perkins was a miner and storekeeper on the diggings in Victoria in districts including Ballarat, Bendigo, Woods Point and Jamieson."
"With his brother Thomas, he started breweries in Victoria and Queensland. In 1866, Patrick Perkins started the Perkins Brewery in Toowoomba. In 1872, he later extended his operations to Brisbane with the purchase of the City Brewery in 1872."
"In 1876, Patrick Perkins moved to Queensland in order to manage the Brisbane and Toowoomba breweries."
"Perkins also had interests in property and mining, including the Mount Morgan Mine and coal mining in the West Moreton area."
He was considered a shrewd and successful business man.
"On 9 April 1877, Edward Wilmot Pechey, the member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly in the seat of Aubigny, resigned. On 1 May 1877, in a by-election, Perkins was elected in Aubigny, defeating Angus Mackay (the then editor of ""The Queenslander"") by a large majority. He was elected again in Aubigny in the 1878 election and was appointed as Minister of Lands in the First McIlwraith Ministry from 21 January 1879 to 13 November 1883."
"Perkins was elected again in Aubigny in the 1883 election, However, allegations about electoral fraud (including intimidation, bribery, and ballot stuffing) in the Aubigny election started to surface, resulting in a petition to the Governor of Queensland detailing numerous kind of electoral fraud and asking to declare that the Aubigny election was void and that Patrick Perkins was guilty of bribery and corruption. On 21 February 1884, the Committee of Elections and Qualifications ruled the Aubigny election was null and void and called for a by-election. Perkins had denied any involvement in the alleged electoral fraud and the Committee of Elections and Qualifications did not disqualify him from re-contesting the seat, which provoked outrage in some quarters. However, Patrick Perkins announced he would not re-contest the seat as he would be taking a trip to England."
James Campbell was elected unopposed at the resulting by-election on 4 March 1884.
"At the 1888 election, Perkins was elected in the seat of Cambooya on 10 May 1888, which he held until 6 May 1893."
"On 23 May 1893, Perkins was appointed to Queensland Legislative Council from 23 May 1893. Being a lifetime appointment, he served until his death on 17 May 1901."
"In 1883 used his wealth to buy a palatial home at 273 North Quay, Brisbane, which he called ""Aubigny"" after the electorate that first sent him to parliament. The house was originally built in 1870 by Samuel Davis, a Jewish businessman, and included a separate building used as Brisbane's first synagogue. Patrick Perkins used the former synagogue as a billiards room. In 1899, the Perkins family rented the property to the Criminal Investigation Department which used the house as offices and the synagogue as a photography room. In 1906, the house was sold to the Rev. Mother Patrick of the Sisters of Mercy to create the 20-bed Mater Misericordiae Hospital (now a tertiary hospital located at South Brisbane); the former synagogue being the hospital chapel. Once the hospital outgrew the house and relocated to the South Brisbane area where it still operates, the house was renamed ""Loretto"" and used as a hostel for Catholic girls; the former synagogue being the maids' quarters. In about 1939 the house was demolished to make way for the construction of a church for the Church of Christ, Scientist."
"He attended the opening of the first Federal Parliament at the Royal Exhibition Building on 9 May 1901 and caught a chill which developed into bronchial pneumonia, from which he died on Friday 17 May 1901 at ""Ingleborough"", Berkeley Street, Hawthorn."

"Alexander Pushkin used his great-grandfather Abram Gannibal as the model for Ibrahim, the lead character in his unfinished novel ""The Moor of Peter the Great"". After leaving school in 1817, Pushkin met Abram's last surviving son, Peter. He met Peter again in 1825, after writing in his diary about wanting to ""get from him some memoirs about my great-grandfather."" He seemed to use his own experiences, along with Gannibal's to create the plot for ""The Moor of Peter the Great"". A stage version of the work was written by Carlyle Brown and premiered at the Alabama Shakespeare Festival's 13th Southern Writers' Project in March 2001."
"Abram Gannibal is a protagonist of the Soviet comedy movie ""How Czar Peter the Great Married Off His Moor"", although the film's plot has almost nothing to do with Gannibal's real biography. The film is partly based on Pushkin's ""Moor of Peter the Great""."
"There are several portraits thought to depict Gannibal, which include a painting of the Battle of Lesnaya by Pierre-Denis Martin the Younger. The young boy present in Martin’s painting is argued to be Gannibal, because of the young boy’s role as valet to Peter during military campaigns and Gannibal’s possible connection to the artist while in France. A portrait by Adriaan Schoonebeeck is also believed to portray Gannibal during his time with Peter the Great. In Schoonebeeck’s portrait of Peter the Great, the young servant boy directly behind Peter is thought to be Gannibal. Although there are a variety of portraits that claim to contain Gannibal, there is little evidence to suggest the claims are accurate."

"Au Wai Lun (, born 14 August 1971 in Hong Kong) is a retired Hong Kong professional football player. He announced his retirement after being unable to get a contract renewal with South China in Hong Kong First Division League after the 2006–07 season. He was considered to be one of the best strikers in Hong Kong."
"Au made his debut in Hong Kong First Division League for Tin Tin on 20 December 1988, against Happy Valley. He was 17 years old at the time and the final result of the match 0–2."
"Au was the leading goal scorer of the Hong Kong team, but retired from international football after an exhibition match with Manchester United on 23 July 2005."
"On the pitch, Au was recognised easily by his hairstyle – he sports peroxide-blond streaks in his locks. He wore the number 7 jersey for South China and was the captain of the team."
"He is also remembered by his famous ""cross passing during 1-on-1"" in the final of 2002 Carlsberg Cup against Honduras. In the match, he received a pass from his teammate, and got a goal opportunity. However, he passed the ball back and did not shoot. Further jokes on this were developed after this incident."
"Being a veteran striker, Au is valued for his international experience and his strong aerial ability. The 6' tall striker remains one of the best headers in the League."
"In the 2005–06 season, his good performance throughout the season could not prevent South China from finishing 7th in the league, with 2 points below the relegation line. He scored 8 league goals that season (4th among all players, 1st among Hong Kong players). Two years after retiring, he chose to return and play for Eastern, one of his former clubs."
"In the summer of 2007, after being offered a new contract with a salary cut by South China, he decided to retire. He claimed that the entire squad received new contracts with increments, but he was the only one with a salary cut. He thought the club was being unfair to him, who contributed for many years, even when the team performed so poor for several seasons."
"After his retirement announcement, he was approached by Star Publishing and with the help of a professional writer, published his biography titled, ""Lun . Football Biography"" (倫．球傳)."

"The Little Cacapon is formed at the confluence of two small streams, the North Fork Little Cacapon and the South Fork Little Cacapon, shortly after they both pass north under the Northwestern Turnpike (U.S. Route 50) at Frenchburg. From Frenchburg, the Little Cacapon flows north between Town Hill, high, to its west and Little Cacapon Mountain, high, to its east.

It is within this stretch of the stream that the Little Cacapon meanders by the community of Creekvale. At the entrance of Neals Run, the Little Cacapon is met to its east by Spring Gap Mountain and then flows beneath the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and empties into the Potomac River."

From its source, the North Fork flows northeast along Grassy Lick Road (County Route 10). South Branch Mountain ( high) joins the North Fork to its west, and along with Stony Mountain to its east, the river diverges from Grassy Lick Road and continues its northeastern route to Shanks where it meets US Route 50. From Shanks, the North Fork merges with Camp Run and flows east under US Route 50 at Frenchburg, where it merges with the South Fork to create the Little Cacapon River."
"The South Fork is an tributary of the Little Cacapon. The South Fork is formed at its headwater in a hollow towards the southeastern end of Stony Mountain along South Fork of Little Cacapon Road (County Route 12) between the communities of Kirby and Ruckman.

The Singapore Nature Reserves Act officially came into action in 1971. In 1984, biosphere reserves took up some of the country's land. This figure has been increased to , as of 2009."
"The Public Utilities Board-maintained Central Catchment Nature Reserve is Singapore's largest biosphere reserve. The Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve aids in the conservation of both bird species and mangrove plants. The Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, albeit small-sized at , hosts myriad plant and animal lifeforms. Chek Jawa is situated in eastern Pulau Ubin. Teeming with various kinds of marine life, Chek Jawa was ""discovered"" (much publicised) in 2001. The Labrador Nature Reserve is located by the sea. Described as ""an oasis of tranquility and natural wonders"", it teems with vast animal life, as well as plant life by the cliff. The large Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve comprises mostly wetland and a few bird species, most notably the shorebird, can be spotted there. It is cited as the ""first wetlands reserve to be gazetted in Singapore""."
"Owing to rapid urban development, the country is in need of more land for things such as housing, which is deemed more important than nature reservation. One possible issue faced by the biosphere reserves in Singapore is that they will be turned into nothingness by the government when the need arises. There was an instance when the government had wanted to reclaim part of Chek Jawa, but this was opposed by conservationists and it was ultimately not reclaimed."

"Amin Iskander (, ; born 1952) is an Egyptian politician, writer and activist. He is the co-founder, along with Hamdeen Sabahi, of the Dignity Party (""Al-Karama"") and is currently a member of the People's Assembly. He is considered a veteran Nasserist and a long-time advocate of pan-Arab unity. He has authored several books specializing in Egyptian and Arab politics. He is a resident of Shobra and a Coptic Christian."
"Iskander began his career in activism as a staunch Nasserist. Throughout the 1970s, during the presidency of Anwar Sadat, he was part of the anti-Sadat student movement and won in two student union elections. He also participated in the anti-austerity protests of 1977 which resulted in his arrest. He was arrested two more times, during the 1980 parliamentary elections and in 1983 for suspicions of being part of an clandestine Nasserist organization. He was severely tortured during his latter stint in prison."
"When the Arab Democratic Nasserist Party (ADNP) was legalized in 1992 Iskander joined the party, which was founded by Diaa al-Din Dawoud, but later left the party in 1998 along with other members of the ""new guard"" after disagreements with the party's leaders. Along with former ADNP cadre Hamdeen Sabahi, Iskander co-founded the Dignity Party (""Al-Karama""). He continued his activism, being instrumental in the establishment of the Egyptian-Palestinian solidarity movement in 2000 after the start of the Second Intifada (Palestinian uprising) against the Israeli occupation. He also helped organize protests against the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the ensuing occupation."
"These protests, together with wide disapproval of Hosni Mubarak's policies in Egypt, eventually culminated with the founding of Kefaya, a grassroots opposition movement. Iskander was one of the principal leaders of the movement and became a vocal opponent of the planned, succession of Gamal Mubarak, Hosni's son, to the presidency which Iskander criticized as ""presidential inheritance."""
"Iskander joined the youth-led protests of the 2011 Egyptian revolution on its first day, 25 January and was arrested by security forces while protesting in Cairo's Shobra district on the first day. He continued protesting after his release on 27 January. He became the Dignity Party's secretary-general in 2011. Iskander strongly condemned the killing of mostly Coptic Christians protesters during the Maspero demonstrations on 9 October. During the 2011-2012 Egyptian parliamentary election, Iskander represented the Dignity Party and was part of the Democratic Alliance. He won a seat in Cairo's First District (Al-Sahel)."

Most of the first half of the trail, as far as Arnos Park, runs beside Pymmes Brook, but after that the brook is only encountered intermittently as much of the brook passes through private land which is not open to the public. In its lower reaches sections of the brook have been culverted to alleviate the risk of flooding."
"The trail starts on Hadley Green, where the headwaters of Pymmes Brook rise, with a link from High Barnet tube station. Together with the London Loop, it then drops through Monken Hadley Common to Jack's Lake, to meet another link from Cockfosters tube station. Pymmes Brook proper starts here as it flows out from Jack's Lake. The trail detours through Victoria Recreation Ground, where Pymmes Brook is joined with Shirebourne brook, then follows a short street section to rejoin the brook at East Barnet Village. It then runs beside the brook through Oak Hill Park and Brunswick Park to the halfway point in Arnos Park, with a link to Arnos Grove tube station. It is also where Pymmes Brook is joined by Bounds Green Brook. The trail then leaves the brook to pass through Broomfield Park and Palmers Green. It crosses over the New River at Oakthorpe Road, then the North Circular Road, to divert through two new public open spaces - Bowes Meadow and Tile Kiln Lane Open Space - where Pymmes Brook can be followed again. The trail recrosses the North Circular Road onto Silver Street, Edmonton, where the path enters the gardens of Millfield House. From here the trail leads to Pymmes Park and another brookside section, then to Fore Street, where the brook flows underground to merge with Salmons Brook to the south of Angel Road. As of 2018, the trail must temporarily follow public throughfares for a short distance, but will eventually take a new route when access to the brook is opened up in the Meridian Water development. Finally, the trail passes through Tottenham Marshes, beside Pymmes Brook and past Stonebridge Lock on the Lee Navigation, to reach the point where the brook joins the River Lea.

= = = Reflective subcategory = = =
"In mathematics, a full subcategory ""A"" of a category ""B"" is said to be reflective in ""B"" when the inclusion functor from ""A"" to ""B"" has a left adjoint. This adjoint is sometimes called a ""reflector"", or ""localization"". Dually, ""A"" is said to be coreflective in ""B"" when the inclusion functor has a right adjoint."
"Informally, a reflector acts as a kind of completion operation. It adds in any ""missing"" pieces of the structure in such a way that reflecting it again has no further effect."
"A full subcategory A of a category B is said to be reflective in B if for each B-object ""B"" there exists an A-object formula_1 and a B-morphism formula_2 such that for each B-morphism formula_3 to an A-object formula_4 there exists a unique A-morphism formula_5 with formula_6."
"The pair formula_7 is called the A-reflection of ""B"". The morphism formula_8 is called the A-reflection arrow. (Although often, for the sake of brevity, we speak about formula_1 only as being the A-reflection of ""B"")."
This is equivalent to saying that the embedding functor formula_10 is a right adjoint. The left adjoint functor formula_11 is called the reflector. The map formula_8 is the unit of this adjunction.
The reflector assigns to formula_13 the A-object formula_1 and formula_15 for a B-morphism formula_16 is determined by
the commuting diagram
"If all A-reflection arrows are (extremal) epimorphisms, then the subcategory A is said to be (extremal) epireflective. Similarly, it is bireflective if all reflection arrows are bimorphisms."
"All these notions are special case of the common generalization—formula_17-reflective subcategory, where formula_17 is a class of morphisms."
"The formula_17-reflective hull of a class A of objects is defined as the smallest formula_17-reflective subcategory containing A. Thus we can speak about reflective hull, epireflective hull, extremal epireflective hull, etc."
An anti-reflective subcategory is a full subcategory A such that the only objects of B that have an A-reflection arrow are those that are already in A.
"Dual notions to the above-mentioned notions are coreflection, coreflection arrow, (mono)coreflective subcategory, coreflective hull, anti-coreflective subcategory."

"Cosmos atrosanguineus, the chocolate cosmos, is a species of ""Cosmos"", native to Mexico. It has often been claimed that it is extinct in the wild; however it is ""quite abundant"" in Mexico. The species was introduced into cultivation in 1885, when the British seed company Thompson & Morgan first listed it in their seed catalogue. Its dark red to brownish red flowers have a scent resembling chocolate, which is one reason for its popularity as a cultivated plant."
"""Cosmos atrosanguineus"" is a herbaceous perennial plant growing to 40–60 cm tall, with a fleshy tuberous root. The leaves are 7–15 cm long, pinnate, with leaflets 2–5 cm long. The flowers are produced in a capitulum 3-4.5 cm diameter, dark red to maroon-dark brown, with a ring of six to ten (usually eight) broad ray florets and a center of disc florets; they have a light vanillin fragrance (like many chocolates), which becomes more noticeable towards the end of the day."
"The species was first described in 1861 by William Hooker, as ""Cosmos diversifolia"" var. ""atrosanguineus"". Eduard Ortgies later elevated it to a full species, placing it in the genus ""Bidens"". Andreas Voss transferred it back to ""Cosmos"", retaining its status as an independent species. It is one of eight species of ""Cosmos"" placed in section ""Discopoda"". ""Cosmos"" belongs to subtribe Coreopsidinae."

The Signal Company acquired a controlling stake in the company in 1969, and in 1971 renamed it Hayes Trucks. In 1975, Signal sold the company to Paccar, which closed the Hayes plants."

It was renamed Hayes Manufacturing Company Ltd. in 1928, when the company built a large factory on the False Creek flats in Vancouver. The company eventually had over 600 employees and three plants."
"Along with trucks, Hayes manufactured buses, moving vans, tractors and trailers. Its few bus models included the Hayes ""Teardrop"", a very streamlined design introduced in 1936. Several Teardrop buses were purchased by Pacific Stage Lines, one of which has been preserved by the Transit Museum Society."

"Aldegisel, Aldegisl, Aldgillis, Aldgisl, Aldgils or Eadgils (fl. c. 678) was the ruler of Frisia (as king or duke) in the late seventh century contemporarily with Dagobert II and a very obscure figure. All that is known of him is in relation to the famous saint that he harboured and protected, Wilfrid, but he is the first historically verifiable ruler of the Frisians. What the exact title of the Frisian rulers was depends on the source. Frankish sources tend to call them dukes; other sources often call them kings."
"Wilfrid, deposed from his Archdiocese of York, exiled from Northumbria and on his way to Rome to seek papal support, landed in Frisia in 678. and was warmly received by Aldegisel, who entertained him for several months over the winter, probably at Utrecht. According to Stephen of Ripon, Wilfrid's biographer, Aldegisel encouraged Wilfrid in his effective evangelism and ""[the Frisians] accepted his [Wilfrid's] teaching and with a few exceptions all the chiefs were baptised by him in the name of the Lord, as well as many thousands of common people."" It is possible that Aldegisel was one of the early converts. However, it has been doubted whether Wilfrid was actually successful in Frisia, since there is no other evidence of the success of Christianity there before the work of Willibrord."
"While Wilfrid was at Aldegisel's court, the Frankish mayor of the palace, Ebroin, offered a bushel of gold coins in return for Wilfrid, alive or dead. Aldegisel himself is said to have torn up and burned the letter from the Frankish mayor in front of the ambassadors and his household. It has been surmised by some that Aldegisel's kindness to Wilfrid was a mode of defiance of Frankish domination. His successor and possibly son was Radbod, who followed the older pagan ways and was an enemy of Charles Martel."

This history is reflected by the statue in Queens Square of a batsman holding a pose having played a shot (""The Spirit of Cricket"" by Allan Sly). The observant shopper will be able to spot the ball that this batsman has hit (it can be seen in the wall above F. Hinds jewellers)."
"The land on which the shopping centre now stands had been underwater before the 13th century, and was the original harbour for Hastings. A series of severe storms, silting and sea erosion forced the town to move to where the current old town is. The Priory Valley eventually silted up completely and the area became known as Priory Meadow and turned into farmland in 1536."
"In 1864 the Priory Marshes were levelled and drained and opened as a Cricket Ground, by 1932 one corner of the ground was leased by the Maidstone and District bus company to use as a coach station, then in 1958 a row of shops was built on one side of the ground with seating above."

"The building of the estate was a joint project between the Greater London Council and Barnet Council. The plan was approved by the Ministry of Housing and Local Government in 1964, and the first family moved in on 23 October 1971. Sir Roger Walters was the Chief Architect and Gordon Wigglesworth was the Housing Architect."
"A typical characteristic of the estate was the plain, square, brick terraced houses and long winding low-rise flats, with flat roofs, also known as ""Brick Brutalist"" style. Most building names, walkways and roads on the estate have names linked to the aviation history of the site."
Not all of the old aerodrome was sold off for development; the Royal Air Force Museum is situated immediately to the south-east of the estate (with free entrance).
"A secondary road called Grahame Park Way, a typical 1970s-style collector road, runs along the eastern margin of the estate, parallelling the Midland Main Line (Thameslink) railway, and beyond that, the M1 Motorway."
The estate became the sole site of St. James Catholic High School in 1996.

= = = Angletarn Pikes = = =
Angletarn Pikes is a fell in the English Lake District near the village of Patterdale. Its most notable feature is the summit tarn from which it derives its name.
"Angletarn Pikes stands on the western arm of the long horseshoe ridge which surrounds the Martindale catchment, a system of valleys draining north into Ullswater. The adjacent fells on this ridge are Place Fell to the north and Brock Crags to the south. Beda Fell, a subsidiary ridge, also juts out into Martindale from Angletarn Pikes. This separates the heads of Boredale and Bannerdale."
"The western side above Goldrill Beck is steep and includes the faces of Dubhow and Fall Crags. The long eastern flank above Bannerdale is also pock-marked with crags, Heck Crag being the principal feature. The narrow north eastern slopes above Boredale, although steep, are less rocky and are cut by the upper ravine of Freeze Beck."
"North from the summit a long ridge drops over Stony Rigg (1,640 ft) to the walkers’ crossroads of Boredale Hause. From here paths run down to Hartsop, Patterdale and Boredale, while a further bridleway cuts across Beda Fell to Bannerdale. Boredale Hause carries the tiny ruin of a building named ‘Chapel in the Hause’ on OS maps. A mountain pass at 1,300 ft seems a curious place to construct a church. From the Hause a good path carries on northwards up Steel Edge to Place Fell."
"The north-east ridge to Beda Fell is also well defined, a fair path traversing a series of rocky knolls before the final rise to the summit, named Beda Head."
"Southward from Angletarn Pikes is Angle Tarn itself. This indented waterbody is about a quarter of a mile long with an island in the middle and forms a picturesque foreground for views of the Pikes. The tarn sits in a hollow on the centre of the ridge, issuing westwards through a break in the parapet via the ravine of Angletarn Beck. The ridge proper runs to the east of the tarn above the Bannerdale face, rising again to the unnamed 1,870 ft top above Satura Crag. This overtops the summit of Brock Crags, but was made subservient to it by Wainwright in his ""Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells""."
"Angletarn Pikes takes its plural from the two rocky towers at the summit, separated by perhaps 200 yards of peaty bog. The northern top is the true summit, the other being some six feet lower. The southern top is compensated by a clear view of Angle Tarn, described by Wainwright as ""among the best of Lakeland tarns"". The wider view stretches from the Helvellyn range to the spine of the Far Eastern Fells across Martindale."
"The fell can be climbed via Boredale Hause, making Patterdale, Bridgend, Hartsop and Boredale Head all possible starting points. An alternative is to climb from Martindale Old Church, ascending via the Beda Fell ridge or Angle Tarn. The route from Patterdale is often undertaken as the first section of the ascent of High Street."

Campellolebias is a genus of killifish in the family Rivulidae from southeast Brazil. They are restricted to seasonal blackwater pools in forests in coastal parts of Santa Catarina and São Paulo states.
"They are small fish, up to in total length. Uniquely among killifish, ""Campellolebias"" and the closely related ""Cynopoecilus"" have internal fertilization. A part of the males' anal fin forms a ""pseudo-gonopodium"" that is used for inseminating the female."
There are currently four recognized species in this genus:
"The generic name ""Campellolebias"" is a combination of Campello, which honours the Brazilian chemical engineer, aquarist and amateur ichthyologist Gilberto Campello Brasil (1945-2008) and ""lebias"" a Greek word for a small fish which was applied to Killifish by Georges Cuvier and is now used a root for names within the order Cyprinodontiformes.

"Cerezyme is a freeze-dried medicine containing imiglucerase, manufactured by Genzyme Corporation. It is given intravenously after reconstitution as a treatment for Type 1 and Type 3 Gaucher's disease. It is available in formulations containing 200 or 400 units per vial. The specific activity of highly purified human enzyme is 890,000 units/mg. A typical dose is 2.5U/kg every two weeks, up to a maximum of 60 U/kg once every two weeks, and safety has been established from ages 2 and up. It is one of more expensive medications, with an annual cost of $200,000 per person in the United States. Imiglucerase has been granted orphan drug status in the United States, Australia, and Japan."
"Cerezyme was one of the drugs manufactured at Genzyme's Allston, Massachusetts plant, for which production was disrupted in 2009 after contamination with Vesivirus 2117."
"The most common side effect is hypersensitivity, which occurs in about 3% of patients. It is associated with symptoms such as cough, shortness of breath, rashes, itching, and angiooedema. Less common side effects include dizziness, headache, nausea, diarrhoea, and reactions at the injection site; they are found in less than 1% of patients."

= = = Commodity value = = =
"In the field of economics, the commodity value of a good is its free market intrinsic value under optimal use conditions. In a free market, the commodity value of a good will be reflected by its price. For example, if an acre of land can yield a net of 100 dollars loss by lying fallow, 50 dollars gain by being planted with corn, and 100 dollars gain by being planted with wheat, then that acre's commodity value is 100 dollars; the farmer is assumed to put his land to best use. The price of a commodity fluctuates around its commodity value."
"A commodity value expressed as a price is determined by historical, social and cultural aspects of production and distribution. Karl Marx described price as the money-name for the labour realised in a commodity. A commodity value is dependent on its utility."
"Commodity value is of particular significance in the study of currency. For example, the commodity value of a coin is the value of the metal of which it is made. Gold and silver coins have a high commodity value, whereas fiat coins such as modern day quarters have a low commodity value. This is of particular historical relevance when analyzed in light of Gresham's Law."

"John Francis Dodge (October 25, 1864 – January 14, 1920) was an American automobile manufacturing pioneer and co-founder of Dodge Brothers Company."
"Dodge was born in Niles, Michigan, where his father ran a foundry and machine shop. John and his younger brother, Horace, were inseparable as children and as adults. The origins of the Dodge family lie in Stockport, England, where their ancestral home still stands."
"In 1886, the Dodge family moved to Detroit, where John and Horace took jobs at a boiler maker plant. In 1894 they went to work as machinists at the Dominion Typograph Company in Windsor, Ontario, Canada. While John was the sales-minded managerial type, his brother Horace was a gifted mechanic and inveterate tinkerer. Using a dirt-proof ball bearing Horace invented and patented, in 1897 Dodge arranged a deal for the brothers to join with a third-party investor to manufacture bicycles. Within a few years, they sold the bicycle business and in 1900 used the proceeds of the sale to set up their own machine shop in Detroit."
"In their first year of business, the Dodge brothers' company began making parts for the automobile industry. In 1902 the Dodge brothers won a contract to build transmissions for the Olds Motor Vehicle Company upon which they built a solid reputation for quality and service. However, the following year they turned down a second contract from Olds to retool their Detroit plant at Hastings Street and Monroe Avenue to build engines for Henry Ford in a deal that included a share position in the new Ford Motor Company. By 1910, John Dodge and his brother were so successful they built a new plant in Hamtramck, Michigan."
"For ten years (1903–1913), the Dodge brothers' business was a Ford Motor Company supplier, and Dodge worked as vice president of the Ford company. He left Ford in 1913, and in 1914 he and Horace formed Dodge Brothers to develop their own line of automobiles. They began building motor trucks for the United States military during the arms buildup for World War I, and in October 1917 they produced their first commercial car. At war's end, their company produced and marketed both cars and trucks."
He was inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame in 1997.
"Because of his temper and often crude behavior, the red-haired Dodge was seen as socially unacceptable to most of the well-heeled elite of Detroit. Nevertheless, his wealth made him an influential member of the community and he became active in Republican Party politics in Michigan."
"The Dodge brothers were the sons of machinist Daniel Rugg Dodge (1819–1897) and Maria Duval Casto (1823–1906). Maria was Daniel's second wife. They had an elder full sister: Della Lone (1863–1936) and older half brother Charles Frontier Dodge (1855–1926), and half sister Laura Belle (1858-?) from Daniel's first marriage to Lorinda Gould (1820–1860)."
John Dodge married Canadian Ivy Hawkins (1864–1901) in September 1892. They had three children:
"Following Ivy (Hawkins) Dodge's death from tuberculosis, he secretly married Isabelle Smith (who was his housekeeper) in Walkerville, Ontario, on December 8, 1902. They separated in 1905 and quietly divorced in 1907; the marriage was kept secret until after the death of his third wife. Shortly after the divorce from Isabelle, Dodge married his secretary, Matilda Rausch (1883–1967). Dodge had three more children with Matilda:"
"In 1908, John Dodge and Matilda purchased the land for Meadow Brook Farms near Rochester, Michigan. At Meadow Brook, their eldest child, Frances, developed a love of horses that led her to acquire Castleton Farm in Lexington, Kentucky, and turn it into one of the leading horse breeding operations in the United States. Dodge's daughter Isabel established Brookmeade Stable. It became a major participant in Thoroughbred horse racing and owned several Champions, including the U.S. Racing Hall of Fame horses Cavalcade and Sword Dancer. Five years after Dodge's death in 1920, Matilda married Alfred Wilson and they built the Meadow Brook Hall at the Rochester estate."
His great grandson is film producer John F Dodge III.
"John and Horace contracted influenza and pneumonia while in New York City during the 1918 flu pandemic. John died on January 14, 1920, at the Ritz-Carlton, aged 55. He was interred in the Egyptian-style family mausoleum in Detroit's Woodlawn Cemetery guarded by two Sphinx statues."
"Horace died the following December, and in 1925 their widows sold the Dodge Brothers automobile business to Dillon Read, investment bankers, for $146 million (equivalent to $ in ). Dodge's newborn daughter Anna Margaret died of the measles before age five. His son Daniel drowned in the waters off Manitoulin Island after falling overboard while being transported to hospital following an accident involving dynamite. He had just recently married, at age 21."
"After Dodge's death, Matilda married Alfred Wilson and adopted two children with him, Richard and Barbara Wilson. Matilda Dodge Wilson was Lieutenant Governor of Michigan briefly in 1940 under Republican Governor Luren Dickinson."
"In 1957, the Wilsons donated their Meadow Brook Farm, including Meadow Brook Hall, Sunset Terrace and all its other buildings and collections, along with $2 million (equivalent to $ in ), to Michigan State University to establish an extension campus. In 1963, the Michigan State University-Oakland was renamed Oakland University."

"Nachman Goldstein of Tcherin (1825 – 1894), also known as the Tcheriner Rav (rabbi of Tcherin, a town in eastern Ukraine), was a leading disciple of Nathan of Breslov (known as ""Reb Noson""), who in turn was the chief disciple of Rebbe Nachman of Breslov, the founder of the Breslov Hasidic dynasty."
"A child prodigy who excelled in his Torah studies even as a young boy, Goldstein was the grandson of Rabbi Aharon, the chief rabbi of Breslov in Rebbe Nachman's day, and the son of Rabbi Zvi Aryeh, the succeeding rabbi of Breslov. He grew up in the town of Breslov. However, in his youth he shied away from Reb Noson. Once Reb Noson said to him, ""Nachman, who knows? Maybe the reason Rebbe Nachman worked so hard to bring your grandfather to Breslav was because of ""you""?"" After that, Goldstein became a follower of Reb Noson, and after the latter's death, became very involved with Reb Noson's works."
"Goldstein raised his daughter's son, Abraham Sternhartz, after the latter was orphaned of his parents as a young child. As the grandson of Reb Noson's leading disciple and at the same time a great-grandson of Noson through his father's line, Sternhartz was privy to all the family traditions and stories about Rebbe Nachman's closest disciple. These formed the basis for his definitive collection of Breslov oral traditions, entitled ""Tovot Zichronot""."

"Sol Goldman (born Usher Selig Goldman, September 2, 1917 – October 18, 1987) was an American real estate developer. Together with his partner, Alex DiLorenzo, Goldman became the biggest non-institutional real estate investor in New York City in the 1980s, ultimately owning a portfolio of nearly 1900 commercial and residential properties."
"Goldman was born to a Jewish family in Brooklyn, the son of Fannie and Charles Goldman. His father owned a grocery store. Goldman briefly attended Brooklyn College, before turning to real estate during the Great Depression. At age 16, he purchased his first of many foreclosed properties by raising money from his neighbors. In the 1950s, he partnered with Alex DiLorenzo Jr. Together they were very active purchasers through the 1950s and 1960s and their portfolio included the Chrysler Building which they bought in 1960. Although the 1970s were difficult—he lost the Chrysler Building to foreclosure and his partner, DiLorenzo, died in 1975—Goldman continued to invest, purchasing more than 600 buildings in the subsequent years via his company Solil Management (named after Sol and his wife, Lil). Goldman was known for holding onto his properties and rarely selling, preferring instead to sign tenants to long-term ground leases (typically 99 years) where the tenants pay an annual rent to Goldman but are responsible for taxes and upkeep of buildings on the properties."
"The Sol Goldman Pancreatic Cancer Research Center at Johns Hopkins University is named in his honor, following a gift of $10 million."
"In 1941, he married Lillian Schuman, who was also Jewish. They had four children: Allan H. Goldman, Diane Goldman Kemper, Amy P. Goldman, and Jane Goldman. Upon his death at the age of 70 in 1987, he owned New York's largest private real estate portfolio with more than 600 properties valued at $1 billion. His wife and three daughters engaged in litigation over his assets with his wife eventually receiving 1/3rd of his estate. His nephew, Lloyd Goldman, is also a notable real-estate investor in New York City. His children, Allan Goldman and Jane Goldman manage the remaining real estate assets amounting to $6.0B via the firm Solil Management."

"Within five years of the house leaving the Taft family, the front veranda was removed, replaced by a one-story porch. Other modifications were the addition of a conservatory and the demolition of outbuildings, including a stable. Upon Thompson's death the house was sold by his widow to Colonel Ernest H. Ruffner in 1912. Upon Ruffner's death it was sold by his daughter. The William Howard Taft Memorial Association was formed on July 7, 1937, in hopes of buying the property, but went without support of the Taft family, as Robert Taft thought it would look too opportunistic to memorialize the house his father grew up in, and thus failed in acquiring the $12,000 to buy it. In the 1940s the building was used as apartments, with the new owner Elbert R. Bellinger once considering selling it to become a funeral parlor for local blacks. Taft family political fortunes faltered with Robert's death in 1953, and with Charles Phelps Taft II available to spearhead the movement, the William Howard Taft Memorial Association eventually acquired the house for $35,000 (the assessment price), instead of the $75,000 Bellinger was demanding for it."
"By 1961, the house was in poor condition and needed restoration, to the tune of $92,500. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1964. A ceremony on September 15, 1964 (William's 107th birthday), celebrated the home becoming a National Historic Landmark."
"The association gained full title to the house in 1968 and in 1969 transferred it to the National Park Service, which currently operates the site as a historic house museum, so that its future upkeep is ensured. The United States government took the property title on November 1, 1970."
Letters and diary entries written by Louise Taft during her time in the home helped preservationists to return the domicile to how it appeared during William's childhood.
"William Howard Taft National Historic Site has two main buildings. The first is the original home owned by William Howard Taft's parents, Alphonso and Louise Taft. It has been restored to look as it did during the time William lived there. All the family portraits and many of the books on display belonged to the Taft family. The first floor has five rooms restored: William's birthplace, and four rooms representative of the period. The furniture is period pieces and did not necessarily belong to the Tafts. The second floor contains exhibits on the accomplishments of William."
"The second building is the National Historic Site's Visitor Center, officially called the Taft Education Center.

However, his initial agents turned out to not be licensed and he switched to Scott Boras, who said the bidding was now wide open. On October 21, 2013, it was reported that Guerrero had reached a new agreement with the Dodgers, that would be worth $28 million over 4 years.

"Guerrero made his professional debut with the Gigantes del Cibao in the Dominican Winter League. However, he dealt with hamstring issues and was limited to only 12 games, during which he hit .289."
"Guerrero made the Dodgers' 25-man opening day roster for the 2014 season. He made his MLB debut as a pinch hitter on March 22, 2014 against the Arizona Diamondbacks, but when Diamondbacks manager Kirk Gibson countered by putting in a right-handed pitcher, Dodgers manager Don Mattingly sent in a left-hander to pinch hit for Guerrero.

"After two weeks, Guerrero was hitting so well that there was clamor for him to become the regular third baseman, as incumbent Juan Uribe was getting off to a slow start. Uribe, however, picked up his production, and Guerrero continued to be used in a utility role, playing at third base and at left field and pinch hitting. Despite not being a regular starter, Guerrero was named Rookie of the Month for April 2015, his first full month in the Major Leagues. He hit .423 with five homers and 13 RBI in only 13 games."
"On June 2, with the Dodgers trailing the Colorado Rockies by three runs and down to their last strike in the top of the 9th inning, Guerrero hit the first grand slam of his career just over the center field wall to drive in what would be the winning run for the Dodgers."

"Guerrero injured his knee in spring training in 2016, causing him to begin the season on the disabled list. In a minor league rehab stint across three different levels in May, he played in 16 games and hit .136. When he was ready to rejoin the team, there was no spot available on the active roster so Guerrero was designated for assignment by the Dodgers on May 31, 2016 and removed from the 40-man roster.

"Their first car, a three-wheeler, was made in 1899 followed by a forecar in 1903. Cecil Bayliss, the son of the new owner, built a cyclecar in 1911 with 800 cc engine, and this was developed into the first Perry car to reach production."
"The Perry cyclecar was described as 'just placed on the market' when exhibited at the November 1912 Motor Cycle and Cycle Car Show at Olympia. It was described as 'an exact replica of a full-sized model, but is of exceptionally light weight - less than 7cwt'."
"The engine for the car was built in-house and was a twin-cylinder vertical water cooled unit, with 72mm bore and 108mm stroke, unusual in that both pistons rose and fell at the same time. Drive was to the rear wheels through a 3-speed gearbox with reverse and worm-driven axle and spur differential. The rear springing was unusual in that the long semi-elliptic leaf springs were supplemented by coil springs. It was fitted with Sankey detachable wheels and Dunlop tyres."
"The basic body was an open two-seater, but a long-wheelbase version allowing a dickey seat was also available."
About 800 were made.
A full-sized car was introduced in 1914 with four-cylinder 1795 cc engine. The larger car allowed four seat bodies to be offered as well as two seaters and these were mainly made by Mulliners of Birmingham.
"About 300 were made before World War I curtailed car-building activities. A very few were made in 1919 when the design, jigs, patterns and tools were sold to Bean Cars for £15,000, who reintroduced it as the Bean 11.9."
= = = Worst Week = = =
"Worst Week is an American sitcom television series which originally aired on CBS from September 22, 2008 to June 6, 2009. The series was based on the British sitcom ""The Worst Week of My Life"". The show was adapted for American audiences by Fox under the title ""Worst Week of My Life"", but a series failed to materialize after the pilot was filmed."
"The series aired on CBS Mondays at 9:30pm ET/PT, following ""Two and a Half Men"". The premiere attracted 11 million viewers but lost a third of its lead-in audience. Ratings dropped to a low of 8.4 million viewers with the sixth episode, then began to climb steadily. They reached a high of 12.12 million viewers with the eleventh episode but declined afterwards. The season finale titled ""The Epidural"" aired on February 16, 2009."
"On May 20, 2009, CBS announced its new season schedule and canceled ""Worst Week"". A previously unaired episode entitled ""The Party"" aired on June 6, 2009. ""Worst Week"" is set in Manassas, Virginia."
"Verne Gay of ""Newsday"" graded it A and said it ""may be the best new comedy on network TV this season."""
"Less enthusiastic was Tim Goodman of the ""San Francisco Chronicle"", who said, ""Though there are plenty of hard-earned (some might say forced) laughs here and Bornheimer is a real find, you can't help but wonder how they'll keep up the pace. After all, the British series ran for only two seasons and had a mere seven episodes each season...So how is CBS going to stretch this into 22 episodes without stretching it too thin?...In many ways, ""Worst Week"" seems incapable of being made into an American version (there were previous attempts that failed), because not only does the title not make sense, but not having a payoff for all the freaky, not-so-karmic woes Sam endures will be frustrating to the viewing audience . . . [It] is a series that may end up being on a short leash."""
"Linda Stasi of the ""New York Post"" called it ""one of the worst new shows of the week"" and added, ""Only a man (or a couple of them) could get paid big bucks in Hollywood to come up with such a lame-o rip-off and perpetuate the fantasy that gorgeous women can't help but to love out-of-shape guys who do everything wrong."""

"It is significant partly for reflecting a local fad: the school, the Hotel Paris, the Les and Hazel Shepherd Bungalow, and the LDS Stake Office Building (all also NRHP-listed in Paris), reflect the Prairie style, which is otherwise relatively rare in Idaho. According to a 1980 study, the style's unusual popularity in Paris gives the city a sense of architectural unity.

It then follows the north shore of Bras d'Or Lake, bypassing Baddeck on a short Super two controlled access segment. Still running in a general northeast direction, at St. Anns the highway begins ascending the west slope of Kelly's Mountain on the Cape Dauphin Peninsula. Highway 105 descends the east slope of Kelly's Mountain using a series of sharp turns including a 180° hairpin turn at New Harris Forks before crossing the Great Bras d'Or Channel of Bras d'Or Lake on the Seal Island Bridge. The road crosses Boularderie Island using another short Super two controlled access segment and then runs southeast as an uncontrolled access road through the villages of Bras d'Or and Florence. Highway 105 regains controlled access for the final to its eastern terminus at the Marine Atlantic ferry terminal in North Sydney where travellers can continue to Newfoundland."

"Eminsang travelled back to the Gold Coast on the same ship that carried Nagtglas there. Upon arrival, Nagtglas appointed Eminsang as a member of the Colonial Council of the Dutch Gold Coast. When it became apparent that the Dutch were negotiating a treaty to transfer their possessions on the Gold Coast to the United Kingdom, Eminsang led the attempts by the Elminese to stop the transfer, and together with other Dutch loyalists paid for a visit to The Hague by David Mill Graves, in an ultimate attempt to stop the ratification of the treaty. Eminsang wrote a letter to the German ambassador in The Hague asking German Emperor William I for mediation and protection, to be handed over by Mill Graves."
"After it became clear that Mill Graves's mission could not prevent the handing over of Elmina to the British, Eminsang withdrew his protest, keen on keeping his influential positions in the colonial government. Apart from being a member of the Colonial Council of the Dutch Gold Coast, Eminsang had also become a substitute judge on the Court of Justice, a sworn attorney, and a justice of the Small Causes Court. Eminsang's ""volte face"" proved very worthwhile for him, as he was appointed a member of the Committee for the Regularisation of the Affairs of the Netherlands on the Coast of Guinea headed by J. M. C. W. Joost, as well as notary and public registrar."
"When Elmina was finally transferred to the British on 6 April, the British Governor of the Gold Coast John Pope Hennessy appointed Eminsang Civil Commandant, Collector of Customs, Postmaster and Deputy Superintendent of Police. As it appeared that Eminsang was rewarded for his sudden change of opinion, many Elminese grew angry with the situation. On 26 April, people from various ""asafo"" wards, mainly numbers 6, 7 and 8, marched with muskets, knives and Dutch flags to Eminsang's house, where a meeting was held between the Regularisation Committee and colonel De Haes, the Dutch military officer who had been entrusted with effecting the transfer of sovereignty. An altercation followed on the streets and eventually shots were fired, which hit J. M. C. W. Joost, who died of his wounds the next day."
"Eminsang could no longer remain in Elmina and fled to Cape Coast. He was released of his duties to the Regularisation Committee by colonel De Haes on 30 April. Eminsang later returned to Elmina, however, and served as acting consul general of the Netherlands in Elmina in 1878 and 1879 during the absence of Pieter Simon Hamel, and as consul to the Congo and the United States in Cape Coast in 1890."
"In the preface of his book ""Fanti Customary Laws"", John Mensah Sarbah wrote:"
"Eminsang had at least three children with Anna Abraba Smith. One of them, Marianne Eminsang (about 1859–1915), was grandmother to Robert Patrick Baffour. Anna Abraba Smith previously had a child with Cornelis Nagtglas."
"Eminsang married Mary Ellen De Lyons on 14 April 1860 at the American Episcopal Church in Harper, Liberia. She however abandoned him for the British colonial administrator Herbert Taylor Ussher. Eminsang then tried to indict Ussher for fornication and adultery at the Cape Coast court of justice, but after this attempt failed he decided to divorce De Lyons. The divorce was finalised on 11 September 1867."

"This hamlet was named for the owners of Clover Forest Plantation. The settlement overlooks the James River and was once a hub of rural trading activity. A dam and canal lock were built on the James at Pemberton to enable passage by boats. The lock lowered boats from the Kanawha Canal into the James River just below Cartersville, Cumberland County, Virginia and connected with Tamworth, Virginia and its mill. Trade moved from the Cartersville port and Willis River downriver on the James."
"Pemberton became connected to other markets via the Cartersville-Fredericksburg State Road, that began in Cartersville, crossed the James, and continued northward. The Cartersville Bridge, built across the James River in 1824, connected Cartersville and Pemberton; it was the first James River bridge built in Goochland County.
