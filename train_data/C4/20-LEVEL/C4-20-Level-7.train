Ricky and Lucy have finished by the way.
Oh have they?
Finally!
Yeah.
"He, he was up town with this other girl, holding her hand  walked past Lucy and smiled at her!"
"That wa , that is sad!"
And wha
Anyway Lisa  's been flirting badly with Ricky for ages!
Don't you eat it.
Don't you touch that butter.
Right.
I won't.
Nor anybody else.
"If you're saying you're buying the butter solely for me, then I just want me solely to eat it."
Cos I'm not carrying the can.
I needed butter as well.
"Brian, you're not to eat it."
What!
Not even on my toast at night?
No.
She says  you had to go out and buy butter solely because I wanted it.
And I've
Oh
I've had the bollocking cos we've had to buy butter.
Well I wanted it as well so that's two against one.
"And if you see her, see her eating our butter  there will be a row."
Cos
you've said that.
I won't have Flora on the toast.
I think that's horrible.
It goes all watery.
Look I'm not amused at all.
Well neither am I.
na na na na na
He said he wants butter.
Yeah.
Well why couldn't you put up with margarine for one day?
Oh we could have.
But I didn't mind going shopping.
Yeah well sh I wouldn't have minded just for today.
It's over.
It's over.
Mm I know.
I know the time's flying.
Well in actual fact  to te to tell you the honest truth  we've been so busy one way and another over the weekends haven't we?
Yeah.
And then erm  we ain't even been to see Barbara and her  and her new house and they only live
fourteen mile away.
Yeah.
She keeps ringing us up and saying  are you  are you  are you coming?
Are you coming up to see us?
"But  I don't get time, you know?"
By the time we get home and and finished.
"This little dog, he's got something ."
What are you itching for?
Now let your mummy have a look.
Oh look Rude.
What?
Look!
That's where he keeps biting it and scratching it.
"That's what it is, it's scratching and biting."
Look.
He might have got a flea.
He might have got a flea Rudy.
I doubt it .
I dunno.
"You see, see they do  most dogs go down the fields."
Quite possibly he has got a flea duck.
I sprayed him with that stuff.
Ah well if he's
er
I ain't got nothing to put on him.
Picked three jacks up hoping there'd be a joker.
Oh you awkward sod.
Picking up what .
Well I ain't.
She's slinging everything I wa want and can't get nothing.
Picked it up.
Just picked a joker up.
Well you're just bloody lucky.
"Mm, you're joking of course."
I want that.
Ooh pardon me.
That's three bloody cards on the trot I've picked up which I'm .
Seven.
Four five six seven eight.
Have I told you lately that I love you .
That's a king is it?
No I ain't got that one.
Wrong one.
Oh I've got that bugger now.
No I didn't.  clubs.
Jesus wept.
Jack follow the leader.
two three four.
Got nothing.
And that's no good now.
That's
Well look at that bugger.
She's putting all my buggers I want.
Last card.
Little demon.
"Come on, your last chance now for your uncle John."
Wondering what to chuck you John.
your grandmother there?
Are you having to sleep in the
Your mother?
?
people in the house!
Look!
Right.
"I told you I'm still living at home, right?"
Yeah.
"This is , my mother, my father, my sister  my brother, me, my husband, one, two, three children."
Oh really!
And the dog!
"And the dog, yeah."
And
Woof!
Whisky.
Woof!
What sor
What sort of dog?
Do yo
A mongrel.
Right.
"And do you get on very well with all of your family  but, actually living there?"
"Not really, no."
No.
"Can't you afford to find you know, your own house or  rent a place?"
"Would you, if you had the chance"
"Well not really, no."
find your children that had run away?
Probably not.
It's their choice to run away.
How old were they when they did run away?
Mm.
Yeah .
Stupid dog.
He ignored that.
Good boy.
He didn't even look .
I went to the doctors today.
Oh yes?
Yeah.
He said don't buy any more new clothes.
He said what?
Don't buy any more new clothes.
She said I was
A hypochondriac?
terribly overweight.
What made her say that I wonder.
And she would like me to go to the well women's clinic  every Wednesday  it's run.
"And she would like me to go, book in for an appointment."
And she would discuss my diet amongst other things.
Oh dear.
Mhm.
Which diet?
Your chocolate diet?
Your crisp diet or your food diet?
Hm!
Er
Or the the meals in between diet.
If  if I'm on a diet you lot will be on diets.  on diets
We know all about it.
but there will be no more cake.
We know.
I think I'm gonna have to change us all to Flora.
I've dropped my pen under your seat.
"I'll get it when we sa unless you, have you got another one?"
Thanks.
"Have you seen Kathleen, er  Katherine  recently?"
No.
"I've just realized I haven't either, when I saw that woman crossing the road I thought it was her."
Please let us out someone!
Press the
It wasn't
button somebody
it wasn't them that was .
"Oh, thank you kind sir."
It wasn't what?
It wasn't the cars there it was the cars turning in that's stopping him getting out.
We need some sugar.
We've had no sugar all this week.
Not that you've noticed.
I made the custard from er  sugar cubes.
And I didn't know how lo how old the sugar cubes were.
Right.
We got them  when we packed up your mother's house.
"Right, where am I, I'll meet at er"
Co-op.
Co-op.
Okay.
Better hu hurry up.
I can't get out any quicker.
See you later.
Hello.
Hello.

"And there was no erm  television supplement, and no comic in the  Daily Mirror this morning."
I said no.
Mother!
Dad.
Don't worry about me!
No.
"And he said, is Tracey in the kitchen?"
Yeah but he's probably  done tha knows who's anyway !
"I mean, I doubt if he'll know  who's Brian and who's Dave  to be perfectly honest."
"Well, there you are then."
Eh?
off me.
That's why they're always going up to him.
"Mind you, he and Uncle Brian they are identical twins  people can  find out who they are but, well they can't find out who we are can they?"
Don't think it matters at work.
Oh your tea's here.
Yeah.
"you can make  make it right next time with Tracey's and Linda's  anyway, if they hadn't done it in office because I can put  two pound what  Tracey paid  onto Linda's anyway, it'll still balance it out won't it?"
Do you know
No.
what I mean?
No!
"It will, yeah!"
No cos Ta Linda'll be a way behind then.
No.
"Er say, I mean they normally give me three pounds don't they?"
"It's, it's, it's, it's th th the mix up has come on, in that book it's"
Yeah.
not on their cards.
"Oh no, it's not on the cards."
But
I'll pay  as the erm
Well I'll tell you summat
"Mm  one was seventeen, one was six, and"
Making the choice  !
No.
No.
"My hu , my six year old ran away, but"
Yeah but when
"then came back, and then ran away again"
"So, aren't you concerned him?"
"he tried to go out the door but she reached him back, but she hasn't"
Aren't you concerned about how he's living?
gone to him!
Erm
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
And how he's surviving?
He might even be dead for all you know!
That's sweet!
Don't you care?
Well
"Aren't you a bit, the slightest worried"
Why
You're not concerned?
Why did you have children then if you weren't prepared to
Yeah.
look after them suitably?
Erm  my religion forbid the use of  contraception.
Could we
Ya.
have that off.
Yeah.
I think everybody
If that's okay.
Er  second at what ti .
Wednesday second of October.
What time?
Eight thirty.
Eight thirty.
"And this is, this is about the leaflet is it?"
Yeah.
Yes.
Get all the information.
Decide on how we do the  thing.
And erm do take it
To go into details of that it's probably much more sensible to do it with just two or three people.
But er  at least if we can  pull the information together that evening that'd be a start.
Form a sub committee!
Ooh!
sub committee with everybody present!
Well you can always divide up.
Thanks ever so much folks and I'll see you
Oh you've got to go.
soon.
See you.
Bye Katherine.
See you then.
Thanks Katherine.
Your welcome.
I'll be in touch.
Bye.
So what's gonna be on this stall then?
Apart from the new leaflets and a few
Some re re-use labels.
Yeah.
"No, but it be beneficial  if it's Comet  and the receipt came back for our insurance from Comet  erm"
Dixons!
"They're all, they're all same,"
They're all the same.
Comet and
Yes.
it's all owned by Kingfisher.
Kingfisher.
Because if we bought the fridge and the  at Comet  and collected the receipts back on the insurance .
He said they're all the same.
"They're owned by Kingfisher ,."
We  we bought this fridge  from Comet  to keep the insurance
"I was     Oh it's still working, yes."
and he says that
Well at least it's  pounds off .
"Yeah, well mum's telly eleven ."
"And they said to her now, not to insure it ."
"When it's gone, it's now ."
.
I tell you what you .
It's something like a
How much did it cost last time?
I'm  them over.
Paul's mother's flipping well angry!
Last time he   that's my   .
Why does ?
"He, he might say to me you can't use ."
That's a load of nonsense!
"But I said to them,take that cheque ."
Oh  fucking hell !
.Because  mum's territory is there  you got a few people complained!
And it's .
"'T is a great thing to be weak , I trow : ye can do your worst , yet shall none punish you ; ye may steal a man 's weapons in the hour of need , yet may the man not take his own again ; -- y ' are weak , forsooth !"
"Nay , then , if one cometh charging at you with a lance , and crieth he is weak , ye must let him pierce your body through !"
Tut !
fool words ! ''
"`` And yet ye beat me not , '' returned Matcham ."
"`` Let be , '' said Dick -- `` let be ."
I will instruct you .
"Y ' ` ave been ill-nurtured , methinks , and yet ye have the makings of some good , and , beyond all question , saved me from the river ."
"Nay , I had forgotten it ; I am as thankless as thyself ."
"But , come , let us on ."
"An we be for Holywood this night , ay , or to-morrow early , we had best set forward speedily . ''"
"But though Dick had talked himself back into his usual good-humour , Matcham had forgiven him nothing ."
"His violence , the recollection of the forester whom he had slain -- above all , the vision of the upraised belt , were things not easily to be forgotten ."
"`` I will thank you , for the form 's sake , '' said Matcham ."
"`` But , in sooth , good Master Shelton , I had liever find my way alone ."
"Here is a wide wood ; prithee , let each choose his path ; I owe you a dinner and a lesson ."
Fare ye well ! ''
"`` Nay , '' cried Dick , `` if that be your tune , so be it , and a plague be with you ! ''"
"Each turned aside , and they began walking off severally , with no thought of the direction , intent solely on their quarrel ."
"But Dick had not gone ten paces ere his name was called , and Matcham came running after ."
"`` Dick , '' he said , `` it were unmannerly to part so coldly ."
"Here is my hand , and my heart with it ."
"For all that wherein you have so excellently served and helped me -- not for the form , but from the heart , I thank you ."
Fare ye right well . ''
"`` Well , lad , '' returned Dick , taking the hand which was offered him , `` good speed to you , if speed you may ."
But I misdoubt it shrewdly .
Y ' are too disputatious . ''
So then they separated for the second time ; and presently it was Dick who was running after Matcham .
"`` Here , '' he said , `` take my cross-bow ; shalt not go unarmed . ''"
`` A cross-bow ! ''
said Matcham .
"`` Nay , boy , I have neither the strength to bend nor yet the skill to aim with it ."
`` Why do n't you go ? ''
the old one asked politely .
"`` I suppose , '' said Peter huskily , `` I suppose I can still fly ? ''"
"You see , he had lost faith ."
"`` Poor little half-and-half , '' said Solomon , who was not really hard-hearted , `` you will never be able to fly again , not even on windy days ."
You must live here on the island always . ''
`` And never even go to the Kensington Gardens ? ''
Peter asked tragically .
`` How could you get across ? ''
said Solomon .
"He promised very kindly , however , to teach Peter as many of the bird ways as could be learned by one of such an awkward shape ."
`` Then I sha 'n' t be exactly a human ? ''
Peter asked .
`` No . ''
`` Nor exactly a bird ? ''
`` No . ''
`` What shall I be ? ''
"`` You will be a Betwixt-and-Between , '' Solomon said , and certainly he was a wise old fellow , for that is exactly how it turned out ."
The birds on the island never got used to him .
"His oddities tickled them every day , as if they were quite new , though it was really the birds that were new ."
"They came out of the eggs daily , and laughed at him at once , then off they soon flew to be humans , and other birds came out of other eggs , and so it went on forever ."
"The crafty mother-birds , when they tired of sitting on their eggs , used to get the young one to break their shells a day before the right time by whispering to them that now was their chance to see Peter washing or drinking or eating ."
"Thousands gathered round him daily to watch him do these things , just as you watch the peacocks , and they screamed with delight when he lifted the crusts they flung him with his hands instead of in the usual way with the mouth ."
All his food was brought to him from the Gardens at Solomon 's orders by the birds .
"He would not eat worms or insects -LRB- which they thought very silly of him -RRB- , so they brought him bread in their beaks ."
"Thus , when you cry out , `` Greedy !"
Greedy ! ''
"to the bird that flies away with the big crust , you know now that you ought not to do this , for he is very likely taking it to Peter Pan ."
Peter wore no night-gown now .
"You see , the birds were always begging him for bits of it to line their nests with , and , being very good-natured , he could not refuse , so by Solomon 's advice he had hidden what was left of it ."
"But , though he was now quite naked , you must not think that he was cold or unhappy ."
"He was usually very happy and gay , and the reason was that Solomon had kept his promise and taught him many of the bird ways ."
I did n't dare ask him to the house for I knew Anthony was in one of his moods .
But it 's time something was done .
She 's woman grown and this is no life for her .
"And there 's nobody to do anything but me and I 'm not able , even if I knew what to do ."
I wonder why she hates men so .
Perhaps it 's because she never knew any that were real gentlemen .
This man is -- but then he 's a minister and that makes a wide gulf between them in another way .
I 've seen the love of man and woman bridge some wider gulfs though .
"But it ca n't with Lynde , I 'm fearing ."
She 's so bitter at the mere speaking of love and marriage .
I ca n't think why .
"I 'm sure her mother and Anthony were happy together , and that was all she 's ever seen of marriage ."
But I thought when she told me of meeting this young man on the shore there was something in her look I 'd never noticed before -- as if she 'd found something in herself she 'd never known was there .
But she 'll never make friends with him and I ca n't .
"If the Captain was n't so queer -- '' She stopped abruptly , for a tall lithe figure was coming up from the shore ."
Lynde waved her hand as she drew near .
"`` Oh , Emily , I 've had such a splendid sail ."
It was glorious .
"Bad Emily , you 've been carrying water ."
Did n't I tell you never to do that when I was away ? ''
`` I did n't have to do it .
That young minister up at Rexton met me and brought it up .
"He 's nice , Lynde . ''"
Lynde 's brow darkened .
She turned and walked away to the house without a word .
On his way home that night Alan met Isabel King on the main shore road .
She carried an armful of pine boughs and said she wanted the needles for a cushion .
"Yet the thought came into Alan 's mind that she was spying on him and , although he tried to dismiss it as unworthy , it continued to lurk there ."
"For a week he avoided the shore , but there came a day when its inexplicable lure drew him to it again irresistibly ."
"It was a warm , windy evening and the air was sweet and resinous , the lake misty and blue ."
There was no sign of life about Four Winds and the shore seemed as lonely and virgin as if human foot had never trodden it .
"The Captain 's yacht was gone from the little harbour where it was generally anchored and , though every flutter of wind in the scrub firs made Alan 's heart beat expectantly , he saw nothing of Lynde Oliver ."
"`` Well , all our men folk have gone now -- Jem and Walter and Shirley and Jerry and Carl ."
And none of them had to be driven to it .
So we have a right to be proud .
But pride -- '' Susan sighed bitterly -- `` pride is cold company and that there is no gainsaying . ''
"The moon sank lower into a black cloud in the west , the Glen went out in an eclipse of sudden shadow -- and thousands of miles away the Canadian boys in khaki -- the living and the dead -- were in possession of Vimy Ridge ."
Vimy Ridge is a name written in crimson and gold on the Canadian annals of the Great War .
"`` The British could n't take it and the French could n't take it , '' said a German prisoner to his captors , `` but you Canadians are such fools that you do n't know when a place ca n't be taken ! ''"
So the `` fools '' took it -- and paid the price .
"Jerry Meredith was seriously wounded at Vimy Ridge -- shot in the back , the telegram said ."
"`` Poor Nan , '' said Mrs. Blythe , when the news came ."
She thought of her own happy girlhood at old Green Gables .
There had been no tragedy like this in it .
How the girls of to-day had to suffer !
When Nan came home from Redmond two weeks later her face showed what those weeks had meant to her .
"John Meredith , too , seemed to have grown old suddenly in them ."
"Faith did not come home ; she was on her way across the Atlantic as a V.A.D. Di had tried to wring from her father consent to her going also , but had been told that for her mother 's sake it could not be given ."
"So Di , after a flying visit home , went back to her Red Cross work in Kingsport ."
The mayflowers bloomed in the secret nooks of Rainbow Valley .
Rilla was watching for them .
"Jem had once taken his mother the earliest mayflowers ; Walter brought them to her when Jem was gone ; last spring Shirley had sought them out for her ; now , Rilla thought she must take the boys ' place in this ."
"But before she had discovered any , Bruce Meredith came to Ingleside one twilight with his hands full of delicate pink sprays ."
He stalked up the steps of the veranda and laid them on Mrs. Blythe 's lap .
"`` Because Shirley is n't here to bring them , '' he said in his funny , shy , blunt way ."
"`` And you thought of this , you darling , '' said Anne , her lips quivering , as she looked at the stocky , black-browed little chap , standing before her , with his hands thrust into his pockets ."
"`` I wrote Jem to-day and told him not to worry ` bout you not getting your mayflowers , '' said Bruce seriously , '' 'cause I 'd see to that ."
"And I told him I would be ten pretty soon now , so it wo n't be very long before I 'll be eighteen , and then I 'll go to help him fight , and maybe let him come home for a rest while I took his place ."
"I wrote Jerry , too ."
"Jerry 's getting better , you know . ''"
`` Is he ?
Have you had any good news about him ? ''
`` Yes .
"Mother had a letter to-day , and it said he was out of danger . ''"
"To put it with brutal frankness , there never was a cockier boy ."
But for the moment Wendy was shocked .
"` You conceit , ' she exclaimed , with frightful sarcasm ; ` of course I did nothing ! '"
"` You did a little , ' Peter said carelessly , and continued to dance . '"
A little ! '
she replied with hauteur ; ` if I am no use I can at least withdraw ' ; and she sprang in the most dignified way into bed and covered her face with the blankets .
"To induce her to look up he pretended to be going away , and when this failed he sat on the end of the bed and tapped her gently with his foot ."
"` Wendy , ' he said , ` do n't withdraw ."
"I ca n't help crowing , Wendy , when I 'm pleased with myself . '"
"Still she would not look up , though she was listening eagerly ."
"` Wendy , ' he continued , in a voice that no woman has ever yet been able to resist , ` Wendy , one girl is more use than twenty boys . '"
"Now Wendy was every inch a woman , though there were not very many inches , and she peeped out of the bedclothes ."
"` Do you really think so , Peter ? '"
"` Yes , I do . ' '"
"I think it 's perfectly sweet of you , ' she declared , ` and I 'll get up again ' ; and she sat with him on the side of the bed ."
"She also said she would give him a kiss if he liked , but Peter did not know what she meant , and he held out his hand expectantly ."
` Surely you know what a kiss is ? '
"she asked , aghast . '"
"I shall know when you give it to me , ' he replied stiffly ; and not to hurt his feelings she gave him a thimble ."
"` Now , ' said he , ` shall I give you a kiss ? '"
"and she replied with a slight primness , ` If you please . '"
"She made herself rather cheap by inclining her face toward him , but he merely dropped an acorn button into her hand ; so she slowly returned her face to where it had been before , and said nicely that she would wear his kiss on the chain round her neck ."
"It was lucky that she did put it on that chain , for it was afterwards to save her life ."
"When people in our set are introduced , it is customary for them to ask each other 's age , and so Wendy , who always liked to do the correct thing , asked Peter how old he was ."
"It was not really a happy question to ask him ; it was like an examination paper that asks grammar , when what you want to be asked is Kings of England . '"
"I do n't know , ' he replied uneasily , ` but I am quite young . '"
"He really knew nothing about it ; he had merely suspicions , but he said at a venture , ` Wendy , I ran away the day I was born . '"
"Wendy was quite surprised , but interested ; and she indicated in the charming drawing-room manner , by a touch on her night-gown , that he could sit nearer her ."
"` It was because I heard father and mother , ' he explained in a low voice , ` talking about what I was to be when I became a man . '"
He was extraordinarily agitated now . '
"I do n't want ever to be a man , ' he said with passion . '"
I want always to be a little boy and to have fun .
"`` Whoever it was had better tell , and not wait to be found out , '' said Demi , looking as if an awful misfortune had befallen the family ."
"`` I know you think it 's me , '' broke out Nat , red and excited ."
"`` You are the only one who knew where it was , '' said Franz ."
`` I ca n't help it I did n't take it .
I tell you I did n't I did n't ! ''
"cried Nat , in a desperate sort of way ."
"`` Gently , gently , my son !"
What is all this noise about ? ''
and Mr. Bhaer walked in among them .
"Tommy repeated the story of his loss , and , as he listened , Mr. Bhaer 's face grew graver and graver ; for , with all their faults and follies , the lads till now had been honest ."
"`` Take your seats , '' he said ; and , when all were in their places , he added slowly , as his eye went from face to face with a grieved look , that was harder to bear than a storm of words , `` Now , boys , I shall ask each one of you a single question , and I want an honest answer ."
"I am not going to try to frighten , bribe , or surprise the truth out of you , for every one of you have got a conscience , and know what it is for ."
"Now is the time to undo the wrong done to Tommy , and set yourselves right before us all ."
I can forgive the yielding to sudden temptation much easier than I can deceit .
"Do n't add a lie to the theft , but confess frankly , and we will all try to help you make us forget and forgive . ''"
"He paused a moment , and one might have heard a pin drop , the room was so still ; then slowly and impressively he put the question to each one , receiving the same answer in varying tones from all ."
There is really nothing at all but scenery . ''
"`` Out of your world perhaps , Susan -- but not out of mine , '' said Anne with a faint smile ."
"`` I do not quite understand you , Mrs. Doctor , dear , but of course I am not well educated ."
"But if Dr. Blythe buys the Morgan place he will make no mistake , and that you may tie to ."
"They have water in it , and the pantries and closets are beautiful , and there is not another such cellar in P. E. Island , so I have been told ."
"Why , the cellar here , Mrs. Doctor , dear , has been a heart-break to me , as well you know . ''"
"`` Oh , go away , Susan , go away , '' said Anne forlornly ."
`` Cellars and pantries and closets do n't make a HOME .
Why do n't you weep with those who weep ? ''
"`` Well , I never was much hand for weeping , Mrs. Doctor , dear ."
I would rather fall to and cheer people up than weep with them .
"Now , do not you cry and spoil your pretty eyes ."
"This house is very well and has served your turn , but it is high time you had a better . ''"
Susan 's point of view seemed to be that of most people .
Leslie was the only one who sympathised understandingly with Anne .
"She had a good cry , too , when she heard the news ."
"If you 'd sassed her back , I 'd have thought she deserved it and would n't have blamed you a mite , but I would n't have bothered coming to talk to you either ."
"Well , well well !"
"Poor child , do n't cry ."
You just pick up and go home .
I 'll make it all right with Tom .
"You 're pretty near played out yourself , I can see that ."
"But a summer in Fir Cottage , with plenty of cream and eggs and my cookery , will soon make another girl of you ."
Do n't you dare to thank me .
It 's a privilege to be able to do something for Mary Carvell 's girls .
I just loved Mary . ''
"The upshot of the whole matter was that Marcella and Patty went , two days later , to Dalesboro , where Miss Draper gave them a hearty welcome to Fir Cottage -- a quaint , delightful little house circled by big Scotch firs and overgrown with vines ."
Never were such delightful weeks as those that followed .
Patty came rapidly back to health and strength .
"As for Marcella , Miss Draper 's prophecy was also fulfilled ; she soon looked and felt like another girl ."
"The dismal years of drudgery behind her were forgotten like a dream , and she lived wholly in the beautiful present , in the walks and drives , the flowers and grass slopes , and in the pleasant household duties which she shared with Miss Draper ."
"`` I love housework , '' she exclaimed one September day ."
`` I do n't like the thought of going back to the store a bit . ''
"`` Well , you 're not going back , '' calmly said Miss Draper , who had a habit of arranging other people 's business for them that might have been disconcerting had it not been for her keen insight and hearty good sense ."
`` You 're going to stay here with me -- you and Patty .
"I do n't propose to die of lonesomeness losing you , and I need somebody to help me about the house ."
I 've thought it all out .
"You are to call me Aunt Josephine , and Patty is to go to school ."
"I had this scheme in mind from the first , but I thought I 'd wait to see how we got along living in the same house , and how you liked it here , before I spoke out ."
"No , you need n't thank me this time either ."
I 'm doing this every bit as much for my sake as yours .
"Well , that 's all settled ."
"Patty wo n't object , bless her rosy cheeks ! ''"
`` Oh ! ''
"said Marcella , with eyes shining through her tears ."
"`` I 'm so happy , dear Miss Draper -- I mean Aunt Josephine ."
I 'll love to stay here -- and I will thank you . ''
`` Fudge ! ''
Alan shook his head .
"`` No , that has nothing to do with it . ''"
`` And you wo n't come back ? ''
`` It is not a question of will .
I can not -- must not go . ''
"`` Lynde will break her heart then , '' said Emily in a tone of despair ."
`` I think not .
She is too strong and fine for that .
Help her all you can with sympathy but do n't torment her with any questions .
"You may tell her if you like that I advise her to confide the whole story to you , but if she can not do n't tease her to ."
Be very gentle with her . ''
`` You do n't need to tell me that .
I 'd rather die than hurt her .
I came here full of anger against you -- but I see now you are not to blame .
You are suffering too -- your face tells that .
"All the same , I wish you 'd never set foot in Four Winds ."
She was n't happy before but she was n't so miserable as she is now .
"Oh , I know Anthony is at the bottom of it all in some way but I wo n't ask you any more questions since you do n't feel free to answer them ."
But are you sure that nothing can be done to clear up the trouble ? ''
"`` Too sure , '' said Alan 's white lips ."
* * * * * The autumn dragged away .
Alan found out how much a man may suffer and yet go on living and working .
"As for that , his work was all that made life possible for him now and he flung himself into it with feverish energy , growing so thin and hollow-eyed over it that even Elder Trewin remonstrated and suggested a vacation -- a suggestion at which Alan merely smiled ."
A vacation which would take him away from Lynde 's neighbourhood -- the thought was not to be entertained .
"He never saw Lynde , for he never went to any part of the shore now ; yet he hungered constantly for the sight of her , the sound of her voice , the glance of her luminous eyes ."
"When he pictured her eating her heart out in the solitude of Four Winds , he clenched his hands in despair ."
"As for the possibility of Harmon 's return , Alan could never face it for a moment ."
"When it thrust its ugly presence into his thoughts , he put it away desperately ."
The man was dead -- or his fickle fancy had veered elsewhere .
Nothing else could explain his absence .
"But they could never know , and the uncertainty would forever stand between him and Lynde like a spectre ."
But he thought more of Lynde 's pain than his own .
"`` She 's bound to be across now , '' I whispered ."
"`` Na , '' said Alan , `` her foot still sounds boss * upon the bridge . ''"
* Hollow .
And just then -- `` Who goes ? ''
"cried a voice , and we heard the butt of a musket rattle on the stones ."
"I must suppose the sentry had been sleeping , so that had we tried , we might have passed unseen ; but he was awake now , and the chance forfeited ."
"`` This 'll never do , '' said Alan ."
"`` This 'll never , never do for us , David . ''"
"And without another word , he began to crawl away through the fields ; and a little after , being well out of eye-shot , got to his feet again , and struck along a road that led to the eastward ."
"I could not conceive what he was doing ; and indeed I was so sharply cut by the disappointment , that I was little likely to be pleased with anything ."
"A moment back and I had seen myself knocking at Mr. Rankeillor 's door to claim my inheritance , like a hero in a ballad ; and here was I back again , a wandering , hunted blackguard , on the wrong side of Forth ."
`` Well ? ''
"said I. `` Well , '' said Alan , `` what would ye have ?"
They 're none such fools as I took them for .
"We have still the Forth to pass , Davie -- weary fall the rains that fed and the hillsides that guided it ! ''"
`` And why go east ? ''
"said I. `` Ou , just upon the chance ! ''"
said he .
"`` If we cannae pass the river , we 'll have to see what we can do for the firth . ''"
"`` There are fords upon the river , and none upon the firth , '' said I. `` To be sure there are fords , and a bridge forbye , '' quoth Alan ; `` and of what service , when they are watched ? ''"
"`` Well , '' said I , `` but a river can be swum . ''"
"`` By them that have the skill of it , '' returned he ; `` but I have yet to hear that either you or me is much of a hand at that exercise ; and for my own part , I swim like a stone . ''"
"`` I 'm not up to you in talking back , Alan , '' I said ; `` but I can see we 're making bad worse ."
"If it 's hard to pass a river , it stands to reason it must be worse to pass a sea . ''"
"`` But there 's such a thing as a boat , '' says Alan , `` or I 'm the more deceived . ''"
"`` Ay , and such a thing as money , '' says I. `` But for us that have neither one nor other , they might just as well not have been invented . ''"
`` Ye think so ? ''
said Alan .
"`` I do that , '' said I. `` David , '' says he , `` ye 're a man of small invention and less faith ."
"But let me set my wits upon the hone , and if I cannae beg , borrow , nor yet steal a boat , I 'll make one ! ''"
`` I think I see ye ! ''
"said I. `` And what 's more than all that : if ye pass a bridge , it can tell no tales ; but if we pass the firth , there 's the boat on the wrong side -- somebody must have brought it -- the country-side will all be in a bizz -- '' `` Man ! ''"
And there was a wind that came dancing and whistling up the channel to replace the beautiful silence with a music more beautiful still .
The rest of the folks were just coming downstairs when I got back to breakfast .
"They were all yawny , and some were grumpy , but I had washed my being in the sunrise and felt as blithesome as the day ."
"Oh , life is so good to live !"
"Tomorrow Uncle James 's new vessel , the White Lady , is to be launched ."
"We are going to make a festive occasion of it , and I am to christen her with a bottle of cobwebby old wine ."
"But I hear the carriage , and Aunt Jane is calling me ."
"I had a great deal more to say -- about your letter , your big `` round-up '' and your tribulations with your Chinese cook -- but I 've only time now to say goodbye ."
"You wish me a lovely time at the dance and a full programme , do n't you ?"
"Yours sincerely , Sidney Richmond ."
Aunt Jane came home presently and carried away her sleeping baby .
"Sidney said her prayers , went to bed , and slept soundly and serenely ."
"She mailed her letter the next day , and a month later an answer came ."
"Sidney read it as soon as she left the post office , and walked the rest of the way home as in a nightmare , staring straight ahead of her with wide-open , unseeing brown eyes ."
"John Lincoln 's letter was short , but the pertinent paragraph of it burned itself into Sidney 's brain ."
He wrote : I am going east for a visit .
"It is six years since I was home , and it seems like three times six ."
"I shall go by the C.P.R. , which passes through Plainfield , and I mean to stop off for a day ."
"You will let me call and see you , wo n't you ?"
"I shall have to take your permission for granted , as I shall be gone before a letter from you can reach the Bar N. I leave for the east in five days , and shall look forward to our meeting with all possible interest and pleasure ."
"Sidney did not sleep that night , but tossed restlessly about or cried in her pillow ."
"She was so pallid and hollow-eyed the next morning that Aunt Jane noticed it , and asked her what the matter was ."
"`` Nothing , '' said Sidney sharply ."
Sidney had never spoken sharply to her aunt before .
The good woman shook her head .
She was afraid the child was `` taking something . ''
"`` Do n't do much today , Siddy , '' she said kindly ."
`` Just lie around and take it easy till you get rested up .
I 'll fix you a dose of quinine . ''
Sidney refused to lie around and take it easy .
"She swallowed the quinine meekly enough , but she worked fiercely all day , hunting out superfluous tasks to do ."
"That night she slept the sleep of exhaustion , but her dreams were unenviable and the awakening was terrible ."
Joanna !
"Nay , by the sacred rood !"
where is she ?
"Host , where is that girl ? ''"
"`` Girl , Sir Daniel ? ''"
cried the landlord .
"`` Nay , sir , I saw no girl . ''"
"`` Boy , then , dotard ! ''"
cried the knight .
`` Could ye not see it was a wench ?
"She in the murrey-coloured mantle -- she that broke her fast with water , rogue -- where is she ? ''"
"`` Nay , the saints bless us !"
"Master John , ye called him , '' said the host ."
"`` Well , I thought none evil ."
He is gone .
I saw him -- her -- I saw her in the stable a good hour agone ; ' a was saddling a grey horse . ''
"`` Now , by the rood ! ''"
"cried Sir Daniel , `` the wench was worth five hundred pound to me and more . ''"
"`` Sir knight , '' observed the messenger , with bitterness , `` while that ye are here , roaring for five hundred pounds , the realm of England is elsewhere being lost and won . ''"
"`` It is well said , '' replied Sir Daniel ."
"`` Selden , fall me out with six cross-bowmen ; hunt me her down ."
"I care not what it cost ; but , at my returning , let me find her at the Moat House ."
Be it upon your head .
"And now , sir messenger , we march . ''"
"And the troop broke into a good trot , and Selden and his six men were left behind upon the street of Kettley , with the staring villagers ."
CHAPTER II -- IN THE FEN It was near six in the May morning when Dick began to ride down into the fen upon his homeward way .
The sky was all blue ; the jolly wind blew loud and steady ; the windmill-sails were spinning ; and the willows over all the fen rippling and whitening like a field of corn .
"He had been all night in the saddle , but his heart was good and his body sound , and he rode right merrily ."
"The path went down and down into the marsh , till he lost sight of all the neighbouring landmarks but Kettley windmill on the knoll behind him , and the extreme top of Tunstall Forest far before ."
"On either hand there were great fields of blowing reeds and willows , pools of water shaking in the wind , and treacherous bogs , as green as emerald , to tempt and to betray the traveller ."
The path lay almost straight through the morass .
"It was already very ancient ; its foundation had been laid by Roman soldiery ; in the lapse of ages much of it had sunk , and every here and there , for a few hundred yards , it lay submerged below the stagnant waters of the fen ."
She always looks as if she 'd just been starched and ironed .
"Well , poor Marilla is going to have her hands full this winter and no mistake ."
"Still , I do n't see that she could do anything less than take them , under the circumstances , and she 'll have Anne to help her ."
"Anne 's tickled to death over the whole business , and she has a real knacky way with children , I must say ."
"Dear me , it does n't seem a day since poor Matthew brought Anne herself home and everybody laughed at the idea of Marilla bringing up a child ."
And now she has adopted twins .
You 're never safe from being surprised till you 're dead . ''
The fat pony jogged over the bridge in Lynde 's Hollow and along the Green Gables lane .
Marilla 's face was rather grim .
It was ten miles from East Grafton and Davy Keith seemed to be possessed with a passion for perpetual motion .
"It was beyond Marilla 's power to make him sit still and she had been in an agony the whole way lest he fall over the back of the wagon and break his neck , or tumble over the dashboard under the pony 's heels ."
In despair she finally threatened to whip him soundly when she got him home .
"Whereupon Davy climbed into her lap , regardless of the reins , flung his chubby arms about her neck and gave her a bear-like hug ."
"`` I do n't believe you mean it , '' he said , smacking her wrinkled cheek affectionately ."
`` You do n't LOOK like a lady who 'd whip a little boy just 'cause he could n't keep still .
Did n't you find it awful hard to keep still when you was only 's old as me ? ''
"`` No , I always kept still when I was told , '' said Marilla , trying to speak sternly , albeit she felt her heart waxing soft within her under Davy 's impulsive caresses ."
"`` Well , I s ` pose that was 'cause you was a girl , '' said Davy , squirming back to his place after another hug ."
"`` You WAS a girl once , I s ` pose , though it 's awful funny to think of it ."
Dora can sit still ... but there ai n't much fun in it I do n't think .
Seems to me it must be slow to be a girl .
"Here , Dora , let me liven you up a bit . ''"
Davy 's method of `` livening up '' was to grasp Dora 's curls in his fingers and give them a tug .
Dora shrieked and then cried .
`` How can you be such a naughty boy and your poor mother just laid in her grave this very day ? ''
demanded Marilla despairingly .
"`` But she was glad to die , '' said Davy confidentially ."
"`` I know , 'cause she told me so ."
She was awful tired of being sick .
We 'd a long talk the night before she died .
She told me you was going to take me and Dora for the winter and I was to be a good boy .
"I 'm going to be good , but ca n't you be good running round just as well as sitting still ?"
"Often crushed by so many passing feet it gave out its essence freely , and the spicy odour hung round them like a soundless , invisible benediction ."
"Ken looked up at Rilla , whose hair was shining in the moonlight and whose eyes were pools of allurement ."
All at once he felt sure there was nothing in that gossip about Fred Arnold .
"`` Rilla , '' he said in a sudden , intense whisper , `` you are the sweetest thing . ''"
Rilla flushed and looked at Susan .
"Ken looked , too , and saw that Susan 's back was turned ."
He put his arm about Rilla and kissed her .
It was the first time Rilla had ever been kissed .
She thought perhaps she ought to resent it but she did n't .
"Instead , she glanced timidly into Kenneth 's seeking eyes and her glance was a kiss ."
"`` Rilla-my-Rilla , '' said Ken , `` will you promise that you wo n't let anyone else kiss you until I come back ? ''"
"`` Yes , '' said Rilla , trembling and thrilling ."
Susan was turning round .
Ken loosened his hold and stepped to the walk .
"`` Good-bye , '' he said casually ."
Rilla heard herself saying it just as casually .
"She stood and watched him down the walk , out of the gate , and down the road ."
"When the fir wood hid him from her sight she suddenly said `` Oh , '' in a choked way and ran down to the gate , sweet blossomy things catching at her skirts as she ran ."
"Leaning over the gate she saw Kenneth walking briskly down the road , over the bars of tree shadows and moonlight , his tall , erect figure grey in the white radiance ."
As he reached the turn he stopped and looked back and saw her standing amid the tall white lilies by the gate .
He waved his hand -- she waved hers -- he was gone around the turn .
"Rilla stood there for a little while , gazing across the fields of mist and silver ."
She had heard her mother say that she loved turns in roads -- they were so provocative and alluring .
Rilla thought she hated them .
She had seen Jem and Jerry vanish from her around a bend in the road -- then Walter -- and now Ken .
"Brothers and playmate and sweetheart -- they were all gone , never , it might be , to return ."
Yet still the Piper piped and the dance of death went on .
When Rilla walked slowly back to the house Susan was still sitting by the veranda table and Susan was sniffing suspiciously .
"`` I have been thinking , Rilla dear , of the old days in the House of Dreams , when Kenneth 's mother and father were courting and Jem was a little baby and you were not born or thought of ."
It was a very romantic affair and she and your mother were such chums .
To think I should have lived to see her son going to the front .
As if she had not had enough trouble in her early life without this coming upon her !
`` He wished Miranda many happy returns of the day .
"She did not look very happy , but perhaps you could not expect that under the circumstances . ''"
"`` Anyhow , '' thought Rilla , `` I can write a perfectly killing account of it all to the boys ."
How Jem will howl over Sir Wilfrid 's part in it ! ''
But if Rilla was rather disappointed in the war wedding she found nothing lacking on Friday morning when Miranda said good-bye to her bridegroom at the Glen station .
"The dawn was white as a pearl , clear as a diamond ."
Behind the station the balsamy copse of young firs was frost-misted .
The cold moon of dawn hung over the westering snow fields but the golden fleeces of sunrise shone above the maples up at Ingleside .
Joe took his pale little bride in his arms and she lifted her face to his .
Rilla choked suddenly .
It did not matter that Miranda was insignificant and commonplace and flat-featured .
It did not matter that she was the daughter of Whiskers-on-the-moon .
"All that mattered was that rapt , sacrificial look in her eyes -- that ever-burning , sacred fire of devotion and loyalty and fine courage that she was mutely promising Joe she and thousands of other women would keep alive at home while their men held the Western front ."
"Rilla walked away , realising that she must not spy on such a moment ."
"She went down to the end of the platform where Sir Wilfrid and Dog Monday were sitting , looking at each other ."
Sir Wilfrid remarked condescendingly : `` Why do you haunt this old shed when you might lie on the hearthrug at Ingleside and live on the fat of the land ?
Is it a pose ?
Or a fixed idea ? ''
"Whereat Dog Monday , laconically : `` I have a tryst to keep . ''"
When the train had gone Rilla rejoined the little trembling Miranda .
"`` Well , he 's gone , '' said Miranda , `` and he may never come back -- but I 'm his wife , and I 'm going to be worthy of him ."
I 'm going home . ''
`` Do n't you think you had better come with me now ? ''
asked Rilla doubtfully .
Nobody knew yet how Mr. Pryor had taken the matter .
`` No .
"If Joe can face the Huns I guess I can face father , '' said Miranda daringly ."
`` A soldier 's wife ca n't be a coward .
"Come on , Wilfy ."
I 'll go straight home and meet the worst . ''
"There was nothing very dreadful to face , however ."
"Perhaps Mr. Pryor had reflected that housekeepers were hard to get and that there were many Milgrave homes open to Miranda -- also , that there was such a thing as a separation allowance ."
And then what an unthinkable predicament I should have been in !
"`` When poor Fred became convinced that I could n't promise him , he behaved beautifully -- though that rather made things worse ."
"If he had been nasty about it I would n't have felt so heartbroken and remorseful -- though why I should feel remorseful I do n't know , for I never encouraged Fred to think I cared a bit about him ."
Yet feel remorseful I did -- and do .
"If Fred Arnold never comes back from overseas , this will haunt me all my life ."
"`` Then Fred said if he could n't take my love with him to the trenches at least he wanted to feel that he had my friendship , and would I kiss him just once in good-bye before he went -- perhaps for ever ?"
"`` I do n't know how I could ever had imagined that love affairs were delightful , interesting things ."
They are horrible .
"I could n't even give poor heartbroken Fred one little kiss , because of my promise to Ken ."
It seemed so brutal .
"I had to tell Fred that of course he would have my friendship , but that I could n't kiss him because I had promised somebody else I would n't ."
"`` He said , ` It is -- is it -- Ken Ford ? '"
`` I nodded .
It seemed dreadful to have to tell it -- it was such a sacred little secret just between me and Ken .
`` When Fred went away I came up here to my room and cried so long and so bitterly that mother came up and insisted on knowing what was the matter .
I told her .
"She listened to my tale with an expression that clearly said , ` Can it be possible that anyone has been wanting to marry this baby ? '"
"But she was so nice and understanding and sympathetic , oh , just so race-of-Josephy -- that I felt indescribably comforted ."
Mothers are the dearest things . ''
"` But oh , mother , ' I sobbed , ` he wanted me to kiss him good-bye -- and I could n't -- and that hurt me worse than all the rest . ' ''"
"` Well , why did n't you kiss him ? '"
asked mother coolly .
"` Considering the circumstances , I think you might have . ' ''"
"` But I could n't , mother -- I promised Ken when he went away that I would n't kiss anybody else until he came back . '"
`` This was another high explosive for poor mother .
"She exclaimed , with the queerest little catch in her voice , ` Rilla , are you engaged to Kenneth Ford ? ' ''"
"` I -- do n't -- know , ' I sobbed . ''"
` You -- do n't -- know ? '
repeated mother .
"`` Then I had to tell her the whole story , too ; and every time I tell it it seems sillier and sillier to imagine that Ken meant anything serious ."
I felt idiotic and ashamed by the time I got through .
`` Mother sat a little while in silence .
"`` Good shrew , let laugh , I pray you ."
"An ye could see yourself , I warrant ye would laugh the first . ''"
"`` Well , '' cried the lad , flushing , `` ye shall answer this when ye answer for the other ."
Laugh while yet ye may ! ''
"`` Nay , now , good cousin , '' replied Sir Daniel , with some earnestness , `` think not that I mock at you , except in mirth , as between kinsfolk and singular friends ."
"I will make you a marriage of a thousand pounds , go to !"
and cherish you exceedingly .
"I took you , indeed , roughly , as the time demanded ; but from henceforth I shall ungrudgingly maintain and cheerfully serve you ."
"Ye shall be Mrs. Shelton -- Lady Shelton , by my troth !"
for the lad promiseth bravely .
Tut !
ye will not shy for honest laughter ; it purgeth melancholy .
"They are no rogues who laugh , good cousin ."
"Good mine host , lay me a meal now for my cousin , Master John ."
"Sit ye down , sweetheart , and eat . ''"
"`` Nay , '' said Master John , `` I will break no bread ."
"Since ye force me to this sin , I will fast for my soul 's interest ."
"But , good mine host , I pray you of courtesy give me a cup of fair water ; I shall be much beholden to your courtesy indeed . ''"
"`` Ye shall have a dispensation , go to ! ''"
cried the knight .
"`` Shalt be well shriven , by my faith !"
"Content you , then , and eat . ''"
"But the lad was obstinate , drank a cup of water , and , once more wrapping himself closely in his mantle , sat in a far corner , brooding ."
"In an hour or two , there rose a stir in the village of sentries challenging and the clatter of arms and horses ; and then a troop drew up by the inn door , and Richard Shelton , splashed with mud , presented himself upon the threshold ."
"`` Save you , Sir Daniel , '' he said ."
`` How !
Dickie Shelton ! ''
cried the knight ; and at the mention of Dick 's name the other lad looked curiously across .
`` What maketh Bennet Hatch ? ''
"`` Please you , sir knight , to take cognisance of this packet from Sir Oliver , wherein are all things fully stated , '' answered Richard , presenting the priest 's letter ."
"`` And please you farther , ye were best make all speed to Risingham ; for on the way hither we encountered one riding furiously with letters , and by his report , my Lord of Risingham was sore bested , and lacked exceedingly your presence . ''"
`` How say you ?
And it turned out that the dog was a lion and my Very Brave Aunt had druv him into the barn with a stick .
It was a wonder she was not et up but she was very brave .
Emerson Gillis says if she thought it was a dog she was n't any braver than if it really was a dog .
"But Emerson is jealous because he has n't got a Brave Aunt himself , nothing but uncles . ' '' '"
I have kept the best for the last .
You laugh at me because I think Paul is a genius but I am sure his letter will convince you that he is a very uncommon child .
Paul lives away down near the shore with his grandmother and he has no playmates ... no real playmates .
"You remember our School Management professor told us that we must not have ` favorites ' among our pupils , but I ca n't help loving Paul Irving the best of all mine ."
"I do n't think it does any harm , though , for everybody loves Paul , even Mrs. Lynde , who says she could never have believed she 'd get so fond of a Yankee ."
The other boys in school like him too .
There is nothing weak or girlish about him in spite of his dreams and fancies .
He is very manly and can hold his own in all games .
He fought St. Clair Donnell recently because St. Clair said the Union Jack was away ahead of the Stars and Stripes as a flag .
The result was a drawn battle and a mutual agreement to respect each other 's patriotism henceforth .
St. Clair says he can hit the HARDEST but Paul can hit the OFTENEST . ' ''
`` Paul 's Letter . ''
"` My dear teacher , '' ` You told us we might write you about some interesting people we knew ."
I think the most interesting people I know are my rock people and I mean to tell you about them .
I have never told anybody about them except grandma and father but I would like to have you know about them because you understand things .
There are a great many people who do not understand things so there is no use in telling them . ' ''
` My rock people live at the shore .
I used to visit them almost every evening before the winter came .
"Now I ca n't go till spring , but they will be there , for people like that never change ... that is the splendid thing about them ."
Nora was the first one of them I got acquainted with and so I think I love her the best .
"She lives in Andrews ' Cove and she has black hair and black eyes , and she knows all about the mermaids and the water kelpies ."
You ought to hear the stories she can tell .
Then there are the Twin Sailors .
"They do n't live anywhere , they sail all the time , but they often come ashore to talk to me ."
They are a pair of jolly tars and they have seen everything in the world ... and more than what is in the world .
Do you know what happened to the youngest Twin Sailor once ?
He was sailing and he sailed right into a moonglade .
"A moonglade is the track the full moon makes on the water when it is rising from the sea , you know , teacher ."
"They sat thus night after night recalling that fatal Friday , till every detail of it was stamped on their brains and came through on the other side like the faces on a bad coinage ."
"` If only I had not accepted that invitation to dine at 27 , ' Mrs. Darling said ."
"` If only I had not poured my medicine into Nana 's bowl , ' said Mr. Darling ."
"` If only I had pretended to like the medicine , ' was what Nana 's wet eyes said ."
"` My liking for parties , George . '"
"` My fatal gift of humour , dearest . '"
"` My touchiness about trifles , dear master and mistress . '"
"Then one or more of them would break down altogether ; Nana at the thought , ` It 's true , it 's true , they ought not to have had a dog for a nurse . '"
Many a time it was Mr. Darling who put the handkerchief to Nana 's eyes .
` That fiend ! '
"Mr. Darling would cry , and Nana 's bark was the echo of it , but Mrs. Darling never upbraided Peter ; there was something in the right-hand corner of her mouth that wanted her not to call Peter names ."
"They would sit there in the empty nursery , recalling fondly every smallest detail of that dreadful evening ."
"It had begun so uneventfully , so precisely like a hundred other evenings , with Nana putting on the water for Michael 's bath and carrying him to it on her back . '"
"I wo n't go to bed , ' he had shouted , like one who still believed that he had the last word on the subject , ' I wo n't , I wo n't ."
"Nana , it is n't six o'clock yet ."
"Oh dear , oh dear , I sha n't love you any more , Nana ."
"I tell you I wo n't be bathed , I wo n't , I wo n't ! '"
"Then Mrs. Darling had come in , wearing her white evening-gown ."
"She had dressed early because Wendy so loved to see her in her evening-gown , with the necklace George had given her ."
She was wearing Wendy 's bracelet on her arm ; she had asked for the loan of it .
Wendy so loved to lend her bracelet to her mother .
"She had found her two older children playing at being herself and father on the occasion of Wendy 's birth , and John was saying : ' I am happy to inform you , Mrs. Darling , that you are now a mother , ' in just such a tone as Mr. Darling himself may have used on the real occasion ."
"Wendy had danced with joy , just as the real Mrs. Darling must have done ."
"Then John was born , with the extra pomp that he conceived due to the birth of a male , and Michael came from his bath to ask to be born also , but John said brutally that they did not want any more ."
Michael had nearly cried .
"` Nobody wants me , ' he said , and of course the lady in evening-dress could not stand that . '"
"I do , ' she said , ' I so want a third child . '"
` Boy or girl ? '
"asked Michael , not too hopefully ."
` Boy . '
Then he had leapt into her arms .
"Such a little thing for Mr. and Mrs. Darling and Nana to recall now , but not so little if that was to be Michael 's last night in the nursery ."
A handful of archers are but now come to the ferry ; murrey and blue is their wear ; they are our butts -- they shall all taste arrows -- no man of them shall struggle through this wood .
"For , lads , we are here some fifty strong , each man of us most foully wronged ; for some they have lost lands , and some friends ; and some they have been outlawed -- all oppressed !"
"Who , then , hath done this evil ?"
"Sir Daniel , by the rood !"
Shall he then profit ?
shall he sit snug in our houses ?
shall he till our fields ?
shall he suck the bone he robbed us of ?
I trow not .
"He getteth him strength at law ; he gaineth cases ; nay , there is one case he shall not gain -- I have a writ here at my belt that , please the saints , shall conquer him . ''"
Lawless the cook was by this time already at his second horn of ale .
"He raised it , as if to pledge the speaker ."
"`` Master Ellis , '' he said , `` y ' are for vengeance -- well it becometh you !"
"-- but your poor brother o ' the greenwood , that had never lands to lose nor friends to think upon , looketh rather , for his poor part , to the profit of the thing ."
He had liever a gold noble and a pottle of canary wine than all the vengeances in purgatory . ''
"`` Lawless , '' replied the other , `` to reach the Moat House , Sir Daniel must pass the forest ."
"We shall make that passage dearer , pardy , than any battle ."
"Then , when he hath got to earth with such ragged handful as escapeth us -- all his great friends fallen and fled away , and none to give him aid -- we shall beleaguer that old fox about , and great shall be the fall of him ."
'T is a fat buck ; he will make a dinner for us all . ''
"`` Ay , '' returned Lawless , `` I have eaten many of these dinners beforehand ; but the cooking of them is hot work , good Master Ellis ."
And meanwhile what do we ?
"We make black arrows , we write rhymes , and we drink fair cold water , that discomfortable drink . ''"
"`` Y ' are untrue , Will Lawless ."
"Ye still smell of the Grey Friars ' buttery ; greed is your undoing , '' answered Ellis ."
`` We took twenty pounds from Appleyard .
We took seven marks from the messenger last night .
A day ago we had fifty from the merchant . ''
"`` And to-day , '' said one of the men , `` I stopped a fat pardoner riding apace for Holywood ."
Here is his purse . ''
Ellis counted the contents .
`` Five score shillings ! ''
he grumbled .
"Emily , who had said nothing , now spoke harshly ."
"`` Lynde is right , Mr. Douglas ."
You have no right to risk your life for a stranger .
"My advice is to go to the village for help , and Lynde and I will make a fire and watch here ."
That is all that can be expected of you or us . ''
Alan paid no heed to Emily .
Very tenderly he loosened Lynde 's hold on his arm and looked into her quivering face .
"`` You know it is my duty , Lynde , '' he said gently ."
"`` If anything can be done for that poor man , I am the only one who can do it ."
"I will come back safe , please God ."
"Be brave , dear . ''"
"Lynde , with a little moan of resignation , turned away ."
Old Emily looked on with a face of grim disapproval as Alan waded out into the surf that boiled and swirled around him in a mad whirl of foam .
"The shower of sleet had again slackened , and the wreck half a mile away , with its solitary figure , was dearly visible ."
"Alan beckoned to the man to jump overboard and swim ashore , enforcing his appeal by gestures that commanded haste before the next shower should come ."
For a few moments it seemed as if the seaman did not understand or lacked the courage or power to obey .
The next minute he had dropped from the rigging on the crest of a mighty wave and was being borne onward to the shore .
"Speedily the backwater was reached and the man , sucked down by the swirl of the wave , threw up his arms and disappeared ."
"Alan dashed in , groping , swimming ; it seemed an eternity before his hand clutched the drowning man and wrenched him from the undertow ."
"And , with the seaman in his arms , he staggered back through the foam and dropped his burden on the sand at Lynde 's feet ."
"Alan was reeling from exhaustion and chilled to the marrow , but he thought only of the man he had rescued ."
"The latter was unconscious and , as Alan bent over him , he heard Lynde give a choking little cry ."
"`` He is living still , '' said Alan ."
`` We must get him up to the house as soon as possible .
How shall we manage it ? ''
"`` Lynde and I can go and bring the Captain 's mattress down , '' said Emily ."
Now that Alan was safe she was eager to do all she could .
`` Then you and I can carry him up to the house . ''
"`` That will be best , '' said Alan ."
`` Go quickly . ''
He did not look at Lynde or he would have been shocked by the agony on her face .
She cast one glance at the prostrate man and followed Emily .
But I just want to say something that may help you over the worst when you hear that I 've gone ` west . '
"I 've a premonition about you , Rilla , as well as about myself ."
I think Ken will go back to you -- and that there are long years of happiness for you by-and-by .
"And you will tell your children of the Idea we fought and died for -- teach them it must be lived for as well as died for , else the price paid for it will have been given for nought ."
"This will be part of your work , Rilla ."
"And if you -- all you girls back in the homeland -- do it , then we who do n't come back will know that you have not ` broken faith ' with us ."
"`` I meant to write to Una tonight , too , but I wo n't have time now ."
"Read this letter to her and tell her it 's really meant for you both -- you two dear , fine loyal girls ."
"Tomorrow , when we go over the top -- I 'll think of you both -- of your laughter , Rilla-my-Rilla , and the steadfastness in Una 's blue eyes -- somehow I see those eyes very plainly tonight , too ."
"Yes , you 'll both keep faith -- I 'm sure of that -- you and Una ."
And so -- goodnight .
We go over the top at dawn . ''
Rilla read her letter over many times .
"There was a new light on her pale young face when she finally stood up , amid the asters Walter had loved , with the sunshine of autumn around her ."
"For the moment at least , she was lifted above pain and loneliness ."
"`` I will keep faith , Walter , '' she said steadily ."
"`` I will work -- and teach -- and learn -- and laugh , yes , I will even laugh -- through all my years , because of you and because of what you gave when you followed the call . ''"
Rilla meant to keep Walter 's letter as a a sacred treasure .
"But , seeing the look on Una Meredith 's face when Una had read it and held it back to her , she thought of something ."
Could she do it ?
"Oh , no , she could not give up Walter 's letter -- his last letter ."
Surely it was not selfishness to keep it .
A copy would be such a soulless thing .
"But Una -- Una had so little -- and her eyes were the eyes of a woman stricken to the heart , who yet must not cry out or ask for sympathy ."
"`` Una , would you like to have this letter -- to keep ? ''"
she asked slowly .
"`` Yes -- if you can give it to me , '' Una said dully ."
"`` Then -- you may have it , '' said Rilla hurriedly ."
"`` Thank you , '' said Una ."
"It was all she said , but there was something in her voice which repaid Rilla for her bit of sacrifice ."
Una took the letter and when Rilla had gone she pressed it against her lonely lips .
Una knew that love would never come into her life now -- it was buried for ever under the blood-stained soil `` Somewhere in France . ''
That is a pill for the Turks .
I wish I had a chance to tell the Czar just what a mistake he made when he turned Nicholas down . ''
"Susan disappeared downstairs to the kitchen , whence a dreadful thud and a piercing shriek presently sounded ."
"Everybody rushed to the kitchen -- the doctor and Miss Oliver , Mrs. Blythe , Rilla , Miranda in her wedding-veil ."
"Susan was sitting flatly in the middle of the kitchen floor with a dazed , bewildered look on her face , while Doc , evidently in his Hyde incarnation , was standing on the dresser , with his back up , his eyes blazing , and his tail the size of three tails ."
"`` Susan , what has happened ? ''"
cried Mrs. Blythe in alarm .
`` Did you fall ?
Are you hurt ? ''
Susan picked herself up .
"`` No , '' she said grimly , `` I am not hurt , though I am jarred all over ."
Do not be alarmed .
"As for what has happened -- I tried to kick that darned cat with both feet , that is what happened . ''"
Everybody shrieked with laughter .
The doctor was quite helpless .
"`` Oh , Susan , Susan , '' he gasped ."
`` That I should live to hear you swear . ''
"`` I am sorry , '' said Susan in real distress , `` that I used such an expression before two young girls ."
"But I said that beast was darned , and darned it is ."
It belongs to Old Nick . ''
"`` Do you expect it will vanish some of these days with a bang and the odour of brimstone , Susan ? ''"
"`` It will go to its own place in due time and that you may tie to , '' said Susan dourly , shaking out her raddled bones and going to her oven ."
`` I suppose my plunking down like that has shaken my cake so that it will be as heavy as lead . ''
But the cake was not heavy .
"It was all a bride 's cake should be , and Susan iced it beautifully ."
"Next day she and Rilla worked all the forenoon , making delicacies for the wedding-feast , and as soon as Miranda phoned up that her father was safely off everything was packed in a big hamper and taken down to the Pryor house ."
"Joe soon arrived in his uniform and a state of violent excitement , accompanied by his best man , Sergeant Malcolm Crawford ."
"There were quite a few guests , for all the Manse and Ingleside folk were there , and a dozen or so of Joe 's relatives , including his mother , `` Mrs. Dead Angus Milgrave , '' so called , cheerfully , to distinguish her from another lady whose Angus was living ."
"Mrs. Dead Angus wore a rather disapproving expression , not caring over-much for this alliance with the house of Whiskers-on-the-moon ."
So Miranda Pryor was married to Private Joseph Milgrave on his last leave .
It should have been a romantic wedding but it was not .
"There were too many factors working against romance , as even Rilla had to admit ."
"Well , he 's dead now and under hatches ; but for two year before that , shiver my timbers , the man was starving !"
"He begged , and he stole , and he cut throats , and starved at that , by the powers ! ''"
"`` Well , it ai n't much use , after all , '' said the young seaman . ''"
"` Tai n't much use for fools , you may lay to it -- that , nor nothing , '' cried Silver ."
"`` But now , you look here : you 're young , you are , but you 're as smart as paint ."
"I see that when I set my eyes on you , and I 'll talk to you like a man . ''"
You may imagine how I felt when I heard this abominable old rogue addressing another in the very same words of flattery as he had used to myself .
"I think , if I had been able , that I would have killed him through the barrel ."
"Meantime , he ran on , little supposing he was overheard ."
`` Here it is about gentlemen of fortune .
"They lives rough , and they risk swinging , but they eat and drink like fighting-cocks , and when a cruise is done , why , it 's hundreds of pounds instead of hundreds of farthings in their pockets ."
"Now , the most goes for rum and a good fling , and to sea again in their shirts ."
But that 's not the course I lay .
"I puts it all away , some here , some there , and none too much anywheres , by reason of suspicion ."
"I 'm fifty , mark you ; once back from this cruise , I set up gentleman in earnest ."
"Time enough too , says you ."
"Ah , but I 've lived easy in the meantime , never denied myself o ' nothing heart desires , and slep ' soft and ate dainty all my days but when at sea ."
And how did I begin ?
"Before the mast , like you ! ''"
"`` Well , '' said the other , `` but all the other money 's gone now , ai n't it ?"
You dare n't show face in Bristol after this . ''
"`` Why , where might you suppose it was ? ''"
asked Silver derisively .
"`` At Bristol , in banks and places , '' answered his companion ."
"`` It were , '' said the cook ; `` it were when we weighed anchor ."
But my old missis has it all by now .
"And the Spy-glass is sold , lease and goodwill and rigging ; and the old girl 's off to meet me ."
"I would tell you where , for I trust you , but it 'd make jealousy among the mates . ''"
`` And can you trust your missis ? ''
asked the other .
"`` Gentlemen of fortune , '' returned the cook , `` usually trusts little among themselves , and right they are , you may lay to it ."
"But I have a way with me , I have ."
"Take him by the knees , good Master Shelton , while I lift him by the shoulders , and let us lay him in his house ."
This will be a rare shog to poor Sir Oliver ; he will turn paper colour ; he will pray like a windmill . ''
"They took up the old archer , and carried him between them into his house , where he had dwelt alone ."
"And there they laid him on the floor , out of regard for the mattress , and sought , as best they might , to straighten and compose his limbs ."
Appleyard 's house was clean and bare .
"There was a bed , with a blue cover , a cupboard , a great chest , a pair of joint-stools , a hinged table in the chimney corner , and hung upon the wall the old soldier 's armoury of bows and defensive armour ."
Hatch began to look about him curiously .
"`` Nick had money , '' he said ."
`` He may have had three score pounds put by .
I would I could light upo n't !
"When ye lose an old friend , Master Richard , the best consolation is to heir him ."
"See , now , this chest ."
I would go a mighty wager there is a bushel of gold therein .
"He had a strong hand to get , and a hard hand to keep withal , had Appleyard the archer ."
Now may God rest his spirit !
"Near eighty year he was afoot and about , and ever getting ; but now he 's on the broad of his back , poor shrew , and no more lacketh ; and if his chattels came to a good friend , he would be merrier , methinks , in heaven . ''"
"`` Come , Hatch , '' said Dick , `` respect his stone-blind eyes ."
Would ye rob the man before his body ?
"Nay , he would walk ! ''"
"Hatch made several signs of the cross ; but by this time his natural complexion had returned , and he was not easily to be dashed from any purpose ."
"It would have gone hard with the chest had not the gate sounded , and presently after the door of the house opened and admitted a tall , portly , ruddy , black-eyed man of near fifty , in a surplice and black robe ."
"`` Appleyard '' -- the newcomer was saying , as he entered ; but he stopped dead ."
`` Ave Maria ! ''
he cried .
`` Saints be our shield !
What cheer is this ? ''
"`` Cold cheer with Appleyard , sir parson , '' answered Hatch , with perfect cheerfulness ."
"`` Shot at his own door , and alighteth even now at purgatory gates ."
Ay !
"there , if tales be true , he shall lack neither coal nor candle . ''"
"Sir Oliver groped his way to a joint-stool , and sat down upon it , sick and white ."
`` This is a judgment !
`` Course I do .
But you ca n't be a gemplum till you grow up . ''
"`` Oh , indeed you can , '' Anne hastened to say , thinking she saw a chance to sow good seed betimes ."
`` You can begin to be a gentleman when you are a little boy .
And gentlemen NEVER snatch things from ladies ... or forget to say thank you ... or pull anybody 's hair . ''
"`` They do n't have much fun , that 's a fact , '' said Davy frankly ."
`` I guess I 'll wait till I 'm grown up to be one . ''
"Marilla , with a resigned air , had cut another piece of cake for Dora ."
She did not feel able to cope with Davy just then .
"It had been a hard day for her , what with the funeral and the long drive ."
At that moment she looked forward to the future with a pessimism that would have done credit to Eliza Andrews herself .
"The twins were not noticeably alike , although both were fair ."
Dora had long sleek curls that never got out of order .
Davy had a crop of fuzzy little yellow ringlets all over his round head .
Dora 's hazel eyes were gentle and mild ; Davy 's were as roguish and dancing as an elf 's .
"Dora 's nose was straight , Davy 's a positive snub ; Dora had a `` prunes and prisms '' mouth , Davy 's was all smiles ; and besides , he had a dimple in one cheek and none in the other , which gave him a dear , comical , lopsided look when he laughed ."
Mirth and mischief lurked in every corner of his little face .
"`` They 'd better go to bed , '' said Marilla , who thought it was the easiest way to dispose of them ."
`` Dora will sleep with me and you can put Davy in the west gable .
"You 're not afraid to sleep alone , are you , Davy ? ''"
"`` No ; but I ai n't going to bed for ever so long yet , '' said Davy comfortably ."
"`` Oh , yes , you are . ''"
"That was all the much-tried Marilla said , but something in her tone squelched even Davy ."
He trotted obediently upstairs with Anne .
"`` When I 'm grown up the very first thing I 'm going to do is stay up ALL night just to see what it would be like , '' he told her confidentially ."
In after years Marilla never thought of that first week of the twins ' sojourn at Green Gables without a shiver .
Not that it really was so much worse than the weeks that followed it ; but it seemed so by reason of its novelty .
"There was seldom a waking minute of any day when Davy was not in mischief or devising it ; but his first notable exploit occurred two days after his arrival , on Sunday morning ... a fine , warm day , as hazy and mild as September ."
Anne dressed him for church while Marilla attended to Dora .
Davy at first objected strongly to having his face washed .
`` Marilla washed it yesterday ... and Mrs. Wiggins scoured me with hard soap the day of the funeral .
That 's enough for one week .
On his way home that evening he again met Isabel King .
She turned and walked back with him but she made no reference to Four Winds or its inhabitants .
"If Alan had troubled himself to look , he would have seen a malicious glow in her baleful brown eyes ."
But the only eyes which had any meaning for him just then were the grey ones of Lynde Oliver .
"* * * * * During Alan 's next three visits to Four Winds he saw nothing of Lynde , either in the house or out of it ."
This surprised and worried him .
"There was no apparent difference in Captain Anthony , who continued to be suave and friendly ."
"Alan always enjoyed his conversations with the Captain , who was witty , incisive , and pungent ; yet he disliked the man himself more at every visit ."
"If he had been compelled to define his impression , he would have said the Captain was a charming scoundrel ."
But it occurred to him that Emily was disturbed about something .
"Sometimes he caught her glance , full of perplexity and -- it almost seemed -- distrust ."
She looked as if she felt hostile towards him .
But Alan dismissed the idea as absurd .
She had been friendly from the first and he had done nothing to excite her disapproval .
Lynde 's mysterious absence was a far more perplexing problem .
"She had not gone away , for when Alan asked the Captain concerning her , he responded indifferently that she was out walking ."
Alan caught a glint of amusement in the older man 's eyes as he spoke .
He could have sworn it was malicious amusement .
One evening he went to Four Winds around the shore .
"As he turned the headland of the cove , he saw Lynde and her dogs not a hundred feet away ."
The moment she saw him she darted up the bank and disappeared among the firs .
Alan was thunderstruck .
There was no room for doubt that she meant to avoid him .
He walked up to the house in a tumult of mingled feelings which he did not even then understand .
He only realized that he felt bitterly hurt and grieved -- puzzled as well .
What did it all mean ?
He met Emily in the yard of Four Winds on her way to the spring and stopped her resolutely .
"`` Miss Oliver , '' he said bluntly , `` is Miss Lynde angry with me ?"
And why ? ''
Emily looked at him piercingly .
`` Have you no idea why ? ''
she asked shortly .
"`` A mother is the best thing in the world -- I realized that when I lost mine , '' said Alan gently ."
`` How long is it since your mother died ? ''
`` Three years .
"Oh , I thought I should die too when she did ."
"She was very ill -- she was never strong , you know -- but I never thought she could die ."
There was a year then -- part of the time I did n't believe in God at all and the rest I hated Him .
I was very wicked but I was so unhappy .
Father had so many dreadful moods and -- there was something else .
I used to wish to die . ''
She bowed her head on her hands and gazed moodily on the ground .
"Alan , leaning against a pine tree , looked down at her ."
The sunlight fell through the swaying boughs on her glory of burnished hair and lighted up the curve of cheek and chin against the dark background of wood brown .
"All the defiance and wildness had gone from her for the time and she seemed like a helpless , weary child ."
He wanted to take her in his arms and comfort her .
"`` You must resemble your mother , '' he said absently , as if thinking aloud ."
`` You do n't look at all like your father . ''
Lynde shook her head .
"`` No , I do n't look like Mother either ."
She was tiny and dark -- she had a sweet little face and velvet-brown eyes and soft curly dark hair .
"Oh , I remember her look so well ."
I wish I did resemble her .
I loved her so -- I would have done anything to save her suffering and trouble .
"At least , she died in peace . ''"
There was a curious note of fierce self-gratulation in the girl 's voice as she spoke the last sentence .
Again Alan felt the unpleasant impression that there was much in her that he did not understand -- might never understand -- although such understanding was necessary to perfect friendship .
"She had never spoken so freely of her past life to him before , yet he felt somehow that something was being kept back in jealous repression ."
"It must be something connected with her father , Alan thought ."
"Doubtless , Captain Anthony 's past would not bear inspection , and his daughter knew it and dwelt in the shadow of her knowledge ."
His heart filled with aching pity for her ; he raged secretly because he was so powerless to help her .
"Her girlhood had been blighted , robbed of its meed of happiness and joy ."
Was she likewise to miss her womanhood ?
Alan 's hands clenched involuntarily at the unuttered question .
Once I thought I was stuck for keeps .
Ai n't it an awful night ? '
`` I came to myself and knew I must hurry upstairs .
"I explained as quickly as I could to Mary , and left her trying to brush the snow off ."
"Upstairs I found that Jims was over that paroxysm , but almost as soon as I got back to the room he was in the grip of another ."
"I could n't do anything but moan and cry -- oh , how ashamed I am when I think of it ; and yet what could I do -- we had tried everything we knew -- and then all at once I heard Mary Vance saying loudly behind me , ` Why , that child is dying ! '"
`` I whirled around .
Did n't I know he was dying -- my little Jims !
I could have thrown Mary Vance out of the door or the window -- anywhere -- at that moment .
"There she stood , cool and composed , looking down at my baby , with those , weird white eyes of hers , as she might look at a choking kitten ."
I had always disliked Mary Vance -- and just then I hated her . ''
"` We have tried everything , ' said poor Susan dully ."
` It is not ordinary croup . ' ''
"` No , it 's the dipthery croup , ' said Mary briskly , snatching up an apron ."
` And there 's mighty little time to lose -- but I know what to do .
"When I lived over-harbour with Mrs. Wiley , years ago , Will Crawford 's kid died of dipthery croup , in spite of two doctors ."
"And when old Aunt Christina MacAllister heard of it -- she was the one brought me round when I nearly died of pneumonia you know -- she was a wonder -- no doctor was a patch on her -- they do n't hatch her breed of cats nowadays , let me tell you -- she said she could have saved him with her grandmother 's remedy if she 'd been there ."
She told Mrs. Wiley what it was and I 've never forgot it .
I 've the greatest memory ever -- a thing just lies in the back of my head till the time comes to use it .
"Got any sulphur in the house , Susan ? '"
"`` Yes , we had sulphur ."
"Susan went down with Mary to get it , and I held Jims ."
I had n't any hope -- not the least .
Mary Vance might brag as she liked -- she was always bragging -- but I did n't believe any grandmother 's remedy could save Jims now .
Presently Mary came back .
"She had tied a piece of thick flannel over her mouth and nose , and she carried Susan 's old tin chip pan , half full of burning coals . ''"
"` You watch me , ' she said boastfully ."
"` I 've never done this , but it 's kill or cure that child is dying anyway . '"
"`` She sprinkled a spoonful of sulphur over the coals ; and then she picked up Jims , turned him over , and held him face downward , right over those choking , blinding fumes ."
I do n't know why I did n't spring forward and snatch him away .
"Susan says it was because it was fore-ordained that I should n't , and I think she is right , because it did really seem that I was powerless to move ."
"Susan herself seemed transfixed , watching Mary from the doorway ."
"I just hoped he would go on forgetting about Jims , Mrs. Crawford . ''"
"`` And then your pa would have the expense of raising him , '' said Cousin Sophia reprovingly ."
`` You young creeturs are terrible thoughtless . ''
"Jims himself ran in at this juncture , so rosy and curly and kissable , that he extorted a qualified compliment even from Cousin Sophia ."
"`` He 's a reel healthy-looking child now , though mebbee his colour is a mite too high -- sorter consumptive looking , as you might say ."
I never thought you 'd raise him when I saw him the day after you brung him home .
I reely did not think it was in you and I told Albert 's wife so when I got home .
"Albert 's wife says , says she , ` There 's more in Rilla Blythe than you 'd think for , Aunt Sophia . '"
Them was her very words .
` More in Rilla Blythe than you 'd think for . '
Albert 's wife always had a good opinion of you . ''
"Cousin Sophia sighed , as if to imply that Albert 's wife stood alone in this against the world ."
But Cousin Sophia really did not mean that .
She was quite fond of Rilla in her own melancholy way ; but young creeturs had to be kept down .
If they were not kept down society would be demoralized .
`` Do you remember your walk home from the light two years ago tonight ? ''
"whispered Gertrude Oliver to Rilla , teasingly ."
"`` I should think I do , '' smiled Rilla ; and then her smile grew dreamy and absent ; she was remembering something else -- that hour with Kenneth on the sandshore ."
Where would Ken be tonight ?
And Jem and Jerry and Walter and all the other boys who had danced and moonlighted on the old Four Winds Point that evening of mirth and laughter -- their last joyous unclouded evening .
"In the filthy trenches of the Somme front , with the roar of the guns and the groans of stricken men for the music of Ned Burr 's violin , and the flash of star shells for the silver sparkles on the old blue gulf ."
"Two of them were sleeping under the Flanders poppies -- Alec Burr from the Upper Glen , and Clark Manley of Lowbridge ."
Others were wounded in the hospitals .
But so far nothing had touched the manse and the Ingleside boys .
They seemed to bear charmed lives .
Yet the suspense never grew any easier to bear as the weeks and months of war went by .
"`` It is n't as if it were some sort of fever to which you might conclude they were immune when they had n't taken it for two years , '' sighed Rilla ."
`` The danger is just as great and just as real as it was the first day they went into the trenches .
"I know this , and it tortures me every day ."
And yet I ca n't help hoping that since they 've come this far unhurt they 'll come through .
"Oh , Miss Oliver , what would it be like not to wake up in the morning feeling afraid of the news the day would bring ?"
I ca n't picture such a state of things somehow .
"Want of practice , they called it ; but what it really meant was that they no longer believed ."
"Michael believed longer than the other boys , though they jeered at him ; so he was with Wendy when Peter came for her at the end of the first year ."
"She flew away with Peter in the frock she had woven from leaves and berries in the Neverland , and her one fear was that he might notice how short it had become ; but he never noticed , he had so much to say about himself ."
"She had looked forward to thrilling talks with him about old times , but new adventures had crowded the old ones from his mind ."
`` Who is Captain Hook ? ''
he asked with interest when she spoke of the arch enemy .
"`` Do n't you remember , '' she asked , amazed , `` how you killed him and saved all our lives ? ''"
"`` I forget them after I kill them , '' he replied carelessly ."
"When she expressed a doubtful hope that Tinker Bell would be glad to see her he said , `` Who is Tinker Bell ? ''"
"`` O Peter , '' she said , shocked ; but even when she explained he could not remember ."
"`` There are such a lot of them , '' he said ."
`` I expect she is no more . ''
"I expect he was right , for fairies do n't live long , but they are so little that a short time seems a good while to them ."
Wendy was pained too to find that the past year was but as yesterday to Peter ; it had seemed such a long year of waiting to her .
"But he was exactly as fascinating as ever , and they had a lovely spring cleaning in the little house on the tree tops ."
Next year he did not come for her .
She waited in a new frock because the old one simply would not meet ; but he never came .
"`` Perhaps he is ill , '' Michael said ."
`` You know he is never ill . ''
"Michael came close to her and whispered , with a shiver , `` Perhaps there is no such person , Wendy ! ''"
and then Wendy would have cried if Michael had not been crying .
Peter came next spring cleaning ; and the strange thing was that he never knew he had missed a year .
That was the last time the girl Wendy ever saw him .
For a little longer she tried for his sake not to have growing pains ; and she felt she was untrue to him when she got a prize for general knowledge .
"But the years came and went without bringing the careless boy ; and when they met again Wendy was a married woman , and Peter was no more to her than a little dust in the box in which she had kept her toys ."
Wendy was grown up .
You need not be sorry for her .
She was one of the kind that likes to grow up .
In the end she grew up of her own free will a day quicker than other girls .
All the boys were grown up and done for by this time ; so it is scarcely worth while saying anything more about them .
"You may see the twins and Nibs and Curly any day going to an office , each carrying a little bag and an umbrella ."
Michael is an engine-driver -LSB- train engineer -RSB- .
"`` Oh , I did n't mean to deceive you !"
I never thought of such a thing .
"When you asked me to write to you I wanted to , but I did n't know what to write about to a stranger ."
"I just could n't write you about my life here , not because it was hard , but it was so ugly and empty ."
So I wrote instead of the life I wanted to live -- the life I did live in imagination .
"And when once I had begun , I had to keep it up ."
"I found it so fascinating , too !"
Those letters made that other life seem real to me .
I never expected to meet you .
These last four days since your letter came have been dreadful to me .
"Oh , please go away and forgive me if you can !"
I know I can never make you understand how it came about . ''
Sidney turned away and hid her burning face against the cool white bark of the birch tree behind her .
It was worse than she had even thought it would be .
"He was so handsome , so manly , so earnest-eyed !"
"Oh , what a friend to lose !"
John Lincoln opened the gate and went up to her .
"There was a great tenderness in his face , mingled with a little kindly , friendly amusement ."
"`` Please do n't distress yourself so , Sidney , '' he said , unconsciously using her Christian name ."
`` I think I do understand .
I 'm not such a dull fellow as you take me for .
"After all , those letters were true -- or , rather , there was truth in them ."
You revealed yourself more faithfully in them than if you had written truly about your narrow outward life . ''
"Sidney turned her flushed face and wet eyes slowly toward him , a little smile struggling out amid the clouds of woe ."
This young man was certainly good at understanding .
`` You -- you 'll forgive me then ? ''
she stammered .
"`` Yes , if there is anything to forgive ."
"And for my own part , I am glad you are not what I have always thought you were ."
"If I had come here and found you what I expected , living in such a home as I expected , I never could have told you or even thought of telling you what you have come to mean to me in these lonely years during which your letters have been the things most eagerly looked forward to ."
"I should have come this evening and spent an hour or so with you , and then have gone away on the train tomorrow morning , and that would have been all ."
"`` But I find instead just a dreamy romantic little girl , much like my sisters at home , except that she is a great deal cleverer ."
"I must take the bridle off , ' said Peder ."
` It is not to be sold with the animal as is usually the case . '
"` I 'll give you a hundred dollars for the bridle , ' said the old man , taking out his purse ."
"` No , I ca n't sell it , ' replied Hans 's father ."
` Five hundred dollars ! '
` No . ' '
A thousand ! '
At this splendid offer Peder 's prudence gave way ; it was a shame to let so much money go .
So he agreed to accept it .
"But he could hardly hold the horse , it became so unmanageable ."
"So he gave the animal in charge to the old man , and went home with his two thousand dollars ."
"Kirsten , of course , was delighted at this new piece of good fortune , and insisted that the new house should be built and land bought ."
"This time Peder consented , and soon they had quite a fine farm ."
"Meanwhile the old man rode off on his new purchase , and when he came to a smithy he asked the smith to forge shoes for the horse ."
"The smith proposed that they should first have a drink together , and the horse was tied up by the spring whilst they went indoors ."
"The day was hot , and both men were thirsty , and , besides , they had much to say ; and so the hours slipped by and found them still talking ."
"Then the servant girl came out to fetch a pail of water , and , being a kind-hearted lass , she gave some to the horse to drink ."
What was her surprise when the animal said to her : ` Take off my bridle and you will save my life . ' '
"I dare not , ' said she ; ` your master will be so angry . '"
"` He can not hurt you , ' answered the horse , ` and you will save my life . '"
At that she took off the bridle ; but nearly fainted with astonishment when the horse turned into a dove and flew away just as the old man came out of the house .
Directly he saw what had happened he changed himself into a hawk and flew after the dove .
"Over the woods and fields they went , and at length they reached a king 's palace surrounded by beautiful gardens ."
The princess was walking with her attendants in the rose garden when the dove turned itself into a gold ring and fell at her feet .
"` Why , here is a ring ! '"
"she cried , ` where could it have come from ? '"
And picking it up she put it on her finger .
"As she did so the hill-man lost his power over Hans -- for of course you understand that it was he who had been the dog , the cow , the horse and the dove ."
"` Well , that is really strange , ' said the princess ."
` It fits me as though it had been made for me ! '
Just at that moment up came the king .
` Look at what I have found ! '
This was seeing ; it was not hearing .
He means foully .
"Hark , else , if his bell be not stopped ! ''"
Such was the case .
The bell rang no longer .
"`` Nay , '' said Dick , `` I like not that ."
"Nay , '' he cried again , `` I like that little ."
What may this betoken ?
"Let us go , by the mass ! ''"
"`` He hath gone east , '' added Matcham ."
"`` Good Dick , let us go westward straight ; I shall not breathe till I have my back turned upon that leper . ''"
"`` Jack , y ' are too cowardly , '' replied Dick ."
"`` We shall go fair for Holywood , or as fair , at least , as I can guide you , and that will be due north . ''"
"They were afoot at once , passed the stream upon some stepping-stones , and began to mount on the other side , which was steeper , towards the margin of the wood ."
"The ground became very uneven , full of knolls and hollows ; trees grew scattered or in clumps ; it became difficult to choose a path , and the lads somewhat wandered ."
"They were weary , besides , with yesterday 's exertions and the lack of food , and they moved but heavily and dragged their feet among the sand ."
"Presently , coming to the top of a knoll , they were aware of the leper , some hundred feet in front of them , crossing the line of their march by a hollow ."
"His bell was silent , his staff no longer tapped the ground , and he went before him with the swift and assured footsteps of a man who sees ."
Next moment he had disappeared into a little thicket .
"The lads , at the first glimpse , had crouched behind a tuft of gorse ; there they lay , horror-struck ."
"`` Certain , he pursueth us , '' said Dick -- `` certain !"
"He held the clapper of his bell in one hand , saw ye ?"
that it should not sound .
"Now may the saints aid and guide us , for I have no strength to combat pestilence ! ''"
`` What maketh he ? ''
cried Matcham .
`` What doth he want ?
"Who ever heard the like , that a leper , out of mere malice , should pursue unfortunates ?"
"Hath he not his bell to that very end , that people may avoid him ?"
"Dick , there is below this something deeper . ''"
"`` Nay , I care not , '' moaned Dick ; `` the strength is gone out of me ; my legs are like water ."
The saints be mine assistance ! ''
I asked them to tell me the things they most wanted .
"Some of the answers were commonplace enough ... dolls , ponies , and skates ."
Others were decidedly original .
Hester Boulter wanted ` to wear her Sunday dress every day and eat in the sitting room . '
Hannah Bell wanted ` to be good without having to take any trouble about it . '
"Marjory White , aged ten , wanted to be a WIDOW ."
"Questioned why , she gravely said that if you were n't married people called you an old maid , and if you were your husband bossed you ; but if you were a widow there 'd be no danger of either ."
The most remarkable wish was Sally Bell 's .
She wanted a ` honeymoon . '
I asked her if she knew what it was and she said she thought it was an extra nice kind of bicycle because her cousin in Montreal went on a honeymoon when he was married and he had always had the very latest in bicycles !
`` Another day I asked them all to tell me the naughtiest thing they had ever done .
"I could n't get the older ones to do so , but the third class answered quite freely ."
Eliza Bell had ` set fire to her aunt 's carded rolls . '
"Asked if she meant to do it she said , ` not altogether . '"
She just tried a little end to see how it would burn and the whole bundle blazed up in a jiffy .
Emerson Gillis had spent ten cents for candy when he should have put it in his missionary box .
Annetta Bell 's worst crime was ` eating some blueberries that grew in the graveyard . '
Willie White had ` slid down the sheephouse roof a lot of times with his Sunday trousers on . '
"` But I was punished for it 'cause I had to wear patched pants to Sunday School all summer , and when you 're punished for a thing you do n't have to repent of it , ' declared Willie ."
`` I wish you could see some of their compositions ... so much do I wish it that I 'll send you copies of some written recently .
"Last week I told the fourth class I wanted them to write me letters about anything they pleased , adding by way of suggestion that they might tell me of some place they had visited or some interesting thing or person they had seen ."
"They were to write the letters on real note paper , seal them in an envelope , and address them to me , all without any assistance from other people ."
Last Friday morning I found a pile of letters on my desk and that evening I realized afresh that teaching has its pleasures as well as its pains .
Those compositions would atone for much .
"Here is Ned Clay 's , address , spelling , and grammar as originally penned . ''"
` Miss teacher ShiRley Green gabels .
p.e. Island can birds '' ` Dear teacher I think I will write you a composition about birds .
birds is very useful animals .
my cat catches birds .
His name is William but pa calls him tom .
he is oll striped and he got one of his ears froz of last winter .
only for that he would be a good-looking cat .
was the answer .
"`` Howsoever , so be it , amen ! ''"
"After a little while of silence , he said he thought somebody might read a prayer ."
"`` It 's the custom , sir , '' he added apologetically ."
"And not long after , without another word , he passed away ."
"In the meantime the captain , whom I had observed to be wonderfully swollen about the chest and pockets , had turned out a great many various stores -- the British colours , a Bible , a coil of stoutish rope , pen , ink , the log-book , and pounds of tobacco ."
"He had found a longish fir-tree lying felled and trimmed in the enclosure , and with the help of Hunter he had set it up at the corner of the log-house where the trunks crossed and made an angle ."
"Then , climbing on the roof , he had with his own hand bent and run up the colours ."
This seemed mightily to relieve him .
He re-entered the log-house and set about counting up the stores as if nothing else existed .
"But he had an eye on Tom 's passage for all that , and as soon as all was over , came forward with another flag and reverently spread it on the body ."
"`` Do n't you take on , sir , '' he said , shaking the squire 's hand ."
`` All 's well with him ; no fear for a hand that 's been shot down in his duty to captain and owner .
"It may n't be good divinity , but it 's a fact . ''"
Then he pulled me aside .
"`` Dr. Livesey , '' he said , `` in how many weeks do you and squire expect the consort ? ''"
"I told him it was a question not of weeks but of months , that if we were not back by the end of August Blandly was to send to find us , but neither sooner nor later ."
"`` You can calculate for yourself , '' I said ."
"`` Why , yes , '' returned the captain , scratching his head ; `` and making a large allowance , sir , for all the gifts of Providence , I should say we were pretty close hauled . ''"
`` How do you mean ? ''
I asked .
"`` It 's a pity , sir , we lost that second load ."
"That 's what I mean , '' replied the captain ."
"`` As for powder and shot , we 'll do ."
"But the rations are short , very short -- so short , Dr. Livesey , that we 're perhaps as well without that extra mouth . ''"
And he pointed to the dead body under the flag .
"Just then , with a roar and a whistle , a round-shot passed high above the roof of the log-house and plumped far beyond us in the wood ."
`` Oho ! ''
said the captain .
`` Blaze away !
"You 've little enough powder already , my lads . ''"
"At the second trial , the aim was better , and the ball descended inside the stockade , scattering a cloud of sand but doing no further damage ."
It seemed a pity to waste him .
"And say , was n't it fun to hear that girl yell ? ''"
Tuesday afternoon the Aid Society met at Green Gables .
"Anne hurried home from school , for she knew that Marilla would need all the assistance she could give ."
"Dora , neat and proper , in her nicely starched white dress and black sash , was sitting with the members of the Aid in the parlor , speaking demurely when spoken to , keeping silence when not , and in every way comporting herself as a model child ."
"Davy , blissfully dirty , was making mud pies in the barnyard ."
"`` I told him he might , '' said Marilla wearily ."
`` I thought it would keep him out of worse mischief .
He can only get dirty at that .
We 'll have our teas over before we call him to his .
"Dora can have hers with us , but I would never dare to let Davy sit down at the table with all the Aids here . ''"
When Anne went to call the Aids to tea she found that Dora was not in the parlor .
Mrs. Jasper Bell said Davy had come to the front door and called her out .
A hasty consultation with Marilla in the pantry resulted in a decision to let both children have their teas together later on .
Tea was half over when the dining room was invaded by a forlorn figure .
"Marilla and Anne stared in dismay , the Aids in amazement ."
"Could that be Dora ... that sobbing nondescript in a drenched , dripping dress and hair from which the water was streaming on Marilla 's new coin-spot rug ?"
"`` Dora , what has happened to you ? ''"
"cried Anne , with a guilty glance at Mrs. Jasper Bell , whose family was said to be the only one in the world in which accidents never occurred ."
"`` Davy made me walk the pigpen fence , '' wailed Dora ."
`` I did n't want to but he called me a fraid-cat .
And I fell off into the pigpen and my dress got all dirty and the pig runned right over me .
"My dress was just awful but Davy said if I 'd stand under the pump he 'd wash it clean , and I did and he pumped water all over me but my dress ai n't a bit cleaner and my pretty sash and shoes is all spoiled . ''"
Anne did the honors of the table alone for the rest of the meal while Marilla went upstairs and redressed Dora in her old clothes .
Davy was caught and sent to bed without any supper .
"Anne went to his room at twilight and talked to him seriously ... a method in which she had great faith , not altogether unjustified by results ."
She told him she felt very badly over his conduct .
"`` I feel sorry now myself , '' admitted Davy , `` but the trouble is I never feel sorry for doing things till after I 've did them ."
"Dora would n't help me make pies , cause she was afraid of messing her clo'es and that made me hopping mad ."
I s ` pose Paul Irving would n't have made HIS sister walk a pigpen fence if he knew she 'd fall in ? ''
"`` No , he would never dream of such a thing ."
Paul is a perfect little gentleman . ''
"`` How lovely , '' cried Wendy so longingly that Mrs. Darling tightened her grip ."
"`` I thought all the fairies were dead , '' Mrs. Darling said ."
"`` There are always a lot of young ones , '' explained Wendy , who was now quite an authority , `` because you see when a new baby laughs for the first time a new fairy is born , and as there are always new babies there are always new fairies ."
"They live in nests on the tops of trees ; and the mauve ones are boys and the white ones are girls , and the blue ones are just little sillies who are not sure what they are . ''"
"`` I shall have such fun , '' said Peter , with eye on Wendy ."
"`` It will be rather lonely in the evening , '' she said , `` sitting by the fire . ''"
`` I shall have Tink . ''
"`` Tink ca n't go a twentieth part of the way round , '' she reminded him a little tartly ."
`` Sneaky tell-tale ! ''
Tink called out from somewhere round the corner .
"`` It does n't matter , '' Peter said ."
"`` O Peter , you know it matters . ''"
"`` Well , then , come with me to the little house . ''"
"`` May I , mummy ? ''"
`` Certainly not .
"I have got you home again , and I mean to keep you . ''"
`` But he does so need a mother . ''
"`` So do you , my love . ''"
"`` Oh , all right , '' Peter said , as if he had asked her from politeness merely ; but Mrs. Darling saw his mouth twitch , and she made this handsome offer : to let Wendy go to him for a week every year to do his spring cleaning ."
Wendy would have preferred a more permanent arrangement ; and it seemed to her that spring would be long in coming ; but this promise sent Peter away quite gay again .
"He had no sense of time , and was so full of adventures that all I have told you about him is only a halfpenny-worth of them ."
"I suppose it was because Wendy knew this that her last words to him were these rather plaintive ones : `` You wo n't forget me , Peter , will you , before spring cleaning time comes ? ''"
Of course Peter promised ; and then he flew away .
He took Mrs. Darling 's kiss with him .
"The kiss that had been for no one else , Peter took quite easily ."
Funny .
But she seemed satisfied .
"Of course all the boys went to school ; and most of them got into Class III , but Slightly was put first into Class IV and then into Class V. Class I is the top class ."
"Before they had attended school a week they saw what goats they had been not to remain on the island ; but it was too late now , and soon they settled down to being as ordinary as you or me or Jenkins minor -LSB- the younger Jenkins -RSB- ."
It is sad to have to say that the power to fly gradually left them .
"At first Nana tied their feet to the bed-posts so that they should not fly away in the night ; and one of their diversions by day was to pretend to fall off buses -LSB- the English double-deckers -RSB- ; but by and by they ceased to tug at their bonds in bed , and found that they hurt themselves when they let go of the bus ."
In time they could not even fly after their hats .
No one but herself -- and perhaps Rilla -- knew it -- would ever know it .
She had no right in the eyes of her world to grieve .
She must hide and bear her long pain as best she could -- alone .
"But she , too , would keep faith ."
CHAPTER XXIV MARY IS JUST IN TIME The autumn of 1916 was a bitter season for Ingleside .
"Mrs. Blythe 's return to health was slow , and sorrow and loneliness were in all hearts ."
Every one tried to hide it from the others and `` carry on '' cheerfully .
Rilla laughed a good deal .
"Nobody at Ingleside was deceived by her laughter ; it came from her lips only , never from her heart ."
"But outsiders said some people got over trouble very easily , and Irene Howard remarked that she was surprised to find how shallow Rilla Blythe really was ."
"`` Why , after all her pose of being so devoted to Walter , she does n't seem to mind his death at all ."
Nobody has ever seen her shed a tear or heard her mention his name .
She has evidently quite forgotten him .
Poor fellow -- you 'd really think his family would feel it more .
"I spoke of him to Rilla at the last Junior Red meeting -- of how fine and brave and splendid he was -- and I said life could never be just the same to me again , now that Walter had gone -- we were such friends , you know -- why I was the very first person he told about having enlisted -- and Rilla answered , as coolly and indifferently as if she were speaking of an entire stranger , ` He was just one of many fine and splendid boys who have given everything for their country . '"
"Well , I wish I could take things as calmly -- but I 'm not made like that ."
I 'm so sensitive -- things hurt me terribly -- I really never get over them .
I asked Rilla right out why she did n't put on mourning for Walter .
She said her mother did n't wish it .
But every one is talking about it . ''
"`` Rilla does n't wear colours -- nothing but white , '' protested Betty Mead ."
"`` White becomes her better than anything else , '' said Irene significantly ."
`` And we all know black does n't suit her complexion at all .
But of course I 'm not saying that is the reason she does n't wear it .
"Only , it 's funny ."
If my brother had died I 'd have gone into deep mourning .
I would n't have had the heart for anything else .
I confess I 'm disappointed in Rilla Blythe . ''
"`` I am not , then , '' cried Betty Meade , loyally , `` I think Rilla is just a wonderful girl ."
A few years ago I admit I did think she was rather too vain and gigglesome ; but now she is nothing of the sort .
"I do n't think there is a girl in the Glen who is so unselfish and plucky as Rilla , or who has done her bit as thoroughly and patiently ."
"Our Junior Red Cross would have gone on the rocks a dozen times if it had n't been for her tact and perseverance and enthusiasm -- you know that perfectly well , Irene . ''"
It was in this casual way that Wendy one morning made a disquieting revelation .
"Some leaves of a tree had been found on the nursery floor , which certainly were not there when the children went to bed , and Mrs. Darling was puzzling over them when Wendy said with a tolerant smile : ' I do believe it is that Peter again ! '"
"` Whatever do you mean , Wendy ? '"
"` It is so naughty of him not to wipe , ' Wendy said , sighing ."
She was a tidy child .
She explained in quite a matter-of-fact way that she thought Peter sometimes came to the nursery in the night and sat on the foot of her bed and played on his pipes to her .
"Unfortunately she never woke , so she did n't know how she knew , she just knew ."
"` What nonsense you talk , precious ."
No one can get into the house without knocking . ' '
"I think he comes in by the window , ' she said ."
"` My love , it is three floors up . '"
"` Were not the leaves at the foot of the window , mother ? '"
It was quite true ; the leaves had been found very near the window .
"Mrs. Darling did not know what to think , for it all seemed so natural to Wendy that you could not dismiss it by saying she had been dreaming ."
"` My child , ' the mother cried , ` why did you not tell me of this before ? ' '"
"I forgot , ' said Wendy lightly ."
She was in a hurry to get her breakfast .
"Oh , surely she must have been dreaming ."
"But , on the other hand , there were the leaves ."
"Mrs. Darling examined them carefully ; they were skeleton leaves , but she was sure they did not come from any tree that grew in England ."
"She crawled about the floor , peering at it with a candle for marks of a strange foot ."
She rattled the poker up the chimney and tapped the walls .
"She let down a tape from the window to the pavement , and it was a sheer drop of thirty feet , without so much as a spout to climb up by ."
Certainly Wendy had been dreaming .
"But Wendy had not been dreaming , as the very next night showed , the night on which the extraordinary adventures of these children may be said to have begun ."
On the night we speak of all the children were once more in bed .
"It happened to be Nana 's evening off , and Mrs. Darling had bathed them and sung to them till one by one they had let go her hand and slid away into the land of sleep ."
All were looking so safe and cosy that she smiled at her fears now and sat down tranquilly by the fire to sew .
"It was something for Michael , who on his birthday was getting into shirts ."
"The fire was warm , however , and the nursery dimly lit by three night-lights , and presently the sewing lay on Mrs. Darling 's lap ."
"Then her head nodded , oh , so gracefully ."
She was asleep .
Your voice is like music and your eyes are like pansies when the dew is on them .
You are like a tall stately queen .
Your hair is like rippling gold .
"Anthony Pye says it is red , but you need n't pay any attention to Anthony . '' '"
I have only known you for a few months but I can not realize that there was ever a time when I did not know you ... when you had not come into my life to bless and hallow it .
I will always look back to this year as the most wonderful in my life because it brought you to me .
"Besides , it 's the year we moved to Avonlea from Newbridge ."
My love for you has made my life very rich and it has kept me from much of harm and evil .
"I owe this all to you , my sweetest teacher . '' '"
I shall never forget how sweet you looked the last time I saw you in that black dress with flowers in your hair .
"I shall see you like that for ever , even when we are both old and gray ."
"You will always be young and fair to me , dearest teacher ."
I am thinking of you all the time ... in the morning and at the noontide and at the twilight .
I love you when you laugh and when you sigh ... even when you look disdainful .
I never saw you look cross though Anthony Pye says you always look so but I do n't wonder you look cross at him for he deserves it .
I love you in every dress ... you seem more adorable in each new dress than the last . ''
"` Dearest teacher , good night ."
The sun has set and the stars are shining ... stars that are as bright and beautiful as your eyes .
"I kiss your hands and face , my sweet ."
May God watch over you and protect you from all harm . ''
"`` Your afecksionate pupil , '' ` Annetta Bell . ' ''"
`` This extraordinary letter puzzled me not a little .
I knew Annetta could n't have composed it any more than she could fly .
When I went to school the next day I took her for a walk down to the brook at recess and asked her to tell me the truth about the letter .
Annetta cried and ` fessed up freely .
"She said she had never written a letter and she did n't know how to , or what to say , but there was bundle of love letters in her mother 's top bureau drawer which had been written to her by an old ` beau . ' ''"
"` It was n't father , ' sobbed Annetta , ` it was someone who was studying for a minister , and so he could write lovely letters , but ma did n't marry him after all ."
She said she could n't make out what he was driving at half the time .
But I thought the letters were sweet and that I 'd just copy things out of them here and there to write you .
I put `` teacher '' where he put `` lady '' and I put in something of my own when I could think of it and I changed some words .
I put `` dress '' in place of `` mood . ''
I did n't know just what a `` mood '' was but I s ` posed it was something to wear .
"As for the baby, it cried a good deal at odd times; but at night, when its mother had settled down to sleep, it would always begin to cry, quite as a matter of course, so that she hardly got any rest at all."
This made her very tired.
"The baby could make up for its bad nights during the day if it liked, but the poor mother couldn't. So whenever she had nothing to do she used to sit and cry, because she was tired out with work and worry."
"One evening the blacksmith was busy with his forge. He was making a goat-shoe for the goat of a very rich lady, who wished to see how the goat liked being shod, and also whether the shoe would come to fivepence or sevenpence before she ordered the whole set. This was the only order John had had that week. And as he worked his wife sat and nursed the baby, who, for a wonder, was not crying."
"Presently, over the noise of the bellows and over the clank of the iron, there came another sound. The blacksmith and his wife looked at each other."
"""I heard nothing,"" said he."
"""Neither did I,"" said she."
"But the noise grew louder and the two were so anxious not to hear it that he hammered away at the goat-shoe harder than he had ever hammered in his life, and she began to sing to the baby a thing she had not had the heart to do for weeks."
"But through the blowing and hammering and singing the noise came louder and louder, and the more they tried not to hear it, the more they had to. It was like the noise of some great creature purring, purring, purring and the reason they did not want to believe they really heard it was that it came from the great dungeon down below, where the old iron was, and the firewood and the twopence worth of coal, and the broken steps that went down into the dark and ended no one knew where."
"""It can't be anything in the dungeon,"" said the blacksmith, wiping his face. ""Why, I shall have to go down there after more coals in a minute."""
"""There isn't anything there, of course. How could there be?"" said his wife. And they tried so hard to believe that there could be nothing there that presently they very nearly did believe it."
"Then the blacksmith took his shovel in one hand and his riveting hammer in the other, and hung the old stable lantern on his little finger, and went down to get the coals."
"""I am not taking the hammer because I think there is something there,"""
"said he, ""but it is handy for breaking the large lumps of coal."""
"""I quite understand,"" said his wife, who had brought the coal home in her apron that very afternoon, and knew that it was all coal dust."
"So he went down the winding stairs to the dungeon and stood at the bottom of the steps, holding the lantern above his head just to see that the dungeon really was empty, as usual. Half of it was empty as usual, except for the old iron and odds and ends, and the firewood and the coals. But the other side was not empty. It was quite full, and what it was full of was Dragon."
"""It must have come up those nasty broken steps from goodness knows where,"" said the blacksmith to himself, trembling all over, as he tried to creep back up the winding stairs."
"But the dragon was too quick for him it put out a great claw and caught him by the leg, and as it moved it rattled like a great bunch of keys, or like the sheet iron they make thunder out of in pantomimes."
"""No you don't,"" said the dragon in a spluttering voice, like a damp squib."
"""Deary, deary me,"" said poor John, trembling more than ever in the claw of the dragon. ""Here's a nice end for a respectable blacksmith!"""
The dragon seemed very much struck by this remark.
"""Do you mind saying that again?"" said he, quite politely."
"So John said again, very distinctly:"
"""Here is a nice end for a respectable blacksmith."""
"""I didn't know,"" said the dragon. ""Fancy now! You're the very man I wanted."""
"""So I understood you to say before,"" said John, his teeth chattering."
"""Oh, I don't mean what you mean,"" said the dragon, ""but I should like you to do a job for me. One of my wings has got some of the rivets out of it just above the joint. Could you put that to rights?"""
"""I might, sir,"" said John, politely, for you must always be polite to a possible customer, even if he be a dragon."
"""A master craftsman you are a master, of course? can see in a minute what's wrong,"" the dragon went on. ""Just come around here and feel my plates, will you?"""
"John timidly went around when the dragon took his claw away; and sure enough, the dragon's wing was hanging loose, and several of the plates near the joint certainly wanted riveting."
"The dragon seemed to be made almost entirely of iron armor a sort of tawny, red-rust color it was; from damp, no doubt and under it he seemed to be covered with something furry."
"All the blacksmith welled up in John's heart, and he felt more at ease."
"But Nurse said: ""Don't count your chickens, my dear. You haven't seen the last of that Dragon yet."""
"Now, the next day was Saturday. And in the afternoon the Dragon suddenly swooped down upon the common in all his hideous redness, and carried off the Soccer Players, umpires, goal-posts, ball, and all."
"Then the people were very angry indeed, and they said: ""We might as well be a Republic. After saving up all these years to get his crown, and everything!"""
"And wise people shook their heads and foretold a decline in the National Love of Sport. And, indeed, soccer was not at all popular for some time afterward."
"Lionel did his best to be a good King during the week, and the people were beginning to forgive him for letting the Dragon out of the book."
"""After all,"" they said, ""soccer is a dangerous game, and perhaps it is wise to discourage it."""
"Popular opinion held that the Soccer Players, being tough and hard, had disagreed with the Dragon so much that he had gone away to some place where they only play cats' cradle and games that do not make you hard and tough."
"All the same, Parliament met on the Saturday afternoon, a convenient time, for most of the Members would be free to attend, to consider the Dragon. But unfortunately the Dragon, who had only been asleep, woke up because it was Saturday, and he considered the Parliament, and afterwards there were not any Members left, so they tried to make a new Parliament, but being a member of Parliament had somehow grown as unpopular as soccer playing, and no one would consent to be elected, so they had to do without a Parliament. When the next Saturday came around everyone was a little nervous, but the Red Dragon was pretty quiet that day and only ate an Orphanage."
"Lionel was very, very unhappy. He felt that it was his disobedience that had brought this trouble on the Parliament and the Orphanage and the Soccer Players, and he felt that it was his duty to try and do something. The question was, what?"
"The Blue Bird that had come out of the book used to sing very nicely in the Palace rose garden, and the Butterfly was very tame, and would perch on his shoulder when he walked among the tall lilies: so Lionel saw that all the creatures in The Book of Beasts could not be wicked, like the Dragon, and he thought: ""Suppose I could get another beast out who would fight the Dragon?"""
"So he took The Book of Beasts out into the rose garden and opened the page next to the one where the Dragon had been just a tiny bit to see what the name was. He could only see ""cora,"" but he felt the middle of the page swelling up thick with the creature that was trying to come out, and it was only by putting the book down and sitting on it suddenly, very hard, that he managed to get it shut. Then he fastened the clasps with the rubies and turquoises in them and sent for the Chancellor, who had been ill since Saturday, and so had not been eaten with the rest of the Parliament, and he said: ""What animal ends in 'cora'?"""
"The Chancellor answered: ""The Manticora, of course."""
"""What is he like?"" asked the King."
"""He is the sworn foe of Dragons,"" said the Chancellor. ""He drinks their blood. He is yellow, with the body of a lion and the face of a man. I wish we had a few Manticoras here now. But the last died hundreds of years ago worse luck!"""
"Then the King ran and opened the book at the page that had ""cora"" on it, and there was the picture Manticora, all yellow, with a lion's body and a man's face, just as the Chancellor had said. And under the picture was written, ""Manticora."""
"In a few minutes the Manticora came sleepily out of the book, rubbing its eyes with its hands and mewing piteously. It seemed very stupid, and when Lionel gave it a push and said, ""Go along and fight the Dragon, do,"" it put its tail between its legs and fairly ran away. It went and hid behind the Town Hall, and at night when the people were asleep it went around and ate all the pussy-cats in the town. And then it mewed more than ever. And on the Saturday morning, when people were a little timid about going out, because the Dragon had no regular hour for calling, the Manticora went up and down the streets and drank all the milk that was left in the cans at the doors for people's teas, and it ate the cans as well."
"And just when it had finished the very last little halfpenny worth, which was short measure, because the milkman's nerves were quite upset, the Red Dragon came down the street looking for the Manticora. It edged off when it saw him coming, for it was not at all the Dragon-fighting kind; and, seeing no other door open, the poor, hunted creature took refuge in the General Post Office, and there the Dragon found it, trying to conceal itself among the ten o'clock mail. The Dragon fell on the Manticora at once, and the mail was no defense. The mewings were heard all over the town. All the kitties and the milk the Manticora had had seemed to have strengthened its mew wonderfully. Then there was a sad silence, and presently the people whose windows looked that way saw the Dragon come walking down the steps of the General Post Office spitting fire and smoke, together with tufts of Manticora fur, and the fragments of the registered letters. Things were growing very serious. However popular the King might become during the week, the Dragon was sure to do something on Saturday to upset the people's loyalty."
"The Dragon was a perfect nuisance for the whole of Saturday, except during the hour of noon, and then he had to rest under a tree or he would have caught fire from the heat of the sun. You see, he was very hot to begin with."
"At last came a Saturday when the Dragon actually walked into the Royal nursery and carried off the King's own pet Rocking Horse. Then the King cried for six days, and on the seventh he was so tired that he had to stop. He heard the Blue Bird singing among the roses and saw the Butterfly fluttering among the lilies, and he said: ""Nurse, wipe my face, please. I am not going to cry any more."""
"Nurse washed his face, and told him not to be a silly little King."
"""Crying,"" said she, ""never did anyone any good yet."""
"""I don't know,"" said the little King, ""I seem to see better, and to hear better now that I've cried for a week. Now, Nurse, dear, I know I'm right, so kiss me in case I never come back. I must try to see if I can't save the people."""
"""Well, if you must, you must,"" said Nurse, ""but don't tear your clothes or get your feet wet."""
So off he went.
"The Blue Bird sang more sweetly than ever, and the Butterfly shone more brightly, as Lionel once more carried The Book of Beasts out into the rose garden, and opened it very quickly, so that he might not be afraid and change his mind. The book fell open wide, almost in the middle, and there was written at the bottom of the page, ""Hippogriff,"" and before Lionel had time to see what the picture was, there was a fluttering of great wings and a stamping of hoofs, and a sweet, soft, friendly neighing; and there came out of the book a beautiful white horse with a long, long, white mane and a long, long, white tail, and he had great wings like swan's wings, and the softest, kindest eyes in the world, and he stood there among the roses."
"The Hippogriff rubbed its silky-soft, milky white nose against the little King's shoulder, and the little King thought: ""But for the wings you are very like my poor, dear lost Rocking Horse."" And the Blue Bird's song was very loud and sweet."
"Then suddenly the King saw coming through the sky the great straggling, sprawling, wicked shape of the Red Dragon. And he knew at once what he must do. He caught up The Book of Beasts and jumped on the back of the gentle, beautiful Hippogriff, and leaning down he whispered in the sharp, white ear: ""Fly, dear Hippogriff, fly your very fastest to the Pebbly Waste."""
"And when the Dragon saw them start, he turned and flew after them, with his great wings flapping like clouds at sunset, and the Hippogriff's wide wings were snowy as clouds at moonrise."
"When the people in the town saw the Dragon fly off after the Hippogriff and the King they all came out of their houses to look, and when they saw the two disappear they made up their minds to the worst, and began to think what they would wear for Court mourning."
"But the Dragon could not catch the Hippogriff. The red wings were bigger than the white ones, but they were not so strong, and so the white-winged horse flew away and away and away, with the Dragon pursuing, till he reached the very middle of the Pebbly Waste."
"Now, the Pebbly Waste is just like the parts of the seaside where there is no sand all round, loose, shifting stones, and there is no grass there and no tree within a hundred miles of it."
"Lionel jumped off the white horse's back in the very middle of the Pebbly Waste, and he hurriedly unclasped The Book of Beasts and laid it open on the pebbles. Then he clattered among the pebbles in his haste to get back on to his white horse, and had just jumped on when up came the Dragon. He was flying very feebly, and looking around everywhere for a tree, for it was just on the stroke of twelve, the sun was shining like a gold guinea in the blue sky, and there was not a tree for a hundred miles."
"So the lad did that; but in spite of all the pains he took, he still spilt one drop on the horse's flank. So it became a great deep lake; and because of that one drop, the horse found himself far out in it, but still he swam safe to land. But when the Trolls came to the lake, they lay down to drink it dry; and so they swilled and swilled till they burst."
"""Now we're rid of them,"" said the Horse."
"So when they had gone a long, long while, they came to a green patch in a wood."
"""Now, strip off all your arms,"" said the Horse, ""and only put on your ragged clothes, and take the saddle off me, and let me loose, and hang all my clothing and your arms up inside that great hollow lime-tree yonder. Then make yourself a wig of fir-moss, and go up to the king's palace, which lies close here, and ask for a place."
"Whenever you need me, only come here and shake the bridle, and I'll come to you."""
"Yes! the lad did all his Horse told him, and as soon as ever he put on the wig of moss he became so ugly, and pale, and miserable to look at, no one would have known him again. Then he went up to the king's palace and begged first for leave to be in the kitchen, and bring in wood and water for the cook, but then the kitchen-maid asked him:"
"""Why do you wear that ugly wig? Off with it. I won't have such a fright in here."""
"""No, I can't do that,"" said the lad; ""for I'm not quite right in my head."""
"""Do you think then I'll have you in here about the food,"" cried the cook. ""Away with you to the coachman; you're best fit to go and clean the stable."""
"But when the coachman begged him to take his wig off, he got the same answer, and he wouldn't have him either."
"""You'd best go down to the gardener,"" said he; ""you're best fit to go about and dig in the garden."""
"So he got leave to be with the gardener, but none of the other servants would sleep with him, and so he had to sleep by himself under the steps of the summer-house. It stood upon beams, and had a high staircase. Under that he got some turf for his bed, and there he lay as well as he could."
"So, when he had been some time at the palace, it happened one morning, just as the sun rose, that the lad had taken off his wig, and stood and washed himself, and then he was so handsome, it was a joy to look at him."
"So the Princess saw from her window the lovely gardener's boy, and thought she had never seen any one so handsome. Then she asked the gardener why he lay out there under the steps."
"""Oh,"" said the gardener, ""none of his fellow-servants will sleep with him; that's why."""
"""Let him come up to-night, and lie at the door inside my bedroom, and then they'll not refuse to sleep with him any more,"" said the Princess."
So the gardener told that to the lad.
"""Do you think I'll do any such thing?"" said the lad. ""Why they'd say next there was something between me and the Princess."""
"""Yes,"" said the gardener, ""you've good reason to fear any such thing, you who are so handsome."""
"""Well, well,"" said the lad, ""since it's her will, I suppose I must go."""
"So, when he was to go up the steps in the evening, he tramped and stamped so on the way, that they had to beg him to tread softly lest the King should come to know it. So he came into the Princess' bedroom, lay down, and began to snore at once. Then the Princess said to her maid:"
"""Go gently, and just pull his wig off;"" and she went up to him."
"But just as she was going to whisk it off, he caught hold of it with both hands, and said she should never have it. After that he lay down again, and began to snore. Then the Princess gave her maid a wink, and this time she whisked off the wig; and there lay the lad so lovely, and white and red, just as the Princess had seen him in the morning sun."
After that the lad slept every night in the Princess' bedroom.
"But it wasn't long before the King came to hear how the gardener's lad slept every night in the Princess' bedroom; and he got so wroth he almost took the lad's life. He didn't do that, however, but he threw him into the prison tower; and as for his daughter, he shut her up in her own room, whence she never got leave to stir day or night."
"All that she begged, and all that she prayed, for the lad and herself, was no good. The King was only more wroth than ever."
"Some time after came a war and uproar in the land, and the King had to take up arms against another king who wished to take the kingdom from him. So when the lad heard that, he begged the gaoler to go to the King and ask for a coat of mail and a sword, and for leave to go to the war. All the rest laughed when the gaoler told his errand, and begged the King to let him have an old worn-out suit, that they might have the fun of seeing such a wretch in battle. So he got that, and an old broken-down hack besides, which went upon three legs, and dragged the fourth after it."
"Then they went out to meet the foe; but they hadn't got far from the palace before the lad got stuck fast in a bog with his hack. There he sat and dug his spurs in, and cried, ""Gee up! gee up!"" to his hack."
"And all the rest had their fun out of this, and laughed, and made game of the lad as they rode past him. But they were scarcely gone, before he ran to the lime-tree, threw on his coat of mail, and shook the bridle, and there came the Horse in a trice, and said: ""Do now your best, and I'll do mine."""
"But when the lad came up the battle had begun, and the King was in a sad pinch; but no sooner had the lad rushed into the thick of it than the foe was beaten back, and put to flight. The King and his men wondered and wondered who it could be who had come to help them, but none of them got so near him as to be able to talk to him, and as soon as the fight was over he was gone. When they went back, there sat the lad still in the bog, and dug his spurs into his three-legged hack, and they all laughed again."
"But alas! he went out to die. In one battle, a small band of the English bravely attacked a large army of their enemies. The horse which Sidney was riding was killed under him, and as he mounted another, he was shot in the leg, and his thigh-bone was broken. The horse took fright and galloped away from the fight, but its wounded and bleeding rider held to his seat, and when he reached a place of safety was lifted from his horse, and gently laid upon the ground. He was faint from loss of blood, and in great pain, and his throat was parched with thirst."
"""Bring me water,"" said he to a friend."
"This was not easy to do, for there was not a stream near at hand, and in order to get to one it would be necessary to pass where the shot from the enemy's cannons was falling fast. But his friend was brave and went through the danger. Then he found some water, and brought it to him."
"Sidney eagerly held out his hand for the cup, and as he was preparing to drink, another poor wounded soldier was carried past. This man was dying; he could not speak, but he looked with longing eyes at the water."
"Sir Philip saw the look, and taking the cup from his own lips, passed it to the soldier, saying: ""Thy need is greater than mine."" The poor man quenched his thirst, and blessed him as he died."
"Sir Philip lived on for a few weeks, growing weaker every day, but he never came back to his own land, and the many friends who loved him."
"Sidney was great in many ways; very fair to see, very wise and good, and very clever and witty. He was one of the bravest fighters, one of the finest poets, and one of the best gentlemen who ever lived. He will always be remembered for his brave deeds, and his wise sayings, but most of all do men bless his name for this act of kindness to his poor dying comrade."
"The ""Revenge"""
"In the days of Queen Elizabeth, English sailors first began to find their way across the seas to new lands, from which they brought home many strange, and rich, and beautiful things. The Spaniards sailed across the seas too, to fetch gold and silver from the mines in Mexico, which belonged to the King of Spain. Sometimes the English ships met the Spanish ones, and robbed them of their gold, for it was thought quite right and fair in those days to take every chance of doing harm to the enemies of England. Of course the Spaniards hated the English for this, and whenever they met English ships which were weaker than theirs they attacked them, and robbed them, killing the sailors, or taking them prisoners."
"Once, a small ship, called the Revenge, was sailing home to England, when it met with fifty great Spanish vessels. The captain of the Revenge was Sir Richard Grenville, and he had a great many sick men on board. There was no time to escape from the Spanish ships, which soon surrounded the little Revenge. So there were only two courses which Sir Richard could take. One was to give up his ship to the Spaniards; the other was to fight with them till his men were all killed, or his ship sank."
"Some of the sailors wished him to take the first course, but the others, and all the sick men, said: ""Nay, let us fall into the hands of God, and not into the hands of Spain."" This they said because they thought it better to die, than to be made prisoners by the cruel Spaniards."
"Sir Richard made up his mind to fight. It was after noon when the firing began, and all night long, until daylight came, the little English ship kept the fifty Spanish vessels at bay. Then it was found that all the powder was gone, and all the English were dead or dying."
"And then only was the flag of the Revenge pulled down, to show that she surrendered to her enemies."
"The brave Sir Richard was taken on board a Spanish ship, where he soon died of his wounds."
"These were his last words: ""Here die I, Richard Grenville, with a joyful and quiet mind, for I have ended my life as a good soldier ought. I have fought for my country and my queen, for honour, and for God."""
The Pilgrim Fathers
"There was a time when the people of England were not allowed to pray to God in the way they thought right, but were punished if they did not worship as the king ordered. This was very hard, and when James I was king, a little band of brave people, who found that they could not obey the king, left their country to make a new home across the sea, where they could be free. They are called the ""Pilgrim Fathers""."
"A hundred people men, women, and children set sail in a little ship called the Mayflower for the new world which a great explorer called Columbus had discovered away in the west, and which we now call America."
"They had a long and stormy voyage, but at last, in mid-winter, they landed on the shores of North America, and set up their huts."
"At first they had much trouble, for the ground was frozen and barren."
"They suffered from hunger and sickness, and the wild Indians who lived in that land came down upon them and tried to drive them away. But the Pilgrim Fathers did not lose courage. They were free, and they worked hard, and waited in patience for brighter days. By and by other ships from England brought food to keep them alive, and more people to help them. Then they made friends with the Indians, and when spring came they planted seeds and grew crops for themselves."
"After a time many other Englishmen, who wished to be free, followed the Pilgrim Fathers, and settled in America. They founded the colonies of New England, which are now a part of the United States."
Guy Fawkes
"In the time of James I, many of the English people were very hardly treated because of their religion. At last they could bear the ill-usage no longer, and they thought of a plan to get rid of the king and queen and their eldest son."
"Many barrels of gunpowder were secretly put into a cellar under the Parliament House, where James was to meet his lords and commons on November 5; and a man named Guy Fawkes was hired to set fire to it at the right time, and so to blow up the hall above, and all in it."
"All was ready, when one of the plotters remembered that a friend of his would be at the meeting next day. As he did not wish him to be killed, he sent him a letter, without signing his name, saying: ""Do not go to the House, for there shall be a sudden blow to many, and they shall not see who hurts them""."
"The lord who received this letter took it to the King's Council, and when King James saw it, he guessed what the ""sudden blow"" would be. Men were sent to search the cellars, and there, on the very night before the deed was to be done, Guy Fawkes was found waiting till the time should come to set fire to the powder. He was cruelly tortured to make him tell all he knew, but he was a brave man, and he died without betraying his friends."
"Since that time, every year, on the 5th of November, bonfires have been lighted in many places in England, and ""guys"" burned, to remind people how an English king was once saved from a great danger."
"Now the other forest people would have liked to watch the Bat longer, but after the Ground Hog had gone off in this way, they thought it would show too much curiosity if they stayed. So one after another went away, and the little Bat was left alone. He fluttered around until he reached the branch where the Blue Jay had been, and there he hung himself up to wait until night."
"""Oh dear!"" he said, ""I wonder how long a day is. I am hot and blind and sleepy, and if any more of the forest people come and talk about me, I don't know what I shall do. They don't think me good-looking because my wings grow to my legs. I only wish I could see what they look like. I believe they are just as homely."""
"And then, because he was a very tired little Bat, and cross, as people always are when they have done wrong, he began to blame somebody else for all his trouble."
"""If my father and mother had cared very much about me,"" he said, ""they would never have let me stay up all day. Guess if I were a big Bat and had little Bats of my own, I'd take better care of them!"" But that is always the way, and when, long afterward, he was a big Bat with little Bats of his own, he was a much wiser person."
A SWARM LEAVES THE BEE TREE
"The old Bee tree was becoming very crowded and the Queen-Mother grew restless. There were many things to make her so. In the tree were thousands of cells made ready for her eggs, and she had been busy for days putting one in each. In the larger cells she laid eggs that would hatch out Drones, and in the smaller ones she laid Worker eggs. She never laid any Queen eggs. Perhaps she did not want any Queens among her children, for there can never be two Queens in one swarm, and when a new one is hatched, the Queen-Mother has to go away and find another home."
That is a law among the Bees.
"The Workers, however, knew that there must be young Queens growing up all the time. Supposing something should happen to the Queen-Mother, what would become of the swarm if there were nobody to lay eggs? So after she had laid several thousand Worker eggs, and it was time for the young ones to hatch, they decided to change some of the babies into young Queens. And this was easy enough. When they were out for honey, they filled the pockets on their hind legs with pollen, the yellow dust that is found in flowers. This was to be mixed with honey and water and made into bread for the babies, who were now awake, and looked like tiny white worms in the bottom of their cells. Then they made some that was almost like sour jelly, and put it in a few of the Worker cells for the tiny white worms, or Larvæ, to eat. The Larvæ that eat this jelly grow up to be Queens, and can lay eggs. Those that eat the common bread are either Drones or Workers, whichever their mother had planned them to be."
"After the Larvæ were five or six days old, the Workers shut them up in their cells and stopped feeding them. That was because the Larvæ had other things to do than eat. They had to spin their cocoons, and lie in them until they were grown and ready to come out among the older Bees."
"When a Larva, or Bee baby, has finished its cocoon, and is lying inside, it is called a Pupa, and when a Pupa is full grown and has torn its way out of the cocoon and wax, it is called a Drone, or a Worker, or a Queen."
"Now the Queen-Mother was restless. She could hear the young Queens piping in their cells, and she knew that they wanted to come out and drive her away. She wanted to get to them and stop their piping, but the Workers stood in her way and prevented her. They knew it would not be well for the Queen-Mother to meet her royal children, and when these children tried to come out the Workers covered the doors of their cells with another layer of wax, leaving little holes where they could put out their tongues and be fed."
"This made the Queen-Mother more restless than ever. ""If I cannot do as I wish to with my own children,"" she said, ""I will leave the tree."" And she began walking back and forth as fast as she could, and talked a great deal, and acted almost wild with impatience. The Workers saw how she felt, and part of them decided to go with her. When a Worker made up her mind to go with the Queen-Mother, she showed it by also acting wild and walking back and forth, and talking a great deal, sometimes fluttering her wings very fast. Then she would go for honey, because when Bees are about to swarm they fill their honey-pockets just as full as they can. At times the Queen-Mother would be quiet, and you might almost think that she had given up going. Then suddenly she would grow restless again, and all the Workers who were going with her would act as she did, and they would get so warm with excitement that the air in the tree became quite hot."
"At last the Queen-Mother thought it time to start, and her followers came around her in the tree, and were very still for a minute. Several of the Workers had been flying in circles around the tree, and now they came to the doorway and called. Then all came out, and hovered in the air a few minutes before stopping to rest on a bush near by. When they rested, the first Bee held on to the bush, the next Bee held on to her, and that was the way they did until they were all clinging tightly together in a squirming, dark-brown mass."
"Ah, then the Queen-Mother was happy! She felt that she was young again, and she thought, ""How they love me, these dear Workers!"" She stroked her body with her legs to make herself as fine as possible, and she noticed, with pleasure, how slender she was growing. ""I had thought I should never fly again,"" she said, ""yet this is delightful. I believe I will go off by myself for a little while."""
So she flew off by herself and was talking rather airily to a Butterfly when two of the Workers came after her.
"""You may return to the rest,"" she said in a queenly way, as she motioned to them with her feelers. ""I will come by and by."""
"""No,"" said they, ""you must come at once or we shall all go back to the Bee tree. You must stay with us. You must do your part as it should be done."" And she had to go, for she knew in her heart that Queens have to obey the law as well as other people."
"After she had hung with the Workers on the bush for some time, the ones who had gone ahead to find a new home for the swarm came back and gave the signal for the rest to follow. They went to an old log near the river-bank, and here they began the real work. Crawling through an opening at one end, they found a roomy place within, and commenced to clean house at once."
"""If there is anything I do like,"" said a Worker, as she dropped a splinter of rotten wood outside the door, ""it is house-cleaning."""
"""So do I,"" said her sister. ""But what a fuss the Drones always make when we try to do anything of the sort! A pretty-looking home we'd have if they took care of it!"""
"""I'm glad none of them came with us to this place,"" said the first Worker. ""I guess they knew they were not wanted."""
"""There, there!"" said the Queen-Mother, coming up to where they were; ""you must not talk in that way. It may be that you would rather do without Drones, and perhaps they would rather do without you; but I need you both and I will not have any quarreling."" When she said this she walked away with her head in the air, and the Workers did not scold any more. They knew that she was right, and, after all, she was their Queen, even if she did have to obey the laws."
"Next they got varnish from the buds of poplar trees and varnished over all the cracks and little holes in the walls of their home, leaving open only the place where they were to go in and out. They also covered with varnish a few heavy fragments of wood that lay on the floor of their home, and when this task was done it was all in order and ready for the furniture, that is, the comb."
"You know how the comb looks, and you know how they get the wax from which to make it, but unless you are acquainted with the Bees, and have seen them at work, you have no idea what busy creatures they are. The Queen-Mother, as soon as the cells were ready and she could begin laying eggs again, was as contented and happy as ever."
"One day, when she was walking around a corner of the comb, she ran against a sad and discouraged-looking Worker. ""Why, what is the matter?"""
"said she, kindly. ""Are you sick?"""
"""No,"" answered the Worker. ""I'm not sick and I'm not tired, only I want to get through."""
"""Through with what?"" asked the Queen."
"""With work! It is clean house, varnish the walls, make wax, build combs, get honey, make bread and jelly, and feed the babies. And when they get old enough they'll have to clean house, varnish the walls, make wax, build combs, get honey, make bread and jelly, and feed the babies. I want to know when it is going to stop, and Bees can spend their time in play."""
"""Never,"" said the Queen-Mother; and she spoke very gently, for she saw that the Worker was crazy. ""It will never stop. If you had nothing to do but play all your life you would soon want to die, and you ought to, for there is no place in this world for idlers. You know that after a while the Drones die because they do nothing, and it is right they should."""
"""Don't you ever get tired of your eggs?"" asked the Worker."
"So one day, 'twas on a Thursday evening late at the fall of the year, the weather was so wild and rough outside, and it was so cruelly dark, and rain fell and wind blew, till the walls of the cottage shook again. There they all sat round the fire, busy with this thing and that. But just then, all at once something gave three taps on the window-pane. Then the father went out to see what was the matter; and, when he got out of doors, what should he see but a great big White Bear."
"""Good-evening to you!"" said the White Bear."
"""The same to you!"" said the man."
"""Will you give me your youngest daughter? If you will, I'll make you as rich as you are now poor,"" said the Bear."
"Well, the man would not be at all sorry to be so rich; but still he thought he must have a bit of a talk with his daughter first; so he went in and told them how there was a great White Bear waiting outside, who had given his word to make them so rich if he could only have the youngest daughter."
"The lassie said ""No!"" outright. Nothing could get her to say anything else; so the man went out and settled it with the White Bear that he should come again the next Thursday evening and get an answer."
"Meantime he talked his daughter over, and kept on telling her of all the riches they would get, and how well off she would be herself; and so at last she thought better of it, and washed and mended her rags, made herself as smart as she could, and was ready to start. I can't say her packing gave her much trouble."
"Next Thursday evening came the White Bear to fetch her, and she got upon his back with her bundle, and off they went. So, when they had gone a bit of the way, the White Bear said:"
"""Are you afraid?"""
"""No,"" she wasn't."
"""Well! mind and hold tight by my shaggy coat, and then there's nothing to fear,"" said the Bear."
"So she rode a long, long way, till they came to a great steep hill."
"There, on the face of it, the White Bear gave a knock, and a door opened, and they came into a castle where there were many rooms all lit up; rooms gleaming with silver and gold; and there, too, was a table ready laid, and it was all as grand as grand could be. Then the White Bear gave her a silver bell; and when she wanted anything, she was only to ring it, and she would get it at once."
"Well, after she had eaten and drunk, and evening wore on, she got sleepy after her journey, and thought she would like to go to bed, so she rang the bell; and she had scarce taken hold of it before she came into a chamber where there was a bed made, as fair and white as any one would wish to sleep in, with silken pillows and curtains and gold fringe. All that was in the room was gold or silver; but when she had gone to bed and put out the light, a man came and laid himself alongside her. That was the White Bear, who threw off his beast shape at night; but she never saw him, for he always came after she had put out the light, and before the day dawned he was up and off again. So things went on happily for a while, but at last she began to get silent and sorrowful; for there she went about all day alone, and she longed to go home to see her father and mother and brothers and sisters. So one day, when the White Bear asked what it was that she lacked, she said it was so dull and lonely there, and how she longed to go home to see her father and mother and brothers and sisters, and that was why she was so sad and sorrowful, because she couldn't get to them."
"""Well, well!"" said the Bear, ""perhaps there's a cure for all this; but you must promise me one thing, not to talk alone with your mother, but only when the rest are by to hear; for she'll take you by the hand and try to lead you into a room alone to talk; but you must mind and not do that, else you'll bring bad luck on both of us."""
"So one Sunday the White Bear came and said, now they could set off to see her father and mother. Well, off they started, she sitting on his back; and they went far and long. At last they came to a grand house, and there her brothers and sisters were running about out of doors at play, and everything was so pretty, 'twas a joy to see."
"""This is where your father and mother live now,"" said the White Bear; ""but don't forget what I told you, else you'll make us both unlucky."""
"""No! bless her, she'd not forget;"" and when she had reached the house, the White Bear turned right about and left her."
"Then, when she went in to see her father and mother, there was such joy, there was no end to it. None of them thought they could thank her enough for all she had done for them. Now, they had everything they wished, as good as good could be, and they all wanted to know how she got on where she lived."
"Well, she said, it was very good to live where she did; she had all she wished. What she said beside I don't know, but I don't think any of them had the right end of the stick, or that they got much out of her. But so, in the afternoon, after they had done dinner, all happened as the White Bear had said. Her mother wanted to talk with her alone in her bedroom; but she minded what the White Bear had said, and wouldn't go upstairs."
"""Oh! what we have to talk about will keep!"" she said, and put her mother off. But, somehow or other, her mother got round her at last, and she had to tell her the whole story. So she said, how every night when she had gone to bed a man came and lay down beside her as soon as she had put out the light; and how she never saw him, because he was always up and away before the morning dawned; and how she went about woeful and sorrowing, for she thought she should so like to see him; and how all day long she walked about there alone; and how dull and dreary and lonesome it was."
"""My!"" said her mother; ""it may well be a Troll you slept with! But now I'll teach you a lesson how to set eyes on him. I'll give you a bit of candle, which you can carry home in your bosom; just light that while he is asleep, but take care not to drop the tallow on him."""
"Yes! she took the candle and hid it in her bosom, and as night drew on, the White Bear came and fetched her away."
"But when they had gone a bit of the way, the White Bear asked if all hadn't happened as he had said."
"""Well, she couldn't say it hadn't."""
"""Now, mind,"" said he, ""if you have listened to your mother's advice, you have brought bad luck on us both, and then, all that has passed between us will be as nothing."""
"""No,"" she said, ""she hadn't listened to her mother's advice."""
"So when she reached home, and had gone to bed, it was the old story over again. There came a man and lay down beside her; but at dead of night, when she heard he slept, she got up and struck a light, lit the candle, and let the light shine on him, and so she saw that he was the loveliest Prince one ever set eyes on, and she fell so deep in love with him on the spot, that she thought she couldn't live if she didn't give him a kiss there and then. And so she did; but as she kissed him, she dropped three hot drops of tallow on his shirt, and he woke up."
"""What have you done?"" he cried; ""now you have made us both unlucky, for had you held out only this one year, I had been freed. For I have a step-mother who has bewitched me, so that I am a White Bear by day, and a Man by night. But now all ties are snapt between us; now I must set off from you to her. She lives in a Castle which stands East of the Sun and West of the Moon, and there, too, is a Princess, with a nose three ells long, and she's the wife I must have now."""
"She wept and took it ill, but there was no help for it; go he must."
Then she asked if she mightn't go with him.
"Well they all said there could be but one voice and will as to that, and when Halvor heard that he wasn't long in throwing off his beggar's rags, and arraying himself as bridegroom."
"""Aye, aye, here is the right one after all,"" said the youngest Princess as soon as she saw him, and so she tossed the other one out of the window, and held her wedding with Halvor."
THE GIANT WHO HAD NO HEART IN HIS BODY
"Once on a time there was a King who had seven sons, and he loved them so much that he could never bear to be without them all at once, but one must always be with him. Now, when they were grown up, six were to set off to woo, but as for the youngest, his father kept him at home, and the others were to bring back a princess for him to the palace. So the King gave the six the finest clothes you ever set eyes on, so fine that the light gleamed from them a long way off, and each had his horse, which cost many, many hundred pounds, and so they set off. Now, when they had been to many palaces, and seen many princesses, at last they came to a King who had six daughters; such lovely king's daughters they had never seen, and so they fell to wooing them, each one, and when they had got them for sweethearts, they set off home again, but they quite forgot that they were to bring back with them a sweetheart for Boots, their brother, who stayed at home, for they were over head and ears in love with their own sweethearts."
"But when they had gone a good bit on their way, they passed close by a steep hill-side, like a wall, where the Giant's house was, and there the Giant came out, and set his eyes upon them, and turned them all into stone, princes and princesses and all. Now the King waited and waited for his six sons, but the more he waited, the longer they stayed away; so he fell into great trouble, and said he should never know what it was to be glad again."
"""And if I had not you left,"" he said to Boots, ""I would live no longer, so full of sorrow am I for the loss of your brothers."""
"""Well, but now I've been thinking to ask your leave to set out and find them again; that's what I'm thinking of,"" said Boots."
"""Nay, nay!"" said his father; ""that leave you shall never get, for then you would stay away too."""
"But Boots had set his heart upon it; go he would; and he begged and prayed so long that the King was forced to let him go. Now, you must know the King had no other horse to give Boots but an old broken-down jade, for his six other sons and their train had carried off all his horses; but Boots did not care a pin for that, he sprang up on his sorry old steed."
"""Farewell, father,"" said he; ""I'll come back, never fear, and like enough I shall bring my six brothers back with me;"" and with that he rode off."
"So, when he had ridden a while, he came to a Raven, which lay in the road and flapped its wings, and was not able to get out of the way, it was so starved."
"""Oh, dear friend,"" said the Raven, ""give me a little food, and I'll help you again at your utmost need."""
"""I haven't much food,"" said the Prince, ""and I don't see how you'll ever be able to help me much; but still I can spare you a little. I see you want it."""
So he gave the raven some of the food he had brought with him.
"Now, when he had gone a bit further, he came to a brook, and in the brook lay a great Salmon, which had got upon a dry place and dashed itself about, and could not get into the water again."
"""Oh, dear friend,"" said the Salmon to the Prince; ""shove me out into the water again, and I'll help you again at your utmost need."""
"""Well!"" said the Prince, ""the help you'll give me will not be great, I daresay, but it's a pity you should lie there and choke;"" and with that he shot the fish out into the stream again."
"After that he went a long, long way, and there met him a Wolf which was so famished that it lay and crawled along the road on its belly."
"""Dear friend, do let me have your horse,"" said the Wolf; ""I'm so hungry the wind whistles through my ribs; I've had nothing to eat these two years."""
"""No,"" said Boots, ""this will never do; first I came to a raven, and I was forced to give him my food; next I came to a salmon, and him I had to help into the water again; and now you will have my horse. It can't be done, that it can't, for then I should have nothing to ride on."""
"""Nay, dear friend, but you can help me,"" said Graylegs the wolf; ""you can ride upon my back, and I'll help you again in your utmost need."""
"""Well! the help I shall get from you will not be great, I'll be bound,"" said the Prince; ""but you may take my horse, since you are in such need."""
"So when the Wolf had eaten the horse, Boots took the bit and put it into the Wolf's jaw, and laid the saddle on his back; and now the Wolf was so strong, after what he had got inside, that he set off with the Prince like nothing. So fast he had never ridden before."
"""When we have gone a bit farther,"" said Graylegs, ""I'll show you the Giant's house."""
So after a while they came to it.
"""See, here is the Giant's house,"" said the Wolf; ""and see, here are your six brothers, whom the Giant has turned into stone; and see, here are their six brides, and away yonder is the door, and in that door you must go."""
"""Nay, but I daren't go in,"" said the Prince; ""he'll take my life."""
"""No! no!"" said the Wolf; ""when you get in you'll find a Princess, and she'll tell you what to do to make an end of the Giant. Only mind and do as she bids you."""
"Well! Boots went in, but, truth to say, he was very much afraid."
"When he came in the Giant was away, but in one of the rooms sat the Princess, just as the Wolf had said, and so lovely a princess Boots had never yet set eyes on."
"""Oh! heaven help you! whence have you come?"" said the Princess, as she saw him; ""it will surely be your death. No one can make an end of the Giant who lives here, for he has no heart in his body."""
"At the wedding they drank and feasted both well and long; for feast they all could, even if they could not find the Princesses, and if they have not yet done feasting and drinking they must be at it still."
THE CAT ON THE DOVREFELL
"Once on a time there was a man up in Finnmark who had caught a great white bear, which he was going to take to the King of Denmark. Now, it so fell out, that he came to the Dovrefell just about Christmas Eve, and there he turned into a cottage where a man lived, whose name was Halvor, and asked the man if he could get house-room there for his bear and himself."
"""Heaven never help me, if what I say isn't true!"" said the man; ""but we can't give anyone house-room just now, for every Christmas Eve such a pack of Trolls come down upon us, that we are forced to flit, and haven't so much as a house over our own heads, to say nothing of lending one to anyone else."""
"""Oh?"" said the man, ""if that's all, you can very well lend me your house; my bear can lie under the stove yonder, and I can sleep in the side-room."""
"Well, he begged so hard, that at last he got leave to stay there; so the people of the house flitted out, and before they went, everything was got ready for the Trolls; the tables were laid, and there was rice porridge, and fish boiled in lye, and sausages, and all else that was good, just as for any other grand feast."
"So, when everything was ready, down came the Trolls. Some were great, and some were small; some had long tails, and some had no tails at all; some, too, had long, long noses; and they ate and drank, and tasted everything. Just then one of the little Trolls caught sight of the white bear, who lay under the stove; so he took a piece of sausage and stuck it on a fork, and went and poked it up against the bear's nose, screaming out:"
"""Pussy, will you have some sausage?"""
"Then the white bear rose up and growled, and hunted the whole pack of them out of doors, both great and small."
"Next year Halvor was out in the wood, on the afternoon of Christmas Eve, cutting wood before the holidays, for he thought the Trolls would come again; and just as he was hard at work, he heard a voice in the wood calling out:"
"""Halvor! Halvor!"""
"""Well,"" said Halvor, ""here I am."""
"""Have you got your big cat with you still?"""
"""Yes, that I have,"" said Halvor; ""she's lying at home under the stove, and what's more, she has now got seven kittens, far bigger and fiercer than she is herself."""
"""Oh, then, we'll never come to see you again,"" bawled out the Troll away in the wood, and he kept his word; for since that time the Trolls have never eaten their Christmas brose with Halvor on the Dovrefell."
ONE'S OWN CHILDREN ARE ALWAYS PRETTIEST
"A sportsman went out once into a wood to shoot, and he met a Snipe."
"""Dear friend,"" said the Snipe, ""don't shoot my children!"""
"""How shall I know your children?"" asked the Sportsman. ""What are they like?"""
"""Oh!"" said the Snipe, ""mine are the prettiest children in all the wood."""
"""Very well,"" said the Sportsman, ""I'll not shoot them; don't be afraid."""
"But for all that, when he came back, there he had a whole string of young snipes in his hand which he had shot."
"""Oh, oh!"" said the Snipe, ""why did you shoot my children after all?"""
"""What! these your children!"" said the Sportsman; ""why, I shot the ugliest I could find, that I did!"""
"""Woe is me!"" said the Snipe; ""don't you know that each one thinks his own children the prettiest in the world?"""
AMONG THE FOREST PEOPLE
MR. RED SQUIRREL COMES TO LIVE IN THE FOREST
"Life in the forest is very different from life in the meadow, and the forest people have many ways of doing which are not known in the world outside. They are a quiet people and do not often talk or sing when there are strangers near. You could never get acquainted with them until you had learned to be quiet also, and to walk through the underbrush without snapping twigs at every step. Then, if you were to live among them and speak their language, you would find that there are many things about which it is not polite to talk. And there is a reason for all this."
"In the meadow, although they have their quarrels and their own troubles, they always make it up again and are friendly, but in the forest there are some people who can never get along well together, and who do not go to the same parties or call upon each other. It is not because they are cross, or selfish, or bad. It is just because of the way in which they have to live and hunt, and they cannot help it any more than you could help having eyes of a certain color."
"These are things which are all understood in the forest, and the people there are careful what they say and do, so they get on very well indeed, and have many happy times in that quiet, dusky place. When people are born there, they learn these things without thinking about it, but when they come there from some other place it is very hard, for everybody thinks it stupid in strangers to ask about such simple matters."
"""Now the time is up,"" bawled the King; ""come hither, headsman, and take off his head."""
"""Nay, nay!"" said the lad; ""stop a bit, there are still three minutes!"
"Out with the key, and let me get into this house."""
"But there stood the King and fumbled with his keys, to draw out the time. At last he said he hadn't any key."
"""Well, if you haven't, I have,"" said the lad, as he gave the door such a kick that it flew to splinters inwards on the floor."
"At the door the Princess met him, and told her father this was her deliverer, on whom her heart was set. So she had him; and this was how the beggar boy came to marry the daughter of the King of Arabia."
PRINCE LINDWORM
"Once upon a time, there was a fine young King who was married to the loveliest of Queens. They were exceedingly happy, all but for one thing they had no children. And this often made them both sad, because the Queen wanted a dear little child to play with, and the King wanted an heir to the kingdom."
"One day the Queen went out for a walk by herself, and she met an ugly old woman. The old woman was just like a witch: but she was a nice kind of witch, not the cantankerous sort. She said, ""Why do you look so doleful, pretty lady?"" ""It's no use my telling you,"" answered the Queen, ""nobody in the world can help me."" ""Oh, you never know,"""
"said the old woman. ""Just you let me hear what your trouble is, and maybe I can put things right."""
"""My dear woman, how can you?"" said the Queen: and she told her, ""The King and I have no children: that's why I am so distressed."" ""Well, you needn't be,"" said the old witch. ""I can set that right in a twinkling, if only you will do exactly as I tell you. Listen."
"To-night, at sunset, take a little drinking-cup with two ears"" (that is, handles), ""and put it bottom upwards on the ground in the north-west corner of your garden. Then go and lift it up to-morrow morning at sunrise, and you will find two roses underneath it, one red and one white. If you eat the red rose, a little boy will be born to you: if you eat the white rose, a little girl will be sent. But, whatever you do, you mustn't eat both the roses, or you'll be sorry, that I warn you! Only one: remember that!"" ""Thank you a thousand times,"" said the Queen, ""this is good news indeed!"" And she wanted to give the old woman her gold ring; but the old woman wouldn't take it."
"So the Queen went home and did as she had been told: and next morning at sunrise she stole out into the garden and lifted up the little drinking-cup. She was surprised, for indeed she had hardly expected to see anything. But there were the two roses underneath it, one red and one white. And now she was dreadfully puzzled, for she did not know which to choose. ""If I choose the red one,"" she thought, ""and I have a little boy, he may grow up and go to the wars and get killed."
"But if I choose the white one, and have a little girl, she will stay at home awhile with us, but later on she will get married and go away and leave us. So, whichever it is, we may be left with no child after all."""
"However, at last she decided on the white rose, and she ate it. And it tasted so sweet, that she took and ate the red one too: without ever remembering the old woman's solemn warning."
"Some time after this, the King went away to the wars: and while he was still away, the Queen became the mother of twins. One was a lovely baby-boy, and the other was a Lindworm, or Serpent. She was terribly frightened when she saw the Lindworm, but he wriggled away out of the room, and nobody seemed to have seen him but herself: so that she thought it must have been a dream. The baby Prince was so beautiful and so healthy, the Queen was full of joy: and likewise, as you may suppose, was the King when he came home and found his son and heir. Not a word was said by anyone about the Lindworm: only the Queen thought about it now and then."
"Many days and years passed by, and the baby grew up into a handsome young Prince, and it was time that he got married. The King sent him off to visit foreign kingdoms, in the Royal coach, with six white horses, to look for a Princess grand enough to be his wife. But at the very first cross-roads, the way was stopped by an enormous Lindworm, enough to frighten the bravest. He lay in the middle of the road with a great wide open mouth, and cried, ""A bride for me before a bride for you!"" Then the Prince made the coach turn round and try another road: but it was all no use. For, at the first cross-ways, there lay the Lindworm again, crying out, ""A bride for me before a bride for you!"" So the Prince had to turn back home again to the Castle, and give up his visits to the foreign kingdoms. And his mother, the Queen, had to confess that what the Lindworm said was true. For he was really the eldest of her twins: and so he ought to have a wedding first."
"There seemed nothing for it but to find a bride for the Lindworm, if his younger brother, the Prince, were to be married at all. So the King wrote to a distant country, and asked for a Princess to marry his son (but, of course, he didn't say which son), and presently a Princess arrived. But she wasn't allowed to see her bridegroom until he stood by her side in the great hall and was married to her, and then, of course, it was too late for her to say she wouldn't have him."
But next morning the Princess had disappeared. The Lindworm lay sleeping all alone: and it was quite plain that he had eaten her.
"A little while after, the Prince decided that he might now go journeying again in search of a Princess. And off he drove in the Royal chariot with the six white horses. But at the first cross-ways, there lay the Lindworm, crying with his great wide open mouth, ""A bride for me before a bride for you!"" So the carriage tried another road, and the same thing happened, and they had to turn back again this time, just as formerly. And the King wrote to several foreign countries, to know if anyone would marry his son. At last another Princess arrived, this time from a very far distant land. And, of course, she was not allowed to see her future husband before the wedding took place, and then, lo and behold! it was the Lindworm who stood at her side. And next morning the Princess had disappeared:"
and the Lindworm lay sleeping all alone; and it was quite clear that he had eaten her.
"By and by the Prince started on his quest for the third time: and at the first cross-roads there lay the Lindworm with his great wide open mouth, demanding a bride as before. And the Prince went straight back to the castle, and told the King: ""You must find another bride for my elder brother."""
"""I don't know where I am to find her,"" said the King, ""I have already made enemies of two great Kings who sent their daughters here as brides: and I have no notion how I can obtain a third lady. People are beginning to say strange things, and I am sure no Princess will dare to come."""
"Now, down in a little cottage near a wood, there lived the King's shepherd, an old man with his only daughter. And the King came one day and said to him, ""Will you give me your daughter to marry my son the Lindworm? And I will make you rich for the rest of your life."" ""No, sire,"" said the shepherd, ""that I cannot do. She is my only child, and I want her to take care of me when I am old. Besides, if the Lindworm would not spare two beautiful Princesses, he won't spare her either. He will just gobble her up: and she is much too good for such a fate."""
"But the King wouldn't take ""No"" for an answer: and at last the old man had to give in."
"Well, when the old shepherd told his daughter that she was to be Prince Lindworm's bride, she was utterly in despair. She went out into the woods, crying and wringing her hands and bewailing her hard fate. And while she wandered to and fro, an old witch-woman suddenly appeared out of a big hollow oak-tree, and asked her, ""Why do you look so doleful, pretty lass?"" The shepherd-girl said, ""It's no use my telling you, for nobody in the world can help me."" ""Oh, you never know,"" said the old woman. ""Just you let me hear what your trouble is, and maybe I can put things right."" ""Ah, how can you?"" said the girl, ""For I am to be married to the King's eldest son, who is a Lindworm. He has already married two beautiful Princesses, and devoured them: and he will eat me too! No wonder I am distressed."""
"""Well, you needn't be,"" said the witch-woman. ""All that can be set right in a twinkling: if only you will do exactly as I tell you."" So the girl said she would."
"""Listen, then,"" said the old woman. ""After the marriage ceremony is over, and when it is time for you to retire to rest, you must ask to be dressed in ten snow-white shifts. And you must then ask for a tub full of lye,"" (that is, washing water prepared with wood-ashes) ""and a tub full of fresh milk, and as many whips as a boy can carry in his arms, and have all these brought into your bed-chamber. Then, when the Lindworm tells you to shed a shift, do you bid him slough a skin. And when all his skins are off, you must dip the whips in the lye and whip him; next, you must wash him in the fresh milk; and, lastly, you must take him and hold him in your arms, if it's only for one moment."""
"""The last is the worst notion ugh!"" said the shepherd's daughter, and she shuddered at the thought of holding the cold, slimy, scaly Lindworm."
"""Do just as I have said, and all will go well,"" said the old woman."
Then she disappeared again in the oak-tree.
"When the wedding-day arrived, the girl was fetched in the Royal chariot with the six white horses, and taken to the castle to be decked as a bride. And she asked for ten snow-white shifts to be brought her, and the tub of lye, and the tub of milk, and as many whips as a boy could carry in his arms. The ladies and courtiers in the castle thought, of course, that this was some bit of peasant superstition, all rubbish and nonsense. But the King said, ""Let her have whatever she asks for."" She was then arrayed in the most wonderful robes, and looked the loveliest of brides. She was led to the hall where the wedding ceremony was to take place, and she saw the Lindworm for the first time as he came in and stood by her side. So they were married, and a great wedding-feast was held, a banquet fit for the son of a king."
"""Now you're talking!"" he retorted approvingly. ""Say what's in your mind,"
"straightforwardly, and we'll soon come to an understanding. Sit down"
"again, you strutting peacock! and tell me what it is you want."""
"Slyne did not sit down again, however; to do so would scarcely have been"
"dignified. He stayed in the doorway, silent, a thin stream of"
"cigarette-smoke slowly filtering from his nostrils. His cold,"
calculating eyes were once more on Captain Dove's. And it was Captain
Dove's would-be mocking glance that at length gave way.
"""You offered to give me Sallie, if I paid you a hundred thousand"
"dollars,"" said Slyne, judicially."
"""To see you safely married to her,"" Captain Dove corrected him."
"Slyne nodded, in grave assent."
"""Well, I'm going to hold you to your offer,"" said he. ""The money's ready"
and waiting for you--just as soon as we can settle a few trifling
"formalities. I have Sallie's promise to marry me--"""
"""The devil you have!"" said Captain Dove, not slow to seize opportunity"
"either. ""I thought I heard her say--"""
"Slyne's face darkened again. ""And, if you'll come ashore with me now,"""
"he went on, controlling his temper, ""I'll prove to you that your money"
"is perfectly safe."""
"Captain Dove lay back in his bunk and laughed, most discordantly. He"
"laughed till his red-rimmed eyes were adrip, while Slyne sat looking at"
"him. He was still laughing when Slyne rose and, flicking the"
"cigarette-end from between two nicotine-stained fingers, began to button"
and those of the German patriotic historians the Hansa is seen in a
rather delusive abstract. The useful monograph of Miss Zimmern (_The
Hansa Towns_: Story of the Nations Series) gives a good idea of the
"reality. See in particular pp. 82-147. It should be noted, however, that"
Lübeck is credited with being the first northern town to adopt the
"Oriental usage of water-pipes (Macpherson, _Annals of Commerce_, 1802,"
"i, 381).]"
Chapter IV
HOLLAND
NOTE ON LITERATURE
The special interest of Dutch history for English and other readers led
in past generations to a more general sociological study of it than was
given to almost any other. L. Guicciardini's _Description of the Low
"Countries_ (_Descrizione ... di tutti Paesi Bassi_, etc., Anversa,"
"folio, 1567, 1581, etc.; trans. in French, 1568, etc.; in English, 1593;"
"in Dutch, 1582; in Latin, 1613, etc.) is one of the fullest surveys of"
the kind made till recent times. Sir William Temple's _Observations upon
the United Provinces of the Netherlands_ (1672) laid for English readers
further foundations of an intelligent knowledge of the vital conditions
of the State which had been in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries
the great commercial rival of England; and in the eighteenth century
many English writers discussed the fortunes of Dutch commerce. An
English translation was made of the remarkably sagacious work variously
"known as the _Memoirs of John de Witt_, the _True Interest of Holland_,"
"""Or open the cottage, if you'd rather,"" she excitedly interrupted him."
"""I hadn't intended leaving New York this winter, but will chaperon a"
"house party if you like!"""
"""Fiddlesticks! Cruise, by all means,"" he spoke with good-natured"
"emphasis. ""Get another fellow, and go after adventures and romances and"
"that kind of thing! Go after 'em hammer and tongs! By George, that's"
"what I'd do if I were a boy, and had the chance!"""
"They waited, rather expectantly."
"""Cruising's all right,"" I said, without enthusiasm. ""But it's a waste of"
"time to go after romance and adventure. They died with the war."""
"""Ho!--they did, did they?"" he laughed in mock derision. ""What's become"
"of your imagination--your vaporings? You used to be full of it!"" And the"
Mater supported him by exclaiming:
"""Why, Jack Bronx! And I used to call you my Pantheist! Don't tell me"
your second sight for discovering the beautiful in things has failed
"you!"""
"""It got put out by mustard gas, maybe,"" I murmured, remembering with"
bitterness some of the fellows who had been with me.
"What was romance here to the colorful, high-tensioned thing I had seen"
in devastated areas where loves of all gradations were torn and
scattered and trampled into the earth like chaff! Fretfully I told them
this.
"They exchanged glances, yet she continued in coaxing vein:"
"""Do you understand Accum?"""
"""I stopped shortly before Matrix. Accumulative Math is so much pothooks"
"on a sheet of paper to me."""
"""Um. Then I'd find it hard to explain. The theory seems to be"
"demonstrable, and the accumulative mathematics upholds the"
experimental evidence. But there hasn't yet been an acceptable verbal
"description of what happens."""
"""I've often wondered, leaving the nondirectional quality out of it,"
why we couldn't cut our emitting power and somehow compute range by
"observing the incoming power from a distant infrawave transmitter."""
"Allison shook his head. ""Oddly enough, the matrix mathematics that"
deal with radiation shows that for any hypothetical radiation with an
"infinite velocity of propagation, there can be no attenuation with"
"distance."""
"""Meaning that we should be able to transmit all the way from here to"
"hell and back."""
"""Not exactly. Infrawave radiation comes in quanta, you know. A kilowatt"
"covers two point one, seven nine three six plus parsecs. Two kilowatts"
"covers twice that distance minus the ninth root of two point, seven"
nine three six plus. Three kilowatts covers three times two point et
"cetera, minus two times the ninth root."" Allison shrugged and spread"
his hands.

"immediately recognized Colonel-General of Aviation Anatoly Savitsky,"
whose humorless face appeared almost weekly in Soviet Military Review;
"Major- General Igor Mikhailov, whose picture routinely graced the pages"
"of Air Defense Herald; and also Colonel-General Pavel Ogarkov, a"
marshal of the Soviet air force before that rank was abolished by the
general secretary.
What are those Air Force neanderthals doing here? They're all notorious
"hardliners, the ""bomb first, ask questions later"" boys. And _Daedalus_"
"is supposed to be for space research, right? Guess the bullshit is"
about to be over. We're finally getting down to the real scenario.
"And there in the middle, clearly the man in charge, was a tall, silver-"
haired Japanese in a charcoal silk suit. He was showing off the
"vehicles as though he owned them, and he carried himself with an"
authority that made all the hovering Soviet generals look like bellboys
waiting for a tip.
"Well, Yuri Andreevich thought, for the time being he does own them."
"They're bought and paid for, just like us."
"""_Tovarisch_, Major Androv, _kak pazhavatye_,"" came a voice behind him."
"He turned and realized it belonged to General Valentin Sokolov,"
commander of the MiG 31 wing at the Dolinsk air base on Sakhalin.
"Sokolov was three star, top man in all the Soviet Far East. Flanking"
him were half a dozen colonels and lieutenant colonels.
"""Comrade General Sokolov."" He whipped off a quick salute. Brass. Brass"
everywhere. Shit. What in hell was this all about?
"Now the project director, Taro Ikeda, had broken away from the Soviet"
"group and was approaching. ""Yuri Andreevich, thank you for coming."" He"
squarely in the stomach.
"With a startled, disbelieving look the Japanese stumbled backward,"
crashing over a large chair positioned next to the table. The other
"_kobun_ instantly reached for his holstered Llama, but by then Kenji"
"Nogami had moved, seizing him and momentarily pinning his arms with a"
powerful embrace.
"For her own part, Eva had lunged for Vera and her purse, to neutralize"
"the Walther she carried. Comrade Karanova, however, had already"
"anticipated everything. She whisked back the purse, then plunged her"
"hand in. What she withdrew, though, was not a pistol but a shiny"
cylindrical object made of glass.
"It was three against three, a snapshot of desperation."
"We've got a chance, Vance thought. Keep him down. And get the Llama."
"As the _kobun_ tried to rise, gasping, Vance threw himself over the"
"upturned chair, reaching to pin the man's arms. With a bear-like"
"embrace he had him, the body small and muscular in his arms. Out of the"
corner of his eye he saw Kenji Nogami still grappling with the other
"_kobun_. The computer now lay on the floor, open and askew."
"Where's Eva? He tried to turn and look for her, but there was no sound"
to guide him. Then the _kobun_ wrenched free one arm and brought a fist
"against the side of his face, diverting him back to matters at hand."
Hold him down. Just get the gun.
"He tried to crush his larger frame against the other's slim body,"
forcing the air out of him. Focus.
"Then, after an interminable time, Miss Craig called out cheerily;"
"""There, that's enough for this morning,"" and came down to the dory,"
opening a little crocheted bag. From it she took two crisp one dollar
"bills. ""Take this, girls, and divide it. And we are ever so"
"grateful--you were splendid types. We'll have you again some day."""
Sidney's hand had barely closed over her dollar bill when she spied a
"woman and a girl slowly walking along the wharf, watching with interest"
the artists who were still at work. The girl looked startlingly
familiar to Sidney. She gave a little gasp and ran forward.
"""_Pola!_"" she called loudly."
"The girl turned in astonishment at the sound of her name, stared for a"
"moment, then quickly advanced laughing."
"""Why, you're the Romley girl, aren't you? Of _all_ the things! What are"
"you doing here?"""
"""I'm visiting my aunt,"" explained Sidney, suddenly conscious of her"
appearance and in consequence painfully ill-at-ease.
"""Oh, and do they hire you to pose? What fun! I suppose that's a sort of"
"costume they make you wear, isn't it?"""
"""Y--yes,"" Sidney faltered, miserably. Pola's manner was prettily"
condescending and she made no move to join Sidney on the beach.
"""I'm a wreck myself,"" Pola went on, airily surveying her trim and"
"elegant person. ""Mother and I are motoring. And I made her bring me"
down here to see my cousin. He's an artist and lives here summers.
He'll just despise seeing us because he comes here to get rid of
“Eh?” bawled Sir Gilders Persimmon.
All eyes turned from Ffolliott to the perspiring Fosse. The little man
shifted uneasily under the fire of many amused critical eyes.
"“I was saying,” shrilled the minor critic in his thin jerky voice,"
“that the man who does not play whist is laying up a sad old age for
himself.”
The old baronet shook his head:
“The man who what?”
Fosse licked his lips sullenly:
"“The man who doesn’t play whist,” shrieked Fosse, reddening miserably."
“What about him?” asked Sir Gilders peremptorily.
"“Lays up a sad old age for himself,” screamed the miserable little man."
The old gentleman knit his brows:
“A reformed rake?” he asked testily....
But attention was diverted from the fussy little minor critic’s despair
by the murmur of admiration which greeted the entrance into the room
of a beautiful woman to whom Quogge Myre was paying aggressively
marked court as the announcement of her name called the regard of
the assembled guests to her arrival. Myre was ever for stealing the
lime-light. He was a born filcher of honour. But the beauty’s calm
"dismissal of him, as she swept towards her host, gave Myre a sudden"
"Defoe is uncertain, though the character of Robinson Crusoe was certainly"
"founded on his adventures in Juan Fernandez. In 1712 he returned to Largo,"
"living the life of a recluse, and we must be forgiven for suspecting that"
"he rather acted up to the part, since it is recorded that he made a cave"
in his father's garden in which to meditate. This life of meditation in an
artificial cave was soon rudely interrupted by the appearance of a certain
"Miss Sophia Bonce, with whom Selkirk fell violently in love, and they"
"eloped together to Bristol, which must have proved indeed a sad scandal to"
the elders and other godly citizens of Largo. Beyond the fact that he was
"charged at Bristol with assaulting one Richard Nettle, a shipwright, we"
"hear no more of Selkirk until his first will was drawn up in 1717, in"
"which he leaves his fortune and house to ""my loving friend Sophia Bonce,"
"of the Pall Mall, London, Spinster."" Shortly after this, Alexander basely"
"deserted his loving friend and married a widow, one Mrs. Francis Candis,"
at Oarston in Devon.
"In 1720 he was appointed mate to H.M.S. _Weymouth_, on board of which he"
died a year later at the age of 45.

all his energy for the task of eating.
Why had she written? There was nothing to prevent her speaking to him. He
"had, after all, been sitting on the doorstep when she emerged from her"
room and passed him. Had she foreseen that the good comedian could not
"contain himself, but would surely let a third person into the secret?"
"Why probe or question further? The actor did not eat much, but he looked"
"very happy. So the note must have said yes, must have been a promise;"
perhaps she would not tantalize him further.

"A few days later, they were going to leave. They would travel together,"
and that would be the end.
"I might have pitied them both, for though life is good, life is stern. One"
"result at any rate was accomplished. She had not sent for him in vain, nor"
had he come in vain.
That was the end of the act. But there were more acts to come--many more.
"She had lost much: having been ravished, she gave herself away; why be"
"niggardly now? And this is the destiny of her type, that they lose"
"increasingly much, retaining ever less; what need to hold back now? The"
ground has been completely shifted: from half-measures to the immolation
"Then Alice added, ""And even if it weren't for the hundred per, he isn't"
"the kind to kill himself."""
"Andrews grunted, ""No, he isn't. But Alice, I'm not at all sure that"
"Norton knows whether he's doing the right thing or not."""
"She shook her head. There was no answer to that argument. Furthermore,"
it was the kind of unresolvable argument that could go on and on until
the answer was supplied from the outside. There could be no end to it
until they were either picked up safely or died in lonely space.
"She decided to drop the discussion as pointless, so headed for the"
bathroom. A hot shower and a quick tubbing of her underclothing were
"on her mind. Her garments, of course, would dry instantly. She had"
to smile a little. To think that a hundred years ago women thought
something they called nylon was wonderful because it was fairly
"quick-drying! Not instantaneous, of course, as was the material of"
which her lingerie was made.
"Anyhow, getting it clean now, and having a bath herself would make"
her feel better. And she would be better equipped to face the
nerve-gruelling business of just sitting there watching the clock go
"around and around, with nothing to do but wait."

"Regin Naylo faced his superior with a scowl. ""That rips it wide open,"""
he said.
"""We are all here,"" she answered. ""None of us has fled. Did you not"
"know that?"""
He looked about him. A flash of scorn rekindled in his somber eyes.
"""You are alone. Have they deserted you?"""
"""They do not know that I am here. I crept back of my own free will--to"
"speak with you, Nehal."""
"Both hands clasped upon his sword-hilt, erect, a proud figure of"
"misfortune, he stood there and studied her, half-wonderingly,"
half-contemptuously. The restless forces at his back were forgotten.
They were no more to him than the pawns with which his will played
life and death. He was their god and their faith. They waited for his
word to sweep out of his path the white-faced Englishwoman who held
him checked in the full course of his victory. But he did not speak to
"them, but to her, in a low voice in which scorn still trembled."
"""You are here, no doubt, to intercede for those others--or for"
"yourself. You see, I have learned something in these two years. It is"
"useless. No one can stop me now."""
"""No one?"""
"He smiled, and for the first time she saw a sneer disfigure his lips."
"""Not even you, Miss Cary. You have done a great deal with me--enough"
perhaps to justify your wildest hopes--but you have touched the limits
of your powers and of my gullibility. Or did you think there were no
"limits?"""
But the wiry man was stronger than he looked. With a twist he rolled
over and pinned Vance's shoulders against the carpet. Vance felt the
"shag, soft against his skin, and couldn't believe how chilly it felt."
"But now he had his hand on the _kobun's_ throat, holding him in a"
powerful grip while jamming a free elbow against the holster.
Cut off his oxygen. Don't let him breathe.
"The old moves were coming back, the shortcuts that would bring a more"
powerful opponent to submission. He pressed a thumb against the man's
"windpipe, shutting off his air. A look of surprise went through the"
"_kobun's_ eyes as he choked, letting his hold on Vance's shoulders"
slacken.
Now.
He shoved the man's arm aside and reached for the holster. Then his
hand closed around the hard grip of the Llama. The Japanese was weaker
"now, but still forcing his arm away from the gun, preventing him from"
getting the grip he needed.
"He rammed an elbow against the man's chin, then tightened his finger on"
the grip of the Llama. He almost had it.
"With his other hand he shoved the _kobun_'s face away, clawing at his"
"eyes, and again they rolled over, with the Japanese once more against"
the carpet. But now he had the gun and he was turning.
"He felt a sharp jab in his back, a flash of pain that seemed to come"
"from nowhere. It was both intense and numbing, as though his spine had"
"been caught in a vise. Then he felt his heart constrict, his"
"""It's more 'n I did,"" returned the Girl, evenly, and bolted the door."
"""Do you think I'd want to shield a man who tried to rob me?"" she asked,"
facing him.
"Ignoring the question, Rance removed the glove of his weaponless hand"
and strode to the curtains that enclosed the Girl's bed and parted them.
When he turned back he was met by a scornful look and the words:
"""So, you doubt me, do you? Well, go on--search the place. But this ends"
your acquaintance with The Polka. Don't you ever speak to me again.
"We're through."""
Suddenly there came a smothered groan from the man in the loft; Rance
"wheeled round quickly and brought up his gun, demanding:"
"""What's that? What's that?"""
Leaning against the bureau the Girl laughed outright and declared that
the Sheriff was becoming as nervous as an old woman. Her ridicule was
"not without its effect, and, presently, Rance uncocked his gun and"
replaced it in its holster. Advancing now to the table where the Girl
"was standing, he took off his cap and shook it before laying it down;"
"then, pointing to the door, his eyes never leaving the Girl's face, he"
went on accusingly:
"""I saw someone standing out there against the snow. I fired. I could"
"have sworn it was a man."""
The Girl winced. But as she stood watching him calmly remove his coat
"and shake it with the air of one determined to make himself at home, she"
cried out tauntingly:
difficult to make out whether the men had left the boat or not. Once
Lav crawled to the top of the companion ladder but a muttering like a
human voice drove him back. Queer sounds struck upon their sensitized
ears. And the boat seemed to lift to a new motion.
They waited for an interminable time. Then Mart spoke quickly.
"""Lav, we're moving!"""
"Lav needed no warning. He, too, had missed the pull of the boat on the"
anchor rope. He shot up the ladder.
"""Oh, what's the matter?"" cried Sidney and Pola, forgetting all caution."
"Mart had no time to explain her fears. In an instant Lav was back,"
fairly throwing himself into the cabin.
"""We're drifting! They cut the anchor rope! We're drifting out! Fast!"
"Way out! To sea!"""
"That had been the ""better scheme."" To cut the _Arabella_ free from its"
mooring and let the wind and tide carry it out into the bay. At first
Starrow had not favored the plan; he had declared that it was too much
"risk, that the wind was shifting and freshening fast and that the old"
"tub might open a seam, but Joe Josephs had convinced him with: ""the"
_Arabella_ would be good for a week out in a nastier sea than this.
It's safer than riskin' runnin' afoul one of Phin Davies' men ashore.
Guthrie's _Sally_'ll stand this squall and pick up the _Arabella_ easy
"and we can reckon sure on the course the old tub'll take, even 'lowin'"
"for the wind to shift."""
As she comprehended what had happened Pola screamed. Mart and Sidney
Already they could hear the footsteps of the officers.
"""I'll take a chance. Good-bye."""
There was no time even for a hand-shake; Fraser stepped swiftly to the
"door, then strolled quietly out into the view of the two men, who an"
instant later accosted him.
"""Are you Mr. Boyd Emerson?"""
"The adventurer answered brusquely, ""Yes, but I can't talk to you now."""
"""You are under arrest, Mr. Emerson."""
Boyd waited to hear no more. The glass door swung open noiselessly
"under his hand, and he stepped out just as the bill-clerk looked up"
"from his work, staring out through the other entrance."
"""Fingerless"" Fraser's voice was louder now, as if for a signal. ""Arrest"
"me? What do you mean? Get out of my way."""
"""You'd better come peaceably."""
"Boyd heard a sharp exclamation--""Get him, Bill!"" And then the sound of"
"men struggling. He ran, followed by a roar from the strikers, in whose"
full view Fraser's encounter with the plain-clothes men was taking
place. A backward glance showed him that Fraser had drawn his pursuers
"to the street. He had broken away and dodged out into the open, where"
the other officers responded at a call and seized him as he apparently
undertook to break through the cordon. This diversion served an
unexpected purpose. Not only did it draw attention from Emerson's
"retreat, but it also gave the mob its long-awaited opportunity."
"""Maybe he dropped the knife,"" said the watchman, and began to search"
"about the floor, followed by the others."
"""It may have been the woman herself who stabbed Mr. Marsh,"" offered"
"Emerson. ""He was strangling her when I arrived."""
"Roused by this statement to a fresh denial, Marsh cried out:"
"""I tell you there wasn't any woman."""
"""And there isn't any knife either,"" Emerson sneered."
The men paused uncertainly. Seeing that they were undecided whether to
"believe him or his assailant, Marsh went on:"
"""If he hasn't a knife, then he must have had a friend with him--"""
"""Then tell your men what we were doing in here and how you came to be"
"alone with us in the dark."" Emerson stared at his accuser curiously,"
"but the Trust's manager seemed at a loss. ""See here, Marsh, if you will"
"tell us whom you were choking, maybe we can get at the truth of this"
"affair."""
"Without answering, Marsh rose, and, leaning upon the watchman's arm,"
said:
"""Help me up to the house. I'm hurt. Send the launch to the upper plant"
"for John; he knows something about medicine."" With no further word, he"
"made his way out of the building, followed by the mystified fishermen."
"No one undertook to detain Emerson, and he went his way, wondering what"
lay back of the night's adventure. He racked his brain for a hint as to
The mortuary attendant came walking along the duckboards.
As he passed by me he growled:
"""There's a 'ell of a stunt on--there'll be umpteen slabs for the"
"mortuary."""

AIR-RAIDS
"It was a warm, sunny afternoon. About a dozen of us were pitching a"
"marquee in leisurely fashion, when suddenly there was a shout of ""Fritz"
"up!"""
"We gazed at the sky, and, after searching for a while, saw a tiny white"
"speck moving slowly across the blue at an immense height. Then, at some"
"distance from it, a small white puff, like a little ball of cotton-wool,"
appeared. A few seconds passed and we heard a faint pop. More puffs
"appeared around the moving speck, each one followed by a pop. All at"
"once, behind us, a bright tongue of flame flashed out above a group of"
"bushes. There was a sharp report and a whizzing, rustling noise that"
died down gradually. Then another puff and another pop. The bright
flames flashed out again in rapid succession. The little speck moved on
and on. Grouped closely round it were compact little balls of
"cotton-wool, but trailing behind were thin wisps and semi-transparent"
whitish blurs. Above a belt of trees in the distance we observed a
The Uzi. The goddam Uzi. Why hadn't they brought it?
"It was still back in Kensington, where they'd stashed it in the false"
bottom of a new suitcase. But if the _Mino-gumi_ had been searching
"only for a computer, maybe they'd missed it. So Tanzan Mino's hoods"
could still be in for a surprise. Just make an excuse to go back.
"Vera was aware an Uzi had been part of their deal for the limo, but"
"maybe that fact had momentarily slipped her mind, what with all the"
important things she had to think about. Or maybe she'd assumed Alex
"had kept it, or maybe she thought it was still in the car. Whatever she"
"thought, things were moving too fast now."
"""I get the picture,"" he said, rising from his chair. With a"
"carefully feigned nonchalance, he strolled over to the table. ""Guess"
"it's time we got our toothbrushes."""
"""You won't have to bother, Mr. Vance,"" Vera continued. ""Your suitcases"
were sent to the plane an hour ago. We found them conveniently packed.
"Don't worry. Everything has already been taken care of."""
"Okay, scratch the Uzi. Looks like it's now or never. Settle it here."
"He shot a glance at Eva, then at Ken, trying to signal them. They"
"caught it, and they knew. She began strolling in the direction of Vera,"
"who was now standing in the doorway, as though readying to depart."
"""We appreciate the snappy service,"" Vance said. He looked down at the"
"computer, then bent over. When he came up, it was in his right hand,"
"sailing in an arc. He brought it around with all his might, aimed for"
"the nearest Japanese _kobun_. He was on target, catching the man"
CHAPTER XXVII.
THE HOUSE IN THE CHURCHYARD.
The heat which Count Leuchtenstein had thrown into the matter
"surprised me somewhat when I came to think of it, but I was soon to be"
"more surprised. I did not go to my lady at once on coming in, for on"
"the landing the sound of voices and laughter met me, and I learned"
that there were still two or three young officers sitting with her who
had outstayed Count Hugo. I waited until they were gone--clanking and
"jingling down the stairs; and then, about the hour at which I usually"
"went to take orders before retiring, I knocked at the door."
Commonly one of the women opened to me. To-night the door remained
"closed. I waited, knocked again, and then went in. I could see no one,"
"but the lamps were flickering, and I saw that the window was open."
"At that moment, while I stood uncertain, she came in through it; and"
"blinded, I suppose, by the lights, did not see me. For at the first"
"chair she reached just within the window, she sat down suddenly and"
burst into tears!
'Mein Gott!' I cried clumsily. I should have known better; but the
laughter of the young fellows as they trooped down the stairs was
"still in my ears, and I was dumfounded."
"She sprang up on the instant, and glared at me through her tears. 'Who"
are--how dare you? How dare you come into the room without knocking?'
she cried violently.
"'I did knock, my lady,' I stammered, 'asking your pardon.'"
"There young Charles was waiting for him. Carefully, as though"
"everything depended on it, he was tucking a towel round the hot-water"
can. Young Charles had been a favourite of his ever since as a little
red-faced boy he had come into the house to look after the fires. Old
"Mr. Neave lowered himself into the cane lounge by the window, stretched"
"out his legs, and made his little evening joke, “Dress him up,"
"Charles!” And Charles, breathing intensely and frowning, bent forward"
to take the pin out of his tie.
"H’m, h’m! Well, well! It was pleasant by the open window, very"
pleasant—a fine mild evening. They were cutting the grass on the tennis
court below; he heard the soft churr of the mower. Soon the girls would
begin their tennis parties again. And at the thought he seemed to hear
"Marion’s voice ring out, “Good for you, partner.... Oh, _played_,"
"partner.... Oh, _very_ nice indeed.” Then Charlotte calling from the"
"veranda, “Where is Harold?” And Ethel, “He’s certainly not here,"
"mother.” And Charlotte’s vague, “He said—”"
"Old Mr. Neave sighed, got up, and putting one hand under his beard, he"
"took the comb from young Charles, and carefully combed the white beard"
"over. Charles gave him a folded handkerchief, his watch and seals, and"
spectacle case.
"“That will do, my lad.” The door shut, he sank back, he was alone...."
And now that little ancient fellow was climbing down endless flights
"that led to a glittering, gay dining-room. What legs he had! They were"
"like a spider’s—thin, withered."
"“You’re an ideal family, sir, an ideal family.”"
"But if that were true, why didn’t Charlotte or the girls stop him? Why"
"""That's my business!"" came like a knife-cut from the Girl."
"""Do you know you're talkin' to the Sheriff?"""
"""I'm talkin' to Jack Rance, the gambler,"" she amended evenly."
"""You're right,--and he's just fool enough to take you up,"" returned"
Rance with sudden decision. He looked around him for a chair; there was
"one near the table, and the Girl handed it to him. With one hand he"
"swung it into place before the table, while with the other he jerked off"
"the table-cover, and flung it across the room. Johnson neither moved nor"
"groaned, as the edge slid from beneath his nerveless arms."
"""You and the cyards have got into my blood. I'll take you up,"" he said,"
seating himself.
"""Your word,"" demanded the Girl, leaning over the table, but still"
standing.
"""I can lose like a gentleman,"" returned Rance curtly; then, with a swift"
"seizure of her hand, he continued tensely, in tones that made the Girl"
"shrink and whiten, ""I'm hungry for you, Min, and if I win, I'll take it"
"out on you as long as I have breath."""
"A moment later, the Girl had freed her hand from his clasp, and was"
"saying evenly, ""Fix the lamp."" And while the Sheriff was adjusting the"
"wick that had begun to flare up smokily, she swiftly left the room,"
saying casually over her shoulder that she was going to fetch something
from the closet.
"""What you goin' to get?"" he called after her suspiciously. The Girl made"
the wardrobe top.
"In that same moment Johnson was standing in the parting of the curtains,"
his hand raised warningly. In another moment he was over to the door
"where, after taking his pistols from his overcoat pockets, he stood in a"
"cool, determined attitude, fingering his weapons."
"""But some one's ben callin',"" the Girl was saying, at the very moment"
when above the loud roaring of the wind another knock was heard on the
"cabin door. ""Who can it be?"" she asked as if to herself, and calmly went"
"over to the table, where she took up the candle and lit it."
"Springing to her side, Johnson whispered tensely:"
"""Don't answer--you can't let anyone in--they wouldn't understand."""
The Girl eyed him quizzically.
"""Understand what?"" And before he had time to explain, much less to check"
"her, she was standing at the window, candle in hand, peering out into"
the night.
"""Why, it's the posse!"" she cried, wheeling round suddenly. ""How did they"
"ever risk it in this storm?"""
At these words a crushed expression appeared on Johnson's countenance;
"an uncanny sense of insecurity seized him. Once more the loud, insistent"
"pounding was repeated, and as before, the outlaw, his hands on his guns,"
commanded her not to answer.
"""But what on earth do the boys want?"" inquired the Girl, seemingly"
"oblivious to what he was saying. Indeed, so much so that as the voice of"
"door. Stripped down for action, they were quickly and professionally"
"tallying the certificates, one handling the open cashiers checks and"
the other the bearer bonds.
"Guess they intend to keep a close eye on the details, Vance thought."
"Well, screw them. We've still got the protocol. We've got some leverage"
left.
But he was having trouble focusing on the future. He was still in shock
from the sight of Novosty being gunned down in cold blood. Alex's
"abrupt death was a tragic end to an exceptional, if sometimes dubious,"
career. He'd really wanted Novosty to make this one last score. The man
"deserved it. He was an operator who lived at the edge, and Vance had"
"always admired players who put everything on the table, no matter which"
side.
"Well, he told himself, the scenario had come close, damned close. But"
maybe it was doomed from the start. You only get so many chances to
"tempt the fates. Today everybody's number came up, Alex's for the last"
time.
"Rest in peace, Aleksei Ilyich."
"Then Vera turned back to them. ""Now, I want the computer. We know it"
"was moved to the house in Kensington, but our search this morning did"
"not locate it."""
"So they were on to us from the start, Vance realized."
"""Looks like you've got a problem."" He strolled over and plopped down in"
"one of the straight-backed chairs along the opposite wall. ""Too bad."""
torrent of rain beat upon the Frangipani's streaming face; he tottered
"on his knees, but still held his hands to the heavens."
"""They lied,"" he cried. ""Give me but life.""--"
The duke looked at him and heaved up his sword.
"Giovanni Frangipani saw the white face above him, gave a great cry and"
cowered behind his hands. It was all ended in a moment. The rain
washed his gilded harness as he lay with his blood soaking into the
crevices of the rocks.--
Francesco had witnessed neither the fight nor the ending. Impelled by
"an insensate desire to find Raniero, to have a final reckoning for all"
"the baseness and insults he had heaped upon him in the past, for his"
"treachery and cruelty to Ilaria, he had made his way to the great"
hall.
The door was closed and locked from within.
Francesco dealt it a terrific blow. Its shattered framework heaved
inward and toppled against the wall.
In the doorway stood Raniero and looked out at his opponent. He did
not recognize Francesco. His face was sullen; the glitter of his
little eyes mimicked the ring gleams of his hauberk. He put out the
tip of a tongue and moistened his lips.
Francesco's face was as the face of a man who has but one purpose left
"in life and, that accomplished, cares not what happens. Raising his"
"vizor, he said:"

"""Sallie--_Harris!_"" Mr. Jobling ejaculated. ""Dear me! Did you say"
"Sallie--er--Harris?"""
"""I said Saleh Harez,"" affirmed Captain Dove, and filled the glass at his"
"elbow again. ""But all that concerns you, so far's I can see, is that"
I've known her ever since she was knee-high to me. I've been a father to
"her all those years, and she's my adopted daughter. So now, you can take"
"it from me, Mr. Jobling, that I'm the joker, and both bowers too, in"
"this merry little game."""
"""Which makes it all the more unfortunate for you that you haven't a"
"single penny to stake on your hand,"" Slyne put in, while the lawyer"
"looked somewhat blankly from one to the other of them. ""So--don't waste"
"any more time bluffing, but tell Jobling how you found Sal--Lady"
"Josceline."""
"Captain Dove darted a very evil look at his friendly adviser. ""And what"
"if I refuse?"" he asked."
"Slyne almost smiled. ""Why cut off your own nose to spite your face?"" he"
"returned. ""You won't refuse, because it would cost you a hundred"
"thousand dollars to do so."""
"Captain Dove stroked his chin contemplatively, and his face slowly"
cleared.
"""A hundred and fifty thousand, you mean,"" he said in a most malevolent"
tone.
"Slyne got up from the table as if in anger, and for some time the two"
"wrangled over that point, the stout solicitor gazing at them with"
"evident dismay, while Sallie awaited the upshot of it all with bated"
"“I want to talk to you, Wallie,” said he."
"“Have a drink? No? I sha' n't want anything, Perkins,” said he to"
the waiting dresser. “Call me when I 'm on in the second act. I don't
"change,” he explained."
"“I know,” said John. “That 's why I 've come now.”"
"“What's the matter?” Herold asked, sitting in the chair before the"
"dressing-table, bright with mirrors and electric lights and sticks of"
grease paint and silver-topped pots and other paraphernalia.
"“Nothing particular. Only hell, just as usual. I saw that child to-day.”"
Herold lit a cigarette.
“Have you ever speculated on what becomes of the victims in cases of
this kind?” asked John.
"“Not particularly,” said Herold, seeing that John wanted to talk."
“What do you think can become of a human creature in the circumstances
of this poor little wretch? Her childhood is one vista of bleak
"ugliness. Never a toy, never a kiss, not even the freedom of the gutter."
"Unless you 've been there, you can't conceive the soul-crushing despair"
of that infernal orphanage. She leaves it and goes into the world.
She goes out of a kind of dreary Greek hades into a Christian hell. It
"lasted for months. She was too ignorant and spiritless to complain, and"
"to whom was she to complain? Now she's sent back again, just like a sick"
"animal, to hades. Fancy, they would n't let her have a few flowers in'"
"the room! It makes me mad to think of it. And when she gets well again,"
"hands and arms a long pair of motoring doeskin gloves. By George, she"
"was a winner—in general looks, though. Well, something about the clerk,"
"I suppose, must have aroused her suspicions. For, a moment later, she"
was gone in the crowd. Evidently she had thought of the danger and had
picked out a time when the lobby would be full and everybody busy. But
she did not leave by the front entrance through which she entered. I
concluded that she must have left by one of the side street carriage
doors.”
“And she got away?”
“Yes. I found that she asked one of the boys at the door to crank up a
"car standing at the curb. She slid into the seat, and was off in a"
minute.”
Kennedy said nothing. But I knew that he was making a mighty effort to
restrain comment on the bungling amateur detective work of the son of
our client.
"Reginald saw the look on his face. “Still,” he hastened, “I got the"
number of the car. It was 200859 New York.”
“You have looked it up?” queried Kennedy quickly.
“I didn’t need to do it. A few minutes later Dr. Rae Wilson herself
came out—storming like mad. Her car had been stolen at the very door of
the hotel by this woman with the innocent aid of the hotel employees.”
Kennedy was evidently keenly interested. The mention of the stolen car
had apparently at once suggested an idea to him.
"“Mrs. Blake,” he said, as he rose to go, “I shall take this letter with"
the bottom a la log.
“Here we go!” shouted Frank.
The boys raced along the slope until they came to a point of timber
"which, following a more fertile spot, thrust itself up the ascent. Here"
"they disappeared, considering themselves reasonably safe in the"
seclusion of the forest. Frank examined his gun and found it empty.
“Good thing that dub didn’t know it was empty!” he laughed.
“Don’t stop now to throw bouquets at yourself!” grinned Harry.
“That’s right!” Jack declared. “We want to be getting back to the camp.
Gilroy’ll have a fit if he wakes up and finds us gone.”
"“Don’t you ever think those half-breeds will give up the chase here,”"
"Frank suggested. “Do you know what they’ll do?” he asked, “They’ll"
circle around and get between us and the camp! That’s what they’ll do.”
"“I sometimes think,” Harry snorted, turning to Jack, “that Frank is"
getting so intelligent that he may have the gift of speech conferred
upon him. He certainly has that proposition right.”
"“Well, if we can’t go back to camp,” Jack asked, “where can we go?”"
“We’ll have to glide into some gentle dell in the bosom of a friendly
"hill!” laughed Harry, “and send a scout out to watch those fellows spy"
upon the camp.”
“If they’ve got a detachment of half-breeds guarding every squad of Boy
"Scouts that have strayed away from the camp today,” Jack laughed, “they"
chuckled ecstatically. His own eyes were shining.
"""That settles it, Lady Josceline,"" said he triumphantly, turning to"
"Sallie. ""I'll stake my professional reputation on your identity now. You"
"need have no further doubt--"""
"""And just to clinch the matter,"" growled Captain Dove, ""you'd better add"
this to your affidavy:--The clothes the kid was wearing when I fetched
her off that dhow were all marked with the moniker 'J. J.' and some sort
of crest. But--they were all lost when the ship I commanded then
"was--went down at sea."""
"Mr. Jobling groaned. ""How _very_ unfortunate!"" he remarked before he"
resumed his writing. And Slyne stared fixedly at the old man until the
lawyer had finished.
"""Now,"" said Mr. Jobling, adjusting his pince-nez and beaming about him"
"again, ""we can call in a couple of witnesses and--"""
"""We'll witness each other's signatures."" Slyne disagreed. ""Better not"
"bring in any outsiders."""
"The stout solicitor frowned over that, but finally nodded concurrence."
"And Captain Dove took the pen from him, only to hand it to Slyne."
"""Gimme my thousand dollars and your joint note for the balance first,"""
he requested unamiably.
"Slyne signed the new note Mr. Jobling pushed across the table, and Mr."
Jobling endorsed it. Captain Dove read it over carefully before he
"pocketed it, and also counted with great caution the bills Slyne tossed"
"to him. Then he in his turn signed, without reading it, the statement"
"""By Jove,"" he cried, ""the news'll be at the House by now! Come along,"
"man, come along!"""
"And, as they went, they read the rest; for the paper had it all--even a"
copy of that marriage certificate.
CHAPTER XXIII.
AN ORATOR'S RIVAL.
"The House was crowded, and every gallery full. Lady Eynesford and"
"Eleanor Scaife, attended by Captain Heseltine, occupied their appointed"
seats; the members of the Legislative Council overflowed from their
proper pen and mingled with humbler folk in the public galleries;
"reporters wrote furiously, and an endless line of boys bearing their"
slips came and went. The great hour had arrived: the battle-field was
reached at last. Sir Robert Perry sat and smiled; Puttock played with
the hair chain that wandered across his broad waistcoat; Coxon
"restlessly bit his nails; Norburn's face was pale with excitement, and"
he twisted his hands in his lap; the determined partisans cheered or
groaned; the waverers looked important and felt unhappy; all eyes were
"steadily fixed on the Premier, and all ears intent on his words."
For the moment he had forgotten everything but the fight he was
"fighting. No thought of the wretched Benham, who lay dead, no thought of"
"his daughter, who watched him as he spoke, no thought of Alicia"
"Derosne, who stayed away that she might not see him, crossed his brain"
"reversed, and then ended. This was the last answer of the plants."
Thus the responsiveness of the plant world was one. There was no
"difference of any kind between sunshine plants, and those which had"
hitherto been regarded as insensitive or ordinary. It had also been
shown that all the varied and complex responses of the animal were
foreshadowed in the plant. An impressive spectacle was thus revealed of
"that vast unity in which all living organisms, from the simplest plant"
"to the highest animal, were linked together and made one."

EVIDENCE BEFORE THE PUBLIC SERVICES COMMISSION
"The following is the evidence given by Dr. J. C. Bose, C. S. I., C. I."
"E., Professor of Physics, Presidency College, Calcutta, on the 18th"
"December, 1913, before the Royal Commission on the Public Services in"
"India, presided over by Lord Islington, and published, in the Minutes of"
"Evidence relating to the Education Department, at pages 135 to 137, in"
"volume XX, Appendix to the Report of the Commissioners:"
WRITTEN STATEMENT RELATING TO THE EDUCATION DEPARTMENT
"83, 627 (I) _Method of recruitment._--The first question on which I have"
been asked to give my opinion is as regards the method of recruitment. I
think that a high standard of scholarship should be the only
"qualification insisted on. Graduates of well-known Universities,"
Thursday 2:28 P.M.
"""The hypersonic test flight must proceed as scheduled,"" Tanzan Mino"
"said quietly. ""Now that all the financial arrangements have been"
"completed, the Coordinating Committee of the LDP has agreed to bring"
"the treaty before the Diet next week. A delay is unthinkable."""
"""The problem is not technical, Mino-sama,"" Taro Ikeda, the project"
"director, continued, his tone ripe with deference. ""It is the Soviet"
"pilot. Perhaps he should be replaced."" He looked down, searching for"
"the right words. ""I'm concerned. I think he has discovered the stealth"
"capabilities of the vehicle. Probably accidentally, but all the same,"
I'm convinced he is now aware of them. Two nights ago he engaged in
certain unauthorized maneuvers I believe were intended to verify those
"capabilities."""
"""_So deshoo_."" Tanzan Mino's eyes narrowed. ""But he has said nothing?"""
"""No. Not a word. At least to me."""
"""Then perhaps he was merely behaving erratically. It would not be the"
"first time."""
"""The maneuvers. They were too explicit,"" Ikeda continued. ""As I said,"
"two nights ago, on the last test fight, he switched off the"
"transponder, then performed a snap roll and took the vehicle into a"
"power dive, all the way to the deck. It was intended to be a radar-"
"evasive action."" The project director allowed himself a faint, ironic"
"smile. ""At least we now know that the technology works. The vehicle's"
thought that she had been unjust was iron through Mrs. Carmichael's
"soul, for above all things she prided herself on her fairness. She"
pushed her work away and went over to Beatrice's side. Mrs. Cary's
"head still rested against the aching shoulder, and Mrs. Carmichael"
made a sign to let her improvize a cushion substitute. Beatrice shook
her head.
"""No, thank you,"" she whispered, glancing down at the flushed, sleeping"
"face. ""We have done each other so little real service that I am glad"
to be able to do even this much. I don't suppose it will be for long.
"How quiet everything is!"""
Mrs. Carmichael looked at the clock on the writing-table.
"""It is not yet midnight,"" she said. ""Probably the Rajah is keeping his"
"promise."" Her expression relaxed a little. ""Don't tire yourself,"" she"
"added bruskly to Mrs. Berry, who had been fanning the unconscious"
"woman's face with an improvized paper fan. ""I don't think she feels"
"the heat."""
The missionary's wife continued her good work with redoubled energy.
It was perhaps one of the few really unselfish things which she had
"ever done in the course of a pious but fundamentally selfish life, and"
it gave her pleasure and courage. The knowledge that some one was
weaker than herself and needed her was new strength to her new-born
heroism.
"""It is so frightfully hot,"" she said half apologetically. ""Why isn't"
"the punkah-man at work?"""
"""The 'punkah-man' has bolted with the rest of them,"" Mrs. Carmichael"
"answered. ""I dare say I could work it, though I have never tried."""

(_f_) The title _Lady_ belongs to daughters of all noblemen not lower
than earl.
(_g_) The title _Hon._ belongs to daughters of viscounts and barons;
"also to an untitled woman who becomes a maid-of-honor to the Queen,"
and this title is retained after she leaves the service. If a woman who
has the title _Lady_ becomes maid-of-honor she does not acquire the
title _Hon._
Index compound names according to the usage of the author's
"fatherland, though if it is known that his practice differs from"
"this usage, his preference should be followed. Compound names"
then go:
"(_a_) If English, under the last part of the name, when the first has"
"not been used alone by the author: e.g., _Gould, Sabine Baring-_;"
"but _Halliwell (afterwards Halliwell-Phillipps), J. O._, and _Locker"
"(afterwards Locker-Lampson)_, because they are well-known under the"
first names.
"(_b_) If foreign, under the first part."
Both such compound names as _Gentil-Bernard_ and such as _Gentil de
"Chavagnac_. There are various exceptions, when a name has been more"
"known under the last part, as _Fénelon_, not _Salignac de Lamothe"
"Fénelon_; _Voltaire_, not _Arouet de Voltaire_; _Sternberg_, not"
"_Ungern-Sternberg_. Moreover, it is not always easy to determine"
what is a compound surname in French. Cross-references are necessary
"whichever way one decides each case, especially when the second part"
"“I don’t understand,” she began feebly. And then the darkness fell upon"
"her, and her limbs relaxed. She swayed sideways and would have fallen,"
but he caught her in his arms and laid her on the couch.
"“Thank you,” she murmured faintly."
"She hid her face in her hands and remained, crouched up, quite still, in"
"a stupor of misery. The Canon stood over her helplessly, unable to find"
a word of comfort.
The sight of her prostration did not move him. He had been wounded to
"the very depths of his being. His pride, his honour, his dignity were"
lacerated in their vitals. He burned with the sense of unpardonable
wrong.
"“It is self-evident,” he said at last, “that we must part. Our remaining"
together would be a sin against God and an outrage upon Society.”
"She rased herself wearily, with one hand on the couch, and shook her"
head slowly.
“Such things are beyond me. No one will ever know.”
"“There is One who will always know, Yvonne.”"
"She pondered over the saying, as far as her tired, bewildered brain"
allowed. It conveyed very little meaning to her. Theology had not
altered her child-like conception of the benevolence of the Creator.
After a long time she was able to disentangle an idea from the
confusion.
"lately?"""
"""Very well, I believe. The men were down the other day, and told me it"
"was a big thing."""
"""I'm delighted. How does it seem, to be rich?"""
There was the slightest hint of constraint in the girl's voice as she
"stared out at the slowly gathering twilight, murmuring:"
"""I--I hardly know. Rich! That has always been my dream, and yet--"""
"""The wonderful feature about dreams,"" he took advantage of her pause to"
"say, ""is that they come true."""
"""Not all of them--not the real, wonderful dreams,"" she returned."
"""Oh yes! My dream is coming true, and so is yours."""
"""I have given up hoping for that,"" she said, without turning."
"""But you shouldn't give up. Remember that all the great things ever"
"accomplished were only dreams at first, and the greater the"
"accomplishments, the more impossible they seemed to begin with."""
Something in the girl's attitude and in her silence made him feel that
"his words rang hollow and commonplace. While they had talked, an"
"unaccustomed excitement had been mounting in his brain, and it held him"
now in a kind of delicious embarrassment. It was as if both had been
"suddenly enfolded in a new and mysterious understanding, without the"
need of speech. He did not tell himself that Cherry loved him; but he
"roused to a fresh perception of her beauty, and felt himself privileged"
"for herself, but with fear for me. No one can reassure her. In fact it"
was as much for her sake as anyone’s that I sent for you. Reginald has
"tried to trace the thing down himself, but has not succeeded.”"
She paused. The door opened and Reginald Blake entered. He was a young
"fellow, self confident and no doubt very efficient at the new dances,"
"though scarcely fitted to rub elbows with a cold world which, outside"
"of his own immediate circle, knew not the name of Blake. He stood for a"
moment regarding us through the smoke of his cigarette.
"“Tell me just what you have done,” asked Kennedy of him as his mother"
"introduced him, although he had done the talking for her over the"
telephone.
"“Done?” he drawled. “Why, as soon as mother told me of the letter, I"
"left an envelope up at the Prince Henry, as it directed.”"
“With the money?” put in Craig quickly.
"“Oh, no—just as a decoy.”"
“Yes. What happened?”
"“Well, I waited around a long time. It was far along in the day when a"
woman appeared at the desk. I had instructed the clerk to be on the
watch for anyone who asked for mail addressed to a Dr. Hopf. The clerk
slammed the register. That was the signal. I moved up closer.”
“What did she look like?” asked Kennedy keenly.
"“I couldn’t see her face. But she was beautifully dressed, with a long"
"light flowing linen duster, a veil that hid her features and on her"
obstinately.
"'Wait,' he said; 'I will ask.'"
But when the old housekeeper came she had only the same tale to tell.
She was alone. No young woman had crossed the threshold for a week
"past. There was no other woman there, young or old."
'You will have it that I have a young man in the house next!' she
"grumbled, shooting scorn at me."
"'I can assure you that there is no one here,' Herr Krapp said civilly."
"'Dorcas has been with me many years, and I can trust her. Still if you"
like you can walk through the rooms.'
"But I hesitated to do that. The man's manner evidenced his sincerity,"
"and in face of it my belief wavered. Fancy, I began to think, had"
played me a trick. It was no great wonder if the features which were
"often before me in my dreams, and sometimes painted themselves on the"
"darkness while I lay wakeful, had for once taken shape in the"
"daylight, and so vividly as to deceive me. I apologised. I said what"
"was proper, and, with a heavy sigh, went from the door."
"Ay, and with bent head. The passing crowd and the sunshine and the"
distant music of drum and trumpet grated on me. For there was yet
another explanation. And I feared that Marie was dead.
I was still brooding sadly over the matter when I reached home. Steve
"met me at the door, but, feeling in no mood for small talk just then,"
"I would have passed him by and gone in, if he had not stopped me."
"'I have a message for you, lieutenant,' he said."
"19. The Captors shall, with all practicable Speed after the captured"
"Ship is brought into Port, bring Three or Four of the Principal Persons"
belonging to the captured Ship before the Judge of the Court or some
"Person authorised in this behalf, by whom they shall be examined on Oath"
on the Standing Interrogatories.
"The Preparatory Examinations on the Standing Interrogatories shall, if"
"possible, be concluded within Five Days from the Commencement thereof."
[Sidenote: Adjudication by Court.]
"20. After the Return of the Monition, the Court shall, on Production of"
"the Preparatory Examinations and Ship Papers, proceed with all"
convenient Speed either to condemn or to release the captured Ship.
[Sidenote: Further Proof.]
"21. Where, on Production of the Preparatory Examinations and Ship"
"Papers, it appears to the Court doubtful whether the captured Ship is"
"good Prize or not, the Court may direct further Proof to be adduced,"
"either by Affidavit or by Examination of Witnesses, with or without"
"Pleadings, or by Production of further Documents; and on such further"
Proof being adduced the Court shall with all convenient Speed proceed to
Adjudication.
"[Sidenote: Custody, &c. of Ships of War.]"
"22. The foregoing Provisions, as far as they relate to the Custody of"
"the Ship, and to Examination on the Standing Interrogatories, shall not"
apply to Ships of War taken as Prize.
"So, with greatly altered circumstance, was it in the present instance."
Rollo kissed first and made up his mind to it some time after.
Consequently Concha was taken absolutely by surprise. She uttered a
little cry and stepped back indignantly into the lighted room where the
spare muskets were piled.
"But again Rollo was before her. If he had attempted to make love, she"
"would have scathed him with the soundest indignation, based on"
"considerations of time, place, and personality."
But the young Scot gave her no opportunity. In a moment he had again
become her superior officer.
"""Take your piece,"" he said, with an air of assured command, ""together"
"with sufficient ammunition, and post yourself at the little staircase"
window over the great door looking towards the town. If you see any one
"approaching, do not hesitate to fire. Good-bye. God bless you! I will"
"see you again on my rounds!"""
And Rollo passed on his way.
"Then with a curious constraint upon her tongue, and on her spirit a new"
and delightful feeling that she could do no other than as she was
"bidden, Concha found herself, with loaded musket and pistol, obediently"
taking her place in the general defence of the palace.
CHAPTER XXXII
"By mutual consent, Mrs. Carmichael and Beatrice ceased to talk, but"
"when suddenly there was a movement close to them, and a dim light"
"flashed over the partition, they exchanged a glance of meaning."
"""That is my husband,"" Mrs. Carmichael whispered. ""Something is going"
"to happen. Listen!"""
She was not wrong in her supposition. The Colonel had entered the next
"room, followed by Nicholson and Saunders, and had closed the door"
carefully after him. All three men carried lanterns. They glanced
instinctively at the wooden partition which divided them from the four
"women, but Carmichael shook his head."
"""It's all right,"" he said. ""They must be fast asleep, poor souls."
"Let's have a look at these fellows."" He went over to a huddled-up"
figure lying in the shadow. The corner of a military cloak had been
thrown over the face. He drew it on one side and then let it drop.
"""Gone!"" he said laconically. He passed on to the next. There were in"
"all three men ranged against the wall. Two of them were dead. ""Martins"
"told me they couldn't last,"" Colonel Carmichael muttered. ""It is"
"better for them. They are out of it a little sooner, that's all."" The"
"third man was Travers. He lay on his back, his face turned slightly"
"toward the wall, his eyes closed. He seemed asleep. The Colonel nodded"
"somberly. ""Another ten hours,"" he calculated."
"He came back to the table, where the others waited, and drew out a"
paper from his pocket.
"""Give me your light a moment, Nicholson,"" he said."
No one spoke while he examined the list before him. All around them
"allow her,--and great gladness lit her face."
“Darling! Are you going to stay here to-day and to-morrow and the next
day?”
"“My dear,” said John, “I've got to get up to town this morning.”"
"“You won't do that,” said Stella. “Look at the clock.”"
"It was a quarter to one. He had spent the whole morning with her, and"
the hours had flown by like minutes.
“Why did n't you tell me that I ought to be catching my train?”
She regarded him in demure mischief.
“I had no object in making you catch your train.”
"And then Her Serene High-and-Mightiness, the nurse (who had been called"
"in for Stella when first she was put to bed in the sea-chamber, and,"
"falling under her spell, had stayed on until she had grown as much"
involved in the web of her life as Sir Oliver and Lady Julia and
"Constable and Herold and Risca), came into the room and decreed the end"
of the morning interview.
"Risca went down-stairs, his purpose unaccomplished. He walked about the"
"garden and argued with himself. Now, when a man argues with himself, he,"
"being only the extraneous eidolon of himself, invariably gets the worst"
"of the argument, and this makes him angry. John was angry; to such a"
"point that, coming across Sir Oliver, who had just returned from an"
inexplicably disastrous game of golf and began to pour a story of
"bunkered gloom into his ear, he gnashed his teeth and tore his hair and"
"Dagoes, and Dutchmen and Calashees, I'd 'ave showed you and Salisbury"
"'ow to 'andle mixed sweets.  Vig'lance, difficulties, bright"
"look-out, and the rule o' the road.  And look at the chart!  That's"
"me!"""
"And very shortly afterwards the triple conversation ceased, for the"
captain lay snoring in his cabin.
"The _Potluck_ was a barque of eleven hundred tons' register, and was"
"bound for Adelaide, with a general cargo of all mixed things under"
heaven and on earth.  Now she was engaged in running down her
"easting, and, as her skipper believed, was somewhere about Lat. 44°"
"30' S., Long. 50° E., and not far off the Crozets.  The westerly"
"winds were blowing hard, but had the worst chill of winter off, for"
"the month was September.  Nevertheless, as old Jones, the skipper,"
"was on a composite track, with a maximum latitude of 45° S., and was"
bound farther south still it might have been to the advantage of all
"concerned if he had drunk less, talked little, and minded his own"
business instead of arguing foreign politics.
But to each man Fate often gives his chance of proving what he boasts
to be his particular skill in the universe.
"When Lampert relieved Simcox at midnight, the weather was thick, and"
"neither man's temper was of the sweetest, so they had a bit of a"
breeze.
"""What kind of a relief d'ye call this?' growled Simcox."
"""I call it a very good relief,"" replied Lampert, ""and a darned sight"
"better one than you deserve.  You owe me ten minutes even now."""
he picked his way through the passengers down to the steps at the front
"of the car. His wife followed, but she first turned her eyes and saw"
the escaped tourist glide from behind the furniture van and slip behind
"a tree on the edge of the little park, not fifty feet away."
"Descended to the ground, James Williams faced his captors with a smile."
He was thinking what a good story he would have to tell in Cloverdale
about having been mistaken for a burglar. The Rubberneck coach
"lingered, out of respect for its patrons. What could be a more"
interesting sight than this?
"“My name is James Williams, of Cloverdale, Missouri,” he said kindly,"
so that they would not be too greatly mortified. “I have letters here
that will show—”
"“You’ll come with us, please,” announced the plainclothes man. “‘Pinky’"
McGuire’s description fits you like flannel washed in hot suds. A
detective saw you on the Rubberneck up at Central Park and ’phoned down
to take you in. Do your explaining at the station-house.”
James Williams’s wife—his bride of two weeks—looked him in the face
"with a strange, soft radiance in her eyes and a flush on her cheeks,"
looked him in the face and said:
"“Go with ’em quietly, ‘Pinky,’ and maybe it’ll be in your favour.”"
And then as the Glaring-at-Gotham car rolled away she turned and threw
a kiss—his wife threw a kiss—at some one high up on the seats of the
Rubberneck.
"“Your girl gives you good advice, McGuire,” said Donovan. “Come on,"
now.”
"grounds, chatting and sipping tea, I was watching, watching. And my hand"
"was never far from the butt of the Webley automatic which, slung from my"
"waist, was hidden in a bag of silk."""
"""Heavens!"" he cried out. ""You are...."""
"""Hush,"" interposed Madame. ""A lawyer and a Gatepath should be more"
"discreet. The war is over, and I can tell you now that I fought every"
"minute of it in the Secret Service, the Civil branch. I was the head"
"woman, the bright particular star, in Dawson's Secret Corps."""
"""Is it discreet to tell me this?"" he asked, countering her reproof of a"
moment earlier.
"She smiled rather wickedly. ""Are you not a lawyer and a Gatepath? And"
"can one not tell anything to a lawyer and a Gatepath? Besides, I have"
"sent in my resignation, and am now a free woman. It has been a good"
"time, a very good time. I have fought devils and mastered devils in"
"England and France and Italy for four long years, and now I would rest."
You say that time and sorrow have spared me. Yet I have known both time
"and sorrow. Have I not lost...."""
"He broke into a babble of apologies. ""I did not know.... I did not"
"realise...."""
"She waved a hand, and he fell silent. ""I do not wear the trappings of"
"woe, for though I am eternally widowed, I glory in my loss. It was in"
"the rearguard at Caporetto, when all less gallant souls had fled, that"
"my Guilberti fell."""
Of course from that moment Gatepath was her slave. She had flattered him
and humbugged him as she flattered and humbugged all of us. Madame had
"not a day over forty?"""
"""I have given up wondering where the real Dawson ends and where the"
disguises begin. The man I met up north wasn't the least bit like the
"one down here."""
"""A deal younger, I expect,"" said the chief assistant, grinning. ""He"
shifts about between thirty and sixty. The old man is no end of a
"cure, and tries to take us in the same as he does you. There's an"
"inspector at the Yard who was at school with him down Hampshire way,"
"and ought to know what he is really like, but even he has given Dawson"
up. He says that the old man does not know his own self in the
"looking-glass; and as for Mrs. Dawson, I expect she has to take any"
"one who comes along claiming to be her husband, for she can't,"
"possibly tell t'other from which."""
"""One might make a good story out of that,"" I observed to Cary."
"""I don't understand,"" said he. ""Mr. Dawson told me once that I knew"
"the real Dawson, but that few other people did."""
"""If he told you that,"" calmly observed the assistant, ""you may bet"
"your last shirt he was humbugging you. He couldn't tell the truth, not"
"if he tried ever so."""
"""What is he at now?"" I asked."
"""I don't know, sir. And if he told me, I shouldn't believe him. I"
don't take no account of a word that man says. But he's the most
successful detective we've got in the whole Force. He's sure to be
"head of the C.I.D. one day, and then he will have to stay in his"
"office and give us others a chance."""
sob.
"""Surely there is confidence between us?""  I urged.  ""Do you not remember"
"that day long ago when we walked one evening in the sunset hand-in-hand,"
"as was our wont, along the river-path towards La Roche?  Do you not"
remember how you told me that in future you would have no single secret
"from me?"""
"""Yes,"" she answered hoarsely, with an effort, ""I recollect."""
"""Then you intend to break your promise to me?""  I whispered earnestly."
"""Surely you will not do this, Yolande?  You will not hide from me the"
"cause of all this bitterness of yours?""  She was silent.  Her breast,"
"beneath its lace, rose quickly and fell again.  Her tear-filled eyes"
were fixed upon the carpet.
"""I would not break my promise,"" she said at last, clasping my hand"
"convulsively and lifting her eyes to mine; ""but, alas! it is now"
"imperative."""
"""Why imperative?"""
"""I must suffer alone,"" she responded gloomily, shaking her head.  Her"
"countenance was as pale as her gown, and she shivered as though she were"
"cold, although the noonday heat was suffocating."
"""Because you refuse to tell me anything or allow me to assist you?""  I"
"said.  ""This is not in accordance with the promise made and sealed by"
"your lips on that evening long ago."""
"""Nor have your actions been in accordance with your own promise,"" she"
said slowly and distinctly.
Rippley slapped him on the shoulder:
"“Then,” said he, “we ought to give Pangbutt’s house an air. There"
is a lack of the grand manner here. One man-servant is ridiculously
inadequate. At least three of us ought to assist to wait on the guests.
"Doome and Fluffy and I and--and you, Blotte--would make a ripping lot"
"of waiters, and it wouldn’t be half so slow as talking art and rot"
to people who don’t know.... Genius shall serve the mob. This night
"must never be forgotten. By Macready, yes--Pangbutt used to play at"
play-acting! But where are his properties?”
Blotte was striding the room; he laughed:
"“Ay, ay--the gala-night of life should be gay and joyous,” cried"
"he--“all the candles lit, as for a bridal.” He came to a halt, scowled"
"at the dark hollow of the great doorway, and strode thither."
The old butler was lurking suspiciously outside.
"Blotte grabbed him by his coat lapel, and drew him into the light:"
"“Hireling fellow,” said he, “bring more lights. This place is like a"
damned omnibus.”
The old butler held out an expostulant palm in dignified remonstrance:
"“Gentlemen, gentlemen--the guests will be arriving in a few minutes----”"
"Rippley went up to him, and gripping his fingers in the old servant’s"
"waistcoat, pulled him into the room."
"“Don’t talk like an unfrocked bishop, Dukes--it’s most irreligious,”"
then! I felt that I had become a different being altogether.
The boat entered the harbour and ran alongside the quay. A train was
waiting for us. We poured out of the ship in two streams that spread out
fan-wise and flowed into the carriages.
It was good to sit by the window in a comfortable compartment and lean
back against soft cushions.
Glad anticipation and barely suppressed excitement were visible on
everybody's face.
"The train sped through familiar country: meadows, pastures, cornfields,"
orchards and woodlands. People waved their handkerchiefs at us from
cottage windows.
It was growing dark as the first rows of drab suburban houses began to
glide past.
So this was London. I stared out of the window and tried to grasp the
"tremendous, wonderful fact with all the power of my mind. Somehow or"
"other it did not seem real, but I felt I could make it real by an effort"
of the will.
Streets and houses and moving people soon crowded the whole view. The
people filled me with intense curiosity. I longed to talk to them and
find out what they felt and thought about the war.
We entered Victoria Station. I opened the door of the compartment with
"hasty, trembling hands. I did not wait to change my French money, but"
hurried out into a street and got on to a 'bus.
"Robbins laughed gently, and winked to the others:"
"“We _are_ a trifle early, Dukes, I am afraid,” said he, going up to the"
dignified old man--“but if Mr. Rippley _will_ insist on sitting between
"the reins on the top of the hansom, the cabby drives hard to escape the"
"inquisitive attention of the police--a body of men, Dukes, that live"
feverishly anxious to catch something and are bored with the greyness
of the popular virtue.”
He tapped the old man on the shirt-front.
"The butler bowed stiffly, and withdrew."
Fluffy Reubens strode airily into the middle of the room and surveyed
it:
"“I say,” said he--“portrait painting seems to pay, eh?”"
Lovegood coughed:
"“H’m--n’yes,” he grunted; and added tragically: “When you can paint"
portraits.”
"“Get out!” said Fluffy, and flung himself into an easy-chair."
Rippley strolled round the room and tested the electric lights; his
hands itching to be at any devilment:
“Oho!” said he--“so the curtain is to go up to-night and discover the
real Anthony Bickersteth--the man of mystery--the writer of _the_
book!... I suppose it ain’t Pangbutt himself!”
"asked the man. ""There is an old hair strainer for you. I found it"
"outside on the ground,"" said he, and he threw it on the bench. And"
then his wife saw him; but at the same moment the hat of the _huldres_
"disappeared, for he should only have loaned it, not given it away."
"Now the man saw how everything had come about, and went back to the"
"wedding-feast. And this time he was received in right friendly fashion,"
"and was asked to drink, and to seat himself at the table."
NOTE
A favorite jewel among the treasures of the underground world
"plays the leading part of the tale: ""The Hat of the _Huldres_"""
"(Asbjörnsen, _Huldreeventyr_, I, p. 157; from the vicinity of"
"Eidsvold, told by an old peasant woman). Often appearing in"
"legend proper as the tarn-cap, it here finds a more humble place"
"in everyday life, neither ennobled by legendary dignity, nor"
diversified by the rich incident of fairy-tale. The entertaining
picture here afforded of its powers shows them all the more
clearly.

THE CHILD OF MARY
"Far, far from here, in a great forest, there once lived a poor couple."
Heaven blessed them with a charming little daughter; but they were so
poor they did not know how they were going to get her christened. So her
"the greater number of her clothes, hers was the heavier sack. Thus had"
they shifted their burdens; what burdens would they carry in the future?
"She was, after all, no longer a schoolmistress, and perhaps he was no"
longer with the theater or the films.
"I watched those two crossing rocky, mountainous ground, bare ground, with"
not a tree anywhere except a few stunted junipers; far away near the ridge
"murmured the little Reisa. Those two had put their possessions together,"
"were walking together; at the next halt they would be man and wife, and"
take only one room because it was cheaper.
"Suddenly I started up and, moved by some impulse of human sympathy--nay,"
"of duty--I wanted to run across to her, talk to her, say a word of"
"warning: ""Don't go on!"" I could have done it in a few minutes--a good"
"deed, a duty...."
They disappeared behind the shoulder of the hill.
Her name was Ingeborg.

"And now I, too, must wander on again, for I am the last at the Tore Peak"
"farm. The season is wearing on, and this morning it snowed for the first"

“And do you like Rome; eh?”
"“I should say so! At first, I didn’t, I must admit. It was a"
disappointment to me. I had dreamed so much about Rome!” and Kennedy
talked of the books and guides he had read about the Eternal City.
"“I must admit that I had never dreamed about Rome,” said Cæsar. “And"
you boast of that?” asked Laura.
"“No, I don’t boast of it, I merely state it. I understand how agreeable"
it is to know things. Cæsar died here! Cicero made speeches here! Saint
Peter stumbled over this stone! It is fine! But not knowing things
is also very comfortable. I am rather like a barbarian walking
indifferently among monuments he knows nothing about.”
“Doesn’t such an idea make you ashamed?”
"“No, why? It would be a bother to me to know a lot of things offhand. To"
"pass by a mountain and know how it was thrown up, what it is composed"
"of, what its flora and fauna are; to get to a town and know its history"
in detail.... What things to be interested in! It’s tiresome! I hate
"history too much. I far prefer to be ignorant of everything, and"
"especially the past, and from time to time to offer myself a capricious,"
arbitrary explanation.”
"“But I think that knowing things not only is not tiresome,” said"
"Kennedy, “but is a great satisfaction.”"
“You think even learning things is a satisfaction?”
“Thousands of years ago one could know things almost without learning
"them; nowadays in order to know, one has to learn. That is natural and"
"'ear?  But when I sent you, what use was you?  I released 'Art, who's"
repaid me by bein' unable to see an 'ole in a ladder; and I've
concluded a treaty of peace and friendship with the French.  Next
time (if so be a German ship comes ashore) I'll go out as my own
"hambassador.  No, Simcox, never more!  No, Lampert, never, never"
"more!  I just speaks to that French crowd, and they are civil and"
drink fair.  They recognised they'd met their match.  Their skipper
"says, says he, 'Captain Jones, I owns fair and square I'm not your"
"ekal at diplomatics.'  He adds, moreover, 'Captain Jones, damn me if"
"I believe your match is to be found.'  And I says, with dignity (with"
"dignity, Simcox), 'Right you are!'  That's what I says.  And as for"
"you, you ratty galoots, you'll treat 'em when you meets 'em just the"
same as if they wasn't French.  Do you 'ear me?  That's my
"hultimatum.  Now you can go.  That'll do the watch."""
He turned to the mates.
"""I thought better of you two, so I did,"" he remarked sadly.  ""But"
"there, you 'aven't 'ad my experience, and when I gets 'ome I shall"
see as them that is in power at the Furrin Office 'ears 'ow I done
"it.  Salisbury ain't my stiffness of backbone, and 'e ain't my tact."
"If so be as 'e was to invite them Frenchmen to dinner, it would be"
different.  They knows (as the French captain owned to me; fair and
square 'e owned it) they don't 'ave no nat'ral right to hislands and
col'nies.  Make the Frenchmen's 'omes 'appy and they'll stay at 'ome.
"Think it hout; you'll see 'ow it could be done.  There now, that'll"
"do you.  I disarrest you!"""
"And the ""old man"" rolled cheerfully for his cabin."
"""By my lone I done it!"" said the Guffin."
"this ever happened."""
"She flipped down the computer's screen, then turned back."
"""Unfortunately nothing is ever that simple. I'm sorry to have to tell"
"you two that we haven't seen the last of each other."" She paused, then"
"continued. ""In fact, we are about to become much better acquainted."""
"""What do you mean?"""
"""You once told me, back when we met on the plane from Athens, you would"
welcome that. You should be happy that your wish is now about to be
"granted. You both are going to be our guests."""
"""That's kind of you."" He stared at her, startled. ""But we can probably"
"bear up to the separation."""
"""No, I must insist. You were right about the difficulties. Your death"
"now would be awkward, for a number of reasons. Alex will be trouble"
"enough to explain, but that is purely an internal Soviet matter. Moscow"
"Narodny can cover it. However, eliminating you two would raise awkward"
"inquiries. On the other hand, you represent a security risk to the"
"project. Consequently we have no option. Surely you understand."""
He understood all too well. This was the one turn he hadn't figured on.
Almost eight years. It had been that long ago. But what had Ken said?
The Tokyo _oyabun _never forgot. What this really meant was that Tanzan
Mino wanted to settle the score first hand. What did he have planned?
Vance had a sudden feeling he didn't want to know. It was going to be a
zero-sum game. Everything on the table and winner take all.
The man swelled with determination and pride. He had no thought of
"failure, and drew inspiration and joy from the heaviness of the bet"
which he had made with Fortune. He took the born gambler's delight in
a big risk.
"""Then you think that the _Antinous_ and the _Antigone_ were both"
"damaged by the same man, and that he may have designs upon the"
"_Malplaquet_?"" said I."
"""I don't propose to tell you what I think,"" replied Dawson stiffly."
"""Still,"" I persisted, passing over the snub, ""you have a theory?"""
"""No, thanks,"" said Dawson contemptuously. ""I have no use for theories."
"When they are wrong they mislead you, and when they are right they are"
no help. I believe in facts--facts brought out by constant vigilance.
"Unsleeping watchfulness and universal suspicion, those are the"
"principles I work on. The theory business makes pretty story books,"
"but the Force does not waste good time over them."""
"""What are you going to do?"""
"""This is Thursday afternoon. I am going to join the _Malplaquet_"
"presently, and I'm not going to sleep till she is safely down the"
"river. I'm going to be my own watchman this time."""
"""How? In what capacity?"""

"moment he hesitated, and then, recollecting the high post to which I"
"had tacitly been appointed in his household, he replied:"
road.
"Eilert was going out in his boat to fish haddock, and I went with him."
Actually he should have been getting some meat for us; but he had promised
"the gentry from the city some fish, and fish was one of the gifts of God."
"Besides, if he lacked meat, he could always slaughter one of the pigs."
"There was a slight wind; but then we wanted some wind, Eilert said, as"
long as there was not too much of it.
"""Not reliable tonight though,"" he said, looking up into the sky; ""the"
"bigger the wind, the stronger the current."""
"At first I was very brave, and sat on the thwart thinking of Eilert's"
"French words: _travali, prekevary, sutinary, mankémang_, and many"
"others. They've had a long way to travel, coming here by ancient routes"
"via Bergen, and now they're common property."
"And then suddenly I lost all interest in French words, and felt extremely"
"ill. It was much too windy, and we got no haddock."
"""Pity she's come up so quick,"" said Eilert; ""let's try inshore for a"
"while."""
"But we got nothing there either, and as the wind increased and the sea"
"rose, ""We'd better go home,"" said Eilert."
"The sea had been just right before, remarkably so, but now there was"
entirely too much of it. Why on earth did I feel so bad? An inner
"exhaustion, some emotional excitement, would have explained it. But I had"
experienced no emotional excitement.
"""Oh, yes, a scratch. I hardly feel it. It isn't anything. It can't be"
"anything. There's nothing vital thereabouts, is there, Berry?"""
The missionary shrugged his shoulders. He had flung open the glass
"doors which led on to the verandah, and the brightening dawn flooded"
in upon them.
"""Come and help me carry this poor lady,"" he said. ""We have not a"
"minute to lose."""
"Travers tried to obey, but he had no strength, and the other thrust"
him impatiently on one side.
"""Mrs. Carmichael, you are a strong woman,"" he appealed. Between them"
"they managed to bring Mrs. Cary's heavy, unconscious frame down the"
"steps. It was a nerve-trying task, for their progress was of necessity"
"a slow one, and the sound of the desperate fighting seemed to surround"
them on every side. It was with a feeling of intense relief that the
little party saw Nicholson appear from amidst the trees and run toward
them.
"""That's right!"" he cried. ""Only be quick! They are at us on all sides"
"now, but my men are keeping them off until you are out of the"
bungalow. The old ruin at the back of the garden is our last stand.
"Carmichael is there already with a detachment, and is keeping off a"
"rear attack. I shall remain here."""
"""Alone?"" Berry asked anxiously."
"""Yes. I believe they will ransack the bungalow first. When they come,"
"the Rajah is sure to be at their head, and--well, it's going to be"
diamond cut diamond between us two when we meet. I know the beggars
"be in the mornin'. You'll see in the mornin' that there'll be--"" She"
"stopped and stared in frozen terror at the sinister face of the Sheriff,"
who was coolly watching his handkerchief turn from white to red under
the slow rain of blood from the loft above.
"""Oho!"" he emitted sardonically, stepping back and pointing his gun"
"towards the loft. ""So, he's up there!"""
"The Girl's fingers clutched his arm, dragging desperately."
"""No, he isn't, Jack--no, he isn't!"" she iterated in blind, mechanical"
denial.
"With an abrupt movement, Rance flung her violently from him, made a grab"
"at the suspended ladder and lowered it into position; then, deaf to the"
"Girl's pleadings, harshly ordered Johnson to come down, meanwhile"
covering the source of the blood-drops with his gun.
"""Oh, wait,--wait a minute!"" begged the Girl helplessly. What would"
happen if he couldn't obey the summons? He had spent himself in his
"climb to safety. Perhaps he was unconscious, slowly bleeding to death!"
"But even as she tortured herself with fears, the boards above creaked as"
though a heavy body was dragging itself slowly across them. Johnson was
evidently doing his best to reach the top of the ladder; but he did not
move quickly enough to suit the Sheriff.
"""Come down, or I'll--"""
"""Oh, just a minute, Jack, just a minute!"" broke in the Girl frantically."
"""Don't shoot!--Don't you see he's tryin' to--?"""
"""Come down here, Mr. Johnson!"" reiterated the Sheriff, with a face"
"stood a pile of grips, stacked up, packed, and undisturbed."
Winters who had been studying the room while we got our bearings picked
up a queer-looking revolver from the floor. As he held it up I could
see that along the top of the barrel was a long cylinder with a ratchet
or catch at the butt end. He turned it over and over carefully.
"“By George,” he muttered, “it has been fired off.”"
Kennedy glanced more minutely at the body. There was not a mark on it.
I stared about vacantly at the place where Winters had picked the thing
up.
"“Look,” I cried, my eye catching a little hole in the baseboard of the"
woodwork near it.
"“It must have fallen and exploded on the floor,” remarked Kennedy. “Let"
"me see it, Winters.”"
Craig held it at arm’s length and pulled the catch. Instead of an
"explosion, there came a cone of light from the top of the gun. As"
"Kennedy moved it over the wall, I saw in the center of the circle of"
light a dark spot.
"“A new invention,” Craig explained. “All you need to do is to move it"
so that little dark spot falls directly on an object. Pull the
trigger—the bullet strikes the dark spot. Even a nervous and unskilled
marksman becomes a good shot in the dark. He can even shoot from behind
the protection of something—and hit accurately.”
It was too much for me. I could only stand and watch Kennedy as he
deftly bent over Schloss again and placed a piece of chemically
"answer, wishing to understand him."
"""Speak to me from the Bible.  There are no such men there."""
"Then the teacher began criticising the Bible.  The old man listened,"
and interrupted him after a long while.
"""Stop ...  Wait!  That means that among people known to God there are"
no Russians?  We are not known to God?  Is it so?  God knew all those
"who are mentioned in the Bible ... He destroyed them by sword and fire,"
He destroyed their cities; but He also sent prophets to teach them.
That means that He also pitied them.  He scattered the Jews and the
"Tartars ...  But what about us?  Why have we prophets no longer?"""
"""Well, I don't know!"" replied the teacher, trying to understand the old"
"man.  But the latter put his hand on the teacher's shoulder, and slowly"
"pushed him backwards and forwards, and his throat made a noise as if he"
were swallowing something....
"""Tell me!  You speak so much ... as if you knew everything.  It makes"
me sick to listen to you ... you darken my soul....  I should be better
"pleased if you were silent.  Who are we, eh? Why have we no prophets?"
"Ha, ha! ...  Where were we when Christ walked on this earth?  Do you"
"see?  And you too, you are lying....  Do you think that all die out?"
The Russian people will never disappear....  You are lying....  It has
"been written in the Bible, only it is not known what name the Russians"
are given.  Do you see what kind of people they are?  They are
numberless....  How many villages are there on the earth? Think of all
"the people who live on it, so strong, so numerous! And you say that"
"they will die out; men shall die, but God wants the people, God the"
Creator of the earth!  The Amalekites did not die out.  They are either
"German or French....  But you, eh, you!  Now then, tell me why we are"
"he had reached the corner house, their house. The carriage gates were"
pushed back; there were fresh marks of wheels on the drive. And then he
"faced the big white-painted house, with its wide-open windows, its"
"tulle curtains floating outwards, its blue jars of hyacinths on the"
broad sills. On either side of the carriage porch their
"hydrangeas—famous in the town—were coming into flower; the pinkish,"
bluish masses of flower lay like light among the spreading leaves. And
"somehow, it seemed to old Mr. Neave that the house and the flowers, and"
"even the fresh marks on the drive, were saying, “There is young life"
here. There are girls—”
"The hall, as always, was dusky with wraps, parasols, gloves, piled on"
"the oak chests. From the music-room sounded the piano, quick, loud and"
impatient. Through the drawing-room door that was ajar voices floated.
"“And were there ices?” came from Charlotte. Then the creak, creak of"
her rocker.
"“Ices!” cried Ethel. “My dear mother, you never saw such ices. Only two"
"kinds. And one a common little strawberry shop ice, in a sopping wet"
frill.”
"“The food altogether was too appalling,” came from Marion."
"“Still, it’s rather early for ices,” said Charlotte easily."
"“But why, if one has them at all....” began Ethel."
"“Oh, quite so, darling,” crooned Charlotte."
"Suddenly the music-room door opened and Lola dashed out. She started,"
"she nearly screamed, at the sight of old Mr. Neave."
She ate alone that evening.
"""Isn't your husband coming in?"" asked the woman of the house."
"""Perhaps he doesn't want anything,"" she replied."
"There he stood, away by the tiny barn pretending to be interested in the"
"roof, in the style of building, and walked round looking at it, pursing"
his lips and whistling. But she could see perfectly well from the window
"that his face was blue and dejected. When she had eaten, she walked down"
"to the shore, calling as she passed him:"
"""Go in and eat!"""
"But he had not sunk quite so low; he would not go in to eat, and slept"
towards the papers in the seed-tray.
“You have great strength of character. You will marry a red-haired man
and have three children. Beware of a blonde woman.” Look out! Look out!
A motor-car driven by a fat chauffeur comes rushing down the hill.
"Inside there a blonde woman, pouting, leaning forward—rushing through"
your life—beware! beware!
"“Ladies and gentlemen, I am an auctioneer by profession, and if what I"
tell you is not the truth I am liable to have my licence taken away
from me and a heavy imprisonment.” He holds the licence across his
chest; the sweat pours down his face into his paper collar; his eyes
look glazed. When he takes off his hat there is a deep pucker of angry
flesh on his forehead. Nobody buys a watch.
Look out again! A huge barouche comes swinging down the hill with two

"He walked unsteadily, toward Piccadilly.  A girl of the town passed and"
"looked up at him.  Staring hard, he hooked his arm in hers without a"
"word; it steadied him, and they walked on thus together.  Suddenly he"
said:
"""Well, girl, are you happy?""  The girl stopped and tried to disengage her"
arm; a rather frightened look had come into her dark-eyed powdered face.
"Fiorsen laughed, and held it firm.  ""When the unhappy meet, they walk"
together.  Come on!  You are just a little like my wife.  Will you have a
"drink?"""
"The girl shook her head, and, with a sudden movement, slipped her arm out"
of this madman's and dived away like a swallow through the pavement
traffic.  Fiorsen stood still and laughed with his head thrown back.  The
second time to-day.  SHE had slipped from his grasp.  Passers looked at
"him, amazed.  The ugly devils!  And with a grimace, he turned out of"
"Piccadilly, past St. James's Church, making for Bury Street.  They"
"wouldn't let him in, of course--not they!  But he would look at the"
"windows; they had flower-boxes--flower-boxes!  And, suddenly, he groaned"
aloud--he had thought of Gyp's figure busy among the flowers at home.
"Missing the right turning, he came in at the bottom of the street.  A"
fiddler in the gutter was scraping away on an old violin.  Fiorsen
"stopped to listen.  Poor devil!  ""Pagliacci!""  Going up to the man--dark,"
"lame, very shabby, he took out some silver, and put his other hand on the"
man's shoulder.
"""Brother,"" he said, ""lend me your fiddle.  Here's money for you. Come;"
"lend it to me.  I am a great violinist."""
"""Vraiment, monsieur!"""
"“You’ve been under arrest for ten minutes, ‘Silky’ Bob. Chicago thinks"
you may have dropped over our way and wires us she wants to have a chat
"with you. Going quietly, are you? That’s sensible. Now, before we go on"
to the station here’s a note I was asked to hand you. You may read it
here at the window. It’s from Patrolman Wells.”
The man from the West unfolded the little piece of paper handed him.
"His hand was steady when he began to read, but it trembled a little by"
the time he had finished. The note was rather short.
_Bob: I was at the appointed place on time. When you struck the match
to light your cigar I saw it was the face of the man wanted in Chicago.
"Somehow I couldn’t do it myself, so I went around and got a plain"
clothes man to do the job.

LOST ON DRESS PARADE
Mr. Towers Chandler was pressing his evening suit in his hall bedroom.
One iron was heating on a small gas stove; the other was being pushed
vigorously back and forth to make the desirable crease that would be
seen later on extending in straight lines from Mr. Chandler’s patent
leather shoes to the edge of his low-cut vest. So much of the hero’s
toilet may be intrusted to our confidence. The remainder may be guessed
by those whom genteel poverty has driven to ignoble expedient. Our next
view of him shall be as he descends the steps of his lodging-house
"no reply. Rance made no movement to follow her, but instead drew a pack"
of cards from his pocket and began to shuffle them with practiced
carelessness. But when a minute had passed and the girl had not
"returned, he called once more, with growing impatience, to know what was"
keeping her.
"""I'm jest gettin' the cards an' kind o' steadyin' my nerves,"" she"
answered somewhat queerly through the doorway. The next moment she had
"returned, quickly closing the closet door behind her, blew out her"
"candle, and laying a pack of cards upon the table, said significantly:"
"""We'll use a fresh deck. There's a good deal depends on this, Jack."" She"
seated herself opposite the Sheriff and so close to the unconscious form
of the man she loved that from time to time her left arm brushed his
shoulder.
"Rance, without protest other than a shrug, took up his own deck of"
"cards, wrapped them in a handkerchief, and stowed them away in his"
pocket. It was the Girl who spoke first:
"""Are you ready?"""
"""Ready? Yes. I'm ready. Cut for deal."""
"With unfaltering fingers, the Girl cut. Of the man beside her, dead or"
"dying, she must not, dared not think. For the moment she had become one"
"incarnate purpose: to win, to win at any cost,--nothing else mattered."
"Rance won the deal; and taking up the pack he asked, as he shuffled:"
"""A case of show-down?"""
either.
"""Curious!"" he ejaculated.  ""Very curious indeed!"""
"""What is curious?""  I inquired eagerly."
"""Those marks,"" he answered, indicating them with his finger.  ""They are"
"very puzzling.  I've never seen such marks before."""
"""Do they point to foul play?""  I inquired, feeling suspicious that she"
had by some mysterious means fallen the victim of an assassin.
"""Well, no,"" he responded, after some hesitation; ""that is not my"
"opinion."""
"""Then what is your opinion?"""
"""At present I have none.  I can have none until I make a thorough"
"examination.  There are certainly no outward marks of violence."""
"""We need not inform the police, I suppose?"""
"""Not at present,"" he replied, his eyes still fixed upon the blanched"
face of the woman who had once been all the world to me.
"I raised her dead hand, and upon it imprinted a last fervent kiss.  It"
was cold and clammy to my lips.  In that hour all my old love for her
"had returned, and my heart had become filled with an intense bitterness"
"and desolation.  I had thought that all my love for her was dead, and"
"that Edith Austin, the calm, sweet woman far away in an English county,"
"who wrote to me daily from her quiet home deep in the woodlands, had"
"taken her place.  But our meeting and its tragic sequel had, I admit,"
The Further Adventures of Peggy of Spinster Farm
_By Helen M. Winslow_
"_12mo, cloth decorative, illustrated, net $1.25; postpaid $ 1.40_"
Miss Winslow calls us again away from the strenuous and noisy
"confusion of modern cities to the charm and contentment of life ""under"
"the greenwood tree."" Peggy's adventures had only just begun in the"
"first book. In this new record of life at Spinster Farm and ""Elysium,"""
"""At the Sign of the Town Pump,"" there is plenty of romantic adventure"
of the kind that proves truth to be stranger sometimes than fiction.
"There is humor, too, in even greater quantities than in the preceding"
"book, sparkling humor that places the author well up in the list of"
"our New England humorists. ""At the Sign of the Town Pump"" will be"
welcomed not only by those who enjoyed making the acquaintance of
"Spinster Farm, but by thousands of new readers who appreciate a clever"
story and a fascinating heroine.
"_On ""Peggy at Spinster Farm"" the Press opinions are as follows_:"
"""Very alluring are the pictures she draws of the old-fashioned"
"house, the splendid old trees, the pleasant walks, the gorgeous"
"sunsets, and--or it would not be Helen Winslow--the"
"cats.""--_The Boston Transcript._"
"""'Peggy at Spinster Farm' is a rewarding volume, original and"

breakwater.
"The skipper, who had been lying flat when the others jumped for the"
"main deck, got up and crawled forward to the break of the poop.  He"
was half-paralysed with a mixture of funk and rage.  He addressed
"himself and his remarks to the sky, the sea, and the island, but"
above all to Lampert.
"""You man-drowning, slop-built caricature of a sailorman, what 'ave"
"you bin and done with my ship?"" he bellowed.  ""Oh, Lord, I'm a ruined"
"man; by gosh, I'll murder you!"""
"He tumbled down on the main deck and made for Lampert, who easily"
dodged him.
"""Shut up, you old idiot!"" said the mate contemptuously.  ""Who but me"
"told you that if you drove her in thick weather, and no sun seen for"
"a week, you'd pile her up?"""
Simcox caught Jones and held him.
"""Good lord, sir,"" said the second greaser, ""it's no time to fight."""
"""No, it ain't,"" said Jack Hart boldly."
"That a foremast hand should dare to shove his oar in, almost cowed"
the poor old Guffin.  It was something out of nature.
"""It ain't no time for jawbation,"" insisted Hart, about whom the"
"others had gathered.  ""It's time for thinkin' out the politics of the"
"situation, and if I'm not mistaken we shall be able to walk ashore by"
"the morning, and there won't be no ship for any one to command--so"
"""So you're here at last----!"" then with a little gasp drew back, facing"
me in the most entrancing attitude of bewilderment.
It was the girl who had left that ball of paper!
"The sea, always my friend, at this moment did a rather decent thing; it"
gave the yacht a firm but gentle lurch and sent us into each other's
arms. Perhaps nothing else in all the world of chances could so
"effectively have broken the ice between us, for we were laughing as I"
"helped her back to the couch; and, as our eyes met, again we laughed."
"""I didn't know,"" she said, ""that Father brought a guest aboard last"
"night!"""
"""Awkward of him, wasn't it?"" I stammered, sparring for time."
"""One is apt to be awkward in weather like this,"" she graciously"
admitted.
"""You don't know how profoundly aware I am of--of how terribly true that"
"is,"" I stumbled along. ""Is he on deck?"" For, oh, if I could only get to"
see him five minutes alone!
"""No, he's unusually lazy this morning; but I've called, him, the old"
"dear!"""
"A chill crept up my spine--crept up, crept down, and then criss-crossed."
But she must know of her mistake before we had gone so far that putting
me ashore would be a serious inconvenience--for I knew he would put me
"ashore at the nearest point, if not, indeed, set me adrift in an open"
boat. Therefore I suggested:
SODII SALICYLAS--SODIUM SALICYLAS
DERIVATION.--Made by the action of salicylic acid on sodium carbonate.
The solution is filtered and heated to expel carbon dioxide.
PROPERTIES.--A white amorphous or crystalline powder or scales; odorless
"and having a sweetish, saline taste. Permanent in air. Soluble in water,"
alcohol and glycerine.
DOSE.--Same as for salicylic acid.
PHENYLIS SALICYLAS--PHENYL SALICYLATE (Salol)
DERIVATION.--Made by heating salicylic and carbolic acids with
phosphorous pentachloride.
"PROPERTIES.--A white crystalline powder; odorless, or having a faintly"
"aromatic odor, and almost tasteless. Permanent in air. Insoluble in"
"water, soluble in ten parts of alcohol and readily soluble in"
chloroform.
DOSE.--Same as for salicylic acid.
"history of the Low Countries, some have a special and general scientific"
interest. Among these is the research of M. Alphonse Wauters on _Les
"libertés communales_ (Bruxelles, 1878). Barante's _Histoire des Ducs de"
Bourgogne_ (4th ed. 1838-40) contains much interesting matter on the
"Burgundian period. The assiduous research of M. Lefèvre Pontalis, _Jean"
"de Witt, Grand Pensionnaire de Hollande_ (2 tom. 1884; Eng. trans. 2"
"vols.), throws a full light on one of the most critical periods of Dutch"
history.
"Dutch works on the history of the Low Countries in general, and the"
"United Provinces in particular, are many and voluminous; indeed, no"
history has been more amply written. The good general history of the
"Netherlands by N.G. van Kampen, which appeared in German in the series"
"of Heeren and Uckert (1831-33), is only partially superseded by the"
"_Geschichte der Niederlande_ of Wenzelburger (Bd. i, 1879; ii, 1886),"
which is not completed. But the most readable general history of the
"Netherlands yet produced is that of P.J. Blok, _Geschiedenis van het"
"Nederlandsche Volk_ (1892, etc.), of which there is a competent but"
"unfortunately abridged English translation (Putnams, vol. i, 1898)."
"Standard modern Dutch works are those of J.A. Vijnne, _Geschiedenis van"
"het Vaderland_, and J. van Lennep, _De Geschiedenis van Nederland_. For"
Belgian history in particular the authorities are similarly numerous.
"The _Manuel de l'histoire de Belgique_, by J. David (Louvain, 1847),"
"will be found a good handbook of authorities, episodes, and chronology,"
though without any sociological element. The _Histoire de Belgique_ of
"Th. Juste (Bruxelles, 1895, 3 tom. 4to) is comprehensive, but disfigured"
by insupportable illustrations.
§ 1. _The Rise of the Netherlands_
The case of Holland is one of those which at first sight seem to flout
"A Christian hymn is a lyric poem, reverently and devotionally"
"conceived, which is designed to be sung and which expresses the"
"worshiper’s attitude toward God, or God’s purposes, in human life."
"L. F. Benson, America’s foremost hymnologist, defines a hymn in these"
simple words:
The Christian hymn ... is a form of words appropriate to be sung or
chanted in public devotions.
"A hymn is to be sung _by a congregation_. Its message must be simple,"
"not subtle. It must read well and sing well. In modern usage, the hymn"
is not limited to the praise of God but includes other moods of worship
such as resignation and consecration.
2. The Beginnings of Christian Song.
Hymn singing has always been associated with Christian worship. Jesus
"and the Twelve sang a hymn, presumably a portion of the _Hallel_ (Ps."
"115-118), after the Supper was ended. Paul and Silas sang hymns, “songs"
"of the night,” during the midnight hours of their imprisonment in"
Philippi. The great Apostle recognized the value of song when he
exhorted the churches thus:
Be filled with the Spirit; speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns
"and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the"
"Lord. Eph. 5:18, 19."
Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and
"admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs,"
singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord. Col. 3:16.
"bought Lilly, body and soul--with promises."" The king shrugged his"
"shoulders and whispered: ""With promises, you understand, Baron Ned, with"
"promises. Now give him a chance at the Abbé."""
"Charles laughed and chuckled in self-gratulation, not the least"
suspecting that he was talking to the wrong man and playing into the
French king's hand. I bore in mind the fact that the king had bought
"Lilly with promises, and I determined to buy the good Doctor with ready"
gold.
"""I'll try to carry out your Majesty's commands,"" I answered, apparently"
"doubtful of my ability. ""But of course you would not have me insist, if"
"the Abbé seems disinclined to consult Lilly."""
"""No, no! Odds fish, man, no! But find a way to bring them together,"
"and your reward will come later. I choose, you for this little piece of"
business because you are in no way connected with the affair between the
"French king and me, and because I know you are to be trusted."""
I to be trusted! So was Brutus!
"""I shall do my best, your Majesty, and if I fail, I shall notify you at"
"once,"" I said, taking my leave."
"I hastened to De Grammont's house, which at that time was over near the"
"Mall, and told the count what the king had said."
"""Ah, that is good!"" cried De Grammont. ""A fool, who knows himself to be a"
"fool, is likely to be wary, but one who deems himself wise is the easiest"
"dupe in the world. I'll see Monsieur l'Abbé. Wait."""
"De Grammont returned in a few minutes, saying that the Abbé would go with"
Her complacency irritated him. The canary never ceased his ear-splitting
"noise. The canary is a beautiful, gentle bird--stuffed; alive, he is"
pestilence made vocal. Risca lost his temper.
"“Surely you must know, Aunt Gladys. I 've been wandering through hell"
with a pack of little devils at my heels.”
"Startled, she lifted up her arms and dropped Dandy, who slithered down"
her dress and sought a morose shelter under the table.
“My dear John!” she exclaimed.
"“I'm very sorry; I did n't mean to use strong language,” said he,"
putting his hands to his ears. “It's all that infernal canary.”
"“Oh, poor Dickie! Don't you like to hear Dickie sing? He sings so"
"beautifully. The gas-man was here the other day and said that, if I"
"liked, he would enter him for a competition, and he was sure he would"
"get first prize. But if you don't like to hear him, dear--though I"
really can't understand why--I can easily make him stop.” She drew a
white napkin from the drawer of the table on which the cage was placed
and threw it over the top. The feathered steam-whistle swallowed his din
"in an angry gurgle or two and became silent “Poor Dickie, he thinks it"
"'s a snowstorm! What were we talking about, John? Do sit down.”"
"John resumed his seat on the slippery couch, and Miss Lindon, having"
"snatched Dandy from his lair, sat by his side, depositing the dog"
between them.
"“You asked me what I had been doing for the last few years,” said he."
"“I’m afraid it wouldn’t do much good in case of an attack,” Ned"
suggested. “We’d soon get hungry and thirsty and have to surrender.”
"“Anyway, it’s an all right thing to shoot from!” Jimmie announced. “If"
"you’d seen the way we sweat rolling those rocks, you’d think it was all"
"right, anyway. I wonder where the boys are.”"
"“I was thinking more about the boys than about the barricade,” Ned"
admitted. “Were they all here when you left?”
"“All sitting in front of the entrance,” Jimmie replied, “except Gilroy,"
and he was asleep on a pile of blankets in the cave.”
"“He may be there yet,” suggested Ned. “Suppose we go and see.”"
"Jimmie made his way through the narrow entrance, found a searchlight,"
and turned a round circle of flame on a great heap of blankets in a back
corner. There was no one in the cave at all save only himself.
"Before returning to report to Ned, the hungry boy seized a plate of corn"
pones and a can of tinned beans from the provision chest.
"“Look here, Ned,” he said in a moment, appearing before his chum with"
"his mouth full of beans, “the appetite of our midnight visitor seems to"
be for confidential clerks as well as for bread. Someone has stolen
"Gilroy! Anyway, he’s not in the cave!”"
"“He may have gone away with the boys,” suggested Ned."
"“He wasn’t thinking of going away with the boys when I left,” Jimmie"
"answered. “He was telling how much he liked New York, and how he’d like"
XXVII
"A large house, with and upper story of planks built on later, displayed a"
"new signboard on the wall: Room and Board. The barn, as usual, was a peat"
hut.
"As I did not know which was Eilert and which Olaus, and had stopped to"
"consider which road to take, a man came hurrying toward me. Ah, well, the"
world is a small place; we meet friends and acquaintances everywhere. Here
"am I, meeting an old acquaintance, the thief of last winter, the pork"
"thief. What luck, what a satisfaction!"
This was Eilert. He took in paying guests now.
"At first he pretended not to recognize me, but he soon gave that up. Once"
"he had done so, however, he carried the thing off in style:"
"""Well, well,"" he said, ""what a nice surprise! You are most welcome under"
"my humble roof, and such it is!"""
"My own response was rather less jaunty, and I stood still collecting my"
"thoughts. When I had asked a few questions, he explained that since the"
"motor traffic had started in Stordalen, many visitors came through this"
"way, and sometimes they wanted to stop over at his house before being"
"rowed across to the steamer. They always came down in the evenings, and it"
"might be fine, or it might not, and at night the fjord was often wild. He"
"had therefore had to arrange to house them, because after all, you can't"
"calculations, took no notice of the dark group of men, who were taking"
such a wicked delight in adding to his father's discomfiture.  He did
not even once look in their direction.
"""The young spider has himself well in hand,"" remarked Abyedok, watching"
young Petunikoff's every movement and action.  Having taken all the
"measurements he desired, Ivan Andreyevitch knit his brows, got into the"
"cart, and drove away.  His son went with a firm step into Vaviloff's"
"eating-house, and disappeared behind the door."
"""Ho, ho!  That's a determined young thief! ...  What will happen next,"
"I wonder ...?"" asked Kuvalda."
"""Next?  Young Petunikoff will buy out Egor Vaviloff,"" said Abyedok with"
"conviction, and smacked his lips as if the idea gave him great pleasure."
"""And you are glad of that?"" Kuvalda asked him, gravely."
"""I am always pleased to see human calculations miscarry,"" explained"
"Abyedok, rolling his eyes and rubbing his hands with delight.  The"
Captain spat angrily on the ground and was silent. They all stood in
"front of the tumble-down building, and silently watched the doors of"
the eating-house.  More than an hour passed thus.  Then the doors
opened and Petunikoff came out as silently as he had entered.  He
"stopped for a moment, coughed, turned up the collar of his coat,"
"glanced at the men, who were following all his movements with their"
"eyes, and then went up the street towards the town."
"The Captain watched him for a moment, and turning to Abyedok said,"
smilingly:
"""Probably you were right after all, you son of a scorpion and a"
"The green and mossy garden-ways she goes,"
With little mincing airs one keeps to pet
A darling and provoking perroquet.
"Her long-trained robe is blue, the fan she holds"
"With fluent fingers girt with heavy rings,"
So vaguely hints of vague erotic things
"That her eye smiles, musing among its folds."
"—Blonde too, a tiny nose, a rosy mouth,"
"Artful as that sly patch that makes more sly,"
"In her divine unconscious pride of youth,"
The slightly simpering sparkle of the eye.
CYTHÈRE.
"BY favourable breezes fanned,"
A trellised arbour is at hand
To shield us from the summer airs;
"The scent of roses, fainting sweet,"
"Afloat upon the summer heat,"
Blends with the perfume that she wears.
"True to the promise her eyes gave,"
"She ventures all, and her mouth rains"
A dainty fever through my veins;
"And Love, fulfilling all things, save"
"Hunger, we ’scape, with sweets and ices,"
"this way, Mr. Gilroy,” he went on, “the bears out here are hungry for"
"fat clerks from Wall street. I’ve heard they make stews of ’em,” he"
concluded.
Gilroy now arose to his feet and stood gazing into the thicket in the
direction of the bear’s disappearance. Jimmie’s assertion that bruin
would hit the Arctic circle early the next morning seemed to give him
"great comfort. As the distance between the bear and himself increased,"
he grew braver and began throwing out his chest.
"“What a chance that was for me to kill a bear!” he began, boastfully,"
"“If I’d only had a gun with me, I might have had a fine rug made out of"
his hide! It would have been fine to show my friends.”
“Sure it would!” declared Jimmie. “I’m glad you didn’t remember that you
had a gun in your pocket. The bears out here are pretty sensitive about
"being shot at. If you’d blazed away at that cub, and hadn’t shot him"
"dead in his tracks the first time, he would have eaten you.”"
Gilroy put his hand to his pistol pocket and a look of pretended
amazement came over his fat face.
"“Upon my word!” he said, “I thought I left my gun in the bunk!”"
"“After this,” Ned advised, “always keep your gun in sight when you go"
"into the forest. Suppose there had been no tree to climb, what then?”"
"“I should have grappled with him, sir!” exclaimed Gilroy. “I certainly"
should have grappled with him.”
"“You would have had to catch him first,” Jimmie grinned."
than it is in any of Croce's writings. We are probably touching here
"on one of the possible, and probable, lines of development of Croce's"
"philosophy; which, however, will not become actual until the historical"
"problems of the living nature shall not urge Croce himself, or one of"
"his successors, as powerfully as the problems of human history have"
"moved him. At present, with very rare exceptions, the students of"
the history of nature are occupied in transforming their historical
experience into classes and types and laws; but a time may come when
from the naturalistic constructions we shall be able more frequently

they walked along the waterfront fishermen and tourists and boys and
girls stared and nodded and Sidney's sensitive soul mistook their
obvious interest for ridicule. She walked with lowered eyes lest she
encounter Mrs. Calkins or Pola's mother.
Cap'n Phin was waiting outside the door of the shed on Rockman's wharf.
He nodded to Sidney and Trude and beckoned them inside. At any other
"time, in any other state of mind, Sidney would have thrilled to his air"
of mystery.
Four men sat in wooden chairs tipped at various angles and on the floor
before them stood the wooden box from the _Arabella_. The men nodded
and smiled at Sidney and brought their chairs to the floor as though to
attention.
Cap'n Davies solemnly motioned Sidney and Trude to two vacant chairs
and then cleared his throat.
"""I cal'late, Miss Sidney, that you've a sort o' interest in this cargo"
we brought in on the _Sally_ so we stood by 'til you hove in sight.
"Now, mebbe it's what we think it is and mebbe it isn't. Si, give a hand"
"and unload."""
One of the men knelt down by the box and proceeded to open it with a
hammer and a chisel. The others leaned forward with interest. Sidney
held her breath.
"The man Si, having torn off the cover, put his hands into the paper"
wrappings and drew forth yards and yards of magnificently embroidered
fabric that made Sidney and Trude gasp in admiration and astonishment.
But the others were plainly disappointed. A low murmur of disgust went
around the room.
as little to your mind as to mine.  We can flatter and fool and make
mock with the best; but when it comes to marriage!  Faugh! one’s soul
sickens at the thought.  What man in his senses would trust his
happiness or his honour in the hands of that tawdry crew?  Gilt and
"tinsel do very well to play with; but when one desires to purchase, one"
"asks for gold."""
Grey’s heart seemed to stand still within him.  He felt growing numb and
"cold.  As they passed beneath the gateway, and the lamp shone upon his"
"face, Lord Sandford saw that it was white as death, and a strange gleam"
came into his own eyes.
"""Come, my friend, you do not answer.  What think you of the wife that I"
have chosen?  What think you of the Lady Geraldine Adair?  Is she not a
matchless creature?  Who would have believed such a sport could come
"from such a tree?"""
Grey commanded himself by a great effort.
"""Is the Lady Geraldine Adair, then, your affianced wife?"""
"""That, or next door to it.  My suit is approved of her parents.  We"
shall be betrothed ere long.  I thought you might be learning as much
from her own lips to-night.  Did I not hear my name pass between you
"twain?"""
"""She did ask some question anent you,"" answered Grey, who had no desire"
"to fence or parry—he felt too stunned and bewildered; ""but she spoke not"
"of any troth-plight.  Why should she?"""
"""True, why should she?  She is not one of your empty-headed chatterers."
She wears not her heart upon her sleeve.  And your acquaintance is of
instant he fell full length on the boarded floor of the loft with the
hand outstretched in which was the handkerchief he had been staunching
the blood from the wound in his side.
With a whispered injunction that he was all right and was not to move on
"any account, the Girl put the ladder back in its place. But no sooner"
was this done than on looking up she caught sight of the stained
"handkerchief. She called softly up to him to take it away, explaining"
that the cracks between the boards were wide and it could plainly be
seen from below.
"""That's it!"" she exclaimed on observing that he had changed the position"
"of his hand. ""Now, don't move!"""
"Finally, with the lighted candle in her hand, the Girl made a quick"
survey of the room to see that nothing was in sight that would betray
"her lover's presence there, and then throwing open the door she took up"
such a position by it that it made it impossible for anyone to get past
her without using force.
"""You can't come in here, Jack Rance,"" she said in a resolute voice. ""You"
"can tell me what you want from where you are."""
"Roughly, almost brutally, Rance shoved her to one side and entered."
"""No more Jack Rance. It's the Sheriff coming after Mr. Johnson,"" he"
"said, emphasizing each word."
The Girl eyed him defiantly.
"""Yes, I said Mr. Johnson,"" reiterated the Sheriff, cocking the gun that"
"he held in his hand. ""I saw him coming in here."""
Mrs. White took the sketch forcibly from Trude. She frowned over it.
One of the girls certainly did look like Sidney as she remembered the
child from their one meeting.
"""How do you explain it, Trude?"""
"Trude sighed heavily. ""I can't explain it. There's something wrong"
"somewhere. And it's my fault, Aunt Edith. I--I consented--we all"
consented to let Sidney go off down there just so that we could go
ahead with our own plans. But we thought--we felt _certain_ that these
cousins were very nice--I--I mean had a lovely home and were rich so
that Sidney might get something out of her visit that she couldn't get
"at home. It sounds shameful to _say_ it."""
"""I understand, my dear. But what made you think so?"""
"""The--the letter this Cousin Achsa wrote. It _was_ a very nice letter!"""
"""Well, _I_ have always thought you could judge anyone's character and"
"background by a letter. There must be something wrong. This girl--"""
"pointing to the sketch, ""is positively shocking! At least she would be"
"around here."""
"""I remember now something Sidney said--when she was begging us to let"
her go away. 'I want to be different! I want to go somewhere where I
won't be Joseph Romley's daughter. I want adventure and to do exciting
"things--' Those were her very words! I didn't take them seriously then,"
"but, oh, Aunt Edith, perhaps she meant them more than we guessed!"" Poor"
"Trude rose quickly to her feet. ""Aunt Edith, I simply _must_ go to"
Provincetown at once. May I ask Pepper to find out about trains?
"You'll--you'll understand, won't you? I can't be happy one minute until"
"I see the child. I feel that it's all my fault."""
"""What are your plans of escape?"" I asked."
"""I shall work my way down to Sheerness, where I hope to find a boat"
"for The Hague or the French coast. Lilly, who seems to know everything,"
"past, present and future, came last night to tell me that the king has"
"fifty men seeking me in various parts of England, especially the"
"seaports, and has offered a reward of two hundred pounds for me, dead"
"or alive, preferably dead, I suppose. If I go direct to Sheerness and try"
"to take a boat, I am sure to be examined, and I'm not prepared for the"
ordeal. So I intend to preach my way down the river and induce the king's
"officers to send me abroad by force."""
"""How are you off for money, George?"" I asked."
"""I borrowed ten guineas from Lilly,"" he answered."
"""I thought you might be in need of money, so I brought fifty guineas from"
"the strong box under my bed,"" I said, offering him the little bag of"
gold.
"He hesitated, saying: ""If I take the money, you may never again see a"
"farthing of it."""
"""In that case, I'll take my pay in abusing you,"" I replied."
"""Do you believe he would, Frances?"" asked George, turning to my cousin."
Then continuing thoughtfully:
"""It is strange that I should have found such a friend at the bottom of a"
"quarrel, all because I allowed him to abuse me. Truly forbearance is a"
"profitable virtue. The 'other cheek' is the better of the two."""
"""A man named Wolf--Rodolphe Wolf."""
The next instant I saw that the mention of that name affected the mother
no less markedly than it had affected the daughter.  Her face blanched;
"her eyes opened wide in fear, and her glance became in a moment"
"suspicious.  With marvellous self-possession she, however, pretended"
ignorance.
"""Wolf?"" she repeated.  ""I do not remember the name.  Possibly he is some"
"person we have met while travelling."""
"""Yolande knew him, I believe, in Brussels,"" I remarked.  ""He appeared to"
"be acquainted with you."""
"""My daughter's friends are not always mine,"" she remarked coldly, with"
"that cleverness which only a woman of the world can possess, and at once"
returned to the discussion of Yolande and the probability of her
recovery.
This puzzled me.  I felt somehow convinced that she knew the truth.  She
"had some distinct object in endeavouring to seal my lips.  What it was,"
"however, I could not determine."
"She was expressing a fervent hope that her daughter would recover, and"
"pacing the room, impatient to go to her bedside, when, of a sudden, Dick"
"opened the door, and, putting his head inside, addressed me, saying:"
"""Can I speak with you a moment, Ingram?""  She dashed to the door in"
"eagerness, but after a word of introduction from myself, he informed her"
that Yolande had not sufficiently recovered to be disturbed.
"""Perfect quiet is absolutely necessary, madame,"" he urged.  ""Your"
of an American vessel some time previously.
"DE SOTO, CAPTAIN BENITO."
A Portuguese.
A most notorious pirate in and about 1830.
"In 1827 he shipped at Buenos Ayres as mate in a slaver, named the"
"_Defenser de Pedro_, and plotted to seize the ship off the African coast."
"The pirates took the cargo of slaves to the West Indies, where they sold"
"them. De Soto plundered many vessels in the Caribbean Sea, then sailed to"
"the South Atlantic, naming his ship the _Black Joke_. The fear of the"
_Black Joke_ became so great amongst the East Indiamen homeward bound that
they used to make up convoys at St. Helena before heading north.
"In 1832 de Soto attacked the _Morning Star_, an East Indiaman, and took"
"her, when he plundered the ship and murdered the captain. After taking"
"several more ships, de Soto lost his own on the rocky coast of Spain, near"
"Cadiz. His crew, although pretending to be honest shipwrecked sailors,"
"were arrested, but de Soto managed to escape to Gibraltar. Here he was"
recognized by a soldier who had seen de Soto when he took the _Morning
"Star_, in which he had been a passenger. The pirate was arrested, and"
"tried before Sir George Don, the Governor of Gibraltar, and sentenced to"
death. He was sent to Cadiz to be hanged with the rest of his crew. The
"gallows was erected at the water's edge, and de Soto, with his coffin, was"
"conveyed there in a cart. He died bravely, arranging the noose around his"
"own neck, stepping up into his coffin to do so; then, crying out, ""Adios"
"todos,"" he threw himself off the cart."
"This man must not be confused with one Bernado de Soto, who was tried for"
"words on any subject as fast as pen could travel, no matter what torture"
"burned his brain, could not find a foolish message for a sick child. At"
last he wrote like a school-boy:
"_Darling: The flowers were beautiful, and so is the new picture, and I"
want to see you early in the morning. I hope you are well. John Risca._
And he had to tear the letter out of its envelope and put it into a
fresh one because he had omitted to add the magic initials “G. H. B.” to
"his name. Compared with his usual imaginative feats of correspondence,"
this was a poverty-stricken epistle. She would wonder at the change.
"Perhaps his demand for an immediate interview would startle her, and"
"shocks were dangerous. He tore up the letter and envelope, and went to"
his own room. It was past two o'clock when he crept downstairs again to
lay his letter on the hall table.
At the sight of him the next morning the color deepened in the delicate
"cheeks of Stellamaris, and her dark eyes grew bright. She held out a"
welcoming hand.
"“Ah, Belovedest, I 've been longing to see you ever since dawn. I woke"
up then and could n't go to sleep again because I was so excited.”
"He took the chair by her bedside, and her fingers tapped affectionately"
on the back of the great hand that lay on the coverlid.
"“I suppose I was excited, too,” said he, “for I was awake at dawn.”"
“Did you look out of window?”
"“Yes,” said John."
"She threw up her hand suddenly, as if she were about to vent on him"
"all the passions which consumed her--the terror, rage, and shame which"
"swelled in her breast. But something in his gibing tone, something in"
the set lines of his figure--she could not see his face--checked her.
"She let her hand fall in a gesture of despair, and shrank into"
"herself, shuddering. She looked at him as at a serpent--that"
fascinated her. At last she murmured--
'You will not dare. What have they done to you?'
"'Nothing,' he answered. 'It is not their affair; it is yours.'"
For a moment after that they stood confronting one another while the
"sound of the women sobbing in a corner, and the occasional jingle of a"
"bridle outside, alone broke the silence. Behind her the room was dark;"
"behind him, through the open windows, lay the road, glimmering pale"
"through the dusk. Suddenly the door at her back opened, and a bright"
light flashed on his face. It was Marie Wort bringing in a lamp. No
"one spoke, and she set the lamp on the table, and going by him began"
"to close the shutters. Still the Countess stood as if turned to stone,"
and he stood watching her.
"'Where are they?' she moaned at last, though he had already told her."
"'In the camp,' he said."
'Can I--can I see them?' she panted.
"'Afterwards,' he answered, with the smile of a fiend; 'when you are my"
wife.'
cold fury:
"""You better stop that laughin', Jack Rance, or I'll send you to finish"
"it in some place where things ain't so funny."""
Something in the Girl's altered tone so struck the Sheriff that he
"obeyed her. He said nothing, but on his lips were the words, ""By Heaven,"
"the Girl means it!"" and his eyes showed a smouldering admiration."
"""He doesn't hear you,--he's out of it. But me--me--I hear you--I ain't"
"out of it,"" the Girl went on in compelling tones. ""You're a gambler; he"
"was, too; well, so am I."" She crossed deliberately to the bureau, and"
"laid her pistol away in the drawer, Rance meanwhile eyeing her with"
"puzzled interest. Returning, she went on, incisively as a whip lash:"
"""I live on chance money, drink money, card money, saloon money. We're"
"gamblers,--we're all gamblers!"" She paused, an odd expression coming"
"over her face,--an expression that baffled Rance's power to read."
"Presently she resumed: ""Now, you asked me to-night if my answer was"
"final,--well, here's your chance. I'll play you the game,--straight"
"poker. It's two out o' three for me. Hatin' the sight o' you, it's the"
"nearest chance you'll ever get for me."""
"""Do you mean--"" began Rance, his hands resting on the table, his"
hawk-like glance burning into her very thoughts.
"""Yes, with a wife in Noo Orleans all right,"" she interrupted him"
"feverishly. ""If you're lucky,--you'll git 'im an' me. But if you"
"lose,--this man settin' between us is mine--mine to do with as I please,"
"an' you shut up an' lose like a gentleman."""
"""You must be crazy about him!"" The words seemed wrung from the Sheriff"
against his will.

'The second from the door end of the house?' he asked.
"'No, the third.'"
He nodded with an air of quiet triumph. 'Just so!' he said. 'I thought
"so afterwards. But the fact is, my friend, my house ends with the"
"second gable. The third gable-end does not belong to it, though"
doubtless it once did.'
"'No?' I exclaimed. And for a moment I stood taken aback, cursing my"
"carelessness. Then I stammered, 'But this third gable--I saw no door"
"in it, Herr Krapp.'"
"'No, the door is in another street,' he answered. 'Or rather it opens"
on the churchyard at the back of St. Austin's. So you may have seen
"her after all. Well, I wish you well,' he continued. 'I must be"
going.'
"The crowd was beginning to separate, moving away by twos and threes,"
talking loudly. The lights were dying down. He nodded and was gone;
while I still stood gaping. For how did the matter stand? If I had
really seen Marie at the window--as seemed possible now--and if
"nothing turned out to be amiss at home, then I had not been tricked"
"after all, and the message was genuine. True she had not kept her"
"appointment. But she might be in durance, or one of a hundred things"
might have frustrated her intention.
"Still I could do nothing now except go home, and cutting short my"
"speculations, I forced myself through the press, and with some labour"
"managed to reach the door. As I did so I turned to look back, and the"
"sight, though the people were moving away fast, was sufficiently"
hands. Everything living had been slain. Astura was a castle of the
dead.
"""God! What work!"" exclaimed the Pisan. It was the testimony wrung from"
him by the stress of sheer hard fighting.
"""One of the viper-brood still lives,"" the duke turned to his"
"companion, kicking with the tip of his steel boot the lifeless form of"
Giovanni Frangipani.
The Pisan turned to a man-at-arms.
"""Take twenty men! Scour the lair from vault to pinnacle! We must have"
"that other,--dead or alive!"""
The rain had ceased for the time. New thunder-clouds came rolling out
of the west. Flambeaux flared in the court. Black shadows danced along
the ghostly walls. The wind moaned about the crenelated turrets;
"sentinels of the Pisans stood everywhere, alert for ambush."
The duke and his companions approached the door leading into the great
hall. It lay in splinters. Stygian darkness held sway within.
"Suddenly the duke paused, as if turned to stone, at the same time"
plucking his companion back by the sleeve of his surcoat.
Noiselessly as a ghost out of the door came the form of a woman. She
"was tall, exquisitely proportioned, and young. For a moment she paused"
on the threshold and looked out into the night. Almost immediately a
"second form followed, and paused near the first: that of a man. The"
"woman seemed to stare blindly at the duke, with wide, unseeing eyes,"
as one who walks in a sleep.
"'em as they were talking to Peasley. You'd better 'beat' it, quick!"""
"""How? I couldn't get through that crowd. They know me. Listen!"" Outside"
the street broke into a roar at some taunt of the fishermen high up in
"the rigging. ""I can't run away, and if those detectives get me I'm"
"ruined."""
"""Well! What's to be done?"" demanded Fraser, sharply. ""If you say the"
"word, we'll shoot it out with them, and get away on the ship before--"""
"""We can't do that--there are a dozen policemen in front here."""
"""Well, you'll have to move quick, or they'll 'cop' you, sure."""
"Boyd clinched his hands in desperation. ""I guess they've got me,"" he"
"said, bitterly. ""There's no way out."""
His eyes fell upon the letter containing his boastful assurance of
victory. What a mockery!
"""From what they said I don't think they know you,"" Fraser continued."
"""Anyhow, they wanted Peasley to point you out. When they come off,"
"maybe you can slip 'em."""
"""But how?"" Boyd seized eagerly upon the suggestion. ""The wharf is"
"empty--see! I'll have to cross it in plain sight."""
Through the rear door of the office that opened upon the dock proper
they beheld the great floor almost entirely clear. Save for a few tons
"of freight at which Big George's men were working, it was as"
"unobstructed as a lawn; and, although it was nearly the size of a city"
"block, it afforded no more means of concealment than did the little"
"presence, especially as I read he's indisposed, but really I hardly know"
how to bear the situation.  I can't bring myself to think of money in
"relation to that matter; all the same, it's a serious loss to my"
"daughter, very serious loss.  I've got my family pride to think of.  My"
"daughter's name, well--it's my own; and, though I say it, I'm"
"respected--a regular attendant--I think I told you. Sometimes, I assure"
"you, I feel I can't control myself, and it's only that--and you, if I may"
"say so, that keeps me in check."""
"During this speech, his black-gloved hands were clenching and"
"unclenching, and he shifted his broad, shining boots.  Gyp gazed at them,"
not daring to look up at his eyes thus turning and turning from
"Christianity to shekels, from his honour to the world, from his anger to"
herself.  And she said:
"""Please let me do what I ask, Mr. Wagge.  I should be so unhappy if I"
"mightn't do that little something."""
Mr. Wagge blew his nose.
"""It's a delicate matter,"" he said.  ""I don't know where my duty lays.  I"
"don't, reelly."""
Gyp looked up then.
"""The great thing is to save Daisy suffering, isn't it?"""
"Mr. Wagge's face wore for a moment an expression of affront, as if from"
the thought: 'Sufferin'!  You must leave that to her father!' Then it
"wavered; the curious, furtive warmth of the attracted male came for a"
"moment into his little eyes; he averted them, and coughed.  Gyp said"
softly:

They turned to blood the witch-circle of rusty steel skeletons around

"very smart in an almost new flannel suit, rejoined Captain Dove."
"""I'm _too_ fashionable, that's what's the matter with me!"" declared"
"Captain Dove with sudden conviction at sight of him, and gazed very"
bitterly at his own image in an inconvenient mirror.
"""Never mind about that,"" Slyne advised soothingly. ""It's not as if you"

"""A pretty jamb in the harbour,"" said Terence, giving a quick glance"
"at the maze of vessels. ""Fortunately, I hear, we've several seaplanes"
"at our disposal."""
Barracombe wished his relief good-night and descended the ladder to
retire to the seclusion of his cabin and sleep the sleep of
"exhaustion, for he had had a strenuous time before the cruiser left"
Devonport.
During the first hour nothing unusual occurred. The midshipman of the
"watch reported ""Rounds all correct, sir,"" to which Aubyn replied with"
"the stereotyped ""Very good."" Across the harbour came the faint hail"

"“Anyway,” Ned decided, “we’ll wait here a little while and see if they"
"don’t return. In the meantime, you can get yourself something to eat.”"
“Don’t you call this something to eat?” asked Jimmie.
“One poor little can of beans and one poor little plate of corn pones
"won’t make much of an impression on your appetite,” Ned laughed. “What"
"you need is one of those neat little bear steaks, about as large as a"
warming pan. You’ll have plenty of time in which to cook it.”
"“And that means that I can cook one for you, too?” asked Jimmie."
"“Why, of course you can!” returned Ned."
“I’d like to cook one for the Boy Scout who got us both into such
"trouble,” Jimmie declared. “I’d put poison on it!”"
"“Now, don’t you be too severe on that Boy Scout,” Ned advised."
"“According to your own story, he warned you and Frank in the thicket,"
"and I know very well that he wanted to tell me something, but didn’t"
dare do it.”
"“Well, here’s another thing,” Jimmie explained. “When I went out to look"
"for you, I gave the ‘help’ smoke signal from the top of a granite rock"
in the pines. In five minutes after the columns of smoke became large
"enough to be seen at a distance, the signal was answered from the north,"
"it seemed to me from the vicinity of the old mission. Now, of course,"
you didn’t send out that signal.”
"“I rather think not,” smiled Ned."
"The end of Roberts's career was now in sight. A King's ship, the _Swallow_"
"(Captain Chaloner Ogle), discovered Roberts's ships at Parrot Island, and,"
"pretending to fly from them, was followed out to sea by one of the"
"pirates. A fight took place, and after two hours the pirates struck,"
"flinging overboard their black flag ""that it might not rise in Judgement"
"over them."" The _Swallow_ returned in a few days to Parrot Island to look"
"for Roberts in the _Royal Fortune_. Roberts being at breakfast, enjoying a"
"savoury dish of solomongundy, was informed of the approach of the ship,"
"but refused to take any notice of it. At last, thoroughly alarmed, he cut"
"his cables and sailed out, but most of his crew being drunk, even at this"
"early hour, the pirates did not make as good a resistance as if they had"
been sober. Early in the engagement Roberts was hit in the throat by a
"grape-shot and killed; this being on February 10th, 1722. His body, fully"
"dressed, with his arms and ornaments, was thrown overboard according to"
"his repeated request made during his lifetime. Thus the arch-pirate died,"
"as he always said he wished to die, fighting. His motto had always been ""A"
"short life and a merry one."" One good word can be said for Roberts, that"
he never forced a man to become a pirate against his wish.

"Lilly's house on the Strand within three hours, to meet the French king's"
"ambassador, and to receive the instructions which George's letter had"
"intimated the Abbé would give. I told her, also, that the Abbé was not"
the person we had expected to see.
"The evening before, she was ready to die of fright because we believed"
"that the Abbé was George Hamilton, and now, since I had found he was not,"
she was ready to die of disappointment--so she assured me.
"At the appointed time, De Grammont, the Abbé, and I took the count's"
"barge and went down to the water stairs nearest Temple Bar, where the"
Abbé and I left De Grammont and walked up through the crowded streets to
"Lilly's house. Owing to the crowded condition of the street, the Abbé and"
I found no opportunity to exchange words until we were before Lilly's
house.
"Lilly was at home, I having sent word of our coming, so when we knocked,"
"the servant opened and directed us to the waiting parlor, saying that the"
Doctor would soon come down.
"We started upstairs, I in the lead, the Abbé following ten paces behind."
"When I entered the room, I found Bettina and Frances sitting by the"

Besides--in a hundred years it will all be forgotten. Why do we struggle?
In a hundred years someone will read about it in memoirs and letters and
"think: ""How she wriggled, how she fussed--dear me!"" There are others about"
whom nothing at all will be written or read; life will close over them
like a grave. Either way....
"What sorrows she had--dear, dear, what sorrows! The day she had been"
"unable to pay the bill, she thought herself the center of the universe;"
"everybody stared at her, and she was at her wits' end. Then she heard a"
"man's voice outside saying: ""Haven't you watered Blakka yet?"" That was"
_his_ preoccupation. So she was not the center of the universe after
all.
"Then she and her companion had left the house, and set out on their tour."
"The center? Not at all. Day after day they walked across fields, and"
"through valleys, had meals in houses by the way, and water from the"
"brooks. If they met other travelers, they greeted them, or they did not"
"greet them; no one was less a center of attention than they, and no one"
"more. Her companion walked in vacant thoughtlessness, whistling as he"
went.
At one place they stopped for food.

"USES.--Used in high fever where the temperature must be reduced quickly,"
"as in sun-stroke, acute rheumatism; in man a solution of antipyrine from"

"'Like this, my lord?' I muttered stupidly."
"He nodded. 'Yes, like this,' he repeated. 'I have heard him called a"
"brave man. Coming of his stock, he should be; and when I saw him in"
"Tzerclas' camp he had the air of one. Now he starts at a shadow, is in"
"a trance half his time, and a tremor the other half. What ails him?'"
"I told him how he had been wounded, fighting bravely, and that since"
that he had not been himself.
"Count Hugo rubbed his chin gravely. 'It is a pity,' he said. 'We want"
all--every German arm and every German head. We want you. Man alive!'
"he continued, roused to anger, I suppose, by my dull face, 'do you"
know what is in front of you?'
"'No, my lord,' I said in apathy."
He opened his mouth as if to hurl a volley of words at me. But he
"thought better of it and shut his lips tight. 'Very well,' he said"
grimly. 'Wait three days and you will see.'
"But in truth, I had not to wait three days. Before sunset of the next"
"I began to see, and, downcast as I was, to prick up my ears in wonder."
"Beyond Romhild and between that town and Bamberg, the great road which"
"runs through the valley of the Pegnitz, was such a sight as I had"
never seen. For many miles together a column of dust marked its
"course, and under this went on endless marching. We were but a link in"
"a long chain, dragging slowly southwards. Now it was a herd of"
"oxen that passed along, moving tediously and painfully, driven by"
half-naked cattle-men and guarded by a troop of grimy horse. Now it
"bowed deferentially. ""You are about to receive a great honor. The CEO"
"has asked for a private conference with you."""
Yuri stared over Ikeda's shoulder at the Man-in-Charge. All this right-
wing brass standing around kissing his ass counted for nothing. He was
the one calling the shots. Who was everybody kidding?
"Now the CEO looked his way, sizing him up with a quick glance. Yuri"
"Androv assessed him in turn. It was one look, but they both knew there"
was trouble ahead.
Then Tanzan Mino patted a colonel-general on the shoulder and headed
"over. ""Yuri Andreevich Androv, I presume,"" he said in flawless Russian,"

Thursday 4:00 P.M.
"At the precise hour, the _tokonoma _alcove off Vance's bedroom rotated"
"ninety degrees, as though moved by an unseen hand, and what awaited"
"beyond was a traditional Japanese sand-and-stone garden. It was, of"
"course, lit artificially, but the clusters of green shrubs seemed to be"
thriving on the fluorescents. Through the garden's grassy center was a
curving pathway of flat stepping stones placed artfully in irregular
"curves, and situated on either side of the walkway were towering rocks"
nestled in glistening sand that had been raked to represent ocean
waves. The rocks were reminiscent of the soaring mountains in Chinese
Sung landscape paintings.

"""Yes,"" assented the listeners."
"""But all this will never happen,"" says Yashka, becoming rather"

reasons for doing so ... It is your wife's character that causes you to
"beat her so incautiously ...  But your own dark and sad life ..."""
"""You are right!"" shouts Yakov.  ""We live in darkness, like the"
"chimney-sweep when he is in the chimney!"""
"""You are angry with your life, but your wife is patient; the closest"
"relation to you--your wife, and you make her suffer for this, simply"
"because you are stronger than she.  She is always with you, and cannot"
"get away.  Don't you see how absurd you are?"""
"""That is so....  Devil take it!  But what shall I do?  Am I not a man?"""
"""Just so!  You are a man....  I only wish to tell you that if you"
"cannot help beating her, then beat her carefully and always remember"
that you may injure her health or that of the child.  It is not good to
beat pregnant women ... on their belly or on their sides and chests....
"Beat her, say, on the neck ... or else take a rope and beat her on some"

He shook his head.
"""Well, there was a certain shrewd old cannery-man in Washington State"

"prejudice about color, this man printed a lot of striking can-labels,"
"which read, 'Best Grade Pink Salmon, Warranted not to Turn Red in the"

"""No wonder!"" Boyd laughed, beginning to feel the tension of his nerves"
"relax at the restfulness of her influence. As usual, he fell at once"
into the mood she desired for him. He saw that her brows were furrowed
"and her rosy lips drawn into an unconscious pout as she said, more to"
herself than to him:
"""I wish I were a man. I'd like to engage in a business of this sort,"
something that would require ingenuity and daring. I'd like to handle
"big affairs."""

"“Mercy, my dear! How white you are!”"
"“There’s nothing the matter with me,” said Yvonne, trying to smile."
"“It’s past our _déjeuner_ hour,” said the Canon, briskly. “You want some"
food.”
"“Perhaps I do,” said Yvonne."
"She went with the Canon on to the _digue_, and walked along the shady"
"side, by the hotels, past the gay terraces thronged with lunching"
guests. But all the glamour had gone from the place. An hour had changed
it. And that hour seemed a black abyss separating her from happiness.
"An hour ago she had looked upon this kind, grave man who walked by"
her side as her husband. Now what was he to her? She shrank from the
"thought, terrified, and came nearer to him, touching the flying skirt of"
his coat as if to take strength from him.
"They entered the crowded dining-room, where the _maître d’hôtel_ had"
"reserved them a table. She struggled bravely through part of the meal,"
strove to keep up a conversation. But the strain was too great. Another
"five minutes, she felt, would make her hysterical. She rose, with an"
"excuse to the Canon, and escaped to her room."
There she flung herself down on the bed and buried her face in the cool
pillows. It was a relief to be alone with her fright and dismay. She
"strove to think, but her head was in a whirl. The incidents of the late"
"scene came luridly before her mind, and she shivered with revulsion. A"

serious when presently he said:
"""But people coming up here and finding me might--"""
The Girl looked up at him in blank amazement.
"""Might what?"" And then, while she waited for his answer, two shots in"
close succession rang out in the night with great distinctness.
There was no mistaking the nearness of the sound. Instantly scenting
"trouble and alert at the possibility of danger, Johnson inquired:"
"""What's that? What's that?"""
"""Wait! Wait!"" came back from the Girl, unconsciously in the same tone,"
while she strained her ears for other sounds. She did not have long to
"wait, however, before other shots followed, the last ones coming from"
"further away, so it seemed, and at greater intervals."
"""They've got a road agent--it's the posse--p'r'aps they've got Ramerrez"

"rushing over to the window for some verification of her words. But, as"
"before, the wind was beating with great force against the frosted panes,"
and only a vast stretch of snow met her gaze. Turning away from the
"window she now came towards him with: ""You see, whoever it is, they're"

Johnson knitted his brows and muttered something under his breath which
the Girl did not catch.
Again a shot was fired.

_CHIC AND THE REVOLUTION_
“I understand hating bad kings and conquerors; but artists! What harm do
they do?” said Laura.
“Artists are always doing harm to the whole of humanity. They have
"invented an esthetic system for the use of the rich, and they have"
killed the Revolution. The _chic_ put an end to the Revolution. And
"now everything is coming back; enthusiasm for the aristocracy, for the"
Church; the cult of kings. People look backward and the Revolutionary
movement is paralysed. The people that irritate me most are those
"esthetes of the Ruskin school, for whom everything is religious: having"
"money, buying jewels, blowing one’s nose... everything is religious."
"Vulgar creatures, lackeys that they are!”"
"“My brother is a demagogue,” said Laura ironically."
"“Yes,” added Kennedy; “he doesn’t like categories.”"
“But each thing has its value whether he likes it or not.”
"“I do not deny different values, or even categories. There are things of"
"great value in life; some natural, like youth, beauty, strength;"
"others more artificial, like money, social position; but this idea of"
"distinction, of aristocratic fineness, is a farce. It is a literary"

"jump to ill-formed conclusions.  As one of the staff of the Embassy, and"
"her most intimate male friend, it was only courtesy to take her beneath"
"my care.  When she had no other partner and wanted to dance, then she"
"sometimes asked me.  I think she did it to annoy me, for she knew that I"
"was never fond of dancing."""
"""Do you remember the Countess of Flanders' balls at Brussels--how we"
"danced together?"" she remarked."
"""Remember them!""  I echoed.  ""They were in the golden days when"
everything seemed to our eyes couleur de rose--the days when our love
"was perfect."""
"She sighed again, but no word escaped her.  She was, I knew, reflecting"
upon those blissful days and nights when we met here and there at all
"hours and at all the best houses in Brussels, dining, lunching, dancing,"
and gossiping--together always.

"taking her hand in mine again.  ""Come, tell me that you will--that you"

A Bahaman privateer who in 1683 turned pirate and attacked St. Augustine

"returning to New Providence, the Governor attempted, but without success,"
"to arrest Pain and his crew. Pain afterwards appeared in Rhode Island, and"

"the sound of Fosse’s voice, raised in argument, as hyena goes to offal."
"Fosse in his despair had turned from Sir Gilders, and launched into the"
discussion round about him:
"“In the arts,” he was saying, “woman does not, cannot, shine. She only"
exists--on sufferance. A woman’s province----”
Myre had strolled towards the voice:
"“I am flattered to find,” said he, “that Mr. Fosse has been reading me."
He is right. A woman’s province is to be beautiful; and if she write
at all she may write of the nursery--of the domesticities. A woman
has not the experiences of life--she writes only from intuition. She
cannot experience the emotions of a man--cannot describe all shades of
life--is too careful of her skirts to have been on the heights and in
the gutters----”
Lovegood coughed:
"“Never,” said he, with big deliberate voice--“never shall I again"
approach a municipal sewer without an ecstatic thrill.”
Quogge Myre took no notice of the shaft:
"“A woman,” said he, “cannot be in the thrash and fume of life. She only"
peeps out fearfully over the window-blind at the doings of the world.
She has not physical strength----”
Somebody coughed:
“Tra-la-lee!” said he--“opera--bouffe--bouffe--bouffe.”

It struck me that yesterday was the last time I spoke to her. We spoke
"only a few insignificant words that I have forgotten, and today I have not"
spoken to her....
Here they come.
Curious--they seemed somehow to have become welded together; though they
"walked separately up the mountain track, yet they belonged together. They"
did not speak; the essential things had probably already been said. Life
had grown ordinary for them; it still remained to them to be of use to
"each other. He walked first, while she followed many paces behind; it was"
lonely to look at against the rugged background of the mountain. Where had
her tall figure gone to? She seemed to have grown shorter because she had
hitched up her skirt and was carrying her knapsack on her back. They each

"""Jack?"" she slowly repeated. ""What an odd name!"""
This made me feel queer.
"""Where do you live,"" I asked, ""that you think it's an odd name? The"
"States are crawling with Jacks! It's even the Democratic emblem!"""
Her perplexity was fast approaching alarm when we heard a muffled report
"above, followed by a trembling of the yacht. Someone called an order"
that sounded far away in the wind.

"and I reassured her at once, but she merely asked:"
"""Was my father on deck?"""
"""I didn't look,"" I answered, wondering why she thought I knew."
"""Won't you see?"" Her patience was becoming exhausted."
"""I'm crazy to. But first let me help you back--you can't make it"
mix the hats.... Ha-ha!” He laughed mock-tragically. “This night must
never be forgotten!”
"“It never will,” said Blotte; and laughing grimly he got striding again"
"in the red wig, as Fluffy Reubens and Doome burst into the room."
"“Here, Fluffy,” said Rippley, “quick, man! put on this yellow wig, and"
"comb it well over your eyes. There isn’t a moment to be lost; Doome,"
here’s a black moustache and a greyish wig--this is the way to stick it
on--see? Splendid! Makes you look like a broken-down Italian tenor.”
He searched about in the cabinet and found a stubbly black wig which he
"pulled over his own hair, and was at once a son of France:"
"“Look here, boys, I’m head-waiter, see! And when I bow, you bow: and"
"when I rub my hands, you rub your hands; and don’t forget the foreign"
"accent--try to talk English as you used to talk French.... Doome, you"
"stand at the landing below, and see that old Dukes don’t stir a step"
"from the door--and bawl up the names from him. And you, Fluffy, play"
the general ass. I’ll stick to the door here.... Are we all right
"now?... No, Blotte’s not enough disguised. Here, Doome, fasten this"
"fierce moustache on his lip, whilst I shut up.... O lor! here they"
come!”
Rippley had scarcely hurried into his coat when there entered and
halted in the great doorway a hesitating figure in the white satin
"dress of a courtier of Charles the First, lace frills at his weak"
"knees, white stockings, white shoes, and holding a plumed hat in his"
hand.
"His eyeglass dropped out of his eye, and he stood there stuttering and"
aghast.
"his grotesque body, spoke for him."
"""That,"" he was certainly saying, ""is what will happen to any on your"
"helpless planet who dare oppose the Rogan will!"""
He whipped out a command to the terror-stricken girl. She rose from
her crouching position on the floor; and at length formulated the
Rogan's last order:
"""You will explain the working of the engine that drove your space ship"
"here."""
"Dex laughed. It was a short bark of sound, totally devoid of humor,"
but very full of defiance. Brand thrust his hands into the pockets of
"his tunic, spread his legs apart, and began to whistle."
*       *       *       *       *
A quiver that might have been of anger touched the Rogan leader's
repulsive little mouth. He glared balefully at the uncowed Earthmen
"and spoke again, evidently repeating his command. The two turned their"
backs to him to indicate their refusal to obey.
"At that, the tall leader pointed to Dex. In an instant three of the"
guards had wound their double pairs of arms around his struggling
"body. Brand sprang to help him, but a touch of the mysterious"
discharge from the leader's tube sent him writhing to the floor.
"""It's no use, Brand,"" said Dex steadily. He too had stopped"
"struggling, and now stood quietly in the slimy coils of his captors'"
"arms. ""I might as well go along with them and get it over with. I"
"probably won't see you again. Good luck!"""
and awful death. Montagu Askew was in the business. He was one of the
few that came out alive.
"In the rush of the distraught ladies, princesses, duchesses, maids, to"
"the sole outlet of the seething hell, Montagu Askew got caught near the"
door--frantic hands of terrified women clutched at him for help--he was
almost within reach of the free air--could see the sunlight a few paces
"before him--a frightened girl clung to his arm in the awful crush, then"
"another--women’s skirts got under foot as they made for the door, and"
"they went down. He tried to shake himself clear of the two girls, he"
was a little slender man.... The heat was hellish.... One of the girls
"tripped on her skirt and fell, clinging to him. He beat her down with"
the jade-handled cane--fought his way blindly through the rush of women
for the door--stood at last out in the sunlight.
"Some coachmen were dashing into the fiery furnace, lifting up and"
"bringing out fainting women, whose muslin skirts were in flames."
But Monty Askew was frightened.
He smoothed his ruffled dress and went home.
"Montagu Askew, entering a café with Rupert Greppel one evening, saluted"
"Noll Baddlesmere, where he stood amongst a group of students; and a"
silence fell upon the place.
Noll nodded:
"“That’s a handsome cane, Askew,” said he--“though they tell me the"
women have a poor opinion of it.”
expressed intention of hiding this terrible discovery from him. He had
"been duped, not by her, but by his own romantic folly."
Yet what would his life be without her--or rather without his illusion?
An icy hand gripped his heart. He turned to the glimmering window and
stared at the blank wall.
"Presently a moan struck upon his ear. He wheeled round sharply, and"
distinguished her lying with helpless outspread arms on the couch. Mere
humanity brought him to her side.
"“I am so tired,” she moaned."
"“You must go to bed,” he replied in a gentler voice than hitherto. “We"
"had better part now. To-morrow, if you are well enough to travel, we"
will leave for England.”
"“Let me go alone,” she murmured, “and you go on to Switzerland. Why"
should your holiday be spoiled?”
"“It is my life that is spoiled,” he said ungenerously. “The holiday"
matters very little. It is best to return to England as soon as
possible. Between now and to-morrow morning I shall have time to reflect
upon the situation.”
He struck a match and lit the candles and drew down the blind. The
light revealed her to him so wan and exhausted that he was moved with
compunction.
"“Don’t think me hard, my child,” he said, bending over her. “It is the"
bitterest day of our lives. We must pray to God for strength to bear it.
I shall leave you now. I shall see that you have all you want. Try to
"“Can't you say, 'Thank you?' “ said the matron."
"“Thank you, sir,” said Unity Blake."
Even in those three words her accent was unmistakably cockney--as
"unmistakably cockney as the coarse-featured, snub-nosed, common little"
"face. In happier, freer conditions she would have done her skimpy hair"
"up in patent curlers and worn a hat with a purple feather, and joined"
heartily in the raucous merriment of her comrades at the pickle-factory.
"Here, however, she was lying, poor little devil, thought Risca, warped"
"from childhood by the ascetic ideal, and wrecked body and spirit by"
unutterable cruelty. In her eyes flickered the patient apprehension of
the ill-treated dog.
"“I hope you will soon get better,” he said, with sickening knowledge of"
that which lay hidden beneath the rough bedclothes.
"“Yes, sir,” said Unity."
"“It 's chiefly her nerves now,” said the matron. “She hollers out of"
"nights, so she can't be put into the dormitory.”"
“Do you like the things I send you?” asked John.
"“Yes, sir.”"
“Is there anything special you'd like to have?”
"“No, sir.”"
But he caught a certain wistfulness in her glance.
"TOWNLEY, CAPTAIN. Buccaneer."
A buccaneer who in the year 1684 was one of the mixed English and French
"fleet blockading Panama. On this occasion, he commanded a ship with a crew"
of 180 men. By the next year the quarrels between the English had reached
such a pitch that Townley and Swan left Davis and sailed in search of
"their French friends. In May, 1685, Townley was amongst the company that"
"took and sacked Guayaquil. In January, 1686, Townley rescued the French"
"pirate Grogniet and some 350 Frenchmen who, when attacking the town of"
"Quibo, were surprised by a Spanish squadron, which burnt their vessels"
while the crews were on shore. Townley then sailed north with his French
comrades and sacked Granada.
"His next adventure was to take the town of Lavelia, near to Panama, where"
he found a rich cargo which the Viceroy had placed on shore because he was
afraid to send it to sea when so many pirates were about.
"In August of the same year, Townley's ship was attacked by three Spanish"
"men-of-war. A furious fight took place, which ended by two of the Spanish"
ships being captured and the third burnt. In this action the gallant
"Townley was gravely wounded, and died shortly afterwards."
"TRISTRIAN, CAPTAIN. French buccaneer."
"In the year 1681 Dampier, with other malcontents, broke away from Captain"
Sharp and marched on foot across the Isthmus of Darien. After undergoing
"terrible hardships for twenty-two days, the party arrived on the Atlantic"
"seaboard, to find Captain Tristrian with his ship lying in La Sounds Cay."
"The buccaneers bought red, blue, and green beads, and knives, scissors,"

body.]

These saddle bags are most fascinating. They are coarsely woven in bands
"of raw black-rusty wool, with varying bands of raw white wool or hemp or"
cotton--the bands and stripes of varying widths going cross-wise. And on
"the pale bands are woven sometimes flowers in most lovely colours,"
"rose-red and blue and green, peasant patterns--and sometimes fantastic"
"animals, beasts, in dark wool again. So that these striped zebra bags,"
"some wonderful gay with flowery colours on their stripes, some weird"
"with fantastic, griffin-like animals, are a whole landscape in"
themselves.
The train has only first and third class. It costs about thirty francs
"for the two of us, third class to Mandas, which is some sixty miles. In"

"The coach was fairly full of people, returning from market. On these"
railways the third class coaches are not divided into compartments. They
"are left open, so that one sees everybody, as down a room. The"

"himself in the window-sill, had dozed off to sleep, the cigarette still"
"drooping from the corner of his mouth. Yes, he was certainly asleep."
"He held out his hand to Etienne, who readily gave him the last he had"
"rolled. The sentry thanked him with a quick martial salute, and after a"
"turn or two more, deftly dropped the crumbled tobacco upon the floor and"
let the leaf drop on Rollo's knees with a stump of pencil rolled up in
it.
"Then the young man, turning his back upon the dozing guard in the stone"
"window-sill, wrote with some difficulty the following note, lying on his"
breast and using the uneven floor of the granary for a desk.
"""Little Concha"" (it ran), ""we are General Cabrera's prisoners."
Bring the papers as soon as you receive this. Otherwise we are
"to be shot at day-break.--ROLLO BLAIR."""
"There was still a little space left upon the leaf of Alcoy paper, and"
"with a half shamefaced glance at El Sarria, he added, ""_And in any case"
"do not wholly forget R. B._"""
"He passed the note to the outlaw, who folded it to the size of a postage"
stamp and apparently gave directions where and to whom it was to be
delivered.

comrade so that he might not be found asleep at the change of guard.

"Aubrey at the mantelpiece, gazing at himself in the mirror, said simply:"
“Bosh!”
"“Rather a dramatic situation when you come to think of it, eh?” said"
"Fluffy Reubens, lolling his full length in the easy-chair."
"Rippley, his hands in his trousers pockets, considered the situation"
with reflective eye fixed on the carpet:
"“And a rippin’ dramatic emotion, eh! To feel one’s self being wrangled"
about from one end of the country to the other----”
Aubrey turned languidly from the mirror:
"“Ah!” said he, “and then to listen to it all, robed in the delightful"
invisible cloak of pseudonymity!”
Rippley laughed drily:
"“No, no, Aubrey, old man--that wouldn’t have suited you at all. You"
wouldn’t have lasted at it for a fortnight.”
Lovegood smiled:
"“We need not get into the quarrelsome stage about it yet,” he said in"
his big deep voice: “We shall be tearing him to pieces in magazine
articles to-morrow and flinging him to the dogs of the lower journalism
to snarl at before the year is out.... The failures are always
suspicious of popularity.”
"Aubrey turned to the mirror again, and said “Bosh!”"
"""I'm here with a message from your mistress, Betty.  Keep your head;"
"don't look round, but listen to me.  She's at Bury Street and going to"
"stay there; she wants you and baby and the dogs.""  The stout woman's eyes"
grew round and her mouth opened.  Winton put his hand on the
"perambulator.  ""Steady, now!  Go out as usual with this thing.  It's"
about your time; and wait for me at the turning to Regent's Park.  I'll
come on in my cab and pick you all up.  Don't get flurried; don't take
"anything; do exactly as you usually would. Understand?"""
It is not in the nature of stout women with babies in their charge to
"receive such an order without question.  Her colour, and the heaving of"
that billowy bosom made Winton add quickly:
"""Now, Betty, pull yourself together; Gyp wants you.  I'll tell you all"
"about it in the cab."""
"The poor woman, still heaving vaguely, could only stammer:"
"""Yes, sir.  Poor little thing!  What about its night-things?  And Miss"
"Gyp's?"""
"Conscious of that figure still at the window, Winton made some passes"
"with his fingers at the baby, and said:"
"""Never mind them.  As soon as you see me at the drawing-room window, get"
"ready and go.  Eyes front, Betty; don't look round; I'll cover your"
"retreat!  Don't fail Gyp now.  Pull yourself together."""
"With a sigh that could have been heard in Kensington, Betty murmured:"
"""Very well, sir; oh dear!"" and began to adjust the strings of her bonnet."
"With nods, as if he had been the recipient of some sage remarks about the"
"baby, Winton saluted, and began his march again towards the house.  He"
With the greatest diffidence I have at last made up my mind to write
the story of my small campaign with the Sarhad Raiders in 1916.
This campaign sinks into utter insignificance when compared with the
great deeds done in other theatres of war by men who said nothing
"about them. But, insignificant as it was, it forms part of the mosaic"
"of the Great War, and for this reason may be of some general interest."
I take this opportunity of paying a tribute to all the officers who
"took part in this little campaign. Their untiring devotion to duty,"
and their efforts to do their utmost under conditions that were often
"more than trying, accounts for its success."
"I would like, in particular, to mention Major Landon of the 35th"
"Scinde Horse, whose great knowledge of the people and their country"
was invaluable; Major Sanders of the 36th Sikhs; Colonel Claridge of
"the 28th Light Cavalry; Captain Brownlow and Captain Hirst, both of"
the 28th Light Cavalry; Major Lang; Captain Moore-Lane; Lieutenant
"Bream of the Hazara Pioneers, and Captain English, R.A."
"In addition I would mention how much, not only I, but the old country"
"owes to Khan Bahadur, the Sarhad-dar, and to Idu, non-commissioned"
officer of the Chagai Levies.
The photographs are from snapshots taken by various officers during
the campaign.
R.E.H.D.
"sheer ecstatic bravado, emitted a Tarzan roar."
Instantly a weight hit the door from the outside. It shuddered but did
"not give. Dennis crouched, gripping his knife. Frank Corson staggered to"
his feet and hurled himself groggily at the android. Dennis roared
"again, pushed away and arced the knife at his throat."
"Rhoda screamed and lunged at Dennis' legs. ""No! No! Stop it! Please!"""
Dennis teetered under her weight and the knife slanted downward across
Frank's chest. It ripped a red gash as the door shuddered a third time.
Dennis turned in that direction and crouched. The door splintered and
"flew open. Dennis lunged, like a line-bucking football player. He hit"
"both Brent Taber and Captain Abrams simultaneously, sprawling them both"
and sending Abrams' gun spinning out of his hand.
He leaped over them and dashed down the hall where the elevator man
"waited uncertainly, not sure whether to dispute the right of way or not."
"His indecision was fatal. Dennis wrapped an arm around his neck, pulled"
his head back and cut his throat with one slash of the knife.
Captain Abrams' head had hit a doorjamb opposite the entrance to Rhoda's
apartment. He stirred and tried to come erect but he was unable to make
it.
Brent Taber clawed the gun off the floor and came to one knee. He got
off one shot as the elevator door was closing and saw the android spin
away from the controls as the impact of the slug smashed the bone of his
shoulder.
Taber lunged to his feet and went for the stairs.

THE SAMPLE PAGE
"With these details settled, the sample page is next in order. Knowing"
that the book is to be a 12mo (size of leaf 5⅛ × 7⅝) or a 10mo (size
"of leaf 5½ × 8¼), the printer must ""lay out"" the page so as to leave"
margins of proper size and proportion. A 12mo type page may vary from
"3 × 5¼ inches to 4 × 6¾ inches. Somewhere within this area, in the"
"given example, the page must contain about 280 words. If the manuscript"
"is long, then the type page must be large, the type itself small (never"
"smaller than long primer[36] nor larger than pica[36]), the leads[36]"
reduced or omitted altogether. This is where the printer's taste and
skill is given an opportunity for expression: he is the architect
"of the book, and must not combine types or decorations which are"
"inharmonious, and his proportions must be kept correct."
"to glitter with a queer metallic sheen. Then, from each of the three,"
as they passed over the boundary--nothing! All radio communication
"ceased as abruptly as though they'd been stricken dead."""
"He stared at Brand. ""That's all I can tell you, little enough, God"
knows. Something ominous and strange is contained in that red spot:
"but what its nature may be, we cannot even guess. I want you to go"
"there and find out."""
"Brand's determined jaw jutted out, and his lips thinned to a"
purposeful line. He stood to attention.
"""I'll be leaving to-night, sir. Or sooner if you like. I could go this"
"afternoon: in an hour--"""
"""To-night is soon enough,"" said Stone with a smile. ""Now, who do you"
"want to accompany you?"""
Brand thought a moment. On so long a journey as a trip to Jupiter
there was only room in a space ship--what with supplies and all--for
one other man. It behooved him to pick his companion carefully.
"""I'd like Dex Harlow,"" he said at last. ""He's been to Jupiter before,"
"working with me in plotting the northern hemisphere. He's a good man."""
"""He is,"" agreed Stone, nodding approval of Brand's choice. ""I'll have"
"him report to you at once."""
"He rose and held out his hand. ""I'm relying on you, Captain Bowen,"" he"
"said. ""I won't give any direct orders: use your own discretion. But I"
would advise you not to try to land in the red area. Simply fly low
"over it, and see what you can discern from the air. Good-by, and good"
pillow.
I held my breath.  The awful truth was distinctly apparent.  I placed my
"hand upon her heart, the bodice of her dress being already unloosened."
"Then a few seconds later I drew back, standing rigid and aghast."
"""Why, she's dead!""  I gasped."
"""Yes,"" the Countess said, covering her face with her hands and bursting"
"into tears.  ""My poor Yolande! she is dead--_dead_!"""
The discovery appalled me.  Only a couple of hours before we had chatted
"together, and she seemed in the best of health and spirits, just as in"
"the old days, until I had made the announcement of Wolf's presence in"
Paris.  The effect of that statement upon her had apparently been
"electrical.  Why, I knew not.  Had she not implored me to save her?"
This in itself was sufficient to show that she held him in deadly fear.
"Again I bent in order to make further examination, but saw the"
unmistakable mark of death upon her countenance.  The lower jaw had
"dropped, the checks were cold, and the silver hand-mirror which I had"
snatched from the table and held at her mouth was unclouded.  There was
"no movement--no life.  Yolande, my well-beloved of those long-past days,"
was dead.
I stood there at the bedside like a man in a dream.  So swiftly had she
been struck down that the terrible truth seemed impossible of
realisation.
"The Countess, standing beside me, sobbed bitterly.  Truly the scene in"
that darkened chamber was a strange and impressive one.  Never before in
my whole life had I been in the presence of the dead.
"wiping it. All the while his eyes were emotionless, betraying no hint"
of what was in his mind.
"After the utensils were ceremonially cleansed, he wordlessly scooped a"
"portion of pale-green powdered tea into the bowl, then lifted a"
dipperful of boiling water from the kettle and poured it in. Finally he
"picked up a bamboo whisk and began to whip the mixture, continuing"
until it had acquired the consistency of green foam.
"Authority, control, and--above all--discipline. Those things, Vance knew,"
"were what this was really about. As was traditional and proper, not a"
"word was spoken. This was the Zen equivalent of High Mass, and Tanzan"
"Mino was silently letting him know he was a true master--of himself, of"
his world.
"Then the _oyabun _reached over and formally presented the bowl, placing"
it on the _tatami  _in front of his guest.
"Vance lifted it up, rotated it a half turn in his hand, and took a"
"reserved sip. As the bitter beverage assaulted his mouth, he found"
himself thinking this was probably intended to be his Last Supper. He
hoped he remembered enough to get the moves right.
"He sipped one more time, then wiped the rim, formally repositioned the"
"bowl on the _tatami_, and leaned back."
"""Perfectly done,"" Tanzan Mino smiled as he broke the silence. ""I'm"
"impressed."" He nodded toward the white bowl. ""Incidentally, you were"
"just handling one of the finest pieces in all Japan."""
"""Shino ware. Mino region, late sixteenth century. Remarkably fine"
"glaze, considering those kilns had just started firing _chawan_."""
"""Take this lady and her maid straight up to the suite next mine,"""
"ordered Slyne as Sallie alighted, while Captain Dove listened, all ears."
"""And ask Mr. Jobling to join me in my sitting-room. He's still here, I"
"suppose?"""
"He gave vent to a heartfelt sigh of relief as the man, already preceding"
"his charges indoors, paused to answer in the affirmative."
"""I needn't book a room for you,"" he told Captain Dove, with calculated"
"indifference. ""But Sallie must have somewhere to leave Ambrizette."
"""Hey! you. Call my chauffeur to take the car round to the garage."""
"Captain Dove followed him toward the bureau, attracting not a few"
glances of mingled surprise and amusement from the elaborate idlers in
its neighbourhood. Slyne was furious.
"""I can't have him tagging about after me in that ghastly get-up!"" he"
told himself on the way to the elevator; and cuffed the elevator-boy's
ears at the sound of a mirthful sneeze with which that unfortunate youth
"had become afflicted. ""Though how the deuce I'm to help myself I don't"
"know."""
In the corridor at which they got out he caught sight of Mr. Jobling
"approaching, and hurried Captain Dove into the sitting-room of his"
suite.
"""Give me five minutes to change my clothes,"" he requested of the old"
"man. ""And don't get straying about, or you'll lose yourself."""
Mr. Jobling met him on the threshold as he shut the door. That gentleman
Dawson spoke with less than his usual cheery confidence. I fancy that
the thinness and whiteness of his face were not wholly due to
disguise. He had not been to bed since he had been called up in the
"middle watch of the night before last, and the man was worn out."
"""If you take my poor advice, Dawson,"" I said, ""you will cut off now"
and get some sleep. Even your brain cannot work continuously without
"rest. The country needs you at your best, and needs you very badly"
"indeed."""
"His dull, weary eyes lighted as if under the stimulus of champagne,"
and he turned upon me a look which was almost affectionate. I really
"began to believe that Dawson likes me, that he sees in me a kindred"
spirit as patriotically unscrupulous as himself.
"He jumped up and gripped my hand. ""You are right. I will put in a few"
hours' sleep and then to work once more. This time I am up against a
"man who is nearly as smart as I am myself, and I can't afford to carry"
"any handicap."""
"I led him to the door and put him out, and then turned to Cary with a"
"laugh. ""And I, too, will follow Dawson's example. It is past one, and"
"my head is buzzing with queer ideas. Perhaps, after all, the Germans"
"have more imagination than we usually credit them with. I wonder--"""
But I did not tell to Cary what I wondered.

"We were sitting after breakfast in Cary's study, enjoying the first"
"sweet pipe of the day, when the telephone bell rang. Cary took off the"
earpiece and I listened to a one-sided conversation somewhat as
follows:--
"of your naval inquisitiveness."""
"Dawson told his story, and the naval officer's keen kindly face grew"
"stern and hard. ""Germans I can respect,"" said he, ""even those that"
pretend to be our friends. But one of our own folk--to sell us like
"this--ugh! Take the vermin away; Dawson, and stamp upon it."""
"We stood talking for a few moments, and then Dawson broke in with a"
"question. ""I have never understood, Admiral, why you were so very"
confident that Mr. Copplestone here had no hand in this business. The
"case against him looked pretty ugly, yet you laughed at it all the"
"time. Why were you so sure?"""
The Admiral surveyed Dawson as if he were some strange creature from
"an unknown world. ""Mr. Copplestone is a friend of mine,"" said he"
drily.
"""Very likely,"" snapped the detective. ""But is a man a white angel"
"because he has the honour to be your friend?"""
"""A fair retort,"" commented the Admiral. It happens that I had other"
and better reasons. For in July I myself showed Mr. Copplestone over
"the new battleship _Rampagious_, and after our inspection we both"
lunched with the builders and discussed her design and armament in
"every detail. So as Mr. Copplestone knew all about her in July, he was"
"not likely to suborn a draughtsman in November. See?"""
"""You should have told me this before. It was your duty."""
"""My good Dawson,"" said the Admiral gently, ""you are an excellent"
"officer of police, but even you have a few things yet to learn. I had"
"in my mind to give you a lesson, especially as I owed you some"
"know--all strangers, save one.  This was a cabinet portrait in a heavy"
"silver frame, and as I took it up to scrutinise it more closely a cry"
involuntarily escaped my lips.
The picture was a three-quarter length representation of a
"black-bearded, keen-eyed man, standing with his hands thrust idly in his"
"pockets, and smoking a cigarette.  There was no mistaking those"
features.  It was the photograph of the man the discovery of whose
presence in Paris had produced such an extraordinary effect upon her--
Rodolphe Wolf.
CHAPTER SEVEN.
BY A THREAD.
"I was still standing by the window, holding the photograph in my hand,"
"and gazing upon it in wonder, when Dick Deane was shown in."
"""What's the matter, old chap?  Are you the man in possession here?"" he"
"asked breezily, gripping me by the hand."
"He was a fair, merry-faced fellow of thirty-five, rather good-looking,"
"smartly dressed in black frock-coat of professional cut, and wearing a"
"pair of gold-rimmed pince-nez.  He had been born in Paris, and had spent"
"the greater part of his life there, except during the years when he was"
"at school with me before going to Edinburgh, where he took his degree."
"Then he had returned to Paris, taken his French degree, and had soon"
risen to be one of the fashionable doctors in the French capital.  He
"was an especial favourite in the salons, and, like every good-looking"
"doctor, a favourite with the ladies."
"""I'm not in possession,"" I answered.  ""A very serious affair has"
rather know that George had gone to Canada than to fear his return to
England under the circumstances.
"""The dastardly king will take his life if he comes,"" she said."
"""I admit the danger,"" I answered, as hopefully as possible, ""but I"
"believe, if George comes, he will be able to take care of himself."""
"""Danger!"" she exclaimed. ""It is certain death! George will find no"
"mercy."""
"""If he is caught,"" I answered. ""But the letter from King Louis will"
convince King Charles that Hamilton is in Canada and will throw our
jealous monarch off his guard. Perhaps Hamilton will be safer than we
"suppose. He speaks French like a Parisian, but, above all, he is cool,"
"calm, and thoughtful in danger. The London merchants will be far more"
"dangerous than the king."""
"""It does seem that we are guilty of treason to our country in thus"
"helping France,"" she said. Then laughingly, ""But I'll go back to the"
"palace at once and begin my task of wheedling the king."" She paused for a"
"moment, then continued hesitatingly, ""Do you suppose it possible that"
"George would doubt me afterwards?"""
"""Impossible,"" I answered, with emphasis that seemed to reassure her."
"""I am doing it for him,"" she continued with a sigh. ""God knows I would"
"do almost anything in the same cause. But I do not know men, and I fear"
it is possible that he will doubt me after I have succeeded. Let us go
"to see Betty. She is restful to me, and always soothes my nerves. But"
"besides, I want to have her help. I'll introduce her to the king--"""
*CHAPTER IX.*
"*""A MAD WORLD, MY MASTERS.""*"
"""Master, master, wake up!  What ails you? Have you forgot the day, and"
"what has to be done?"""
"Dick, with an expression of uneasiness and determination upon his face,"
was shaking Grey somewhat vehemently by the shoulder.  The latter seemed
"to find it hard to wake; and when his eyes opened at last, there was a"
lack-lustre expression in them that was strange and unnatural.  Dick’s
honest face clouded over yet more.
"""I was certain there was some devilry afoot when they all came here last"
"night.  I have never seen my master in such a mad mood of merriment,"" he"
"muttered half aloud, as he turned away to get a brimming glass of pure"
"cold water from the table.  ""What has come over them, I don’t know.  But"
I like not the change. I liked not the look in Lord Sandford’s eyes.  He
"is a great man, I doubt it not; but I wish my master had chanced upon"
another as a friend and comrade in this great Babylon of a city.  There
"is more going on here than I well understand."""
"""What are you grumbling over there to yourself, Dicon?"" asked Grey from"
"his bed, and his voice sounded more natural and quiet than his servant"
"had heard it yet; ""and where am I?  For sure this room is strange to"
"mine eyes, nor have I any recollection of it overnight; and how come you"
"to be here, for that matter, honest Dicon?  Methought you were at"
"Hampstead, watching over Don Carlos, that he might be ready for"
"Saturday’s race."""
"The android advanced with his knife raised. In desperation, Taber fired"
at the lethal fist that held the weapon. And he was lucky. The hand
snapped open under the ripping impact of the bullet and the knife rang
sharply against the wall as it ricocheted to the ground.
"Only then, did the patrolman obey the order to drop. He went to one knee"
and Brent Taber fired three shots into the chest of the android.
He hesitated. There was only one slug left in the revolver. If the three
"didn't spot the android, he planned to wait for closer contact and put"
the sixth slug into the forehead.
The android shuddered. The fire and frenzy went out of him. He tried to
lift a leg and was surprised when it didn't move. He looked down at it.
"Completely bemused, he peered down at his crimson chest. He looked up at"
"Taber without anger, only with surprise. A distinct expression of"
wistful regret crossed his face as he sank to the ground.
The tenth android was dead.
The patrolman came shakily to his feet. His face was as pale as death.
"""I--I don't know what happened. Buck fever. Pure buck fever, and I've"
"been on the force for ten years."""
"""Don't worry about it,"" Taber said."
"""Don't _worry_. All of a sudden I freeze under pressure and he says,"
"'Don't worry.'"""
"""I meant it. This is no ordinary man. It wasn't buck fever at all. I"
couldn't have faced him myself if I hadn't rattled him with that lucky
"""The murder!"" exclaimed the Captain."
"""Don't talk to me about it, Perry,"" the Chief Justice requested, opening"
"a paper in front of his face. He did not, however, withdraw out of"
earshot.
"""They've got a sort of a clue. A wretched hobbledehoy of a fellow,"
"something in the bookseller's shop at the corner of Kettle Street, has"
come with a rigmarole about a society that he and a few more belonged
"to, including this François Gaspard, who is missing. He protests that"
"the thing was legal, and all that--only a Radical inner ring--but he"
says that at the last meeting this fellow was dropping hints about
putting somebody out of the way. Dyer--that's the lad's name--swears the
"rest of them disowned him and said they'd have nothing to do with it,"
"and hoped he'd given up the idea."""
"""I suppose he's in a blue funk?"" asked the Captain."
"""He is no doubt alarmed,"" said Sir Robert. ""He gave the police the names"
"of the rest of their precious society, and, oddly enough, Ned Evans, of"
"the House--you know him, Coxon?--was one."""
"""Heard such an awful lot of debates, poor chap,"" observed Captain"
Heseltine.
"""Well, they went to Evans' and collared him. For a time he stuck out"
"that he knew nothing about it, but they threatened him with heaven knows"
"what, and at last he confessed to having seen this Gaspard in company"
with the murdered man in Digby Square a little before twelve on the
"night."""
"""By Jove! That's awkward!"" said the Captain."
"""Going to Havana?"""
"This, too, I admitted."
"""Well, there's a feller by the desk who missed the steamer, and he"
"hoped--er----"""
"""We'd take him over,"" Tommy supplied the halting words. ""Where is he?"""
"Turning, we easily distinguished the man by his timid glances in our"
direction.
"""Whiz-bang,"" Tommy whispered. ""What the deuce would you call it, Jack?"""
"Except for his age, that might have been sixty, he was most comical to"
"look upon--in stature short and round, suggesting kinship with a gnome."
"His head seemed too large for the body, yet this might have been because"
"it carried a plenteous shock of straw-colored hair, with mustache and"
"beard to match. He was attired in ""knickers"" and pleated jacket, that"
"looked as if he'd slept in them, and his fat legs were knock-kneed. On"
the floor about his feet lay almost every conceivable type and age of
"traveling bag, with the inevitable camera."
"""What's his name?"" Tommy asked, not that that would have made any"
difference if his passport were in order.
"""Registered as 'Monsieur Dragot, of Roumania,'"" the proprietor answered."
"""Roumania!"" Tommy looked at me. ""Let's go meet him, Jack."""
"Monsieur Dragot turned out to be the original singed cat, for assuredly"
he possessed more attractive qualities inside than were exteriorly
"'Guffin.'  And hevery skipper was the 'Guffin,' new and old, go or"
"stay.  But when we broke hoff to hargue, why, we was talkin' about"
them French jossers and whether Sallis-bury was a-goin' to let 'em
"chip into our game and straddle the Nile."""
"""That's so,"" said the crowd, and the House was rough."
"Meanwhile, the skipper, or ""old man"" (who henceforward, by the way,"
"was called the ""Guffin""), and his two mates were discussing the"
"latest aspect of world politics, as they drank whiskey and water."
"""What's wrong with Salisbury,"" said the Guffin, who was as stout as a"
"barrel and as sturdy, ""is, that he ain't got a backbone.  He just"
lets 'em blow him about like so much paper.  What he wants is
"stiffenin': he's like a sprung spar.  That's what he's like."""
"The mate, a tough-looking dog with hair like anæmic tussac grass in"
"patches on his face, shook his head."
"""I've a greater opinion of him, captain, than you have.  All his"
double shuffle is cunning.  It's getting back so's to lead them
"French on.  Mark me, he'll play them yet a fair knock-out."""
The Guffin sneered.
"""He may have cunnin', Lampert, but he ain't no real tact.  Now,"
"diplomatic tact, I take it, is not givin' way into the gutter, but"
just showin' as you're a nice pleasant-spoken chap as don't mean to
be put on.  It's my good opinion as these foreigners don't yearn to
"fight us.  And men like you and me, Lampert, gets to learn the way of"
handlin' foreigners.  Who has so much experience with 'em as them in
"command of English ships?"""
I'm glad you did. I suppose the lampooners will get hold of the story
and will set every one laughing at me. Kidnapped the wrong woman and
lost her! Odds fish! But you're a pair of wise ones. I see I shall have
"to find me a new Lord High Kidnapper."""
"The king was right concerning the lampooners, for soon they had the"
"story, and he became the laughing-stock of London, though Frances's name"
was not mentioned.
It is a significant index to the morals of our time that the king's
attempt to kidnap a woman in the streets of London should have aroused
laughter rather than indignation.
"As it was, the kidnapping episode brought no harm to my cousin, but she"
"did not want it to happen again, and so was careful to take a trusted"
escort with her when she went abroad thereafter.
CHAPTER X
AT THE MAID'S GARTER
"Betty was confined to her room during the greater part of the next month,"
and Frances visited her frequently. Notwithstanding my vows not to see
"Betty, I was compelled to go with Frances as her body-guard. I even went"
so far in my feeble effort to keep my resolution as to suggest Churchill
"as a body-guard, but Frances objected, and the quality of my good intent"
"was not enduring. So I went with my cousin, and the joy in Betty's eyes"
whenever we entered her room was not the sort that would come because she
"""No,"" she answered in that hard voice, by which I knew that mention of"
"Yolande's name had displeased her.  ""Remember that we are friends, and"
"that sometimes we have interests in common.  Therefore, take this piece"
"of advice from an old woman who knows."""
"""Knows what?"""
"""Knows that your friendship with the pretty Yolande is dangerous--"
"extremely dangerous."""
CHAPTER TEN.
CONFESSION.
"Next day, when the manservant asked me into the tiny boudoir in the Rue"
"de Courcelles, I found Yolande, in a pretty tea-gown of cream silk"
"adorned with lace and ribbons, seated in an armchair in an attitude of"
"weariness.  The sun-shutters were closed, as on the previous day, for"
"the heat in Paris that July was insufferable, and in the dim light her"
wan figure looked very fair and fragile.  The qualities which imparted
to her a distinct individuality were the beautiful combination of the
pastoral with the elegant--of simplicity with elevation--of spirit with
sweetness.
"She gave vent to a cry of gladness as I entered, rose, and stretching"
"out her hands in welcome, drew a seat for me close to her.  I looked at"
"her standing before me in her warm, breathing, human loveliness."
"""You are better, Yolande?  Ah! how glad I am!""  I commenced.  ""Last"
"night I believed that you were dead."""
"""And if I had died would it really have mattered so very much to you?"""
revolver rang out at precisely the same moment. There was a yell of
"fury, followed by a crash. Then almost oppressive silence."
"Bob was on his feet like a cat, fingers gripping the automatic he had"
"snatched from the owner’s nerveless hand. His jaw was hard, and there"
was a glint of more than anger in the eyes he bent upon Joyce’s
supporters hurrying up to the aid of their chief.
"“Hands up!” he cried out harshly, “Quick!”"
"He did not have to speak twice. There was something in his voice,"
"coupled with an emphatic gesture with the automatic, which made those"
"six men, big and powerful as they were, obey him with remarkable"
unanimity.
"“Take their guns, Jack,” continued Bainbridge, in that same commanding"
voice.
"Peters stepped forward to obey. The first man drew back instinctively,"
and started to pull down the hand which held a revolver. Without an
instant’s hesitation Bob fired. The bullet struck the upraised weapon on
"its blued-steel barrel, wringing a cry of surprise and pain from the"
fellow’s lips as he dropped the gun.
"There was no more trouble after that, Peters collected four revolvers"
and two Remingtons. Then he glanced questioningly at Bainbridge.
"“Throw ’em in the river,” the latter commander curtly. “’Way out in the"
"middle, where they can’t be recovered.”"
"The riverman walked a few steps toward the bank; then, pausing, he"
glanced back at the straight young figure standing behind him.

THE END.
half a score of games were in progress at different points of the
quarry-like cauldron which formed the outlaws' rendezvous.
At once the humour of the child changed.
"""They obeyed you,"" she said; ""I like you for that. I mean to have many"
men obey me when I grow up. Then I will kill many--thousands and
"thousands. Now I can do nothing--only I have it in my head--here!"""
The elf tapped her forehead immediately underneath the red sash which
"was tied about it. The Sergeant, though eager to hear her story and"
"marvelling at such sentiments from the lips of a child, successfully"
"concealed his curiosity, and said gently, ""Tell me how you came to think"
"of to-night----"""
"""Of what to-night?"" asked the girl quickly and suspiciously."
"""The deed which is to be done to-night,"" replied the Sergeant simply, as"
though he were acquainted with the whole.
She leaped forward and caught him by the arm.
"""You will stay and go with us? You will lead us?"" she hissed, her blue"
"eyes aflame and with trembling accents, ""then indeed will I be sure of"
my revenge. Then the Italian woman and her devil's brat shall not
"escape. Then I shall be sure--sure!"""
"She repeated the last words with concentrated fury, apparently"
impossible to one of her age. The Sergeant smoked quietly and observed
her. She seemed absolutely transfigured.
"""Tell me that you will,"" she cried, low and fierce, so that her voice"
"'I do not know,' my lady answered, and told him shortly of our flight,"
and how we had lain two days and a night in the osier-bed.
"'It was a good thought,' he said. 'But I fear that you are half"
"famished.' And he called for food and wine, and served my lady with"
"his own hands, while he saw that we did not go without. 'Campaigner's"
"fare,' he said. 'But you come of a fighting stock, Countess, and can"
put up with it.'
"'Shame on me if I could not,' she answered."
"There was a quaver in her voice, which showed how the rencontre moved"
"her, how full her heart was of unspoken gratitude."
"'When you have finished, we will get to horse,' he said. 'I must take"
"you with me to Nuremberg, for I am not strong enough to detach a"
"party. But this evening we will make a long halt at Hesel, and secure"
you a good night's rest.'
"'I am sorry to be so burdensome,' my lady said timidly."
"He shrugged his shoulders without compliment, but I did not hear what"
he answered. For I could bear no more. Marie seemed so forgotten in
"this crowd, so much a thing of the past, that my gorge rose. No word"
"of her, no thought of her, no talk of a search party! I pictured her"
"forlorn, helpless little figure, her pale, uncomplaining face--I and"
no one else; and I had to go away into the bushes to hide myself. She
"was forgotten already. She had done all for them, I said to myself,"
and they forgot her.
"Then, in the thicket screened from the party, I had a thought--to go"
"back and look for her, myself. Now my lady was safe, there was nothing"
"_never_ find my way back to mamma. Goodby, Miss Romley."""
"Behind Pola's back Mr. Dugald cast such a despairing, apologetic and"
altogether furious look toward Sidney as to make Sidney suddenly laugh.
And with her laugh all her sense of dismay and humiliation vanished.
She forgot her red hands and the big gingham apron and the dishes
spread about her in her amusement over Pola's pathetic attempt to be
very grown-up and sophisticated. And _so_ ill-bred! How ashamed Mr.
Dugald had been of her!
Then a thought struck Sidney with such force that she sat down in the
"nearest chair. Why, if Mr. Dugald was Pola's own cousin, belonged to"
"the grandeur that was Pola's, he would _never_ be attracted by poor,"
plain Trude. Her beautiful hopes were shattered! She felt distinctly
aggrieved.
"However, there was Vick. Sidney hated to give Mr. Dugald to Vick, who"
"always got everything, yet it seemed the only thing to do if any of the"
"sisters were to have him. Almost sadly she went to her room, opened her"
"satchel and took from it a small framed photograph of Victoria, a"
"photograph which, while it did not flatter Victoria, paid full justice"
"to her enticing beauty. Considering it, Sidney reflected on how lucky"
it was that at the last moment she had put the pictures of her sisters
into her baggage. Then she carried it to the kitchen and stood it on
the narrow mantel next to the clock where Mr. Dugald's eyes must surely
find it. Unlike the snapshot of Trude the picture remained there
undisturbed.
CHAPTER XVII
"back and clicked his teeth at the ceiling. ""Think we'd have nested out"
"nicely."""
"I hitched myself up to him and we sat on the bunk, glooming away at"
each other. Then we heard the tramp of feet in the crossway.
Butt swung down and headed for the control compartment in the
nose of the lifeboat. He had his blaster out and was cursing very
"interestingly. I started after him, but he picked me up by the seat"
of my jumper and tossed me toward the door. The Captain came in and
tripped over me.
I got all tangled up in his gold braid and million-mile space buttons.
"When we finally got to our feet and sorted out right, he was breathing"
"very hard. The Captain was a round little man with a plump, golden face"
"and a very scared look on it. He _humphed_ at me, just the way Sis"
"does, and lifted me by the scruff of my neck. The Chief Mate picked me"
up and passed me to the Second Assistant Engineer.
"Sis was there, being held by the purser on one side and the Chief"
"Computer's Mate on the other. Behind them, I could see a flock of"
wide-eyed female passengers.
"""You cowards!"" Sis was raging. ""Letting your Captain face a dangerous"
"outlaw all by himself!"""
"""I dunno, Miss Sparling,"" the Computer's Mate said, scratching the"
"miniature slide-rule insignia on his visor with his free hand. ""The Old"
"Man would've been willing to let it go with a log entry, figuring the"
spaceport paddlefeet could pry out the stowaway when we landed. But you
"had to quote the Mother Anita Law at him, and he's in there doing his"
"duty. He figures the rest of us are family men, too, and there's no"
"George would not have sailed without notifying us."""
"""He may have feared to betray himself by writing,"" she suggested, ""since"
"King Charles had asked King Louis to detain him."""
"""That is true,"" I returned. ""But the occasion must have been urgent"
"indeed if he could not have sent us word in some manner."""
"But I could find no comfort for her, for I really believed that George"
"had gone to Canada, and there was a certain relief to me in knowing that"
he had passed out of Frances's life.
After along silence this feeling of relief found unintentional expression
when I said:--
"""Time heals all wounds, Frances. One of these days you will find a man"
"who will make amends for your present loss, and then--"""
"""No, no, Baron Ned. Your words are spoken in kindness, but what you"
suggest is impossible. Perhaps if there had been fewer obstacles between
"us, or if I had not misjudged him so cruelly, I might have found my heart"
"more obedient to my will."""
The only comfort I could give my beautiful cousin was that a letter would
"soon come explaining everything. In default of a letter, I promised to go"
"to Paris and learn the truth from George's friends, if possible."
"Frances did not go back to Whitehall that day, but remained at home,"
pretending to be ill of an ague.
"At the end of a week, Frances not having returned to Whitehall, Sir"
"Richard was honored by a visit from no less a person than the king,"
with more flowers.
'Ha!' I said foolishly. 'What is it?'
"'My lady sent me to you,' she answered."
"'Yes,' I asked eagerly. 'Does she want me?'"
"But Marie hung her head, and played with the flowers. 'I don't think"
"so,' she whispered. 'She only sent me to you.'"
Then I understood. The Waldgrave had gone to the farther end. Steve
and the men were tending the horses half a dozen paces beyond the
"screen of willow-leaves. We were alone. A rat plashed into the water,"
"and drove Marie nearer to me; and she laid her head on my shoulder,"
"and I whispered in her ear, till the lashes sank down over her eyes"
"and her lips trembled. If I had loved her from the first, what was the"
"length and height and breadth of my love now, when I had seen her in"
"darkness and peril, sunshine and storm, strong when others failed,"
"brave when others flinched, always helpful, ready, tireless! And she"
"so small! So frail, I almost feared to press her to me; so pale, the"
blood that leapt to her cheeks at my touch seemed a mere reflection of
the sunlight.
I told her how Steve had made the guards at the prison drunk with wine
bought with her dowry; how the horses he had purchased and taken out
of the camp by twos and threes had been paid for from the same source;
"and how many ducats had gone for meats and messes to keep the life,"
"that still ran sluggishly, in the Waldgrave's veins. She listened and"
lay still.
"'So you have no dowry now, little one,' I said, when I had told her"
"suppose both of you will have to one of these days, when you get older;"
but I don't like to think of it.”
"“I don't believe I shall ever marry, Stellamaris,” said Herold."
“Why?”
Herold looked out to sea for a wistful instant. “Because one can't marry
"a dream, my dear.”"
"“I've married hundreds,” said Stella, softly."
"If they had been alone together, they would have talked dreams and"
"visions and starshine and moonshine, and their conversation would"
have been about as sensible and as satisfactory to each other and as
intelligible to a third party as that of a couple of elves sitting on
adjacent toadstools; but elves don't talk in the presence of a third
"party, even though he be John Risca and Great High Belovedest. And"
"Stellamaris, recognizing this instinctively, turned her eyes quickly to"
Risca.
"“And you, dear--will you ever marry?”"
"“Never, by Heaven!” cried John, with startling fervency."
Stella reached out both her hands to the two men who incorporated the
"all in all of her little life, and each man took a hand and kissed it."
"“I don't want to be horrid and selfish,” she said; “but if I lost either"
"of you, I think it would break my heart.”"
The men exchanged glances. John repeated his query: “Do you think it's
The grim smile on the countenance of old Pépe of the Eleven Wounds grew
yet more grim.
"""No gipsy planned it and no man!"" he said sententiously. ""Come hither,"
"Chica!"""
And out from among the listening throng came a girl of thirteen or
"fourteen, dressed neatly and simply in a grey linen blouse belted at the"
"waist with a leather belt. A gay plaid, striped of orange and crimson,"
"hung neatly folded over her shoulder, and she rested her small sunburnt"
hand on the silver hilt of a pistol. Black elf-locks escaped from
beneath a red silk kerchief knotted saucily after the fashion of her
"companions. But her eyes, instead of being beady and black with that"
"far-away contemplative look which characterises the children of Egypt,"
were bright and sunny and blue as the Mediterranean itself in the front
of spring.
"""Come hither, Chica--be not afraid,"" repeated old Pépe of the Eleven"
"Wounds, ""this is a great man--the greatest of all our race. You have"
"heard of him--as who, indeed, has not!"""
Chica nodded with a quick elfish grin of intense pleasure and
"appreciation. ""I was listening,"" she said, ""I heard all. And I"
"saw--would that I could see it again. Oh, if only the like would happen"
"to me!"""
"""Tell the noble Don José who you are, my pretty Chica,"" said Pépe,"
soothingly.
But the child stamped her sandalled foot. It was still white at the
"instep, and the sergeant could see by the blue veins that she had not"
"""Yes.  Have you brought the hydrated peroxide of iron?"""
"For answer the Frenchman produced the tiny tube, saying:"
"""Then you suspect poison?"""
"""Most certainly,"" he replied; and, taking a glass, he placed a single"
"pillule in it, dissolving it in water, which he afterwards forced"
between the grey lips of my unconscious love.  Afterwards he glanced at
"his watch, observing: ""We must give another in fifteen minutes."""
"Then, drawing a chair to the bedside, he seated himself, holding her"
wrist and watching her countenance for any change that might take place
there.
"""Have you no idea of the nature of the poison?""  I inquired eagerly."
"""None,"" he responded.  ""Ask me no questions now.  When we have brought"
her round will be time enough.  It should be sufficient for you to know
that she is not dead.  Why not leave us for the present?  Go and break
"the good news to the Countess."""
"""You wish to be alone?"""
"""Yes.  This is a serious matter.  Leave us undisturbed, and on no"
"pretext allow her mother to enter here."""
"Thus urged, and feeling reassured by their statement that she still"
lived and that the pulsations of her heart were already quite
"perceptible, I left the room, noiselessly closing the door after me, and"
sought the Countess in the small blue boudoir to which she had returned
plunged in grief and dark despair.

"“Yes, all right: you take one point of view and he takes another. I"
understand why Ruskin wouldn’t please you. What I do not understand is
why you find it absurd that if a person has a desire to penetrate into
"the beauties of a symphony or a picture, he should do so. What is there"
strange in that?”
"“You are right,” said Cæsar; “whoever wants to learn, should. I have"
done so about financial questions.”
“Is it true that your brother knows all about questions of money?”
Kennedy asked Laura.
“He says so.”
“I haven’t much belief in his financial knowledge.”
“No?”
"“No, I have not. You are a sort of dilettante, half nihilist, half"
"financier. You would like to pass for a tranquil, well-balanced man, for"
"what is called a philistine, but you cannot compass it.”"
"“I will compass it. It is true that I want to be a philistine, but a"
philistine out in the real world. All those great artists you people
"admire, Goethe, Ruskin, were really philistines, who were in the"
business of being interested in poetry and statues and pictures.”

"Two centuries later, the Brethren, known now as the Moravians, settled"

an adherent to their faith.

6. Hymns of the Reformation: the German Chorales.
"The movement toward congregational singing, inaugurated by the Bohemian"
"Brethren, was soon to be merged into the greater Reformation movement."
Luther’s influence on the worship and music of the church was
revolutionary. For a thousand years the laymen had had no part in church
song. Congregational singing was unknown. Ambrosian music had at first
been introduced for congregational use but it became more and more
"liturgical, thrusting the laity into the background. The Gregorian Chant"
which followed was never intended for use except by the priests and
trained choirs. The followers of Hus pioneered in congregational
singing; but it was Luther and his followers who brought it into full
fruition.
Pola ate with nervous greed. Sidney bit off a piece but found it dry in
her mouth. She was thinking of her sisters and the safety of the dear
old house; as vividly as though it hung in a picture before her eyes
"she saw the little circle around the dining room table, the embroidered"
"square of Indian cloth, the green shaded lamp, Issy's books and Trude's"
"sewing, Vick's sketching things, the girls at their beloved tasks--and"
"her chair empty! Oh, what if she never sat again in that dear circle?"
Her heart broke in an agony of longing for Trude.
A sudden thought roused Pola to a feeble show of spirit.
"""If I had known how to swim we'd all be ashore now! And you two stayed"
"with me! I--I don't believe I'm worth that, girls."" She spoke with"
gloomy conviction.
But Mart answered with a promptness that settled that question forever.
"""Forget it. Why, you don't think we could a' done anything else, do"
you? And now I'm going up on deck and get some air. We must be most to
"Halifax by this time."""
"""_Halifax!_"" But this time Pola did not scream."
*       *       *       *       *
"Lavender, after his first plunge, had struck out toward the lighthouse."
His Mr. Dugald had taught him the science of swimming and because it
"was the one thing he could do easily and well, in spite of his"
"misshaped body, Lavender had taken pride in perfecting the practice."
"His assurance helped him now; he had no fear, he knew how to save his"
"strength; he swam first with one stroke, then with another, always"
keeping in sight the beacon of light.
"No one spoke, and I looked from one to another. The men had returned"
"from the search, and stood in a dark group round the body, which they"
"had drawn to the side of the road. It wanted an hour of daylight yet,"
"and I could not see their faces, but I read in their silence the"
answer that no one liked to put into words.
"'Be a man!' Steve muttered, after a long pause. 'God help the girl."
But God help us too if we are found here!'
"Still my lady did not speak, and I knew her brave heart too well to"
"doubt her, though she had been the first to talk of going. 'Get to"
"horse,' I said roughly."
"'No, no,' my lady cried at last. 'We will all stay, Martin.'"
"'Ay, all stay or all go!' Steve muttered."
"'Then all go!' I said, choking down the sobs that would rise. And I"
turned first from the place.
I will not try to state what that cost me. I saw my girl's face
"everywhere--everywhere in the darkness, and the eyes reproached me."
"That she of all should suffer, who had never fainted, never faltered,"
whose patience and courage had been the women's stay from the
"first--that she should suffer! I thought of the tender, weak body, and"
"of all the things that might happen to her, and I seemed, as I went"
"away from her, the vilest thing that lived."
But reason was against me. If I stayed there and waited on the road
"by the old crone's body until morning, what could I do? Whither could"
I turn? Marie was gone and already might be half a dozen miles away.
"So the bonds of custom and duty held me. Dazed and bewildered, I"

CONCLUSION
This is the end of my book. I have tried always as I wrote to remember
the principles that I laid down for myself in the first chapter. Whether
"I have always done so I cannot say. It is so difficult, so very"
"difficult, to understand a people--any people--to separate their beliefs"
"from their assents, to discover the motives of their deeds, that I fear"
I must often have failed.
My book is short. It would have been easy to make a book out of each
"chapter, to write volumes on each great subject that I have touched on;"
but I have not done so--I have always been as brief as I could.
"I have tried always to illustrate only the central thought, and not the"
"innumerable divergencies, because only so can a great or strange thought"
"be made clear. Later, when the thought is known, then it is easy to"
"stray into the byways of thought, always remembering that they are"
"byways, wandering from a great centre."
CHAPTER XIV
"""SALLIE HARRIS"""
Sallie's first startled impulse was to deny the new identity Slyne had
so glibly bestowed on her. It seemed too preposterous to be believable;
"and she was very suspicious of him. A little flushed, more than a little"
"afraid, and yet in some sense convinced in spite of herself by the"
outward and visible signs about her that all these strange happenings
"must have at least some foundation of fact, she sought to read the"
others' thoughts in their faces.
"The Marquis of Ingoldsby was gaping at her, in open wonder and"
"admiration. Slyne's features wore a subdued expression of triumph, and"
"Captain Dove's a dazed, incredulous frown. Mr. Jobling was beaming about"
"him, so apparently satisfied with her, so respectably prosperous-looking"
himself that her doubts as to Slyne's good faith began to give way. When
the lawyer was in turn presented to her and also addressed her by that
"new name, she could scarcely disclaim it."
"""You'll stay and have luncheon with us, Lord Ingoldsby?"" Slyne remarked,"
touching the bell; and his lordship left off gaping at Sallie to look
him over with all the solemn sagacity of a young owl in broad daylight.
"""Er--all right,"" his lordship at length agreed. ""Don't mind if I do."
"""Though I have some--er--friends waitin' for me,"" he added as an"
A Dominican.
"Commanded in 1831 a small gaff-topsail schooner, the _General Morazan_,"
armed with a brass eight-pounder and carrying a mixed crew of forty-four
"men, French, Italian, English, and Creoles of St. Domingo."
"VANCLEIN, CAPTAIN MOSES. Dutch filibuster."
Was serving with L'Ollonais's fleet off the coast of Yucatan when a mutiny
"broke out, of which Vanclein was the ringleader. He persuaded the"
malcontents to sail with him along the coast till they came to Costa Rica.
"There they landed and marched to the town of Veraguas, which they seized"
"and pillaged. The pirates got little booty, only eight pounds of gold, it"
proving to be a poor place.
"VANE, CAPTAIN CHARLES."
"Famous for his piratical activities off the coast of North America,"
specially the Carolinas.
"In 1718, when Woodes Rogers was sent by the English Government to break up"
"the pirate stronghold in the Bahama Islands, all the pirates at New"
Providence Island surrendered to Rogers and received the King's pardon
"except Vane, who, after setting fire to a prize he had, slipped out of the"
bay as Rogers with his two men-of-war entered. Vane sailed to the coast of
"Carolina, as did other West Indian pirates who found their old haunts too"
warm for them.
Vane is first heard of as being actively engaged in stealing from the
Spaniards the silver which they were salving from a wrecked galleon in the
"Perhaps she had spoiled everything. Pola would come back, of course,"
"but, somehow, Pola's glamour had faded. After all, what, besides tons"
"of candy and quarts of sweet mixtures and much glitter, had there been"
to it? The sweets and the glitter and Pola's endless confidences of
"""men"" had left Sidney jaded and bored, though she did not know it; she"
did know that she was suddenly lonely for Mart and Lav and the
stimulating pastimes they seemed to find always right at hand.
"As she approached Rockman's, wandering there from force of habit, she"
"saw Lav pushing off in a dory. She ran down the wharf, hailing him."
"""Oh, Lav, take me with you!"" she pleaded, breathlessly."
He hesitated a moment before he swung the dory back to the wharf.
Something of the look Mart had given her flashed into his eyes.
"Then: ""Come on if y'want to,"" he answered ungraciously."
As she sat down in the bow of the boat Sidney wanted to cry more than
"anything else, but Lav's dark face suddenly reminded her of what Aunt"
Achsa had told her. Perhaps he had been out in the sand dunes last
"night, lying on his face, sobbing aloud! She began chattering with"
resolute cheerfulness.
"""Isn't it hot this morning, Lav? Where are you going?"" Lav answered"
shortly that he was going out to the _Arabella_. Sidney noticed a book
"in his pocket, but said nothing. She ventured other remarks concerning"
"the activities in the bay to which Lavender answered in monosyllables,"
if at all.
"""Oh, look, the _Puritan's_ in, Lav!"" And even to this Lavender only"
"machinery in it, and to it go connecting beams from all the square"
"metal plates everywhere. That is all I know."""
"Brand started to question her further, but her time was up. The two"
guards poked their loathsome pumpkin heads in the doorway and
"contemptuously beckoned her out. She answered resignedly, in the"
"piping Rogan tongue, and went with them. But she turned to wave shyly,"
commiseratingly at the two men; and the expression in her clear blue
eyes as they rested on Brand made his heart contract and then leap on
with a mighty bound.
"""We have in ally in her,"" murmured Brand. ""Though God only knows if"
"that will mean anything to us...."""
CHAPTER IV
_In the Tower_
"""What I can't figure out,"" said Dex, striding up and down the big bare"
"room, ""is why we're needed to tell them about the atomic motor."
"They've got our ship, and three others besides. I should think they"
"could learn about the motor just by taking it apart and studying it."""
"Brand grinned mirthlessly, recalling the three years of intensive"
study it had taken him to learn the refinements of atomic motive
"power. ""If you'd ever qualified as a space navigator, Dex, you'd know"
better. The Rogans are an advanced race; their control of polar
magnetism and the marvelously high-powered telescopes Greca mentions
And he went out and banged the door behind him. He walked the streets
furiously angry with Herold. He had gone to consult him on a baffling
problem. Herold had suggested a maiden aunt as a solution. He had but
"one, his mother's sister. Her name was Gladys. What was a woman of over"
fifty doing with such an idiot name? His Aunt Gladys lived at Croydon
and spent her time solving puzzles and following the newspaper accounts
of the doings of the royal family. She knew nothing. He remembered when
he was a boy at school coming home for the holidays cock-a-whoop at
having won the high jump in the school athletics sports. His Aunt
"Gladys, while professing great interest, had said, “But what I don't"
"understand, dear, is--what do you get on to jump down from?” He had"
"smiled and explained, but he had felt cold in the pit of his stomach. A"
futile lady. His opinion of her had not changed. In these days John was
rather an intolerant fellow.
"Chance willed it, however, that when he reached Fenton Square he found"
a letter which began “My dearest John” and ended “Your loving Aunt
Gladys.” And it was the letter of a very sweet-natured gentlewoman.
"John sat down at his desk to work, but ideas would not come. At last"
"he lit his pipe, threw himself into a chair in front of the fire, and"
"smoked till past midnight, with his heavy brows knitted in a tremendous"
frown.
CHAPTER VI
THE same frown darkened Risca's brow the next day as he waited for
admittance at his Aunt Gladys's door. It was such a futile little door
prepared paper flat on the forehead of the dead man.
"When he withdrew it, I could see that it bore marks of the lines on his"
"head. Without a word, Kennedy drew from his pocket a print of the"
photograph of the smudge on Schloss’ door.
"“It is possible,” he said, half to himself, “to identify a person by"
"means of the arrangement of the sweat glands or pores. Poroscopy, Dr."
"Edmond Locard, director of the Police Laboratory at Lyons, calls it."
"The shape, arrangement, number per square centimeter, all vary in"
"different individuals. Besides, here we have added the lines of the"
forehead.”
He was studying the two impressions intensely. When he looked up from
"his examination, his face wore a peculiar expression."
“This is not the head which was placed so close to the glass of the
"door of Schloss’ office, peering through, on the night of the robbery,"
in order to see before picking the lock whether the office was empty
and everything ready for the hasty attack on the safe.”
"“That disposes of my theory that Schloss robbed himself,” remarked"
"Winters reluctantly. “But the struggle here, the sleeve of the dress,"
the pistol—could he have been shot?”
"“No, I think not,” considered Kennedy. “It looks to me more like a case"
of apoplexy.”
"“What shall we do?” asked Winters. “Far from clearing anything up, this"
complicates it.”
“Where’s Muller?” asked Kennedy. “Does he know? Perhaps he can shed
"found him. He didn't come down in the morning, and, as she couldn't make"
"him hear, she forced the door, and found him with his throat cut."""
"""Awful!"" shuddered Lady Eynesford. ""He looked such a respectable man"
"too."""
"""Ah, I fancy he'd gone a bit to the bad lately--taken to drinking and so"
"on."""
"""He was a friend of Mr. Kilshaw's, wasn't he?"" asked Alicia."
"""A sort of hanger-on, I think. Anyhow, there he was dead, and with his"
"pockets empty."""
"""Perhaps he killed himself,"" she suggested."
"""They think not. They've arrested the woman, but she declares she knows"
"nothing about it!"""
"""Poor man!"" said Alicia; and, at another time, she might have thought a"
good deal about the horrible end of a man whom she had known as an
"acquaintance. But, as it was, she soon forgot him again, and, leaving"
"the rest, returned to her solitary seat."
"In the town, the news of the murder was but one ruffle more on the wave"
"of excitement, and not a very marked one. Few people knew Benham's"
"name, and when the first agitation following on the discovery of the"
"body died away and the onlookers found there was no news to be had, they"
turned away to join the processions or to stare at them. The police were
"left to pursue their investigations in peace, and they soon reached a"
"conclusion. The landlady of the house where Benham died lived alone,"
save for the occasional presence of her son: he was away at work in an
"""Sidney Romley, you're _crazy_!"" cried Aunt Achsa, in a quavering"
"voice. ""Go away! How _can_ he go away when we ain't even the money to"
"go 'sfar as Orleans. And he ain't plannin' to go on anyone's _charity_!"""
"""Oh, I don't mean he's going away _soon_! I shouldn't have told anyway"
for Lav told me as a secret. But I thought maybe it would make you
happier knowing he had great ambitions. And he'll tell you sometime
"himself."""
"When Aunt Achsa spoke it was in a thin, grieved voice."
"""It's what I didn't want him to ever take into his head. Goin' off"
"somewhere--alone. For I'm too old to go with him and he'll need me!"""
"""Oh I wouldn't have told you if I'd thought it would make you unhappy."
"He won't go for a long time, Aunt Achsa. And when he does he'll come"
"back real often."""
Now Aunt Achsa sat so still that Sidney thought she had consoled her.
But Aunt Achsa was facing in her own way this at which Sidney had
"hinted, drawing for it from that courage of hers that had not yet been"
"exhausted. Well, if it was best for Lavender some day to go away she'd"
"send him away with a smile even though the heart that had taken him, a"
"wee baby, from the dying mother did burst with loneliness. Besides,"
even if Lavender went away she could go on praying to the Lord to keep
"him ""happy""--no distance could keep her from doing that!"
"""It's like as not his plans in his head that's makin' him act so quiet"
like and short-spoken. And last night he didn't sleep in his bed at
"all!"""
"""Why, Aunt Achsa, where _was_ he?"" gasped Sidney, really startled."
say that the woman only suffers in such cases; the man never.  Whether
that rule proves always true will be shown in this strange story of my
own love.
"She drew her hand away slowly, but forcibly, saying:"
"""You cannot love two women.  Already you have shown a preference for a"
"wife of your own people."""
"""It is all over between us,"" I protested.  ""Mine was a mere passing"
"fancy, engendered, I think, by the loneliness I suffered when I lost"
"you."""
"""Ah,"" (she smiled sadly), ""that is all very well!  A woman, when once"
"played false by the man she loves and trusts, is never the"
"same--_never_!"""
"""Then am I to understand, Yolande, that you refuse to pardon me, or to"
"accept my affection?"""
"""I have already pardoned you,"" she faltered; ""but to accept the love you"
"once withdrew from me without just reason is, I regret to say,"
"impossible."""
"""You speak coldly, as though you were refusing a mere invitation to"
"dinner, or something of no greater importance,"" I protested.  ""I offer"
"you my whole heart, my love--nay, my life;"" and I held her hand again,"
"looking straight into those wonderful eyes, now so calm, so serious,"
that my gaze wavered before them.
"Slowly she shook her head, and her trembling breast rose and fell again."
me. Will you see that Buster is sent up to my laboratory immediately?”
She nodded. It was evident that Buster was a great pet with her and
that it was with difficulty she kept from smoothing his silky coat.
“You—you won’t hurt Buster?” she pleaded.
"“No. Trust me. More than that, if there is any possible way of"
"untangling this mystery, I shall do it.”"
"Mrs. Blake looked rather than spoke her thanks. As we went downstairs,"
"accompanied by Miss Sears, we could see in the music room a very"
"interesting couple, chatting earnestly over the piano."
"Betty Blake, a slip of a girl in her first season, was dividing her"
attention between her visitor and the door by which we were passing.
"She rose as she heard us, leaving the young man standing alone at the"
piano. He was of an age perhaps a year or two older than Reginald
"Blake. It was evident that, whatever Miss Betty might think, he had"
eyes for no one else but the pretty debutante. He even seemed to be
"regarding Kennedy sullenly, as if he were a possible rival."
"“You—you don’t think it is serious?” whispered Betty in an undertone,"
scarcely waiting to be introduced. She had evidently known of our
"visit, but had been unable to get away to be present upstairs."
"“Really, Miss Blake,” reassured Kennedy, “I can’t say. All I can do is"
to repeat what I have already said to your mother. Keep up a good heart
and trust me to work it out.”
"“Thank you,” she murmured, and then, impulsively extending her small"
And then madness descended upon and occupied James Williams. He pushed
his hat far upon the back of his head.
"“My wife seems to think I am a burglar,” he said, recklessly. “I never"
"heard of her being crazy; therefore I must be. And if I’m crazy, they"
can’t do anything to me for killing you two fools in my madness.”
Whereupon he resisted arrest so cheerfully and industriously that cops
"had to be whistled for, and afterwards the reserves, to disperse a few"
thousand delighted spectators.
At the station-house the desk sergeant asked for his name.
"“McDoodle, the Pink, or Pinky the Brute, I forget which,” was James"
Williams’s answer. “But you can bet I’m a burglar; don’t leave that

especially like to have that in the records.”
"In an hour came Mrs. James Williams, with Uncle Thomas, of Madison"
"Avenue, in a respect-compelling motor car and proofs of the hero’s"
innocence—for all the world like the third act of a drama backed by an
automobile mfg. co.
After the police had sternly reprimanded James Williams for imitating a
copyrighted burglar and given him as honourable a discharge as the
"department was capable of, Mrs. Williams rearrested him and swept him"
into an angle of the station-house. James Williams regarded her with
one eye. He always said that Donovan closed the other while somebody
was holding his good right hand. Never before had he given her a word
of reproach or of reproof.
"on his feet once more, pulling his clothes to rights, we looked at each"
"other. I had no wish to speak to him further, and left him. Besides, he"
was going away soon.
"After this, everything was dull and empty again. I went out alone, aping"
"myself and shouting: ""Bricks for the palace! The calf is much stronger"
"today!"" And when this was done, I did other nothings, and when my money"
"began to run out, I wrote to my publisher, pretending I would soon send"
"him an unbelievably remarkable manuscript. In short, I behaved like a man"
in love. These were the typical symptoms.
And to take the bull by the horns: no doubt you suspect me of dwelling on
the subject of Miss Torsen out of self-interest? In that case I must have
concealed well in these pages that I never think of her except as an
"object, as a theme; turn back the pages and you will see! At my age, one"
"does not fall in love without becoming grotesque, without making even the"
Pharaohs laugh.
*       *       *       *       *
_Finis._
"But there is one thing I cannot finish doing, and that is withdrawing to"
"my room, and sitting alone with the good darkness round me. This, after"
"all, is the last pleasure."
An interlude:
Miss Torsen and her actor are walking this way; I hear their footsteps and
"their voices; but since I am sitting in the dark of the evening, I cannot"
"see them. They stop outside my open window, leaning against it, and the"
"actor says something, asks her to do something she does not want to do,"
Is he in an athletic tank?
"""An athletic tank""?"
Yeah.
"I believe that's the nice way of saying ""wifebeater."""
"That's the new way of saying the ""W. B.""?"
Yeah.
Okay.
"Where I'm from, they call them wifebeaters because everyone on ""cops"" was wearing those."
"That's... by the way, everyone calls them wifebeaters."
Okay.
What's the new thing...
"""Athletic tank""?"
"""Athletic tank"" is what it says on the package."

"So, if a guy had, let's say, a classic land cruiser, what would you think?"
I love that car.

Yes.
I had one.

We trusted him with our children.
"Yeah, so did I, and he's got a very gentle hand."
Don't use us as propaganda!
What are you guys doing over there?

"Well, I could ask you the same question."
"Yeah, well, I'm here with the make-a-wish clowns."
We're visiting the children's ward.
Who are you with?
I'm freelancing.
"Can I speak to you outside for a moment, please?"
Sure.
"All right, man, can we stop this?"
We have hit rock bottom.
I'll admit it.
I have felt better about myself.
"Now, let's just put this competition aside."

it's a really important decision.
Take it back!
"Take it back, unni!"
Da Hye!
"If you guys are busy and can't come, I can send you guys my bank account number."
You can put the wedding money in there!
"Be happy, Eun Ah."

What did I tell you?
"You don't buy anything, you hear me?"
You don't buy anything!

"Listen, I need the money."
"I'm leaving, after all."

"But you saw aunt go upstairs, I didn't."

I have something important to discuss with you.
About the rent?
Forget the rent!

Sure.
But I have a condition.
You must do something for me.
What is it?
You know I've been alone since my wife died 20 years ago.
I've never missed female company earlier...
I've heard that one before!
Damn these rickshaw-drivers!

Barry was on every anxiety drug and antidepressant known to man.

His parents had split up.
He just wanted out.
"It's tragic, but it's not your fault."

"-No, you have to--"

"Oh, there we go."
I've smashed it.
Liam's nearly clocked it in about five minutes.

"Oh, thanks, lads."
Yeah.

You're not doing a tepee fire?
"Listen, forget what they taught you in Scouts."
So I've also prepared a rundown...

So you two were in the room then?
Were you sleeping together?
- Did he tell you he slept with me?
"- No, I'm just asking."
What did you do then?
I don't talk about that kind of stuff.
I see.
But how did you get out when I was outside the door?
Ask him yourself.
Did you two by any chance walk over me?
We came out anyway.
So you walked over me?
Why is that so important?
We got out and that's it.
"You're mean, Sunhee."

Dinner.
It's a Greek restaurant.
You'll love it there.
But...
Can you wait for me at that cafe on the corner when you finish work?
I have to go home now.
"Of course, don't worry."
Are you alright?
I'm fine.
I'm only a bit drunk.
Are you alright?
You were so drunk.
Did I...?
Why don't you take a shower to freshen up?
Where is it?
"Come over here, princess?"
Cut the nonsense.
Who was the man in the hat?
- I don't know who you mean.
- Where's Quini?
- I don't know.
- You're sick and he hasn't come to visit?
- I didn't tell him.
Why don't you call him?
- Mom!
"- Marina, look at me."
- Does your mom know what you do at the lodge?
- Mom!
- Tell us who the man is or we'll tell her.
- Mom!
- What is it?
- I don't feel well.
- My stomach hurts.
I'm going to throw up.
"- Honey, what's wrong?"
"Don't worry, ma'am."
We were just leaving.
- Thanks for the coffee.
- You're welcome.
Marina?
- What are you doing?
- Did you believe a word she said?
Me neither.
She's scared and I'm going to find out why.
"There are five bedrooms, each with several beds."
I have extra beds if there are more of you.
There's room outside for the dogs.
"There's water, electricity..."
is there somebody else I can talk to ?
"[Continues, indistinct]"
Wench. I gotta stand over her... to make sure she puts your name on the damn list.
Triflin' bitch.
Okay.
Ooo-kay.
Yeah.
Da da da da da da da da.
- l'll get that.
- [ Baby Gurgling ]
Da da !
I know. I know.
I know. I know.
"So, your dad's trippin' about the flight."
-Yeah.
-Probably thinks it's Derek's fault.
"No, I explained about Nikki."
"So, you put it all on her."
None of it's on you.
She started it.
I told you what she said.
"Maybe she didn't have no business getting up in your face, but she had reason to say what she said."
Wait a minute.
You agree with her ?
You and Derek act like it don't bother people to see you together.
Like it don't hurt people to see.
"Well, we like each other."
What is the big damn deal ?
"It's me and him, not us and other people."
"Black people, Sara."
Black women.
Derek's about something.
I mean which is understandable under the circumstances.
What about the other girls?
I guess it slipped their mind.
Jill's all wrapped up in her wedding.
"And you know, Becca just got that huge movie, so... it's ok."
"Happy birthday, Dale."
Hi.
I have a reservation under um Squire or Hallie.
Thanks.
Surprise!
You didn't think we were gonna forget did you?
I kind of did.
Happy birthday!
Happy birthday!
"All right, guys."
Let's dance!
Whoo!
"Make a wish, but don't tell anyone or it won't come true."
Ok.
What could I possibly wish for?
Ok.
Whoo!
Happy birthday.
"Thanks, you guys."
"You're drunk, Jill."
You never cared before when I was drunk.
And it's Dale's birthday for Christ's sakes.
"All right, you have got to lower your voice now."
Because now you're making a scene.
"You bet your last, Drew."
Because it's nothing they've never heard before.
"You are so... self centered, Drew."
Good!
Yan.
"Yes, Send this picture to Ho Sai at once."
I want him to meet Foon in court.
"Master, why do you draw such pervertible picture?"
Do you feel happy?
"Brother Lone, we all count on you."
Please go ahead.
The witness must be bribed or threatened.
An eye for an eye!
I want to threaten them too.
Please find them out.
"And then torture them, make them confess."
Good idea.
How can you figure this idea out?
I...
I use my brain.
Don't worry.
Count on me.
"It's alright, count on me."
"Don't worry, count on me."
Brother Lone doesn't seems to be alright
"Your Honour, I would like to summon a new witness."
What big deal?
Your old man!
"Objection, how dare he scold my old man?"
"Come on, don't always object, can you listen his words first?"
Summon Sir Ho Sai.
I mean your dad!
This is my master.
Chan Mon-gut.
"Sir, thank you for your help."
Did you know everybody at this school?
"Got to watch where you're going, man."
"Leave him alone, Dirk."
"You never learn, do you, midget?"
"Get to the bus, Barry."
What's the matter?
You scared?
Don't worry.
I'll go easy on you this time.
"Come on, Lose-Chester."
Let's see what you got.
"Come on, freak!"
Freak!
You're not tough.
You're just a jerk.
"""Dirk the jerk."""
"""Dirk the jerk."" Yeah, that's pretty good."
Dirk the jerk.
"So, you were friends with Dirk?"
"Yes, sir, in high school."
I don't recall Dirk having many friends at Truman.
"Here, sit."
Sit down.
"When did, uh -- when did Dirk pass?"
He was 18.
What happened to him?
"Well, there was, first, drinking, then drugs, and then too many drugs."
And then he just slipped through my fingers.
It was my fault.
"I should have seen it coming, you know?"
"Dirk, he, uh -- well, he had his troubles."
What kind of troubles?
"Your serum doesn't work, father."
It never has.
That's impossible.
It's been two years since you... since the last time.
That wasn't your fault.
It was my idea.
I needed time to perfect the forumla.
But it wasn't working.
The hunger just got worse.
What did you do?
I'm sorry father.
No.
"No, that was the other one."
It was both of us.
I sensed him out there.
I knew when he was feeding and I would go out at the same time.
"No, it can't be."
Ellia!
Stay away!
What is it?
What's happening?
Let me help you.
Sheppard.
This is where he's been making camp.
He was here less than an hour ago.
You hear anything?
No.
Me either.
Easy now.
"You just went to all that trouble to save my life, it would be a shame to kill me."
"Are you alright, Rodney?"
"Yeah, I'm just peachy now."
"Clearly, I"
Will go sailing
No more
Mom!
"Mom, have you seen my Sally doll?"
"What, dear?"
What was that?
Never mind!
"Buzz, the coast is clear."
"Buzz, where are you?"
There's a secret mission in uncharted space.
Let's go.
Really?
That is so interesting.
"Would you like some tea, Mrs Nesbitt?"
Buzz!
- [Piano]
- Notthat.
[Stops]
Buddy?
I have always stood by you.
I campaigned foryou when I was pregnant.
"During Checkers, when Ike wanted you out, I told you to fight."
"This is different, Dick."
You've changed.
"You've grown more bitter, like you're atwarwith the world."
You weren'tthatway before.
"I'm 50 years old now, Dick."
Howmany millions of miles have I traveled?
Howmany millions of peoples' hands have I shaked that ljust don't like?
Howmany thank-you notes have I written?
"It's as if I, I don't know, justwentto sleep a long time ago... and missed the years between."
You shouldn't play with people's feelings.
Is that real what you do on the phone?
Isn't it just another game?
"We're just mammals, too."
Sure...
It's good exercise and it pays well.
Do you think we could live like this on a nurse's salary?
"Phone sex is hygienic, impersonal and funny."
There's food in the kitchen.
Hello?
I love your voice.
What's your name?
Jes...
Mr. Yes.
- You'll never be lonely again.
Lusty Terhi will help you.
What's wrong?
"Fine, Mr. Yes."
You want to listen?
You're on top of me.
I can feel something hard against my stomach.
Kiss me all over...
I'm taking your ah...
Isn't this great?
"Are you still there, Mr. Yes?"
"I'd like to - love, for real."
Me too.
Time to go home.
Tired?
"No, this is fun."
You're a strange Finn.
They're usually as lazy as monkeys.
"Okay, guys, come on."
"Let's go, seriously."
We can do that later.
- You okay?
-Yeah.
(PANTING)
"Thank you, Peter."
"Yeah, whatever."
"Now we're even, stiff."
All right.
"Come on, let's go."
Before Jeanine realizes you're still alive.
"- No, no, no."
-What?
The box.
We have to get the box.
"What, are you kidding me?"
"Now's not the time for a souvenir, Tris."
"Four, you have to listen to me."
It's not what Jeanine thinks it is.
I know it's not.
My mother would have destroyed it.
We have to get it.
"Peter, is there another way into the lab?"
"I mean, I'd have to go into the control room to disable all the doors."
"Okay, good, then do that."
Okay.
Right now?
Yeah.
"You just chose our side, whether you meant to or not."
"If you wanna survive, make sure we do."
Let's go.
"Bitey-bitey, eyes shut tighty!"
Oh.
"Hi, Dad."
"Don't you 'hi, Dad' me, you little prick."
What did I say?
What's the one thing I told you to do?
Floss?
Keep your nut down!
I did!
"So why, for Sphinx's sakes, is there not one, but two protests going on outside that door?"
"The Professor did that, not me."
"Well, hang on..."
And why are you chucking apples at some geezer strapped to a column?
Aurelius.
"Great to meet you, sir."
Love the beard.
It's jugball.
It's...
"He invented it, it was all him."
"Finally, he admits it!"
I couldn't give a pharaoh's fat one.
I've only come here cos I've been contacted by the bloody Emporium.
"You've spent 15,420 dinaris, and mostly on caviar."
"That wasn't me, I promise."
Right.
"Tutankhamen, give me the bleeding card back."
I don't know where it is.
I haven't seen it since I gave it to...
"Oh, brilliant."
"Have you got my card, boy?"
"Mm, yeah."
"Give it back, then, fuck face."
- Yeah?
- What do you call this then?
- Interesting!
- Wow.
Who's that from?
- Hannah Fields in the year below.
Sniff it to see if she rubbed her fanny on it.
Neil!
"Na, just a bit of perfume."
So what are you going to do about it?
Nothing.
Apart from making sure Carli doesn't find out.
I think she'll be too busy sucking on her boyfriend's knob.
- Shut up.
- What?
"All I'm saying is, he'll have his cock right deep in her gob and then in her vag."
"Out the vag, back in the gob."
Thanks!
"Oh, yeah, that reminds me."
Give that to your mum for us.
Are you serious?
"- Oh, you are."
- Don't tell her who it's from.
"No, course not."
"Anything else, Neil?"
- Would you like me to ask her out?
- Would you?
Let me think.
Would I?
No.
"No, I fucking wouldn't."
Good morning.
What did you take?
What did you take?
No.
Aah!
No!
"How are your wrists, hon?"
I'm sorry they restrained you.
Lucy.
You've had another schizophrenic episode.
But we're gonna work on making you well.
"Lucy, why don't you introduce yourself to the group?"
"Hi, I'm Lucy."
I...
Obviously.
I go to law school.
- I went to law school.
- She's a schizo.
I saw them bring her in all strapped down and screaming.
Great.
"What'd you do, bite a cop?"
Bruce.
Okay.
"As if our party wasn't full enough with Chuckles, Forgetful, and Her Majesty here, now we add Schizo to the mix."
"Well, this isn't Club Med, so I doubt you're here for a tan."
"No, I, uh..."
I tried to:
Because I went off my meds.
Me too.
"Lucy, what do you think led you to make that decision?"
Um...
I wanted to prove to you that you were wrong.
Wrong about what?
Says he picked up his personal effects.
What about the super saying they fought?
-We're gonna work on that in a minute.
"-John, this guy gets zero rhythm."
Zero.
"Razor, shirts, couple of pictures."
"Which would kind of be what I told you, right?"
-You were only there once?
-Right.
-Super says you were there twice.
-Let's break that down.
Super says I was there twice.
He's a liar.
Says he heard fighting.
Maybe he did.
She had scumbag friends...
-... that'swhysheworkedforus.
-We're getting different stories.
You say you were not there before you went to pick up your stuff?
"-Correct, for the second time."
-You altered a crime scene.
You admit lying about it.
"Hey, John, don't talk to me like some street skell here."
"You guys want to screw me for this, you go ahead."
I'm done talking to you.
-Yeah?
MEDAVOY:
Mrs. Fuentes?
-Yes.
-Detective Medavoy.
Detective Martinez.
-Your husband spoke to Detective Kelly?
What do we think?
Uncool!
It's not uncool!
Who said uncool?
Me!
Why is it uncool?
It's a Peugeot!
What's that got to do with it?
It's ugly!
That's nothing to do with coolness!
Anyone think it is cool?
"Right, I do."
I'm gonna explain why.
It's a hot hatchback - hot hatchbacks are cool.
"They're small, they're easy to run."
"I had one the other week, came down here, drove it in second gear all the way, made me feel 18!"
"All of which is good, and they're good cars."
I just...
"Everybody else thinks it's uncool, you think it's cool."
Casting vote here.
"I reckon, apply your own test."
The Kristen Scott Thomas test.
Picture her outside her apartment in that.
She'll get in.
No.
She'll get in the diesel one of the bloke behind.
I think it's uncool.
"Oh, my God!"
What's up with you?
Chinese burn.
Why don't you give him a dead leg?
I will.
"Every time I come here, Every time, you two."
Don't you work?
"Henry, nice to see you."
"Hi, how are you?"
"Anthony, right in the front."
"Anything you need Henry, just let me know."
"Tony, thanks a lot. I appreciate it."
You gave them $20 each.
"Henry, this is with Mr. Tony, over there."
-Where?
-Over there.
"Thanks a lot, Tony."
Salut!
-What do you do?
-What?
-What do you do?
-l'm in construction.
They don't feel like you're in construction.
I'm a union delegate.
"And now, ladies and gentlemen the Copacabana is proud to present the king of the one-liners Henny Youngman."
How are you all?
I'm glad to be here.
"Take my wife, please."
I take my wife everywhere but she finds her way home.
"I said, ""Where do you wanna go for your anniversary?"""
"She said, ""I wanna go somewhere I've never been before. """
"I said, ""Try the kitchen. """
Dr. Wellsler is here.
Gave a guy six months to live.
Couldn't pay his bill.
Gave him another six months.
I love this crowd.
Now listen.
The three of us are gonna work this out.
Yeah?
How?
"First things first, you're gonna put a dollar in my pocket, both of you."
You want attorney-client privilege?
So that everything you say is strictly between us.
I mean it!
Put a dollar in my pocket.
"Come on, make it official."
"Come on, do it!"
That's it.
Come on.
Just a dollar.
"All right, now you, ski bum."
Come on.
Give with the dollar.
- Go on.
- Be smart.
What?
- All I got's a 5.
- I'll take a 5!
"Come on, already."
Come on.
Be cool.
You're now both officially represented by Saul Goodman and Associates.
"Your secrets are safe with me under threat of disbarment, all right?"
Take the ski mask off.
I feel like I'm talking to the Weather Underground.
Just do it.
So if a prison shanking is completely off the table... and we're sure of that?
No shanking!
And I'll get you away from here.
"No, no, francis."
There's something else that you must do.
"Everything I did, I did for you."
You needn't remind me.
I need you to forget all of it.
What?
Everything I warned you of.
The warnings I gave mary.
"Go to her, tell her that I believe"
The two of you can be wed.
I don't understand.
Your fate has changed.
"Oh, what does it matter?"
You never believed
That nostradamus had the power
To see the future anyway.
What matters is that you love mary.
I did love mary.
You destroyed that.
Nonsense.
"She's with bash now, but she loves you."
You don't know that.
I don't know that.
What matters is what you want.
Is it mary?
Is it to save my life?
Is it the throne of France?
Is it the safety of your brothers?
"Say it, say it!"
I know it's true!
Yes.
Yeah!
"Yeah, yeah, kid, she's hot as a torch, but you don't know anything about her."
- I know plenty.
- Yeah?
Where's she from?
Somewhere else.
Why'd she leave?
Who cares?
"Her past doesn't matter, long as her future's with me."
"Oh, Petey, ever since this girl came to town, you got a dream in your head where your sense ought to be."
"- You know what, Dad?"
- What?
You're right.
Petey...
"I love you, Nicky Johnson."
Marry me.
Marcy came to see me.
She's fine.
Thought you'd like to know that.
Why didn't you bring her home?
She's 18.
"She's still my little girl, Agent Kelton."
"I'm sorry about that, but there was nothing I could do."
What we need to talk about is Curtis McNeal.
"Yeah, I just heard."
It's terrible.
"So what aren't you telling me, Senator?"
Excuse me?
"Look, I've worked a lot of kidnaps, but this one's different."
"They're trying to get to you, and they're trying to get to me."
Why?
I have no idea.
- Where will you go?
- Into the wolf's den.
To be near the woman he loves.
The Dulce base.
-Are you sure you're not human?
How will you get there?
I will take you.
Jaelen?
-I'm fine.
-Are you sure?
[SPEAKS NATIVE AMERICAN TONGUE]
Robert.
[SPEAKS NATIVE AMERICAN TONGUE] Jaelen.
[SPEAKS NATIVE AMERICAN TONGUE] Alyssa.
[CONTINUES SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN TONGUE]
[CONTINUES SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN TONGUE]
[CONTINUES SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN TONGUE]
"-Despite the circumstances, I'm happy to have known you, Robert."
-The feeling's mutual.
"-I hope that we've made a difference, you and I."
-We have.
"Jaelen,"
"I'd like to wish you good luck, but..."
-Luck won't help me.
"A miracle, perhaps."
-Where will you go?
-Chicago.
I've got a niece there that I'm quite fond of and a brother who hasn't spoken to me in twenty years.
He doesn't believe in all this UFO crap.
"-I see an exoneration in your near future, my friend."
-Human eyesight has been deceived for thousands of years.
-How so?
"Son, I got a man outside with a bullet in his leg."
Do you want to help me with him?
"I'm not outside, friend."
I'm right behind you.
"That's a safe place to be, if you're not a liar."
Have any water?
No.
"No, I don't."
"We're some thirsty, ma'am."
If you could just spare us a half a cup apiece.
We got less than a gallon.
It's for the boy.
Tommy.
Mmm.
"Oh, that sure is good, ma'am."
Haven't you got any manners?
"Excuse me, ma'am."
"It's miss, not ma'am."
"Where's your family, menfolk?"
"Well, yesterday, some men..."
Tommy!
They dead?
"They're away, that's all."
The storm's keeping 'em away.
And the Apaches?
"No, the Mongoles and the Chiricahuas water here."
We live at peace with them.
Oh?
"You live at peace with the marauders, too?"
"- They water here, too?"
- Not until you drank.
You better get off that leg.
Your silence has saved your life.
Until now.
"Now you need us, and we need you."
There's only one way to catch that maniac.
Hold on.
By offering him something he can't refuse.
You aren't serious!
We have no other choice.
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
He wants to use you as bait.
You what?
- It's your only chance.
Put me out there like a piece of meat.
You came to see us.
Don't get her involved!
She already is!
You wanted to solve this case.
Not at her expense.
And we'll solve it.
Always you!
And if it's the last thing I do.
You just can't be trusted.
What?
Here's a package.
Speak up!
Who's it for?
"For you, lnspector Minks."
From somebody named lrezumi.
I'll put it here.
Car keys and a parking-lot ticket.
No.
Suspect is armed and dangerous.
- Send backup.
- All units respond.
Hold it steady.
My God!
"Yep, it's definitely a rug!"
"Way to go, Hardy, you asshole!"
"Tommy, congratulations."
We're all very proud of you.
You blew up a litter bug's car and found a carpet.
- It looked like a body.
- Then you're in the wrong job.
Let's just say that it was the killer and it was a cop.
It'd be very easy for him to figure out our patrol patterns.
He'd just be waiting for us to come along.
He dumps the rug to make us look like morons.
- Hardy...
- Yes.
- You should know something...
- Are you really a man?
- No.
- Good.
But I was married to one.
- A cop?
- Worse.
A lawyer.
That is worse.
We have a daughter.
She's four.
- What's her name?
- Sarah.
Nice name.
Jalon!
- Oh!
"- Oh, no!"
It's nice to see you...
Holy shit!
I haven't seen you since we got arrested at the army induction center in [Indistinct].
What are you doing now?
I'm a doctor.
Baby!
I sell convertible bonds for Baldwin and byrne.
[Laughter]
Sounds brilliant.
"Hey, um, who's your friend?"
This is Dalton...
He's a cop.
A cop... that's a good one.
You always did have a sense of humor.
"Hey, want a joint?"
[Giggling]
You know that I have not seen jalon...
For twelve years?
"Those were some times, huh?"
"Yeah, they, uh..."
They were some times.
But they were a little different for you than they were for me.
What do you mean?
"Well, uh, I was there, and you were here."
Were you really?
Where do you think I was...
Sarah Lawrence?
"What I meant was, I haven't been out with anyone who was in Vietnam before."
"Well, most people from scarsdale wouldn't have."
"- Huh, that's sweet."
"It's pathetic, but sweet."
"- Yeah, that's my niche... pathetic and sweet."
Hmm.
What?
No.
Mom!
"I don't know, maybe."
"Okay, I love you, too."
And say hi to Daddy.
What?
How old are you?
- Seventeen.
- What?
!
Really?
You don't go to school?
I used to.
I got kicked out.
"Of Corona, Matre Day, and even Newport Union."
"After that, my parents had enough, said, ""Go away, get a job, move out,"" which I did."
"I got my own studio on the numbered streets, and I work here, and I've never been happier."
- Yeah?
This is you happy?
"- Look, you barely earned these, but..."
"Hey, right on."
Thanks.
Ah!
"All right, Summer's going to be very stoked."
On-on the band.
"I hear they're really good live,and I think the best thing for our friendship, is like, a good, live, band."
"As a girl, I feel I should probably warn you, that this whole little game you're planning, she's gonna see right through it."
Watch out!
Look out!
Mater?
Mater!
Mater!
"Hey, take it easy, Mater!"
Oof!
Yee-hee!
He's nuts.
No need to watch where I'm goin'.
Just need to know where I've been.
"Whoa, that was incredible!"
How'd you do that?
Rearview mirrors.
"We'll get you some, and I'll teach you if you want."
"Yeah, maybe I'll use it in my big race."
"What's so important about this race of yours, anyway?"
It's not just a race.
We're talking about the Piston Cup!
I've been dreaming about it my whole life!
I'll be the first rookie in history ever to win it.
"And when I do, we're talkin' big new sponsor, with private helicopters."
No more medicated bumper ointment.
No more rusty old cars.
What's wrong with rusty old cars?
"Well, I don't mean you, Mater."
I mean other old cars.
You know?
- Not like you.
I like you.
"- It's OK, buddy."
"Hey, you think maybe one day I can get a ride in one of them helicopters?"
Shouldn't you be a delivery man by now?
Harriet!
"Well, Harriet, I'll tell you."
"Not long ago, I had another life."
"I had a big business, I had a lot of money, and you know what?"
I was the most miserable man alive.
"So, one day, I told my wife that..."
- Wife?
"- I told my wife that I wanted to start all over again and if she wanted to, she could start all over with me."
So what happened?
"Oh, she left me, but that's all right, that was her choice."
"My choice was to become a delivery boy... well, man."
"I don't have the business, of course."
I don't have the money.
You know what?
My life is sweet again.
Hmm.
The wurst!
"Oh, no!"
My wurst!
"No, no!"
Oh...
"Oh, Lord."
"Oh, no."
No.
"Don't be sad, Katherine."
This is a blessing in disguise.
That's a pretty good disguise.
Don't you see?
The three of us have to go out for dinner.
- No.
- Yeah!
"Sis, if you only told me we're going here, I should've worn rubber shoes and pants!"
To think I gave too much effort.
Sis?
"Sis, are you okay?"
.
Do you know that Migs proposed to me in front of that tree?
"He told me, however strong that tree is, that's how strong his love for me is."
That's why I want to see that tree.
"As long as that tree is right there,"
I won't lose hope.
"Everything will be alright, Sis."
How many copies to you want me to buy?
.
-What?
How many letters?

Five!
Five!

He's pestering me!
"Yes, okay!"
"I'll call you later, wait!"
Hey!
You're such a pest!
Give me that!
Hey!
Give that to me!
I'm going with them.
I love you.
But I want to experience life in Canada.
You know that long distance relationships are hard.
I'm a stay-at-home mom.
Bright lady.

"My name is Fran, I'm 44 years old."
But I have 30 years experience behind me.
Right.
The chefs enjoy the limelight now.
"Hello, I'm Scott."
"I'm from Manhattan, New York."
I'm here to win Hell's Kitchen.
"But in Hell's Kitchen, you have to prove yourself."
Bold statement.
Good.
And this time is no exception.
Okay.
Because Chef Ramsay has an important announcement.
I want to officially guarantee that we will complete the opening night dinner service at Hell's Kitchen.
"Oh, man."
Has he lost his damn mind?
Why would he promise that?
"I'm, like, thinking to myself, like,"
I don't know how we're going to do that.
It's never been done before.
Is that clear?
"Yes, Chef."
I can't hear you;
is that clear?
"Yes, Chef!"
"And with that, Hell's Kitchen begins."
Get in there and cook me a signature dish.
Off you go!
Let's not let Gordon down.
[Feigns laugh]
"It's gonna be a ""Day in the Life of a Chicago Firefighter"" sort of thing."
"We have a slow day, and you're just gonna reinforce the stereotype that all we do is sit around and eat."
"You got a problem with it, lieutenant?"
Go for it.
Drug tester's on his way.
"And again, this is mandatory."
"Hey, chief, there's a kid outside looking for you."
Thanks.
Good.
You came on by.
You said it was cool.
"It is, it is."
What's your name?
- Ernie.
- Ernie?
Chief Boden.
"You hungry, Ernie?"
"Hey, everybody."
This here is Ernie.
He's gonna be eating some turkey with us.
"- What's up, Ernie?"
"- Hey, Ernie."
"Hey, I need a sous chef, chief."
"Get over here, little man, we got a turkey dinner to prepare."
- Go ahead.
- Come on.
"First thing we gotta do, taste this gravy."
Tell me what you think.
- Good.
- It's good.
Where'd you find that mutt?
Scottie's going to say a few words.
~ Turn it off!
"~ Can we have you on the dance floor, please?"
Where is he?
Peter?
~ Peter?
~ Come on.
"Little Peter Magath, where is he?"
"~ Ah, there he is!"
"~ Go on, Peter!"
"Now, little Peter may not have been the smartest kid in the village, but he was the slowest."
I've got short legs.
"We used to think, Michael and me, that Peter had been dropped on his head as a kid."
~ I had.
~ We felt sorry for him.
"We worried about your future, Peter."
How's little Pete going to manage?
We didn't know you'd end up one of the richest sods in Newcastle!
"~ Did we, Michael?"
"~ No idea at all, Scottie."
"Should've paid more attention, then, shouldn't they?"
"~ Oh, they're only joking."
~ Hm.
Hilarious(!
)
"Now, when Peter came to me and said,"
"""I'm going to make my fortune laying pipe,"""
I thought he wanted to be a gigolo!
"~ What's a gigolo, Scott?"
~ Ask Michael.
"~ Gigolo, that's right!"
"~ Michael thought tonight was fancy dress, so he's come as a Danish porn star."
Hello.
-Hi.
Dude!
Thomas!
How's he doing?
Not so bad.
"There cerebral hematoma, but should to withdraw."
-Will there be consequences?
I had no idea.
I'm not a doctor.
They closed squat.
I know.
"If you want, come in Montrouge."
There are places.
Thank you.
"Here we are, do not worry."
We will avenge you.
Is Pierre here?
"I know 's early, but I see it."
Pierre does not work here.
Yeah?
I'll give you his new address.
I guess he not sit with what detention.
We all have our limits.
"But he seemed love, poor guy."
"Do not bother, you might You may be of help."
I was wondering who posted photos of my investigative files on the Internet.
He is not.
It can not be he said.
But you could be you.
Why would I do?
Because you hate cops.
Self-mutilation is an expression of a child crying out for help.
Wait a minute!
"I've read all the books, too."
I haven't seen a child crying out for help!
This is such crap!
He's a wonderful kid.
He's perfect!
- Too perfect.
- There is no such thing.
There is in children with psychotic tendencies.
"So now we have Ted Bundy, Jr."
Is that it?
"Look, Rachel."
I know you're hating this.
I'm hating this.
But your son has a problem.
"Why are you doing this, Shawn?"
- I'm trying to help.
- You don't want me to be happy.
That's ridiculous!
Stop denying the situation.
Enough.
That's all.
"Let's go, Rachel."
- Rachel--
- No!
Don't say it.
We have to do something.
They're too close to it.
Did you see any marks on his arm?
No!
I can't believe Shawn is doing this.
Why do I get the feeling you're getting the bigger half?
Let me ask you something.
If I'd have offered you less would you have been polite and taken it?
Of course.
You got what you wanted.
I like to kiss the pretty ones.
There's another pretty one.
You got BankExchange.
- How did you know?
- I saw the kiss.
I saw the smile.
How'd you get it?
I didn't say no.
But he'll take a bath on those leases.
It'll just take him longer.
"- Something for him, something for me."
- More for you?
"No, no."
More for the city.
"Hey, cigar."
Sneaking in a drink for Sydney?
I was.
Now they're both for me.
Helps Frank Anselmo go down.
Off-ramp and a subway stop already budgeted for.
But I'm left holding the bag.
What are you complaining about?
The bag's full of cash.
Minus a year.
You can weather a year.
You can weather 100 years.
I've got partners.
Where're they!
Tell me!
Tell me!
Go!
Wait
Where're they?
I let them go
You idiot!
What are you talking about?
You're wrong!

About sebastian?
He awaits you in your throne room.
Brother?
Francis.
I'm going to tell you something.
And it will hurt.
I know you're here to elope with mary.
You don't need to.
"All that nonsense about the prophecy,"
It's gone now.
My mother's let it go
For reasons she can explain.
I'm going to tell mary.
"She'll talk to my mother, to nostradamus."
She'll be convinced.
She won't trust catherine.
I don't trust catherine.
"You don't want things to change, to revert."
You're going to play on mary's fear.
She came to me willingly.
And she will stay with me.
She turned to you because she had to.
It was only a marriage of convenience.
And what was yours?
It went beyond that.
You know it.
And now you know
"Ours did, too."
You're lying.
You entitled son of a bitch.
You.
You're nothing.
Filip!
He's not here either.
I found him!
"Here, quickly!"
Come on!
Help!
Let's bring him outside!
I couldn't extinguish it.
I think I might have given too big a dose.
Let me go!
Departure is in one hour.
Greetings to you all.
"- What is it, please?"
- A contemporary custom.
There.
I have a surprise for you.
A cake!
Right!
With Nasper-cream!
And that's not all!
The best is yet to come.
Watch and wonder!
"This is Adam Bernau's violin, about which he wrote in the Memoirs, that it was his companion throughout his entire childhood."
It's so moving to think that I'll have the chance to see the living Adam Bernau in less than 2 hours.
And on his 11th birthday.
I hope we'll only be there for 4 hours.
It seems unreal.
"When my parents boarded the spaceship, that seemed so unbelieveable too."
So many beautiful women!
"While I, idiotically..."
Prepare for start!
Shields off!
That's Leslie Davison.
You guys go around back.
Make sure everything's all right there.
Looking for Officer Crowe.
They can't hear you.
You're dead.
You wanted to be Leslie.
"Well, you weren't good enough."
Somebody shoot that fucking car alarm.
"Say goodbye to the light, Emma."
I'm taking back the eyes you stole.
"Goddamn it, no!"
Over here!
Hold your fire!
You all right?
You all right?
"Sir, it's Crowe!"
"Oh, Jesus Christ."
"Ms. Brody, come with me."
Come on.
"Johnson, take the back."
Watch your head.
"Look, I know all of this has been hard on you... and again, I just want to thank you for everything."
I think we got enough now.
Sure you don't need to go to the hospital?
"No, think I've had enough of hospitals... for a while anyway."
Let me get somebody to take you home.
"I'll drop her off, lieutenant."
Why don't you take this.
Thank you.
It's the gray one.
I think I've got a ride home.
I know.
"It'sjust a start. I mean, I know you're too old for a twin bed."
"It's a nice bed, Roy."
"You know, l-l didn't mean to mess up your life."
Oryour mother's.
"And I don't deserve a second chance to be your father, but I'm hoping you'll give me one anyway."
"You know, wayback when... lthought lhadallthe time in the worldtoget to knowyou, foryou to get to know me."
"But... one day... wake up, you look around."
"All you got to show foryourself is a... beautiful, talented, little girl."
Young woman... who hates you.
I don't hate you.
I miss her.
I miss her so much.
"God, everything isso screwedup."
Derek is mad at me.
He's not gonna come tomorrow.
I want him to be there.
lneedhim to be there.
I just want someone there who loves me.
I love you.
Whoa !
Hey.
Why are you so quiet ?
I don't feel like talking.
"Derek, there's something I oughta tell you."
I said something to Sara.
What ?
What did you say ?
Stuff.
About how maybe Nikki had a point about black men and white women.
What ?
You said what ?
Ooh.

Who-- who said that?

No.
"Oh, please, no."
So what's going on?
"All right, so there's this girl here tonight"
- that I really like.
- Same with me.
"Oh, that's great!"
Perfect wingman situation.
"Two bros, two babes--"
"Yeah, it's the same girl."
"Ohh, that is less great."
Her name's Kim.
She's new at our school.
"I'm really into her, so I asked Pete to go talk to her"
- and find out her situation.
- So I did.
"I went up and asked her if she had a boyfriend, and she said, ""I do now,"" and then she winked at me."
- Traitor!
- I didn't mean for it to happen.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, guys."
"No need to let a girl get in between two best friends, especially when there's an obvious answer."
Very obvious.
- This one goes to Pete.
"- So, he's not your boyfriend?"
"- Mom, I barely know this person."
I don't know if I want to know this person.
"Well, then you haven't..."
What did you hear?
What did she tell you?
Nothing.
She didn't tell me anything.
Did she say I was sleeping with Jordan Catalano?
No.
"No, of course not."
No one said that.
- lt's just. I just wondered--
- She did.
I can't believe this. I can't believe this. I hate everyone.
Obviously I told my mother.
But all I said was you were hot for him.
Why did you even tell her that?
"Now, my mother thinks we slept together."
Okay.
Do you want my mother to call your mother...
and tell her you didn't sleep together?
I could do that.
- H i honey.
- Hey fag.
Go to hell.
Maybe later.
I have something for you.
is that perfume I smell?
"You know you are boring, don't you?"
- Turd head.
You need something?
How's his health?
He must be all right.
He's still running around digging up tombs.
Mm.
"-Besides, he's had experience."
-I didn't know that.
"Ten, 12 years ago, I think, in Africa."
The exorcism supposedly lasted months.
I heard it damn near killed him.
Father?
-You're Mrs. MacNeil?
-Yes.
I'm Father Merrin.
-Come in.
-Thank you.
-Is Father Karras here?
-Yes.
-He's here already.
-Father?
-Father Karras.
"-It's an honor to meet you, Father."
-Are you very tired?
-No.
"I'd like you to go quickly across to the Residence, Damien and gather up a cassock for myself two surplices, a purple stole, and some holy water and, um your copy of The Roman Ritual."
The large one.
I believe we should begin.
Do you want to hear the background of the case first?
Why?
This is yours to do with as you please.

"Oh, whatever it is, Higgins, the answer is no."
"My, we are suspicious, aren't we?"
I won't give up the Ferrari.
"I wouldn't dream of asking you to, old boy."
I won't move out of the guesthouse.
"Well, I should bloody well hope not."
And I won't let someone move in either.
Never entered my mind.
You want me to take out your sister?
She's married and living in Sussex with four monstrous children.
All right.
But I beat them black and blue.
My name's inspector Zoravar Singh.
I can make arose stink.
Give a swine swine-flu.
And give lice to a bald head.
Listen.
You can't even lie properly.
- Shiv the truth is...
- Kamini!
He's no brave officer.
Kamini!
- He's a coward cop.
- Kamini.
- What?
- Kamini.
Kamini.
Calm down.
He's been beaten up by the local thugs.
You're not worthy of being my husband.
I say you're not worthy of this uniform either.
Inspector!
What did she hurl at me witch.
Nephew.
It's like this.
I'm actually a sub-inspector.
I couldn't become an inspector.
You see.
I had been appointed for the security... of that crazy ACP Ayushman Thakur's sister.
Now how do I go with this broken hand?
You don't get it.
See.
What are you doing?
Did you make the pudding?
Depends.
On what?
Whether you liked it or not.
[ Grunts ] What's in it?
"Relax, Jack Lalanne."
It's low-cal.
"Nonfat milk, sea salt --"
"No, no."
Not the ingredients.
The something extra.
"Chill, man."
"Supplements, okay?"
Dean:
What kind of supplements?
Sam:
Here.
Hey.
"[ Exhales deeply ] To boost metabolism, per Larry and Maritza."
"These aren't ""supplements"", they're roofies."

Why don't I tell you over drinks?
- Excuse me?
- Hey.
Eyes on the road.

I am not having drinks with you.
You might be a pervert.
"I might be a pervert, but you're definitely a car thief."

"You didn't, actually."

By the way she was really upset with me.
And Rosa?
I couldn't go to Rosa's place because her husband was there.
You didn't tell me that.
Truth is I felt offended by the failure of my marriage.
That's why I stayed at the hotel.
So absurd.
"-Quite absurd, yes."
Do you have any children?
One daughter.
Sara.
She kept her too.
I think that's great.
You tell me why?
We had terrible conflicts about Sara.
I started showing myself weak and falling back..
And all of a sudden I had to ask for permission to see my daughter.
(Praying)
Follow me.
She's much better now.
Jacoba!
Don't bother her.
Jacoba.
Who's there?
-I'm Máximo.

I don't know what to tell you.
I don't know if your parents are at home or if they've left.

"Yeah, he didn't drive?"
Never.
He used to sit in front.
He sat in front?
"Oh, yeah."
Really?
Yeah.
"That was your dad, world-famous architect."
"Yeah, that was your father."
Do you remember him at all?
"(man #2) A little bit, vaguely."
Did he ever ride in your cab?
Vaguely.
He loved the women.
"Not the young ones, but he loved the women."
-- Do you remember what he looked like or
(man #1) His face was pointed.
"Yeah, and his hair was-- his hair was, you know, very thin, like a blond."

I am your slave.

"Oh, yes."

I have heard you described.
"Madame Sand, rumour has it you are a woman, and so I must ask you to leave my private chambers."
Have I offended your modesty?
I apologise.
- Play me one more piece and I'll go.
- This is ridiculously improper!

"As much fun as it is in your husband's arms, right?"
Don't take of fence.
I said that only because...
"I enjoyed the bliss of Cashmere silk, on a mat with my husband."
Hand me the pillow-cover.
Who's this handsome hiding in your pillow?
Is he your brother?
He seems to be young.
Must be your elder brother then?
Why do you always giggle?
Go away.
He was my husband.
Was?
Is he no more?
Gosh!
Don't say that!
Have you had a drivorsh?
"It's ""divorce"", aunty."
Not drivorsh.
He's pretty good looking.
Looks can be misleading.
Give me that.

I'm sure he did.
"Oh, regina."
"Oh, baby."
"- Oh, look at me."
- ma.
"Now you know, like saul,"
"You can pick yourself up,"
Dust yourself off and go on forward.
You know?
"And listen,"
I owe you an apology.
I don't ever want you to think
"That i'm not proud of you,"
Because i am.
You're a very ambitious woman
And a very strong woman.
You're my daughter and i love you dearly.
"i want my daughter back, ma."
I owe her so many apologies.
- Oh baby.
- I don't know what to say.
I think i have missed every opportunity.
I...
I'll never have a chance to be a good mother.
"- Oh yes, you will."
- And i lost the man that i love.
"Oh regina, it's not over."
"And i'm gonna apologize to you, mama."
"- For what, baby?"
- Who else lives in this house?
- Nobody.
- Who?
- The watchman.
- What's his name?
- Antonio.
- Who is Sebastian?
- I don't know.
- Stop.
- Where is Sebastian?
I said stop!
Sit down.
Do you know who Carmen and Estrella were?
"Before they killed them, they tortured them."
With a hunting knife and pliers.
They ripped off their nipples.
They cut off their toes.
They stuck something in their ass and vagina until they bled.
They were awake the whole time.
You can't imagine how much pain a person can bear before fainting.
I didn't know.
"I didn't know, I didn't know..."
Look at me.
What's the watchman's name?
Sebastian.
He came looking for work and I hired him.
His mother was my friend.
- He needed to hide.
- Hide from what?
I don't know.
He had changed a lot.
I hardly recognized him.

"If you killed someone, I'd cover for you too."
Is that wrong?
Let's go to Marina's house.
"No, how could he be the father?"
He's 87 years old!
"Tell them I'll do anything, I don't care."
- Hello?
- It's me.
"Hi, Marina."
I wanted to know what's happening with Malaga.
When will they call me?
"Look, there was a problem with your contract."
They're not hiring anyone until next year.
Talk to them.
"Tell them I'll do anything, I don't care."
I have to get out of here.
I can't take it anymore.
Let's meet.
At the usual spot in half an hour.
She called this number.
It's the hunting lodge.
It's okay.
Coming!
Who is it?
- Henry's right.
"- You're out, too."
"- Hey, wait a minute, Henry."
We had a deal.
"I help you, we take it down together."
The deal's changed.
I don't want anyone else to die.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
Who's going to die?
Since when did you become altruistic?
What the hell's going on?
It was a mistake to involve you.
Wait a second.
"You know who it is, don't you?"
Anyone else dies Henry and I am holding you personally responsible.
I work better alone.
Stay out of my way.
She's too powerful.
Henry!
That's great!
I mean that's just great.
So now I've got two of them running around the city.
He's doing it to protect us.
She's been watching him.
She's probably been watching him all night.
She?
And he's figured out who it is and he's protecting her.
The woman behind the vampire...
Christina.
And who the hell is Christina?
Trouble.
However...
Knees to chest.
Knees to chest.
You received this cablegram from Robin Masters.
One minute.
"Swimmers, to your mark."
One minute.
"Since your hands appear to be a bit shaky, I'll take the liberty."
Knees to chest.
Knees to chest.
Now bend over.
Bend down.
Take a deep breath.
And up.
""""" All best wishes and good luck."
""""" Everyone here expecting news of your great victory."
"Warmest regards, Robin Masters."""
"Not that he wants you to feel obligated to win, I'm sure."
Thirty seconds.
"Trainers, leave your contestants, please."
Relax.
"Don't worry, Thomas."
You'll do it.
"Good luck, old chap."
Just be cool.
Just be cool.
I only bet the farm.
"On your mark,"
All right.!
Come on.!
Get set...
Come on!
- Yes.
Where coffee beans come from.
The source of the Nile is in Abyssinia.
Is it?
Interesting.
- How do you do?
Edward Ferrars.
- Margaret Dashwood.
"It adjoins this property, and would be a desirable addition."
- I'll ride there and speak to...
- Gibson.
- He'll be pleased enough to sell.
- He'll want more than it is worth.
Have I hurt you?
Thank you.
Forgive me.
That was my father's favourite.
Thank you for helping Margaret.
She's changed since you came.
I enjoy her company.
- Has she shown you the tree house?
- Not yet.
"Would you do me the honour, Miss Dashwood?"
- It is very fine out.
- With pleasure.
- Margaret always wanted to travel.
- I know.
She's off to China soon.
"I'm to go as her servant, on the understanding I'll be badly treated."
- What will your duties be?
- Sword fighting and swabbing.
Which will take precedence?
!
I just told her it's a surprise for your birthday.
She was thrilled.
Where'd you get the money?
It's all on me.
- But...
"- None of your business, Dorona."
I have the money and I want to do it.
But what'll I eat there?
You're looking at a nut and that's all you care about?
I want to try and find him.
Why?
- What?
- Nothing.
- Where to?
- Paris.
He wanted to come.
And you agreed?
What did he tell you?
"Nothing, I swear."
You have separate rooms.
- And he speaks fluent French.
- So do we.
"- Yeah, like morons."
- Is he going to be with us the whole time?
I'm going home.
Shai got you business class?
Why only you?
"Don't drink too much, your legs will swell."
- When will you tell me what you did?
- When will you tell me what you did?
- Are you starting again?
You were right.
You knew it from the minute we saw him that day.
It wasn't kosher.
There was a second report.
That was only a feeling.
Now it's a fact.
5 people are dead.
Stern looks so judicial.
How could he be so corrupt?
The sweater unravels.
I'll give you one this time.
"""""The only thing new in this world is the history you don't know. """""
New Testament?
Harry Truman.
Judge Stern's a good man.
He's good?
5 people are dead!
-What's your point?
-You throw the book at the guy.
Embrace Detective Santos.
Max death settlement for her.
Medal of Honor for the deceased.
I'll make sure Leslie makes the morning editions with it.
So you got this all figured out?
"-That's my job, isn't it?"
-That's cold.
That's cold.
I mean you don't just... .
It's more complicated than that.
Forgive me.
I know the two of you are old friends.
Be careful how you judge people.
"Carter, there's no way I can get my hands"
On that much cash in an hour.
Not as a private citizen.
There's nobody in the government you can ask?
No one who'd even entertain it.
"And in any case, the request would go into the system and alert the leak."
"Okay, okay."
I have an idea.
I'll get back to you.
Carter?
Hey.
So you can change.
Or I could get you something else if you want.
"- No, thanks."
- All right.
"Isaac, um... is everything all right?"
You seem...
I don't know.
It's been a rough year.
Other people wanting what's mine.
"You can always get out, you know."
Yeah.
"Look, I got a deal about to go down with some Dominicans."
Right?
They're gonna move my product on the north side.
That'll put me back on top.
I'll be a'ight.
Yeah.
What?
How's Nicole?
"She's fine, like I said she'd be."
"What, you called to talk to her?"
OK.
Nice.
That feels good.
Are you gonna fuck me now?
Yup.
-Hi.
-Hi.
-Can I stay up late watching movies?
-Yep.
You're not gonna make me go to bed?
Do whatever the fuck you want.
What's wrong?
"It's... you know my friend you met here tonight, Bender?"
Yeah.
"I can't believe I'm telling you this, but she was here before you got here and she kissed me."
She kissed you?
"Yeah, she was tying my tie and she pulled me in and kissed me."
Did you kiss her back?
No. [LAUGHING] Of course not.
"But it was- you know, it was peculiar."
"Well, girls do funny things sometimes."
Yeah.
"There was this once, a long time ago, actually when we first met, she and I made out."
Nothing really came of it... [SIGH]
She and I - we don't make sense as a couple.
Do we make sense as a couple?
-Yes.
-Yeah?
Water!
"Please, let me get water."
I'm so not done with you yet.
"What, what?"

Was Baker not on your tram?
"No, sir."
That'll do it.
Here they come.
"Purcell, boys."
Too early for Humperdinck.
"Sorry, I'm not sure where I should stand for the microphone."
Probably best if I conduct.
"Get a chair for Miss Riall out of the way, Lionel."
Right you are.
Should I just warm them up?
"Oh, I don't think we need bother with that."
"Round about this tempo, boys."
Once through for luck.
"I didn't get the chance to ask, are we all here?"
Apart from Baker.
Baker?
But he was so excited about it.
Did he send a message?
No.
Just didn't turn up.
So he's out.
"Well, I'm very disappointed."
I had great hopes of Baker.
Aren't you disappointed?
Does Otto know about this?
The deed's in my name.
"After the stroke, we transferred it all to me."
"Audrey, this sale's a mistake."
The market's shit right now.
It's better to ride it out.
I need the money now.
- Because of the investment.
- Yes.
"I need everything I gave to Victoria, and I can't tell you why."
"Well, I'm your attorney."
I'm exactly who you do tell.
What if I loan you the money?
- In cash?
- Yeah.
Now?
[chuckle]
How could you possibly...
"A while back, I put some money into a dance club in Hartford."
"A couple days ago, the other investors bought me out in cash."
- [phone rings]
- Uh...
Bernhardt Bail Bonds.
This is Audrey.
Tell him it's Otto.
You need privacy.
"Oh, Hi, hon."
"Uh, could you hold on a sec?"
"Um, it's Otto."
Would you mind stepping out a moment while I lie to my husband?
"Thank you, Lance."
Porter said Lance pulled you into a sidebar.
Claire's...
Claire's dead.
"Now, will you take that soup and get out of here."
I can't take anymore today.
"Look, all I meant was you..."
Will you just get out of here!
Sir...
And stay out!
"Sir, he didn't mean any harm, if you'll forgive me for saying so, sir."
"I sometimes have a silly effect on people, you know what I mean?"
"Just being a police lieutenant, you know."
"At least, I hope that's why."
"Yes, I'm sure it is."
"Your friend, sir."
He was just trying to be nice.
(SIGHS)
What?
Oh.
Him.
"No, no."
He wasrt trying to be nice.
He was trying to fix me up with an alibi.
Then it wasrt true?
"What, Lieutenant?"
I...
Excuse me.
I keep swimming in and out of myself.
"Well, you know, that's what happens, sir."
It's kind of like being in shock.
"Maybe you ought to sit down for a minute, sir."
I am not in shock.
I don't need to sit down.
Yes. thank you.
I'm sorry about what i said.
You don't have to apologize.
Where's chuck?
It's over... once and for all.
But i'm gonna be strong.
"Still, it doesn't feel right without him here."
You know everyone else is here.
Yeah...
Everyone's here.
Oh it's beaufiful
It looks so good on you.
Oh!

I think it's Jimmy.
You just say that because you're gay.

I seriously think Jimmy is the new Miss America.
He has all the mannerisms of a sex symbol.

Great idea.
And we could end it with the two of them fucking.
He can't fuck.
I can too fuck.

You two are just too chicken to be photographed fucking.
Chicken woman.
He's the chicken not I.
"That sounds like a challenge to me, Jimmy."
You're just a chicken.

But it's also a question of American credibility.

- The Green Dragon.
- The night Lau died.
- I'm guessing 5 minutes before he died.
- What?
- Keep watching.
Kevin Grey is walking out that door to kill Freddie Lau.
Come on - you have nothing here.
So I had a drink with Freddie Lau one evening - so what?
This is accessory to murder.
No.
"Harry, I need something here, Harry."
Old friend.
You've been lying all along about this.
I think Kayleigh Fenchurch was murdered as a warning to Lau.
Then someone set Kevin Grey on the path to revenge.
Someone screwed with his head just enough to make him kill Lau.
"A nice, neat love triangle - case closed."
"But that's not what's really happening here, is it, Kalim?"
So tell me who's pulling your strings?

BP's steady at 120.
But he's been like this the whole time.
"Ricky, you need to calm down."
- Did you give him anything?
- Wouldn't hold still long enough.
Good breath sounds.
"Full trauma panel, chest and AP pelvis."
He's a regular customer.
Through and through to the right triceps.
You were lucky.
Yeah?
You should see the other guys.
No fracture or deformity.
"So, what?"
Just go back and forth shooting each other till all of you are dead?
"- An eye for an eye, man."
- Yeah.
Meanwhile his girl gets shot.
- They got Alma too?
- She was hit in the neck and it's pretty serious.
"W-Well, you see..."
Would you like some food?
It's my mum's birthday today.
She's even got lots of food stalls.
Really?
.
"Hold on, you two."
We can't go about accepting handouts.
"I'm King Pilaf, you know?"
Aw...
Oh well.
"If you say so, Pilaf-sama..."
Is that so?
Okay then.
Y-You fools.
You're too obedient.
How about going against my orders sometimes and bringing me back a bit?
.
It's all tasty.
"Well, if you insist, I guess I'll have to eat it."
Delicious.
You two dig in as well.
Pilaf-sama.
Even 150-fold gravity has outlived its purpose...
"Excuse me, Vegeta-sama?"
Leave.
You're interrupting my training.
"B-Bulma-sama called, she wants you to come to her birthday party."
Just go away already.
Tell her I'm not going to any such thing.
Vegeta.
"What's going on in that head of yours, not coming to your pretty wife's birthday party?"
"- Oh, Dr. Klein gave me this, uh, calorie counter."
"You know, it's amazing how much food you can eat if you eat the right food."
"I mean, like, I could eat a- a whole cow, as long as I didn't butter it."

"Emily, wait till you see the present I picked out for-"
"Uh, Howard?"
"Uh, Bob- Bob, Howard's here."
"Hi, Bob."
"I, uh- I didn't realize you were here."
"Yeah, I-I kind of live here, Howard."
"Of course you do, and- and you should."
Uh
"- Well, I can come back later."
"I just, uh, stopped by to say hello."
- Yes.
Howard just... stopped by to say hello.
- That's right.
"Hello, Howard."
Hello.
"Howard, is there something you wanna discuss in private with Emily?"
"No, no, no, Bob."
"Uh, no."
Nothing at all.
"Uh, well, so you got a birthday coming up, huh?"
Wow.
Forty-one.
That's a biggie.
That's a really big biggie.
"I hope, uh, nobody in this room is, uh, planning anything for my birthday."
"Like what, Bob?"
"Oh, like people jumping out of closets, people jumping up from behind furniture... and, uh, expecting me to be surprised when I'm not surprised."
Teaching me.
Here it is madam 42 it'll be perfectly fit.
"Dad, listen to me."
Brother.
"Not 42, give size 40."
42 will be perfectly fine.
"Brother I said not 42, give size 40."
What are you saying?
How do you know?
It's my size.
Do you know better or me?
I can tell the size of bra by looking at the blouse.
You know my nature.
Her husband even ask me for her size.
150 please.
Here.
Give me a bag.
What's the bag for?
You're going to wear it anyway.
"Dad, You'll have to leave for Pondi."
There you'll have to meet our designer who's worked on our valentines collection.
Actually I've seen the designs on the internet.
You just need to go and make an agreement with her.
Okay I'll go.
Don't you worry.
And if you like the design give her 100000.
She need it.
Okay.
What her name?
"Shut up, Not yours."
Leave the bra.
Speak.
- Cat?
- Mm-mm.
- Bird?
- Mm-mm.
- Wolf?
- Mm.
"Guinea pig, sidewinder, what?"
Just a cat.
Just a cat?
You never talk about your patients that way.
"What, you have to put one down?"
No.
I wasn't going to tell you.
- Tell me what?
- You promise you won't get mad?
About a cat?
Why would I get mad about a cat?
"It was Adalind's cat, and I know that you don't like her, and she knows that too."
She didn't even want me to tell you.
Let me see that.
"Nick, what's the matter with you?"
Take it easy.
How long ago did this happen?
"Today, just before lunch."
"Baby, I get scratches all the time."
Not like this you don't.
- You don't understand.
"- Yeah, I don't understand."
You're getting all worked up about nothing.
You don't know her like I do.
Okay?
"You know, you said that once before."
What?
You know who that is?
You may have met Ted and Alma.
- Ted is still -
"- Oh, I know them."
You know them?
Ted is still volunteering up on the palliative care.
- I knew them very well.
- Yes.
Okay?
So you know some of these people?
Um -
This is the original deed... for the house down on Cecil Street... in 1918.
"It was found recently, and we've had it framed to go with the photographs."
Okay?
That's where Baycrest came from - a house all those years ago.
- And my husband's somewhere here too.
- Yep.
Yeah.
Isn't that great?
This is the auditorium.
- And -
- That should be him.
I should remember this.
[Chattering]
And this is the gift that Al gave us.
He gave us all these photographs that you see here.
All the way down the walls.
Look.
But you come and have a look here.
"- Now - - [Ida] Oh, for goodness' sake."
How do ya like that one?

"Oil rights, shipping, all the high-powered clients."
"It's in Scotland, Paul."
"Smile, everyone!"
"It's not ideal, obviously, but..."
It's only a train ride away.
At least not America or something.
- You could have spoken to me first.
- Yeah.
"Uh, no, I just found out this afternoon."
"But look, look, look, you're right, I should have got you alone."
"- What's up, guy?"
- Cue the lap dog.
"Ah, Lukesta, what's up bro?"
So...
- What've you got for us?
- I've got all sorts.
How's about a drop of the white stuff to kick us off?
"- Paul first, definitely."
"- Oh, no, I shouldn't do it."
"- Well, that's the whole point, mate."
- Yes.
- Go on.
- Okay.

You fucked up the whole thing!
You screwed it all up!
- Stop it!
- You brain-damaged fool!
"God, and i picked out a car and everything!"
"Hey, now listen."
"If I didn't do this, we'd be in jail or at the river bottom..."
- with bricks taped to our wrists.
- [ Groans ]
- And you know it.
"- Oh, my God."
You're so stupid.
- Oh!
"- Oh, Crystal."
- We are under surveillance.
"- Oh, yeah?"
Yes.
Last night I stopped by a convenience store.
"A cop pulled in behind me, he got out, he followed me in... and then he pretended to get a cup of coffee!"
Did he pretend to get a doughnut?
"- Oh, you know--"
- You are nuts!
- You need to see a psychiatrist.
"- Oh, I'm nuts?"
Oh...
Out of time.
You found two answers...
And what you are looking for was transformer.
"This is the stuff you know, guys, isn't it?"
"Difficult to find in the hive, though."
Not particularly.
Not that kind of physics.
Not electronics.
"Well, not bad then, in that case."
"You got two points, well done."
"Team Araucarians, over to you."
Which topic would you like?
We have left...
We're good on...
"Music's not good for any of us, is it?"
No.
"Well, maybe me."
I work in technology.
"Technology, yeah."
Go for it.
Technology.
You've chosen technology.
You're looking for typefaces.
You've ten seconds to confer.
Typefaces?
"Helvetica, Comic Sans, Garamond, Arial, Times New Roman..."
Helvetica - we've had that.
Yeah.
Courier...
Time's up.
"Simon, at the far end, we're going to start with you."
Ah.
"Yeah, I-I wouldn't know."
She and I are
Keeping our creative lives separate right now.
"Uh, you might wanna discuss this one,"
Since it involves her going to Haiti for three months.
"You know what, dad?"
I think I'm gonna have to cancel that waffle.
Okay.
All right.
See you.
Hey.
Um...
"I know this gala tomorrow night seems boring,"
"But I thought, uh, if there's a girl you like,"
Perhaps you'd like to invite her.
"Actually, I'm gay."
"So if I was going, which I'm not,"
Then my date would be a guy named Elliot.
That's cool.
Uh...
Bring Elliot.
I'd love to meet him-
Please stop acting like
You and I have any kind of relationship.
You're right.
Um...
I have a lot to make up for.
I'm sorry.
The window for that
"Closed somewhere between my 12th birthday and, um..."
My suicide attempt.
- lt's okay.
"But look, I landed it right?"
That's all that matters.
I don't think so.
- l don't think that's all that matters.
- Say what you mean.
I'm proud of you.
I'm glad you landed the account...
- and you're fired.
- What?
You're fired because I love you... because I don't want to lose you.
"No, no, Patty, it's okay, I can fix my responsibilities."
"I know, but you're not happy, you're not."
You're...
Something has to change.
- What will we do?
I mean...
- l don't know.
- What will I do?
I don't even...
- l don't know what you're going to do.
I guess you're finally going to figure it out.
"- You know that girl, Angela Chase?"
- That redheaded girl?
Yes.
Some redhead.
It's out of a bottle.
- Anyway. is she avoiding us?
- l think she is.
I think we make her physically ill or something.
I thinks so because...
Angela.
Was that Damon Salvatore you were with?
The one and only.
Do you know him?
We go way back.
He still live out by Miller Lane?
He lives in the old boarding house.
By Wickery Bridge.
He's still in there if you wanna say hi.
I'd rather stay here and talk to you.
Oh.
Nice.
Very smooth with the shoe and the flirt.
But I'm a little drunk.
And hot guy plus drunk me equals very bad things.
I'm pretty sure you'd like it.
I'm sorry.
That was a seriously lame pick-up.
I'm sorry.
That's a nice scent you're wearing.
What is it?
I don't know.
"Ha, ha."
It was a gift.
"And that is a cab, so..."
Vervain.
Making it hard to find something to eat in this town.
- Caroline.
- I don't wanna talk about it.
You're being ridiculous.
"And insecure and stupid, but that doesn't change the fact that Matt's in love with you and I'm the backup."
- You're not the backup.
"- Yes, I am."
We didn't even get the Joni Mitchell.
"Oh, don't, yeah."
Food and Drink.
"Food and Drink, OK."
I can tell you you will be looking for cocktails.
You have ten seconds to confer.
OK!
Single word ones.
Single ones...
"Mojito, screwdriver..."
Erm...
Time's up.
I didn't hear a lot of cocktails there.
Are you not big cocktail drinkers?
They are.
These two love them!
But we like two-word cocktails!
That's a bit inconvenient then.
Yeah!
"Simon, in the middle, we're going to start with you."
"You have 45 seconds, remember those passes."
You're looking for cocktails.
Reveal the hive.
Mojito.
"Mojito, correct."
Helen.
Screwdriver.
BUZZER
"Oh, you are locked out of the hive!"
"With 32 seconds left to go, and two passes to go!"
"You wanted to get screwdriver there, but you can't quite get it, because there's no R. Bad luck."
You've got one point for mojito.
- Yup.
I love this.
"- Ari, you look sexual."
- You were right there the whole time.
- We were so close.
- You really do.
- We were so close.
- You really do.
You look drunk but great.
"Pete, you can really tell how much you love New York with these shots."
And it's sexy.
Sexy at the same time.
- NY.
- Sexy NY.
I do love New York.
"I think it's part of what makes the film, you know, special."
- Absolutely.
- Or specialer.
"But look at these shots, you can tell you're a New Yorker and you love it."
Does anyone remember this reference?
- No.
- It's the fifth lady.
- What?
- What is that?
Wanna know what that's a reference to?
"Sex and the City, when it was over all the girls, they were always talking backstage about the show."
"And they were like, ""New York, it's the fifth lady."""
Didn't Kim Cattrall play New York?
But it is.
It's like in this.
"New York is, like, the biggest character."
That's true.
Look at you.
What do you look like now?
"Master, I think he looks like a lily"
You all think so?
Shut up!
Shut up!
"Master Shi, we found on your apprentice"
Zhou Sanzhao's silver ingot
This is indeed strange
We hope you can clear things up for us!
"The silver ingot is engraved with the word ""San"""
"Y es, ""San""!"
San is on it!
Y es
Where did you get it?
Zhou Sanzhao gave it to me
What?
Zhou Sanzhao is the most notorious murderer
How will he gave you money?
That's right!
"He didn't really give it to me, I..."
"Master, he's lying again"
Y es!
He's lying again!
Where did you get the money?
"Gao Jian, tell dad the truth!"
"Quick, otherwise Master will punish you!"
Zhou Sanzhao threw money... at the prostitutes
So I dressed up as a woman and got his money
Dressed up as a prostitute?
Good idea!
"Y es, yes, he does look like a woman!"
My mouth.
"My hands on the piano, on his face..."
It's all his.
Whether I am alive or not.
"Aro, I love you so much. """
He looked strangely happy.
He didn't go to the funeral.
But he thought only of her.
He locked himself away in selma's room.
He sang and played the piano.
His voice became very beautiful.
When did she realize Aro had left?
I didn't see him for days.
I started looking for him.
in the house...
In his room...
I couldn't find him.
I asked around the village.
I checked with those who knew him.
But nobody had seen him.
He disappeared with the Revolution.
"In 1956, the Russians invaded the country..."
I never saw him again.
I remember...
Once he was very sick.
He took my hand.
He looked at me as if he was begging for something...
"He called me ""SeIma""."
I didn't understand.
"But now, that I know more about his life..."
I realize that he never saw who I really was.
Something like that...
What the...?
..
Murder Squad...
"What are you bringing in here, you guys?"
!
This is crazy!
Successville.
"She's just a bit delusional, I'm so sorry."
"Sit down there, Elsie."
There you go.
"We're cops, Goddamn it, Cyrus!"
You're cops?
Yeah.
Why didn't you say you were cops?
What's this shit about?
You've made an enemy of one of the most powerful men in Successville.
How did I make an enemy?
"Work my arms, Dermot."
How did she make an enemy...?
"Both of them, Dermot."
What did I do?
I just...
What did you do?
"Yeah, what..."
You made me mad!
"You know what, you're crazy."
"You're dressed as an old lady, you have two pairs of glasses on and you've got a head scarf on."
"Screw you, buddy, I'm just a nice old person trying to help people!"
Really?
Yeah.
"How did you try and help Simon Cowell, when you pulled past his office the other night?"
You know what I did?
- WOMAN:
Get rid of her!
-Damn right.
Except you'll have to go through me first.
"Me, too."
ALL:
And all of us.
(ALL CLAMORING)
Hey!
I ain't the one with the time bomb in my arm.
MAN:
Yeah!
(ALL SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY)
(TRIS SNIFFLING)
I know what you're thinking.
But I'm not gonna let you do it.
I can't let anyone else die because of me.
No one else is gonna die because of you.
Tori's gonna find a way to disable the disks...
And if she doesn't?
Then...
Then...
"Then if she doesn't, we figure it out."
Together.
You know I'm just one person.
I'm not worth it.
"No, you are worth it."
You are worth it to me.
I love you.
JEANINE: ...plays a critical role in maintaining the social order.
But this harmony we've achieved is now under attack.
This city may be safely enclosed behind a vast wall.
"No hat, no problem."
Another score for the cat fan.
Hey.
Hey.
Want some necklace?
"How about you, man?"
Ew.
You got it all spitty.
Tastes better that way.
Good.
"Hey, Harriet, what are you writing?"
Notes.
Can we read them?
Can you read this?
"Okay, okay."
I just wanted to know why you're always writing like a maniac.
I want to remember everything.
I want to know everything.
"Well, you must realize, Harriet, knowing everything won't do you a bit of good unless you use it to put beauty in this world."
True or false?
True.
Of course it is.
"Harriet, your mother called."
She's going to be late.
"Come on, Sport, Janie."
I'll have you home before dinner.
Golly always takes us places.
She sees things other people barely notice.
She's my nanny and...
"well, she's Golly."
"Okay, survey of the day."
Today's question is:
- You think he's been acting a part?
- No.
He loves her.
I am sure.
- Of course!
Has he left her any assurance of his return?
Ask if he proposed.
No!
I cannot force a confidence from Marianne.
Neither should you.
We must trust her to confide in us in her own time.
There was something underhand in his manner.
You will think the worst of him.
I give him the benefit of my good opinion.
He deserves no less.
I am very fond of Willoughby.
"I get next game, okay?"
-Coming through.
Coming through.
"-Doctor, is he dead?"
"-Please, get out of the way."
-Dr.
Greene...
... canyouconfirm or deny this report?
Get Security to get these people into the Press Room.
Do you question Dr. Ross' decision to fly the child here?
-Not for a second.
-Come on!
"Move, now!"
Let's go!
Hurry!
We're ready.
"Well, good."
I'll deposit it and bring you your receipt.
"Now, that's twenty thousand shares of Wentworth Drug at two dollars."
That's right.
Looking for a stock to buy?
Why?
Do you know of a good one?
Have you heard of Wentworth Drug?
I don't use drugs.
How much does it sell for?
Two dollars.
I never buy cheap stocks.
"Well, this one may become expensive."
Somebody just bought twenty thousand shares.
"Yes, so I see."
"You just bought twenty thousand at two, Mr. Sabourin."
Thank you.
You bought it.
What if it goes down to a dollar?
Then I'll buy more.
Look.
Still think it will go to a dollar?
I've got to get some.
Mr. O'Hara!
"Yes, Mrs. Ryan?"
Get me fifty thousand shares at two.
You'll never get it at two.
Not after that announcement.
Look!
Three and a half...
Three and five eighths...
Three and seven eighths.
Don't you notice the smell?
I can't stand it.
What a terrible experience!
It smells like something died!
"Haven't you noticed it, too?"
"Yes, but there are several tanneries around here."
- Tanneries?
- Tanneries.
"If they're tanning hides, it's the skin from the ass."
- A tough one!
"- Stop, I can't stand this stench."
Stop!
I think it's coming from that guy in the back!
- Are you going to leave me like this?
- Wimp!
"Dear God, it's not fair."
A dog!
"Quiet, I'm Dr. Cicchirini!"
See that?
I'm getting better.
You look like a fisherman at a taco stand.
"- Now, watch this."
- Not bad for a beginner.
In the corner pocket.
"It's up to you, Benito."
"Come on, cheer up!"
"Come on, play."
- Let's see what he can do.
- Now you'll find out.
"- What are you doing, Benito?"
-What's wrong?
Guys...
"What an interesting palm you've got, Christine."
Can you read palms?
A bit.
"This line here, for instance, means lots of love but not every love is a happy love."
So?
Tell me.
I don't know enough about it.
I might frighten you.
Why?
is it scary...or dangerous?
I see more loves in your present life than just me.
There's someone else...
Tell me I don't mind.
Yes.
I see a young man.
He's beautiful.
Yes.
He lives in... I see letters.
"K, and O with dots on top..."
is that German?
"Yes, Köln, or Cologne is where he lives."
You're really good at it.
"If you want me to go on, I need something tangible of his."
Something tangible?
- A key or a lock of hair or...
- A letter.
- Could work.
You got one?
- l'll get it.
- Here.
"- No, I don't want to read it."
Or you'll think it's all a trick.
Maybe later.
"What do we got, McGee?"
"How about you, Agent Gibbs?"
When was the last time you made a good snow angel?
'Cause it's... it's snowing.
McGee.
NTAS just issued an alert:
possible terrorist chatter.
They pick up chatter all the time.
Subject is northeast U.S. airports.
"Attention, passengers-- due to extreme weather conditions..."
Oop.
Sorry.
Uh...
"Oh, hey."
You again.
"Look, about before, uh, my husband has quite the chivalrous streak."
Uh-huh.
"But, you know, now that I've run into you again... do we know each other?"
I feel like we've met before.
Yeah.
I don't think so.
Has that ever happened to you?
"You see a face, you just can't place it?"
"Not really, no."
Oh.
"Delays are a drag, huh?"
Where you headed?
Home to see family?
Paris.
Business.
"Ah, Paris."
Splendid.
- Your time's running out.
"- Uh, I think it was closer to the waterfall."
"You see, I buried it at night, and I..."
Find it!
Yes.
- Roger!
- Babs.!
Why didn't you tell me?
I couldn't.
It was too dangerous.
You might get hurt.
Oh.
Terrific idea.
"Now, look, you better find it or..."
You buried the money here?
A year ago.
Only everything's changed so much I haven't been able to find it.
"I'm not a thief, Babs."
Well...
Really I'm not.
It was just so tempting.
But I decided to turn it in for the reward money.
Only I had to find it first.
And today's the only day I could get in here without making everyone suspicious.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Even if you wanted to keep the money and be a thief.
Just tell me you wanted to marry me.
Of course.
Didn't you get my proposal?
The postcard.
There should be a number on it.
Ask Mace to look it up.
"Pretty, isn't it?"
(Sighing)
"Stop worrying, Howard."
There's hundreds of them.
And don't forget who's paying for all this.
"That's right, yes."
I'm suggesting exclusive rights to it all.
"I'm sorry, can you speak up?"
"No, I'm not going to sell them individually."
One moment.
"- We do want the world, don't we?"
- Of course we do.
And don't forget America.
"Yes, the world."
And America as well.
"Yes, good."
What?
"Oh, yes, splendid."
That would be grand.
Goodbye.
"Well, that should take pressure off Carter."
- Did they say yes?
- And at a very good price.
"Oh, Pops, you are clever."
Howard will be so pleased.
Let's have a drink.
LACAU:
It is outrageous.
They are behaving as if they own this country.
How dare they give exclusive rights to The Times?
"You heard what I said, keep playing."
"I told you I never wanted to see you in these parts again, Black Bart."
I'll have to blow you away.
[fires cap gun]
"I got you, fall down."
"Okay, you want to play?"
I'll play with you.
Come on out.
"Let's see if your gun's as loud as your mouth,"
Sheriff.
I'll pick where to make my stand.
[fires and giggles]
Hold it.
"Smile, cowboy."
"I got it, Harry."
[laughs]
"[Billy] Bang, bang, bang!"
Whoo-hoo.
"mom, you should of seen it."
This outlaw chased me all over and then he tried to shoot me.
But he shot the head right off this fake Indian.
- Were you scared?
- No.
"Hey, I told you you'd like it."
"Thanks for bringing me, Mom, it's excellent."
"Well, here you go, you guys."
"Uh, I'm gonna go upstairs for a while, I think."
"You have a good time, okay?"
"Uh, say, uh,"
I think we ought to talk.
"See, uh..."
I know this is real hard on you.
Tell him to come up.
I want to see him in the lobby.
Just list them for me.
That's all.
Let me get back to you.
We're missing the best part.
You know it by heart.
I saw you lip-synching.
"Well, lucky l do."
I couldn't hear all the words.
I don't know if it's my old ears or the subway underneath.
-Did you like the Billy Bigelow?
-He's good.
Good voice.
What'd you think of the Julie Jordan?
"Good act, no voice."
My Nettie could sing better.
"We met 25 years ago, Westbury-- l heard about that."
"Speaking of performances, Frank."
I don't wanna hear about another one like this morning.
Your boy embarrassed me.
You'll have to live with it.
-Why?
-Because he's my boy.
There's oil...
"... underthatvacantlot ,Frank."
Jobs.
You don't need to politick me.
I run Kings County.
Jobs for people of this city.
"Not leases for Lenny, Murray and all your greedy pals."
Just because this kid thinks he can elect you President...
- Good day.
"- Uh, no, I meant the young girl."
There.
- This is our niece.
She is lodging with us while my cousin's family is away overseas.
- I remember you from my first visit here.
Do you know my sister Isabel?
- She's a shy girl.
- She's very shy.
Very shy.
- Are you okay?
- I'll be there.
Go on.
"Well, it's so good to see you, Roderick."
"Best to the sister, yeah?"
Be well.
"You know, Isabel,"
I'm working on something very exciting.
I'd like to invite you to my lab to see it.
"Dr. Cairn says that your progression has been remarkable, so not to worry."
- I know my brother won't be pleased.
- You're a strong girl.
You don't need his approval.
You understand?
- Yes.
- Mr. Porter.
- Roderick.
"- Isabel, what are you wearing?"
Huh?
"Your fingers, they're filthy."
- I know.
- Who did this to you?
"She's been hiding something very important from you, you know."
Her family was murdered by a Methuselah.
Her family... was murdered?
Ah.
"I guess you really didn't know, tovaras."
That... can't be...
How odd that she never told you about something so important...
"Who knows, maybe she harbors a grudge against you, too."
Or perhaps-
He got away!
Your Lordship!
Are you all right?
!
Watch Esther!
She's in the backroom of the building on that hill!
Understood!
"Are you all right, Count?"
You've been seriously wounded...
This is nothing at all.
It will quickly heal.
But how did you find me?
An odd message was thrown my way as I returned from the palace.
Thrown?
By whom?
No idea.
What's wrong?
They... and Radu...
plan to kill Her Majesty!
What?
!
Esther-san!
Esther-san!
Why'd you have to leave me?
I can't explain that.
"(LINE RINGING, PHONE RINGING)"
"Hi, honey."
How was breakfast?
Did you tell Dad not to contact me?
(SIGHS)
It's not that simple.
"When he called out of the blue,"
I said that now might not be the best time.
You could have told me that last night.
- I'm tired of all these secrets.
- (HANGS UP)
- (SIGHS) - (TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING)
"So, who were you on the phone with basically at dawn?"
"- Hey, fun story."
None of your business.
- Always so mysterious.
"Look, maybe we should go get breakfast instead of breaking and entering?"
- I'll spring for pancakes.
- No pancakes.
"Ooh, wait!"
"Hey, frame me up."
"Maybe use, like, a Dutch angle so it's creepier."
I got it.
This is it.
"Oh, what?"
The unit was already unlocked?
Crescent Palms guy was hazing you.
We'll see.
- You recording?
- ‭Yup.
Motherfucking mutt!
You fucking piece of shit!
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
"Come on, come on!"
He bought his fucking button!
That fake old tough guy!
You bought your fucking button!
-Don't get nervous.
-You motherfucker!
Keep that motherfucker here!
Keep him here!
Keep him here!
"Come on, you fuckin' feel strong?"
I'm sorry.
Tommy gets a little loaded.
He doesn't mean any disrespect.
"He don't mean any disrespect, Henry?"
Are you nuts?
Teach this kid a little fuckin' manners!
"Hey Jimmy, what's right is right."
-You understand what I'm talkin' about?
-lt's alright.
"The kids over here, we're hugging and kissing over here and then 2 minutes later he's acting like a fucking jerk."
"No, no, no, nah."
You insulted him a little bit.
You got a little out of order yourself.
-l didn't.
-You insulted him a little.
-l didn't insult nobody.
Give us a drink.
-Okay.
"Come on, let's have some drinks, alright?"
But please don't be sad.
It isn't your fault.
"Hey everyone at my funeral, you don't have to be sad."
Death is natural.
Just...feel a little bad.
I won't get to see Je's baby's face.
Kai
I won't get to play badminton with you anymore.
It was really fun that night.
Shit!
"In the end, I forgot to retouch the photo for mom."
Doc
I didn't get to tell you about the beach.
"Actually, I wanted to say sorry about the other day."
And...
"I wanted to talk to you again, even as just a friend."
Shit!
Actually I'm missing out on a lot.
So the doctor told you not to die.
Body.
I am sorry.
I surrender.
"But you won't forgive me, right?"
Goodbye everyone.
Is this the last thing I see in this life?
It isn't even beautiful.
Hello Peng.
Hey you.
Don't call me a douchebag.
But your job isn't finished.
Just a little more.
I asked Lisa to send one day late.
She's like a guy.
What more could you ask for?
- I'm telling her I'm with you.
- No.
"Michael, what are you doing?"
Don't tell her you're out with me.
"No, I'm gonna screw it up."
I can't lie.
You're both gonna hate me forever.
Leave me out of it.
- I have faith in you.
- No.
Come here.
Michael.
Come here.
"Michael, Michael."
"Hey, Michael, come here a second."
My boss said to tell you that there's this guy who really wants to buy this thing coming by tomorrow.
But he is full of shit.
"I mean, I've worked here for three years."
You're the first people I ever showed it to.
"Smoked a lot of weed in there, though."
It's good for that.
- Hello.
"- Izzy, your father, he isn't breathing."
You need to get home quickly.
Okay.
I called the ambulance and the fire volunteers.
I gotta go.
Chris is moving into Kenny's?
"I think so, so they can, like, figure some stuff out."
I don't get it.
"Yeah, I missed you in sixth period."
"Yeah, I kind of skipped."
You can get your jaw off the floor now.
He's got you skipping school?
"Lucas, talk to me when you get your tattoo removed."
Alright.
Lucas!
What are you doing?
I'm taking care of my little girl.
You are such a trouble maker.
"Daddy stop it, come on."
Don't.
Stop.
"Hey, sit down, Rake Boy."
Hey.
I'm never gonna live that one down.
Probably not.
"It's okay, he can be way worse."
What have you got there?
- You're reading Faulkner in school now?
"- No, I just love his stuff."
So what did you do last night?
I saw you with Peyton.
What are you talking about?
You two just looked pretty friendly.
"Well, that's because we're friends."
And what are we?
"Well, I thought that we were dating."
"Well, it looked more like you were dating Peyton."
How messed up is that?
Brooke!
What was that about?
!
- Nope.
"There's a lot of wedding rings in here, though."
"Sir, we're in a big hurry."
Have you seen a cap and gown and sash?
Man:
"Gentlemen, put your hands together for..."
Val the Dictorian!
"(electronica version of ""Pomp and Circumstance"" plays)"
She definitely looks like she knows stuff.
(sighs)
Credit where credit is due.
She put together a pretty solid act in very little time.
Can you just please help me get my stuff back?
Miss?
Miss?
Val?
Hi.
Heh.
Here's the thing.
"The gown, everything..."
He actually left them here last night.
Manny:
I was having a tête-à-tête with Chyna.
She probably mentioned me.
Hope I didn't lead her on.
"See, I'm going to college soon, and I... and I don't want any loose ends."
I'm in the middle of my act.
"Sure, but the thing is he's got to get it back, so if you could strip a little more in our direction..."
I'm such a screw-up.
"Huh. ""Integrity."""
"It should say ""Perverted Schnapps Maniac."""
Timetable updated.
-Mmm-hmm.
We'll have you out of there in less than two hours.
Has everything been taken care of at your end?
I can't confirm that.
is there a problem?
-No.
"-Get it done, immediately."
What?
Two hours.
"Ugh, this drilling is driving me nuts."
I wanna find David and Meredith.
(tapping THE GUN)
You sure no one else could be in here?
-What?
-Nothing.
I was just thinking they wanted something in the broadcast room.
Gotta get over there.
-Think they got what they came for?
-Let's find out.
It's pretty standard activity.
Two broadcasts yesterday.
Three last night.
There's gotta be something.
What?
What do you got?
Fifteen broadcasts this afternoon.
What?
katherine:
Just 20 minutes apart.
Whoever broke in here didn't do it to stop the broadcasts.
"Well, that's a good thing, right?"
"No, we're not!"
This is totally legit.
"For all this guy knows, we could be mega-minted poshos in disguise."
It would be a superb disguise.
Cheers.
"Take us to the bed section, my good man."
I want to try one of them.
Mm-hm.
Security!
Agh.
This chair is like a torture device.
I've asked Flavia for one with back support so many times.
At least you get a chair.
I have to stand still all day.
Think you could stand a bit stiller?
Hard to score if you're jiggling.
I don't want you to score!
Come on!
Getting balls in your jug is the only fun part of my day.
Stop it!
Calm down.
I don't want them in my jug.
"Open your mouth, then."
Give him something to aim at.
I don't want your balls in my mouth!
"It might shut you up for once, water boy."
Sorry.
He's been trying to get balls in my jug all day.
I don't care.
Paper balls.
Stop talking.
Water man.
Books?
Butterfly knife?
"Yeah, Dean."
- You okay?
- Sure.
Sammy...
"I mean, look, this is the third school we've been to this year, and it's only November."
I'm just sick of always being the new kid.
You'll be fine.
"If anyone gives you any trouble, you let me know."
Relax.
"Dad said this hunt will take him two weeks, tops."
"As soon as he gets back, we're out of here."
To another school.
Awesome.
"Ladies and gentlemen, please say hello to Sam Winchester."
"Hi, Sam."
"Class, say hello to our new student, Dean Winchester."
"Dean, is there anything you'd like to tell us about yourself?"
"Not really, sweetheart."
Take your seat.
Is there anything you'd like to tell us about yourself?
Not really.
Okay.
"Uh, grab a seat."
"Whoa, that's yours?"
Awesome!
"Dean, where are your books?"
"Don't need 'em, sugar."
Not gonna be here long enough anyway.
"All right, gang."
Essay assignment.
!
I'll get you some.
"Do you want plain ones, or ones with our address on it?"
Address on it?
!
How many sheets?
"Well, how many are you going to use?"
Manager!
Just enough for one?
Tell me.
Manager!
Manager!
Yes?
Testing...
testing...
There you are.
I've never met such insolence in my life!
"I come down here to get some lavatory paper, and she starts asking me the most insulting, personal things I've ever heard in my life!"
I thought she wanted writing paper.
"- I'm talking to you, Watt!"
- Watt?
Are you deaf?
I said I'm talking to you.
I've never met such insolence in my life.
She said people use it in the lounge.
"- Yes, she thought..."
- Then she starts asking me...
"- No, please listen..."
- Appalling questions about...
I can explain.
"No, you see, she thought you wanted to write."
Wanted a fight?
Last night was terrible.
You look good.
That's impossible at my age.
Even more now... that I'm dying.
Don't say that.
I'm dying!
"Come on Jacoba, you have to be strong!"
I don't want to!
I'm dying...
It's all because of your son.
It's a girl.
Don't you remember?
Why do you blame her?
He's a selfish person.
"When he was small, he was so quiet."
Probably he was thinking what he was going to do later.
He was really cute.
And very obedient.
You know already what happened when he grew up.
He turned out to be so ugly!
Now that we're married I can tell you...
He took away my house.
You said the house was for me.
But he came back and took it away.
So I told him I was leaving to die in other place.
Don't listen to her.
She doesn't know what she's saying.
I know what I'm saying!
Who's that?
She's a nun.
She takes care of you.
You're younger.
"So, as you can see, the mystery of who pooped the bed has been solved."
"And yes my friends, in a way, you're all guilty."
I did it.
- What?
- I did 'em all.
I did all the poops.
- Really?
"- Yeah, I did everyone of them."
"I even did one, while she was rappin us, right here."
- Dude!
- Jesus!
God!
"Why would you do that, dude?"
Because poop is funny.
I guess poop is very funny.
- Poop is funny.
- He pooped on the floor.
"You know what, well-played my man!"
Well-played!
I hate my life.
"Seriously dude, don't ever poop in our bed again."
How is it on the rooftop?
Door is locked.
Hostage situation.
"Michael, do I wait for you?"
"Don't wait, I'll tell dad!"
"Just $20, 000 in such a high-class restaurant?"
"Well, it's high-class, so we use cards."
Where's the safe?
Open it!
Why would I have the key?
Have you ever seen him in our apartment before?
No.
It's not fucking normal.
Did you tell him about the camera?
No.
- Were you planning on it?
"- No, never!"
Then what the fuck is he doing in the apartment?
I said I don't know!
"Okay, is he dangerous?"
"Well, he takes bets from shady assholes like me."
"So, yeah, he's dangerous."
But...
I don't see Marcus here.
That's his goon.
"If I were in trouble, he'd be in this photo."
"Well, what if he's sitting over here?"
Out of view?
(CHEWING)
"I was up early this morning, and I heard him moving around in his room."
He came out about an hour ago.
Hasn't said a word.
"I don't know what those red pills are, but he's taken at least two of them already."
(SIGHS) Can you guys shut up for a sec?
(DIALS)
(BEEPS)
MAN:
Yeah?
"Hey, Ivan, it's Jasper."
I know.
How's it going?
What?
Jim.
"Come on, kids."
Time to go now.
BRlCE:
"I'm sorry, Lutie."
I shouldn't have come back.
I've brought everything to life again.
"And the children, Brice, they don't know me."
I'm not sure they even liked me.
They were just waiting for the time to go home.
They don't need me.
They don't need anything from me.
"Listen to me, Lutie, you and I, we could get Brock."
He's ours.
Let Brewton have Sarah Beth.
We could take Brock away.
He belongs with you and me.
We'd get as far away from here as trains could carry us.
"This is our last chance, Lutie."
The last chance for the three of us.
"I can't go away with you, Brice."
"I can't have Brock and I can't have Sarah Beth so I'm gonna go, but I'll go alone."
And you've got nothing for me;
"Not enough, Brice."
Not enough for that.
Come on in.
Doc.
"Glad Mac got you here, Jim."
Haven't been seeing very much of you lately.
-l haven't been looking for you.
-So I noticed.
I used to love you like the son I never had.
I wasn't okay until now but...
I'll feel better after I meet you.
Actually I'm going out to see my brother.
He's throwing a party today.
Why don't you two come too.
He's invited influential people.
Fine send me the address.
I'll be there.
Okay I'll send it right now.

"Thankyou,Jenna."
"Thanks, you guys."
I appreciate it.
Please...you have to tell him.
HMM.
THAT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE...
FOR A FEE.
THE FEE IS NOT AN ISSUE.
COME ON BACK.
I DON'T GET MUCH CALL FOR THE GOOD STUFF ANYMORE.
MOST OF MY BUSINESS IS JUST TEENAGERS

HOW ABOUT PULLING YOUR SLEEVE BACK?

"YEAH, TELL HIM IT'S JUMBO."
"WELL, HOW MANY JUMBOS YOU THINK HE KNOWS?"
"MIKE, LOOK AT THE DEAL I GOT ON THESE SHOES."
"- Total shock, which I love."
"- I'm like, ""Wait."
"What?"""
- What's happening?
- Wait a minute.
What?
"- ""Why are you grabbing on me?"" - ""What's going on?"""
There was previously a scene there with Mike and a transvestite.
- You can catch that on the DVD too.
"- Oh, yeah, I forgot about that."
- In the deleted scenes.
- That's what I was recovering from.
"Are most of the scenes that are deleted on there, or did you pick and choose?"
We got a great scene with Kat and Jesus.
We've got Trannie Tris.
- Thank God.
- Trannie Tris.
- All the oldies but goodies are there.
- Do you say:
"- ""When I say 'Jesus' you say 'Christ""'?"
- That's in there.
Yes.
- That was fun.
- Yup.
Do you have the bathroom scene at the?
In the Catholic school.
Is that in there?
"- No, I'm afraid not."
- No.
"- That was kind of omitted, right?"
"- Oh, God."
- That was fun.
I've only seen him a few times...
Why?
You think this is related to the murder case?
Maybe.
I began to believe that two of victims were part of a Satanic cult.
What?
We found another body few days ago...
Same M.O. The victim was completely drained of blood...
But there were bite marks on the victim's neck.
Small ones.
Like a child's

"The cause of the fire is still under investigation, but.... ...Hey."
...Hey.
You... have to invite me in.
It's your home
What if I don't...?
Why can't you just come in...?
Is there something in your way...?
No!
By your command.
Master.
"What is it, lord Tyranus?"
I have done as you've asked.
Asajj Ventress is dead.
"Once again, you've proven your loyalty to me."
You took quite a beating there.
"Didn't you, missy?"
Which side of the battle was you on?
"Not too talkative, are you?"
Take me to Dathomir.
"Now, why would anyone want to go there?"
Ain't nothing there but fog and witches.
Exactly.
We don't like strangers.
I'm not a stranger.

She is one of us.
Take her to the village.
- Who is she?
- What is she doing here?

He's a friend.
We've got to rent a room if we're gonna make ends meet...

You won't know he's there.
I'II cage him.
until you feel sorry for him and set him free in the house!
"Do you remember the raccoon, Hogarth?"
I remember the raccoon.
"please, Mom, at Ieast look at him."
AII right.
Where is this guy?
I can't read this handwriting.
"That one should have lettuce, tomato, extra mayo."
"I will go get him, okay?"
So he wants us to hold the mayo and the mustard.
How about just hold the flavor altogether?
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Sir?
Excuse me--!
-What's that?
-please don't move.
My pet's under your table.
Don't look!
"If you make a scene, my mom won't let me keep him."
"-What kind of pet, kid?"
-A squirrel.
He's friendly.
"I'm telling the truth, dang it!"
I'm a retired investor on a pension.
"I went to Israel to live there as a Jew, in the twilight of my life."
"Hey, Frankie!"
"Come on out, let's play some Hearts."
Frankie!
Is it true you're worth over 300 million dollars?

This is my friend Carlo Rizzi.
-You know my brother Fredo.
-Sure.
"This is my stepbrother Tom, and that's his girl Theresa."
This cute little thing is my sister Connie.
Say hello to Carlo.
"He's good-looking, isn't he?"
Yes.
The droopy thing is Mike.
We call him Joe College.
Sit down.
Talk to each other.
"Hey, Mr. Einstein..."
-The cake.
"-Sally, get in here!"
-I was scared.
"As long as she's breathing, we've got fate up against the ropes."
There he is.
"All right, so the bike was stolen in Emeryville."
Head back towards the Bay Bridge.
Okay.
There's your man.
Go to the toll plaza.
- There!
- Yes!
"Okay, the wrist."
Can you max that image?
Can I max that image...
"What can you tell from a tattoo, or whatever that is?"
You're looking at a guy that solved a triple murder in Cole Valley off a bent coke spoon.
Can you make that any clearer?
Not with the tools at hand.
"All right, send me a screen cap."
I'll send it to Jenny.
She'll work on it.
Go back to where he stole the bike...
Hollis and 38th.
He had to have put on the helmet somewhere.
"All right, so, here he is at 60th... 57th..."
That's weird.
Okay.
It's okay.
I'll get him at 48th.
Is the camera broken?
"No, they're different cameras."
Go back to 60th.
What?
Somebody's erasing this... right now.
- Me?
- And then he literally zipped his lips and threw away the key.
What's he gonna tell you?
"What, am I a fortune teller?"
You gonna put him in a room with me?
"Stripped, bound, and shackled."
"I told him nobody would be listening, but I was lying."
Man of the hour.
Who's speaking?
You have zero idea what he wants to tell you?
Invite me to Ruby's talent show?
Where are you?
"Market, crossing Geary."
DeBray's in the car ahead of me with Sarneau.
"All right, I'll see you in 30 seconds."
I'm headed out the door.
"If you want to shoot me in the back, my spinal column starts right here."
Get an ambulance!
"Stand back, sir."
"Hey, hey!"
What did you have to tell me?
They stopped looking for... ffor me.
Who did?
Who?
They didn't keep looking...
Who didn't keep looking?
The whole world's looking for you.
Who?
Hey!
Hey!
He...
"He took mine, so I..."
- It's the'80s.
The'70s.
"By the way, I'm sorry"
I came down on you a little hard at Leena's.
It's whatever.
"It's just 'cause I owe you, for helping me and saving Joshua."
"I mean, the guy hurt you."
It pisses me off.
If finding MacPherson...
Yeah.
"Just help me lift this thing, would you, on three."
"Well, can Mrs. Frederic find him?"
I don't know.
On three.
"One, two, three."
"The guy used to work here though, right?"
"And, what, the place drove him nuts?"
Something lured him to the dark side?
"He is the dark side and things are lured to him, people especially, which is why you're never gonna mention his name ever again."
- Just to you.
"- To anyone, promise me."
Is that Myka?
Whatever it is...
It's not good.
Red five.
- You're pushing our luck.
- And it's pushing right back.
- Take a break.
- I'm okay.
We've got enough.
Nobody's legs are getting broken.
Everybody's paid off.
"Well, yeah."
"Okay, don't start doodling my name on your binder, okay?"
I just mean...
"I mean, I like you the way I like basset hounds."
Something pathetic about them.
You just wanna cheer them up.
Again with the sensitivity.
To sensitivity.

It looks good.
JAVIER:
Yeah.
JANINE:
Yeah.
- He does good work.
"- Yeah, he does."
JANINE:
Very nice.
Very nice.
- Javier?
- Yeah.
Javier if I asked you an honest question do you think you could give me an honest answer?
- I think so.
"- Good, good."
Because I think some of your guys might be smoking.
Javier?
- Is that the question?
- Yes.
- Seemed like a statement.
- The question part's implied.
I really didn't hear it in the inflection.
Javier have you guys been smoking or not?
Come show me.
Why are you wearing these glasses?
What if he recognize me?
"Bhai, really you have..."
what?
Glasses.

This hand's too good to waste on a bluff.
Ooh.

"All right, I think both of y'all are bluffing."
So here's what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna see your 10 and I'm gonna raise you 20.

Hello?
Elizabeth?
SHE SOBS
The policeman...
He came back.
Where were you?
"Don't lie to me, Elizabeth."
Number five.
What did we agree about going upstairs?
Something bad always happens when you go upstairs.
I'm sorry.
Did he see you?
"The policeman, did he see you?"
I hit him.
I had to.
I had to get out of there.
"One day we're going to have to find a way to give all this back, aren't we?"
"I'm sorry, Mr Sellers."
Shh.
Get some rest.
"Peggy, where the hell are you?"
Call me back.
The poster design meeting with Elaine Markham and Peggy Scott?
"I'm so sorry, my partner's been delayed."
"OK, that's not a problem."
Jesus Christ!
I almost registered you as a missing person.
"I bet you didn't, though."
"Well, we didn't get the contract."
Probably not surprising as half of us didn't even show up.
I don't care about the stupid contract.
Leave Franz alone!
"You're in love with him, aren't you?"
"You don't wanna work for me, huh?"
- No!
- Say that again!
Let me go!
"You two, come here!"
"You're my friend, you saved my life."
"Here, take my crown."
"Franz, my dear Franz."
"Hmm, what's up?"
I just don't get this.
"Franz, don't you think we should move somewhere else?"
- Why?
"- I got money, I'll borrow you some."
Why?
I like it here.
You sent that guy away and tonight we're stuck.
We have a replacement.
First-class.
Who?
- He's a decent man.
- You'll see how I'll change his mind.
"I wanna move, to some suburb."
Come in!
"Cilly, a man is waiting outside for you."
Just seeing a tax return paper makes me go crazy.
I just don't know.
"Reinhold lets you know that they need someone tonight, you know the deal."
They want Franz to come over.
Reinhold sent this paper.
He wants you to come over.
"Said it was an accident, but-"
"I sentJasper away, and I ran."
Who are they?
They're your new best friends.
Stay here.
Ah.
"Well, what a piece of work she is."
"So, Evelyn used you to do the grunt work to track him down."
She shows up and finishes the job.
"And when she kills him, everyone comes looking for you."
She seemed so nice.
"Mike, she went through Lucy to get to you."
- Yeah.
Call Lucy.
Evelyn's not the type to leave loose ends.
- Right.
Oh.
Almost forgot.
That's for you.
- Evelyn has the Charger?
- Yeah.
It's gonna need some work.
- And your gun?
- Removed the trigger bar spring.
"Oh, that sounds like something you would do."
"You guys really do have a lot in common, don't ya?"
"Look, Fi."
"I know you're enjoying this, but now's not the time to say ""I told you so. """
"- This isn't like you, Michael."
"- Well, then go ahead-"
I know.
Fiona...
I thought you just said you were here to see Livi.
- I did.
"- Oh, well in that case, go right through."
"Gee, thanks."
"Yeah, exsqueeze me."
"Livi is the biggest star on the planet, she doesn't just talk to anyone."
But I have something really important to give her.
I'll only be a minute.
You'll need to speak to Megan.
"Uh, uh..."
"Livi, how's my superstar?"
You look fabulous.
"Megan, you can't see me."
I...
"I don't need to, darling, you always look fabulous."
"Well, I don't right now, how's the new song coming along?"
"Oh, it's fantastic, a guaranteed hit."
"Great, I'll be at the studio in 10 minutes."
Can't wait to hear it.
"Um, yeah, me too."
Ciao.
"Wow, this new song sounds special."
It better be.
"Otherwise, we're in for it."
What'?
"Hello, I'm Megan, the studio manager."
Hi.
I'm Mia.
"I brought this demo for Livi to listen to, and I hope that..."
A demo?
"Don't worry, I'll deal with this."
Err...
I'll tell you what her father'd say.
He'd say he's gonna kill himself a crab!
That's what he'd say!
I'm gonna march meself straight home right now and tell him just like I should have done the minute...
"And don't you shake your head at me, young lady."
Maybe there's still time.
"If we could get that witch to give you back your voice, you could go home with all the normal fish and just be..."
Just be...
Just be miserable for the rest of your life.
"All right, all right."
I'll try to help ya find that prince.
"Boy, what a soft shell I'm turning out to be."

Good.
What's on your mind?
Clear all the charges against Shiv... and set him free.
Once his connection's severed from you...
I'll cut his connection with life permanently.
Wow!
What an idea!
Great.
I'm the boss after all.
Free advice along with contract.
Fine.
I'll give Shiv clean chit and release him.
Good.
But don't mess up the contract.
He won't.
How can he?
When he kills Shiv I'll be with him.

Something like a coffee or a film.

Get away from there immediately!

- Go into hiding with a friend!
As an inspector has no friends but lots of enemies.
Then go to No.1 Hua Shi Street right away.
Where is it?
"Don't worry, I'll get someone to contact you."

"If someone says 'l am woman,' that means 'He's a friend.'"

We're doing this job without you.
Shit.

All right.
7:00 AM we leave from here.
8:30 we arrive at the house.
I back the van all the way up to the front.
"8:35, you pick the lock, and open the side door."
Okay.
"Blair keeps the van running', and you and me load up."
Good job.
And no more car privileges.
Give me your keys.
Give 'em to me!
"Oh, for the love of God."
"Mom, you want me to... no."
"Mom, come on, let me just... mom."
Mom!
What is going on with you?
Is this about Allison?
Do you really wanna know?
Yeah.
Is this about your father?
"It is, isn't it?"
"Okay, you know what, um..."
We'll talk about this at home.
I'm gonna go get the car.
I'm the worst son ever.
"Well, I'm not exactly winning any prizes either."
Dammit!
"You give him a restraining order, and he's mocking you!"
He was mo... and what do I do about going to the bathroom?
So why do we need their help?
Because it's harder to kill than I thought.
I still don't know who it is.
And they do?
They might.
Which is why I need one of you to get on their good side.
Scott or Stiles?
Either.
"You know, the full moon's coming, Derek."
I'm aware of that.
These look comfortable.

"Johnson's been around both leagues, but seems to have found a home here in the Bronx."

I normally don't like sweet.

Would you mind terribly if we muted the TV?
- What are you doing?
- Nothing much.
All right.
Would it be all right if I sat down?

- I'm heading for the kitchen.
Idiot.
André's got guts.
He does love me.
I'm sure he prefers me to his mother.
I share him so I can act better in the play.
Do you understand?
You've no right to judge me!
You've got too much fog in your head for that!
At last!
It's okay.
He's clean.
"Hey, St. Fruitcake, do you have news from Mickey for Mary?"
- I don't know where he is.
- Same as Mary...
You've come to join the winning team?
I've been telling you that he would find me.
He's my puppy.
Like my sweet little brother!
He knows about tomorrows.
"I'll give you your tomorrows, but hands off my today!"
"Mary got back her ticket, but for a price."
- What's the matter?
"- You know, Frank."
You look terrible.
You should take a vacation.
I don't want a vacation.
"I got 18 years in, you know?"
I save up my time.
I put in my hours.
I'm eligible for pension in 6 months.
I don't want any vacation.
So what is it?
Get the deputy mayor off my ass.
"""Shrimpboats""?"
Him.
Yeah.
You couldn't handle him?
It was easy.
That's what I'm saying.
It was too easy.
Don't throw bouquets at me
Don't please my folks too much
Don't laugh at my jokes too much
People will say we're in love

Yeah?
Something exciting?
"I think so, yes."
I have a 3-year-old boy.
"I wanted to throw the napkin on the floor, push over the table and run."
Brilliant.
I love kids.
Yeah.
I like messing about with them.
Doing kid things.
I'd have been disappointed if you didn't have a child.
Why do you say that?
God knows.
Mainly because it sounded smooth and winning.
Because I love kids so much.
They're so lovely.
And he got 'em all!
- You want another one?
- Not another banana joke.
Can I take one of you?
"- So, you pull the thing back?"

I don't feel like smiling.

Deck 'shun!
Quick march!
"Company, halt!"
"All right, fall out."
I'm sorry for the man who hears the pipes and who isn't born in Scotland.
Standby to enplane.
Enplane.
"Climb aboard, boys."
Good luck to you.
I'll see you back at the camp in the morning.
"I hope so, Sir."
"Listen, everybody."
This is Flight Sergeant Box.
He's our radar dismantling expert.
Get out!
Get out!
I helped you!
Out!
Shame on you!
You rat!
You swine!
Get out!
"""She's so gentle, so faithful..."""
I almost killed you... like I killed Ida.
"I want to go straight, but it's too hard."
Guys like me never get a break.
I'm going for a drive in the country with Karl.
I'm tired of doing nothing.
We've got some accounts to settle in Weissensee.
Ede and Biberkopf have to go along.
- You're taking Franz?
- Yeah.
When will you be back?
Tonight at the earliest.
All right.
"Hello, young lady."
My friend Biberkopf sent me with a message.
He'll be home late tonight.
He asked you to come by?
Not exactly.
I just thought I'd come over and patch things up from last night.
- What do you really want?
- I told you!
"And there's nothing wrong with calling on a pretty girl, is there?"
"I thought, ""It's a beautiful day."
"Let's drive out into the country."""
- Guilty.
- And Vikram Kapoor?
I made him confess to the police.
That's all?
"Yeah, that's all."
"In fact, I wasn't even with him when he killed himself."
"Well, then how do you know he is no more?"
Only the police know about this.
"You do have a phone, don't you?"
"Trust me, no tricks."
00-44- 777-
946-02-41
May I?
"Now what is it, Sia?"
"Good evening, Mr. Ravenscar."
You?
What the heck are you doing there?
I had no choice.
I was right.
"You've been bought, haven't you?"
For God's sake!
"Look, it's not what you think, Sia."
This horrible creature you have in front of you is...
"Major Arjun Singhania, International Vigilance Squad."
Deep undercover in the Turkish drug cartel.
Major Arjun Singhania?
"And he outranks you, so please be nice."
"And now if you'll excuse me, I'd like to get back to my work."
You're a police officer?
Even I hate surprises.
Okay.
"So, what do I call you?"
Cheaper than plastic surgery.
How's the bite?
I'm not howling at the moon.
There is no moon.
- How did it go?
- What?
The meeting.
It was boring.
You went?
Yeah.
"I just said it was boring, didn't I?"
"Sorry, they didn't give me a card."
You went for you or because you promised me you would?
Is this guy gonna look like hamburger?
More like ground chuck.
I went for you.
- You're gonna need some more people.
- Why?
"Come on, hard restraints!"
- No IV?
-20 of morphine before he pulled out.
"- Sir, we need you to hold still."
"- Come on, Gallant, keep him on the table."
"-100 of fent, two of Ativan."
"- Page Surgery, Plastics, Head and Neck."
- Could be PCP.
- Or the gunshot wound.
"Sir, we're gonna help you."
But you gotta hold still...
- ... while we get the morphine into you.
"- Okay, pressure 100/80."
"- Pulse, 150."
[Radio Chatter]
"[Man, Indistinct]"
[Horn Honks]
I don't want to get into this.
I gotta have time.
I can't get any more time.
"- Give me some fuckin' time, will you?"
- You're not gonna get it.
We found a set of works on the kid driving the sports car over there.
His girlfriend's in the back of the car.
She's dead.
- Give the car a complete toss.
- I say we keep sitting' on Boca.
"Jimmy, give it up."
Give it up.
It's all over with.
"If there was a deal, it's gone down by now."
We blew it.
We blew our warrants.
We blew our cover.
"Walter, listen."
I know the deal hasn't gone down.
I— I know it.
I can feel it.
I'm dead certain.
"Last time you were dead certain, we ended up with a dead cop."
Hey!
Hold— Hold on!
Hold on!
"Break it up, both of you!"
Will you two break it up?
Stop it now.
It's all clear!
"Shooters, with a magazine of 20 rounds, as you were, and a magazine with 30 rounds!"
"Shooters, you may commence fire when you see your target!"
"Shooters, it is time."
You're gonna stand.
What are you doing here?
"Uh, just, uh, checking for drainage problems."
Out here?
"Uh, you know what?"
"It's okay, 'cause, uh, I'm with septic."
He's got a ca--
Quiet.
Quiet.
Quiet.
Quiet.
Quiet.
Is somebody out there?
Go.
"Go, go."
Give me your jacket.
"- Go, go."
"- Come here, come here."
Okay.
Go.
You are being read into the Have Blue program.
This is a top-secret U.S. government project administered by the Department of Defense.
You must have some pretty powerful friends to get us here on a Sunday.
To get us here at all.
We're not supposed to be talking about this to anyone.
Not even our wives.
They have people watching our wives.
You know that?
"""Only courage!"
"The results are shining!"""
"""You've no more business in the factory."

The inventor has meanwhile become most needy and turns for the last time to the one who cheated him.
All pleas are in vain.
The poor man finds support under his comrades.
The inventor is a hero.
The conscience of the factory owner triumphs over greed.
The hard days are over.
The end.

The morning's work for the young Jenny.
After a wild night.
Wait for me at 4 o'clock at the front door.
The means to an end.
Clothes make the man.
How to find a REAL life ...
An agonizing wait.
"Mom, Dad, you did all the hard work getting me through high school."
You deserve a gift.
But what do you get the Cadillac of parents?
A Rolls-Royce.
"Oh, my goodness!"
How did you afford that?
"- It was only $2,000."
- Huh.
"Judge Thompson, from the club,"
- got me into a police auction.
- Huh.
"If I had 40 more dollars, you'd be looking at a speedboat."
"So, what do you think?"
It's... it's wow.
- Right?
!
"- I loved the macaroni necklace he made me in first grade, and I even used the perfume he gave me in fifth grade, but this car is so gaudy."
People are gonna think I played for the Knicks in the '70s.
It's the most beautiful gesture
- I have ever seen.
- (car door opens)
It's 100% class.
"Hey, Mom, didn't you say you had some errands to run?"
Oh.
I... in a little while.
"Uh, yeah."
"But... um, gosh, it's got fur."
Wow.
It's like driving a lion.
"Hey, before you go, give us a honk."
All right.
"(horn honks to the tune of ""We're in the Money"")"
Going out with Alice?
Where's Henry?
"Uh, I don't know."
Alice probably called him.
We'll probably meet up.
Probably?
It's not a big deal.
Are you leaving out Henry for some reason?
No.
You and Alice dating?
Got plans to sleep with her again?
Dad!
No.
"We are not dating, exactly."
And I do not have plans to sleep with her.
"But if that were going to happen, you wouldn't have Henry around."
"Oh, I'll call Henry."
Henry doesn't know you slept with Alice?
No.
He does not.
And I'd like to forget that ever happened and so would Alice.
Let me make a suggestion.
"Hang out with Henry, or Henry and Alice, not just Alice."
You slept with her.
She's not just a friend.
"Geez, Dad, what is going on here?"
What is going on here is I think you might be sneaking around trying to see Dylan.
Where did that come from?
I'll tell you where it came from.
Dylan's father.
"He called me asking about Henry, if I know Henry."
Dylan's going out with Henry tonight.
"- 'Cause it's notyou, it's the system."
- [Coughing]
The system won't letyou stop it.
[Boy] That's right.
There's...
There's more atstake here...
- than whatyou wantorwhat I want.
- Then what's the point?
What's the pointof being president?
You're powerless!
- No!
"- No, I'm not powerless."
Because...
"Because I understand the system, I believe I can, uh..."
"I can control it, maybe notcontrol ittotally, buttame itenough to make it do some good."
Sounds like you're talking abouta wild animal.
"Yeah, maybe I am."
"We really must go, Mr. President."
Please.
"- [Girl] Hey, what about the war, man?"
- When you gonna get us out?
[Agent] The old man's moving.
- [Haldeman] Move it.
Getaway.
"- [Nixon] She got it, Bob."
- Nineteen-year-old college kid.
- What?
Who?
She understood something that's taken me 25 years in politics to understand.
"The C.I.A., the Mafia, those Wall Street bastards."
- Sir?
- The beast.
These gentlemen came to see the house.
They were just leaving.
Good afternoon.
- Who is that?
Do you know him?
- The watchman?
Never seen him in my life.
"Take a stroll, Jesus."
Drive.
I'll tell you where to go.
Go inside.
Go on.
Have a seat.
"Eugenio, give them something to drink, it's hot."
"The heroin Rodrigo found was mine, but he didn't find it, he stole it."
But I didn't kill anyone.
That's Fermin over there.
Angelita is his wife.
You've already met.
She's not psychic.
Fermin was at the farmhouse the night the girls were killed.
He knows more than what was in the well.
But there's a price.
What do you want?
Withdraw the Civil Guard from the Point.
Okay or not?
- Okay.
"- Tell them, Fermin."
I saw the man who threw the bag in the well.
- What did he look like?
"- I didn't see his face, it was too dark."
"But he was normal, a normal person."
Who do you think you are?
- You can't treat those boys like animals.
- I'll treat them any way I like.
"- And if you don't like it, you can leave."
- I will.
"But I warn you if I can get to the authorities, you haven't heard the end."
"Miss Griffith, I demand your resignation immediately."
And you can have it.
- I've been waiting for that.
- Yeah.
Come in.
"- Hello, Miss Griffith."
"- Hello, Jimmy."
- Going somewhere?
- Yes.
Where you going?
I'm leaving.
You're kidding.
"No, I'm not."
First Patsy and then you.
"I'm not quitting you, Jimmy."
I've been fired.
Thompson fired me.
What?
Jimmy.
"Quite a delegation of our boys to see you, chief."
A delegation?
- What do they want?
"- I don't know, sir."
- How did they--?
- They got a hold of Walters.
He seemed a little scared and he told them they could see you.
"- Yeah, why do you care?"
You only get to do a first date once.
It should be... fun and sexy and...
ask really good questions.
Ask him why he first decided he wanted to save lives.
"Ooh, ask him what his best surgery ever was."
I know how to go on a date.
Why is Meredith eating pot roast?
It's a show lunch for the mommy.
She's freaking out.
That ponytail?
It's gonna blow.
"Derek tells me you--you, uh, grew up right here in Seattle."
Are your parents...
"Mm, dead."
Mer's mother died last year.
"Oh, I'm so sorry."
And your father?
Oh.
"You know, I should go check on the patient who's the serial killer."
Who's here.
"Not killing people, so that's good."
- I should go.
- Yeah.
"Family isn't her favorite topic, okay?"
She's had a rough time of it.
- I didn't say a word.
- I know what you're thinking.
I was thinking...
It must be awful for you.
Treating a murderer.
Dad died a long time ago.
"Shut, fucking you, right!"
She's just want to bring you up.
So easy!
I'll go to another announcement.
I got a placement to work and gone.
"Congratulations, dude."
6 months.
And I am to start in September.
And...?
"The fucking practice,"
"All do I ... shippings, all the high power plants,..."
Shipping costing world!
Smile everyone!
"It's not ideal, obviously, but..."
Are you to need a train right away?
It isn't America or something?
You're deciding too fast!
I just found out this afternoon.
Look!
"Look, look, look!"
"You're right, I shall discuss with them."
"What's up, guys!"
He's the laugh dog.
Luke!
"What's up, bro?"
So...
- What do you get for us?
- For Paul also...
"How about a drop of the white stuff, tickle soft?"
"Paul first, doen't he?"
I should not...
"- Almost for Paul, man."
Of course I am.
I'm fine.
"Hey, Mom."
Mom.
"Hey, Mom."
What?
I'm trying to sleep.
"Uh, I was just making sure you're alive."
"I'm sorry, sweetie, it was a late night."
My head is throbbing.
"Yeah, um, I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't bring the party home."
I'm sure the neighbors would appreciate it.
It wasn't a party.
It was one guy.
Don't be so judgy.
"Yeah, well, I talked to Roberta at the Grill."
And there's still a bartending position open if you wanted to get a job.
"Well, I figured she'd still be pissed about the last time I worked there."
I think she's desperate.
I'll check it out.
- Yeah?
- Don't act so surprised.
I just...
I didn't know how long you planned on sticking around.
"- Well, there is back rent due."
"- There's back everything, Mom."
"Like I said, I'll check it out."
- Who's that?
- It's Caroline.
Easy.
Yeah.
Come in.
"Oh, yeah."
No.
My boyfriend.
He hurt you?
"Uh, you want me to call the cops?"
No.
No.
That'll only make things worse.
"I just want to go to his place, pick up my stuff."
If I just had an hour.
[phone rings] [ring] [beep]
Bernhardt Bail Bonds.
Otto speaking.
I'm at the bar.
Come see me now.
[click]
"Yeah, it, uh..."
"Well, no, no, no, sir, we don't, and, um, I would..."
I would appreciate it if you would take us off your list.
[beep]
"Hey, uh, you mind watching the place for a few minutes while I go hit the head?"
You don't have a toilet?
"Oh, it's busted."
Goddamn landlord doesn't want to pay to fix it.
We've been using the bar down the street.
"Anyone stops in, just tell them I'll be back in five or thereabouts."
"At my age, it may take a little longer."
[honking]
Hey.
"Hey, why'd you park me in?"
"Hey, what the fuck, man?"
Why'd you park me in?
He didn't.
It was my idea.
I knew she needed a transplant.
"You can arrest me now, detective."
I'm ready to go.
"Detective Munch brought you here tonight, didn't he?"
He is in a lot of trouble.
He did it for me.
I would never say that in court.
Read my lips carefully.
John Munch never came to your apartment tonight.
He never brought you here.
"In fact, you don't even know where this place is."
You got it?
Yes.
Detective Stabler.
What are you doing here?
- Have you arrested Mr. McGovern?
- Yes.
What's gonna happen to him?
Have to hand him over to the FBI.
He'll probably go to prison.
For trying to save his son's life?
Because he bought that kidney.
He had no choice.
His son will die without it.
I know why he did it.
But...
There's nothing I can do.
"I gave you Dr. Swan's name, because I was afraid to die."
"If Kyle McGovern dies,"
I'll live with that the rest of my life.
Look out.
We've got to find the emergency switches.
"You two go that way, and you two go that way."
"Tony, we must eliminate Tia."
You will cause that portable utility panel to run her down.
"Hey, Tia, come here."
Come on.
"That ain't it, right?"
- You found it!
- I knew it was it!
"But, it's spelt wrong."
You guys get dazzler and muscles.
OK.
Come on.
The rest of the money's just arrived.
All right.
I'd better call Gannon.
The cooling system's on.
Switch it off.
We lost it!
What's going on down there?
It's coming back.
"650, 600..."
Gotcha!
"Tony, you must stop her."
"Tony, why are you doing these things?"
Why are you using your powers against me?
What's happened?
Tony pretend to remember Tia.
Lure her to the center of the room and make that crane drop on her.
Tia!
I'm starting to remember.
"Forget about the drive-bys, how are you supposed to meet anybody ?"
"Um, well, I did actually meet somebody, I think."
"I met this guy, and he's really cool."
-They got white guys at your school?
"-Um... no, actually they don't."
Shut up !
Look at me.
I want my money.
[Girl Crying] ldon't have it.
[Malakai] Shut up !
"Quit your crying, man."
[Girl] ldon't get paid till next week.
You wasn 't saying that when you was smoking it.
-l don't have it !
"-Well, you better find it somewhere."
- This ain't no lay a way plan.
- Hey !
"Hey, stop it !"
Come here.
"Where do you think you're going, huh ?"
Aahh !
Bitch !
"You ain't seen nothing, so don't say nothing... to nobody."
[Derek] I stole a bike here once.
- Why'd you do that ?
- 'Cause I didn't have one.
"- Oh, okay."
Good reason.
"- Well, it's not a reason, you know, I used to do shit like that, you know-- wild shit."
- With Malakai ?
- Yeah.
I don't get you two.
I started making calls because I didn´t wanna wait.
"I told you, we have a small window of opportunity here."
I wanted to exploit the fact that Milliken may not have had time to cover his tracks when he had someone grab Kelly.
All right.
- l have other things to attend to.
- OK.
- ls there anything else?
- That´s it.
"Hello, Nina."
Take her to interrogation 819.
"Yes, sir."
- What´s the security configuration?
- Don´t worry.
We´re handling Nina.
"- Ryan, you know what she´s capable of."
- That´s none of your concern.
- l´m sending you to Medical.
- l´m fine.
- l don´t think you are.
- What´s this about?
We found evidence you´ve been injecting heroin.
"Tell me I´m off here, Jack."
Tell me I´m wrong.
- l didn´t think so.
"- Ryan, I haven´t missed a step. I´m fine."
I have to cover my ass.
I need to get you checked out.
You´re wasting time.
- Kim.
- Yeah.
I thought you´d wanna know your dad´s back.
- What about Chase?
-
- It's true.
She took him in and soon they knew each other as only people can who've had a couple of sessions on the Ouija board.
-- (SHOP BELL) -
- Someone's trying to get through!
'Ey up!
It's Noddy!
Good morning.
What can we do for you?
That's what a person my age should be dressed like!
Not like this!
Call that dressed?
I put more than that on to go to bed in!
"Can we help you in any way, or is it t--too late?"
"Razor--sharp responses, you'll notice."
"Still, we shouldn't mock the afflicted."
Pity about his eyesight.
There's nothing the matter with his eyes!
He's wearing shades 'cause he's cool.
I should think he is cool!
His shirt's open to the kneecaps!
"We're over here, sir!"
He's Mutt and Jeff and all!
-
"- Here we are, sir."
-
- Get off!
-
"- Watch it, creeping up on people!"
-- (ROCK MUSIC BLARES OUT)
-
"- Watch it, creeping up on people."
- I'm seeing Cartoon Head again.
"- Oh, you're not?"
Yeah.
I...
I kept thinking about him.
Wondering what might've happened if we'd stayed together.
What might've happened?
!
He's a paranoid hit man who knocked you about.
- How many more clues d'you need?
- There's another side to him.
- Is it worse?
- He's like a little boy.
With a gun.
"China, you're a delicate precious creature."
I don't want you being taken advantage of and me having to hear about it second-hand.
Nobody is taking advantage of anybody.
"You don't have a blim I could take home, do ya?"
- Course I do.
"- Oh, you're great, you."
You're like me other dad.
"- Your dad never, er?"
"- God, no!"
"Good, good."
Aaaah!
Raargh!
Oooargh!
Raargh!
I don't normally cater for family groups.
I'm nearly done with this baby.
- Today is me last day.
"- That's the beauty of childminding, innit?"
Hey!
Enough!
Enough.
What do you idiots think you're doing?
Jackson!
Calm down!
"Mr. McCall, you wanna explain yourself?"
Stilinski!
You dropped this.
You and you...
"Actually, all of you..."
Detention. 3:00.
"Hi, there."
"Oh, I'll make an announcement, have Scott brought to the office."
"Actually, I came here to talk to you."
Me?
-Busy after school?
-Always.
"Well, unbusy yourself."
I wanna talk to you.
"Actually, I want to show you something."
I thought we'd gotten past the slightly rapey language.
And bring your flower.
We can't be in detention together.
I have a restraining order against these tools.
All of these tools?
"No, just us tools."
Fine.
"You two, over there."
-I'm gonna kill him.
"-No, you're not."
You're going to find out who's controlling him and then you're gonna help save him.
I suppose.
Always managed to find a bit of money from somewhere.
Do you know his name?
Aye.
Said his name was...
T Dan Smith?
No.
Richard.
Richard Grainger.
"But when you find him, tell him there's £2.10 to come back on that."
~ He won't be collecting it.
~ Off the cliff?
"Something like that, yeah."
"~ It's all part of the job, pet lamb."
"~ It isn't, actually."
~ I had to do it.
"~ Oh, please don't tell me this is character-building because you're living proof that it's not."
I could have you disciplined for that.
"~ Go on, then."
~ Lovers' tiff?
"Right, guv, there's three Richard Graingers in the Newcastle area."
"One is four years old, one's 78 and the other one is alive and well and works at The Ministry in Longbenton."
"So, the dead man's not from the area, then?"
Do I amuse you?
"What, is this that T Dan Smith blokey again?"
"He's called Richard Grainger now, is he?"
"Are there any chocolate biscuits, pet?"
What?
What's funny?
"Grainger Street, Grainger Town, Grainger Market."
~ Yeah?
~ Richard Grainger.
"Good night, beautiful."
Good night.
"Doctor, it's so nice of you to come."
My pleasure.
"And, Mrs. Comstock, what a heavenly gown."
How sweet.
Thank you.
"I believe you know Margo Stevens, Doctor and Mrs. Comstock."
- How do you do?
"- How do you do, Miss Stevens?"
"Margo is one of my husband's little golf partners, you know."
It's a shame you've never played yourself.
"Oh, you'd be surprised how much I know about the game."
Now be a dear and get Dr. and Mrs. Comstock a drink
"- for me, will you?"
- Thank you.
"You must come out some time, Mrs. Langley, and give me lessons."
Psst.
Danny.
"Danny, I was afraid you weren't going to come to my party."
I wouldn't have missed it for anything in the world.
My bags are packed.
Everybody'll be squishy by 11.
We can sneak out then.
"We'll drive, Danny."
Anywhere in the world.
11:00.
Anywhere in the world.
"Meet me out at the old garage-- the one behind the gardener's shed, the back road."
I love you.
[fizzing]
"Hello, Howard."
I sleep just fine.
Ok.
And I came to realize it's that fear that's the worst of it.
That's the real enemy.
So... get up.
Get out in the real world.
And you kick that bastard as hard as you can right in the teeth.
Do it again.
Go on.
"$10,000 even."
Same as last time.
It's totally accurate.
"You and I, we are gonna feed this machine."
- I want it running 24 hours a day.
- Right on.
"Not yours, I take it."
"We got 10, 20, 30,"
"44, 45 each."
3 pounds should be 48 each.
- Who's short?
- Ok.
"Don't freak, all right?"
We didn't get ripped off.
Badger hasn't kicked in his full amount.
"I know he's planning on pulling an all-nighter, so he's probably still in the sack."
Then wake him up.
He can sleep after we're paid.
Why you gotta be such a hard on?
You're not his pal.
You're his boss.
This only works when they're scared of you.
Jack off.
Okay?
Go for Dr. Baskets.
"Dale, I need you to run an errand for me tomorrow."
"That is a giant no, Mother."
I am knee deep in lazy teachers.
Knee deep!
- Woman:
Excuse me?
"- I said I am knee deep in lazy teachers, you witch!"
"Dale, I think you owe me."
You and your brother ruined my house.
You wrecked the whole place.
"Mother, I texted you an apology already."
What else do you want me to do?
I gotta go.
Bye.
Dale...
"Oh, you brat."

"Hi, Mom."
"Chip, I'm out of town, and I need you to do something for me tomorrow."
"Yeah, yeah, okay, for sure."
"Meemaw has a doctor's appointment tomorrow, there's a reminder on the fridge."
Can you do that for me?
"So, does that mean that you're not mad at me anymore?"
- Don't push it.
"- Okay, that's good enough, 'cause it's anchored to my skivvies."
You can have a seat.
I'm only asking you to do it so that you can have the success you deserve.
Every bit of it.
Blake Carrington's a very smart man.
He'd know the difference.
Not if you control yourself.
Just joking.
"Now, don't be upset."
I thought you loved me.
"I'm sorry, it was-"
It was only an idea.
Bad idea.
You're right.
Sleeping with him is too risky.
"Anyway, I want you for myself."
Believe that.
Oh.
L.B.
What are you doing here?
"It's the man's birthday today, and that kiss was his present."
That damned kid.
He follows me everywhere.
What if he tells somebody about what he just saw?
"That is a problem, isn't it?"
"Well, why don't you just see to it that he doesn't?"
Mother.
Welcome home.
Adam.
Mm.
I can't tell you how proud I am of you.
And happy to be working together again?
Yes.
"Oh, what have we here?"
Interesting.
No judgment here.
"- Sarge, I have to pee now too."
- Seriously?
"You, Diaz?"
"Look, I'll turn off at the next exit, okay?"
- I have to pee really badly.
- Hot.
- What?
- Hitchcock!
"- Guys, enough!"
- Sarge--
"- Yeah, I know!"
"You got to pee, I got it!"
"- No, brake lights!"
"- Oh, crap."
- Everyone hang on!
There's no side-impact airbags!
- Did you get breakfast?
"- I tried, but I got recognized."
- Do I know you from somewhere?
- Do you watch a lot of pornography?
'Cause I'm in most of it.
"- Oh, boy."
What if you were followed?
I don't think it's safe to stay here.
- Where are we gonna go?
- The cops?
- Or Figgis!
Do we have any weapons?
- I have the pipe we pulled out of me.
- I would sooner surrender than go anywhere near your gooey body pipe.
Hi.
Good morning.
"My day, like your smile, is brighter ♬"
♬  Everything became different after I met you.
"Like the rainy season in my daily life, you have become the rainbow.  ♬"
"♬  You, who shorten your foot step, are good."
"You, who shorten the street between us, are good.  ♬"
♬  You and I resemble each other in a lot of ways.
Crystal clear laughter and even the smile.
Everything.
All. ♬
♬ You and I are starting.  ♬
♬ It's not enough time for me to love.
Do it a little faster. ♬
♬  Because you look so much like...  ♬
♬ It's hard.
It's harder.
It's hard. ♬
♬ It's not easy. ♬
♬ Love u love u love u♬
♬ Love u love u love u♬
What is this?
Noona's has work now so I won't be able to take care of you as often.
So eat a lot.
Your sister wasn't even able to sleep last night because she was preparing all this.
So eat up and go to school already.
I'm so sad.
What's with you face.
Your friends don't give you food at their house?
Noona.
Ah for real.
If your that worried why don't you follow him with a bowl.
(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING)
"Ugh, this is such a lame disappointment."
All this hype and then nothing.
"It's like everyone saying, ""Go see The Blair Witch Project,"" right?"
Hey!
Are you listening?
"What'd you expect, Noah?"
"Some giant neon sign flashing ""Piper was... here""?"
Uh...
"Hey, um..."
"Let's jet, okay?"
Before someone else shows.
Someone else!
You're a genius.
That's why the lock was broken.
"'Cause someone else got here first, right?"
Someone who didn't want anyone to find whatever was in here.
"So, that means there was definitely something to find."
Right?
- Oh!
What do we have here?
"- Hey, hey!"
You can't just take that.
- It might be there for security.
‭
"- First, this is new."
"Second, that thing over there is for security."
Someone's been keeping an eye on this place.
Maybe Eddie...
- Who's Eddie?
"- Ugh, the Crescent Palms guy."
Come on.
- What's she want?
"- She wants to see me, Damon."
Alaric is supposed to arrange a meeting.
We don't know why or what she wants.
You don't have to see her if you don't want to.
- I don't really have a choice.
- She's threatening to go on a killing spree.
Oh.
I take it that's not okay with you guys?
ELENA:
I wanna do it.
I wanna meet her.
"If I don't, I know I'll regret it."
Thanks.
Can you hear me?
Thanks for coming.
I'm nervous.
But I'm happy that you're here.
I love you.
[MOUTHS] I love you.
"Hello, Elena."
You look just like her.
It's eerie.
- You've met Katherine?
ISOBEL:
She found me after I turned.
"Genetic curiosity, I suppose."
She would be fascinated by you.
Is that how you can walk in the day?
Katherine helped me obtain it.
- Who's my father?
- Not important.
Look at me.
Ok?
Everything's gonna be fine.

I could see for the first time that Jimmy was a nervous wreck.
His mind was going in eight different directions at once.
Think Morrie tells his wife everything?
Morrie?
Him?
That's when I knew Jimmy was going to whack Morrie.
That's how it happens.
That's how fast it takes for a guy to get whacked.
He's a nut job.
He talks to everybody.
He's always acting like a jerk.
Nobody listens to what he says.
"Nobody cares what he says, he talks so much."
Make sure you bring him here tonight.
-Okay?
-All right.
Start like this.
Sorry.
Did I get you in the eye?
"Stop breaking my balls, alright?"
.
I was just stalling for time.
Couldn't you put your foot down?
Forbid the banns?
Something like that?
"When the parson says, ""Speak now or forever hold your peace""... couldn't you give him a roar, sir?"
You know what I mean?
Higginbotham will replace him.
Dismissed.
"- Tommy, I've got you back again."
- And I've got you.
"I'm here to stay, forever and ever."
Forever and ever.
That's horrible.
- She's charmed him like a snake.
- The siren.
Wouldn't believe it if I didn't see it with my own eyes.
"Me, neither."
I can't stand it.
"Me, too."
Left!
Right!
Center!
As you were!
"Company, attention!"
Right turn!
Two paces forward.
March!
"Head up, chin in."
Get those thumbs behind the seams of your trousers...
Get them back.
Lower that left shoulder an eighth of an inch.
That's much better.
"Otherwise you're looking very regimental, Din."
"- Well, that's unnecessary."
"- Oh, she's right, baby."
"If you had worn these things in college, even I wouldn't have slept with you."
"And, if you recall, I was good to go."
(BARNEY LAUGHS)
"No one, I mean, no one could get laid wearing these."
(BARNEY LAUGHING)
Challenge accepted.
"I, Barney Stinson, being of sound mind and amazing body, will wear these overalls until I have sex with a woman."
- I actually dated that guy.
- Yeah.
- (LILY SIGHS)
- Okay.
Quick game plan.
"Maggie shows up, couple minutes of hugs and ""Hi"" s and then everybody's out of here."
This is my one shot.
I am not gonna screw this up.
Who'd you get to cover your class tonight?
- Crap!
"- Oh, my God!"
- Hey.
- (LAUGHS) Hey.
"Oh, my goodness."
"- Hey, stranger."
- Hey.
"- Maggie, this is my roommate, Robin."
- Hey.
- (GIGGLING) Hey.
Nice to meet you.
"- (GIGGLING) Nice to meet you, too."
"Um, I totally forgot I have to teach a class tonight."
Hey!
- Quarter page in the local paper.
- I like!
(Phone rings)
"Anderson  Millington, how may I direct your call?"
"Hello, Scott?"
Lyle?
"I'm sorry, who is this?"
"Er, it's Scott."
"Sorry, it's a bad line."
- Is everything all right?
"- Yeah, everything's fine."
Got to go!
(Dial tone)
(Owl hoots)
(Hums to classical music)
Mm.
"- Oh, where have you been?"
"- Oh, out on the tiles."
And I had a little look around Janet Cramer's rooms.
Simon!
"Just, you know, to see if I could cut the Gordian knot."
By breaking and entering?
!
"Oh, that's what we do now, is it?"
"Not breaking and entering, more easing and entering."
That's not the point.
"The missing research wasn't there, but this was."
Mary Goodyear's will.
"Don't worry, it's a photocopy."
Cramer won't know.
"That is so far from being my objection to what you've done here, Simon."
There's no mention of research.
-She kissed me.
-That makes me feel so much better!
-lt didn't mean anything!
-The hug or the kiss?
-Neither.
-lt meant your arms around her body.
-lt meant her tongue in your throat.
"-Well, it was her tongue- l don't wanna hear this!"
-Sorry.
Stop.
-Let go of me.
-Just listen to me.
Why should I?
You lied to me.
-l didn't think it would happen again.
-You were wrong.
-l didn't want to embarrass her.
"-What are you talking about, Pacey?"
This your boss hitting on you.
"If you wanted to stop it, you could have."
And you didn't because you like it.
You are attracted to her and-- lt's really obvious to me.
"If you didn't want her to hit on you, why didn't you quit?"
Because maybe I need this job.
I'm not exactly rolling in money here.
I can't afford a place to live.
I'm not a rich college girl who can quit when the mood strikes me.
That's cool.
You know what?
"Screw the girl, keep your job."
Have your cake and eat it too. lt's fine!
You're still here.
Male here.
I'm going up in the white building on the right.
"Gimlet, understood."
There you go!
Course Fixed...
Jin here.
The rockets on the intersection are deployed.
Ram here.
Sniper point secured.
Over.
You were fast Ram.
Finnish the preparations and stand by.
Yankee... can you give me position status?
The enemy is moving to the east.
You'll be able to see it when it goes out to the street.
You'll be able to shoot a hellfire?
As always...
Ok.
Wait for mi instructions.
"Male, how's going?"
Male here.
I'm moving.
Three drones on the air.
Understood.
"Jin, report status."
This is the last one.
"When this starts, they will fly to the objective."
Keep going.
Yankee.
Over.
Yankee here.
Drop the hellfire immediately.
That wasn`t funny!
A noise like that could impair the kids` hearing.
It was real!
"It looked real, didn`t it?"
I thought it was real gun.
Didn`t it look real when I fell down?
What?
Didn`t it look real?
What?
"Are you happy now, clark?"
She`s deaf.
What`s the difference?
It was fun anyway.
Let`s have a drink.
"Pardon me, sir?"
Catherine said we just stay on 50.
I was thinking of shooting over to 54 and zipping down to liberal.
What for?
The House of Mud.
What`s that?
The largest freestanding mud dwelling ever built!
"The pioneers didn`t have bricks, so they used mud."
"They didn`t use mud, they used sod!"
"Right, Audrey."
"When they ran out of sod, they used mud!"
Let`s skip The House of Mud.
Dodge City was enough for one day.
Catherine and Eddie are expecting us.
It`s living history.
"But, if you`d rather see your cousins it`s okay by me."
"personally, I`d rather see a pile of mud than Eddie."
Knock it off!
Sorry.
I don't know the lady.
"Oh, well, it doesn't matter."
I'm trying to locate a Mr. Pierce.
I don't suppose you know him.
"Not intimately, but I do know of him."
"And from what I've heard, I suggest you check at the bar."
Thanks.
Sorry I couldn't help you.
Don't give it a thought.
"I'd like a messenger sent to Mr. Julian Kirk's home, please."
5963 Mandolin Road in Bel Air.
"To a Miss Lenore Adams, Village Motel on Lankershim Boulevard."
Room number 32.
"Yes, that's in North Hollywood."
"I'd like your fast service on that, please."
20 minutes?
That's fine.
[door opens]
"[laughter, chatter]"
Blue Streak.
It's all ready for you.
You made good time.
Not much traffic this late.
That'll be 4 bucks.
Sounds like a party at the big house.
You ought to try reading with that racket.
You ought to crash it.
Bet there's nobody sober enough to even notice.
Keep the change.
Much obliged.
Good night.
"Uh, all right, Robert."
"Hey, stop this!"
"Granddad, stop!"
Listen to me!
We don't have to make the same mistakes!
We can learn!
"We're not niggas, granddad!"
"If I let you live, you are going to leave me alone, and if I see you again, I'm gonna..."
I'm gonna call the police and file for a restraining order!
But what about the fight tour?
!
"Yeah, you know, this didn't really go as expected."
"When you were the one getting beaten, Robert, it was fun!"
Deal's off!
Will you please go fuck with somebody else?
!
"Sure, Robert."
All you had to was ask.
I don't even know you.
I'm just the clone.
That's it.
I think it's finally over.
Let's go home.
"Hey, hey!"
One of you niggas call me an ambulance!
"Hey, Robert!"
"What y'all eating, Robert?"
!
"How come you never invite ya boy Stinkmeaner over for dinner, Robert?"
!
"That's fucked up, you selfish-ass, hungry-ass nigga!"
"Yo, so, you mean, like,"
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!
"You were after money, the same as i was."
You would've cornered gold if you could've done it.
"I'm broke, too."
I'm right back where i started 10 years ago- right down to my last dollar.
"But i'll get on top, and you'll stay right where you are!"
You belong in the streets!
Get back into the streets!
Get a doctor.
"Yes, sir."
"Take it easy, jim."
The doctor's coming.
You're going to be all right.
Jim!
Jim.
"I'm all right, josie."
"Lie still, jim."
Don't move.
I'll go.
"No, no, no."
"Don't go, luke."
We can't split partners now.
"We're not going to split partners, jim."
"We never have, and we never will."
"Take it easy, boss."
You're gonna be all right.
You're gonna pull through.
"Sure, i will."
"You know, it's a great life."
I wouldn't sell this next minute for... for a million dollars.
Nick... i owe you a bet.
"It's all right, Bobby."
We're here together.
"Go to sleep, Bobby."
Go back to sleep.
"It's all right, Bobby."
It's all right.
Go back to sleep.
We're here together.
I think we could all use one of those.
Mr. Gordon?
Shall we go into the other room?
Let's go.
Get started on the clock.
"Stan and I had a brother, Bobby."
He was younger than either of us.
Not quite 7 when he died.
Stan and I were 12 and 14.
We lived in a big house with grounds that bordered a river.
"That particular day, our mother asked us to stay at home and look after Bobby."
We wanted to go swimming.
"What we wanted to do, Bobby wanted to do, naturally."
He idolised his big brothers.
"So we told him to stay in the house, and off we went."
He followed us.
We were pretty far out when we spotted him.
He was trying to...
To get to us.
He still is.
- You mean it's his...?
- Spirit?
Ghost?
"I don't know, Mr. Gordon."
"Hell, that's some vocabulary you got, kid."
Spite.
"Ill will, vengeance."
"Vengeance means revenge, Miller."
"I'm sure you know what revenge means, don't you?"
I'm onto you Miller.
"Despite your stupid jokes, you secretly blame me for the accident."
"New car, or not, you despise me for it."
How did you get into my place?
Duplicate keys?
Credit card?
What?
"Fuck you, Miller!"
This shit's gonna stop!
"Get off my property, punk!"
Bastards.
Shit.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
7-4... 3-C-R-N.
743CRN.
What?
Shit.
Fuck!
"I'm sorry sir, but we don't provide... motorist information to the general public."
I'm not just a member of the general public.
This guy is a friend of mine.
But you don't know your friend's address?
"We just met, I don't know him that well."
"Sir, this is the DMV, not the dating service."
I just want talk to him.
He's good luck.
Not that he remembered to thank you.
And Meadow loved that book.
"You know, I feel bad."
I didn't give you something.
"I bring something, but I forgot it when I left that morning."
"Balsamic vinegar, 35 years."
From my sister's husband's family.
Live in Modena.
"So, aside from your Dad..."
-was it wonderful being back in Italy?
"-It was wonderful, yeah."
"Go home and see your friends, your family."
I gotta be honest... it was not so nice.
-I don't belong there no more.
-No?
Something change.
-Maybe me.
-What do you mean?
I'm like a visitor in my own town.
Life went on without me.
There is nothing there for me now.
-No special someone?
-I feel strange to live here also.
Maybe I should never have come to America.
"You've made such a nice life for yourself, though."
You've got a wonderful home.
-A girlfriend.
-No.
"What do you mean, no?"
Jessica?
I try to talk to her... but there is no communication.
"So, how about you check with the local dermatologist."
See if there's any medical records on Heung-guk or that woman.
"Stop it, you tramp!"
I can't believe this.
"It's important, you idiot!"
The rash is the link here.
"Come on, hurry."
Stop it!
You could hurt somebody!
Community Health Center
"Oh, my."
You're really getting on my nerves!
Where do you live?
Are you from this village?
Hey.
Don't come near me!
Dammit!
The lady killed them all.
What?
In there.
In that room.
What are you talking about?
"The old woman got a shaman to do some ritual, but the lady refused."
That's why they all got killed.
Are you a family member?
"No, I'm not."
Then who are you?
Come with me.
Hey!
What the...?
You can't go in there.
It's all right.
"The train goes down, goes around Lake Waste Water, and comes right back."
"It should back in 15 minutes, so we should just jump on it."
But when is Ethan gonna stop by the Juice Caboose with his next delivery?
Let me check my watch.
In exactly... 15 minutes!
This is gonna be close.
Mmm.
Speak to me.
You're hiding from me.
I'll find you.
Ooh...
"You have got a lot goin' on here, girl."
Ugh.
"Ah, there you are."
A California Central Coast Syrah.
"Okay, Bobby."
Now you taste your wine.
This one is probably...
wine.
I would say red.
Or it could be white.
I'm also realizing that I'm not as good at this as I thought I'd be.
"No, you're not."
"Chablis is a wine, right?"
You guys aren't answering me.
I'm gonna say that's a good sign.
I'm going with Chablis.
"Oh, I'm sorry, Bobby."
You're not good at this.
Poor Bob.
"I can't see your sad, pathetic face right now, but I bet it's crying."
I'll tell you what.
"No, you listen to me, sweetheart, okay?"
"I am coming to Fort Lauderdale, and when I get there,"
"I am gonna find you and I am going to [Bleep] you so [Bleep] hard, you..."
Mmm.
I knew you were a bad guy.
This is where I come to be bad.
I'm a good guy. [Chuckles]
Ah.
"Good guy, bad guy, it's all perception."
Me?
I say I'm just a woman.
You say I'm exceptional woman.
- I never said that.
"- Yes, you do."
I see how you look.
"No, I look."
I don't say that.
"Yeah, but, you know, in my village,"
I'm just average woman.
Like fourth most attractive sister in family.
Bullshit.
Don't buy that story for a second.
Okay?
Yeah.
"You are, objectively, the most attractive woman in every village."
[Clicks tongue] Aw.
There are no absolutes.
"No, there are absolutely absolutes, okay?"
Vinyl?
Absolutely overrated.
Dr. Rob?
Absolutely super-duper rich.
SvenPense!
"He saw his eyes, all terrified."
You said he was.
I chose to save that poor life.
What?
"-He will tell their friends, spread terror."
There's a new predator in the area.
-You're crazy!
-Someone needs to control the number of individuals of species.
-I deserve.
Wearethechampions My friends
And we'll keep fighting until the end
If -sees!
-I am the champion!
-Am champion!
It's a musical delight.
Will is the first sign of madness.
We champion
-How is the shoulder?
-Okay.
Boot a little ice it improves.
Thank you.
"No, I thank you."
"Thank you, friend."
"Brian, the king of the beach, will have another season."
That made you a friend of elephant seals.
"As we speak, children?"
"Thank you, buddy to bring Daddy back."
"-I owe you, my friend."
"-Health, Brian."
"No, I mean it."
You only need to ask.
- Eventually.
"But for now, we keep a low profile."
- No one knows who I am.
- The Salvatore brothers do.
And I wish to hell I could run into them.
They're the reason we were caught in the first place.
"So, uh, Matt, how do you like working here?"
"Uh, it's not that bad."
Wait staff tips out pretty good.
They can't keep a bartender to save their lives but...
I actually put my mom up for the job.
"How's that been, having Kelly back?"
"You know, same old Kelly."
"She's trying, sort of."
Kelly and my mom were best friends growing up.
That's how Matt and I first met.
We shared a crib together.
You're kidding.
"No, we've known each other our whole lives."
Whoo!
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Little Jen.
"- Oh, my God."
I know.
- It's big Jen now.
Let's have another one.
How many is that?
Ha-ha-ha.
Where are you going?
Bethanne and I are going out for a bit.
Hit the town.
Kick up our heels.
Yeah.
Kind of.
I gotta go.
You're looking for something.
I'm not enough!
Am I enough for you?
Are you running for president?
"Yes I am, Ms. Walker."
"Dad, he had another kid."
With Holly.
- Does Mom know about this?
- No!
"And Kevin, she never will."
- You told your sister about us?
- That we're friends.
- It's fine.
Don't worry.
- We got to be careful.
Prodigal daughter returns.
Thought it'd be a nice surprise.
"Oh, my God."
Hey.
Do you know what this editorial is about?
That one reason Whitmore's candidacy is a stretch is because his daughter's too fat to be first daughter.
She's 13.
You're right.
That's awful.
"I mean, my children are going through a divorce."
They need time.
They don't need to be judged by the national media or anyone.
And not to mention...
"Oh, no."
"Oh, right, yeah."
Them the ones with the pointy houses?
"Pyramids, yeah."
"Please, guys, you can call me Rambo."
"I said Rambo could join us for dinner tonight, eh, Grumio?"
"Fine, yeah."
There is no dinner.
Right.
First-class slaving.
It's cool.
I've got my dad's charge card for the Emporium if you wanna run and grab some stuff.
Wicked.
"I mean, I'd rather not run but..."
"So take the sedan, if you like."
Yeah.
I do like.
Excuse me.
"No, no, no, not you again."
Shoo!
Hop it.
I will not allow you to ravage our luxury foods.
"How about I buy 'em, then?"
Ptolemy Hachmenenet?
"Is the name of my master, yes."
He sent me to fetch his scran.
"And I am absolutely delighted you chose us, sir."
Pray tell what your master is craving and I will do my utmost to help.
I thought you might.
"Well, he mainly likes meat."
Lovely.
Shall I fetch a basket?
"Get a trolley, I would."
"Evelyn, I appreciate all the effort you've put into this... but there comes a time whereyou have to walk away."
Come on.
Isn't there something I can do to persuadeyou?
There's nothing you can do.
[ Chuckles ]
Know what I love about Miami?
"Apart from you, of course."
The cheap labor.
"You know, I can get a kid offthe street to do a hit for about, mmm, grand."
"Well, ifl flirt with him a little."
"Say, now, isn't that Lucy?"
Lucy!
Lucy!
[Tires Squealing]
"- Michael, I am so sorry."
- It's notyour fault.
"Yes, it is."
You taught me better than that.
It was so stupid.
I should have been more thorough.
- I've got guys headed to her hotel right now.
- It won't matter.
I know.
I just feel like I should do something.
You should.
"You should be careful, 'cause she's still out there."
- [ Cell Phone Rings ]
- Right on time.
Yeah.
- [ Evelyn ] Changeyour mind?
- Enough ofthis.
"You want to deal, you deal with me."
"Vic, come on."
"It's, uh... been a pretty rough ride lately..."
Enough I'm thinking about gettin' off the train.
You wanna give up your badge?
I'm lookin' for a sign.
Seen any around?
You don't wanna give it up.
–Retirement's been pretty good to you.
–A forced retirement.
Believe me.
I still miss it.
We can hit the links together every day.
What's bothering you now?
"When, uh..."
When we were ridin'... you ever feel like you went too far?
Yeah.
"Couple times, maybe."
Probably.
Definitely.
"Hell, you can't always land just right."
Goin' too far will get you fired.
Not goin' far enough will get you killed.
I never lost any sleep over it though.
"Anyway, we always did more good than bad, right?"
Right.
That's the key.
–Yeah.
"That's him, all right."
–Yeah.
–Good.
–Anything else we can do?
She was such a nice girl.
So you come along for her friend.
See?
I knew it.
I knew it.
What the fuck is wrong with that?
When is it?
Tomorrow night.
I'm meeting Tuddy.
You could meet Tuddy.
Come early and then go.
Why do you always do this?
Don't give me that shit.
What did I ask you for?
A favor.
I do a lot of fucking favors for you.
I'm trying to bang this broad.
Help me out.
I don't understand you.
She's beautiful!
Her family lives in the Five Towns.
These Jews got money.
Maybe the family owns the whole block.
You may wind up with a big score.
You with your fucking mouth!
I had a meeting with Tuddy at 11:00 and here I am a backup guy for Tommy.
Did you have enough to eat?
It was delicious.
I'm just watching my diet.
Let me watch your figure.
I couldn't wait to go.
I was ordering dessert when they were eating dinner.
I was asking for the check.
What time is it?
It's almost fucking 10 o'clock.
How's it going?
"Well, we haven't got a shot off yet."
This is exciting.
The script is exciting.
I loved it.
"-Oh, I'm glad you liked it."
I loved it.
I thought it was so funny.
It's so funny.
So you liked the script?
"You think it's as good as ""Shakespeare in Love""?"
"Oh, much better."
"When you're not busy, could me and him talk to you?"
Sure.
Because he has something pretty big going on.
"-Oh, yeah?"
-Yeah.
Pretty big?
"Well, I ought to hear about it right now."
He wants to make a movie?
Yeah?
He's making a book right now.
Uh-huh.
And he has his own characters and everything.
And he wanted to know if he could make a movie out of it.
Why not?
"Just keep-- you have to have, like, a script or something."
You got to get some money.
You have to raise money.
You need money to make a movie.
Surya didn't save any transport king... he saved a gangster.
And only he can do such a lowly job.

Physical wounds may heal with time.
But he's inflicted a wound on my heart.
Satyakant.
He's your son just like Shiv.
Blood ties don't make up relations Raghunath.
You've to abide by it too.
And Shiv has done that.
He has.
He's so cultured.
He's always first to lend a helping hand.
He never does anything wrong behind my back.
And even today... he never forgets to give respect to his elders.
He always leaves a mark behind.
That's true.
Yes.
Shiv.
Where were you?
Listen.
You're going to Delhi tomorrow.
To your uncle.
Pack your bags.
Yes father.
Come nephew.

So are you prepared?
What's happened?
Some seniors were ragging the new students.
So...

Ah!

Any newbie can do it.
It will make no difference.
"How can you say that, Je?"
No difference?
It was a simple little job.
Be reasonable.
You turned off your mobile for half a day.
What was I supposed to do?
I had to fix it.
You weren't here.
Are you seeing someone now?
The hell!
Have you ever seen me with a girl?
No.
"But if you do, that's cool."
But turning off your cell phone.
That's too much.
"Normally you're more professional than this, you know?"
It's good that I noticed it first.
How could you miss that?
Even I noticed it.
"""Normally you're more professional than this, you know?"""
Shit!
It's not going away.
Not better.
So tired.
A waste of time.
What am I doing?
Hold on.
Shit!

A reminder though.
This is gonna be worth half of your final grade.
Leave him alone.
I'm going for a record.
"I said, ""leave him alone."""
You want to take his place midget?
Yeah.

"Ok, everybody, got any questions?"
"All right, let's get started."
"Today, you will have the honor of playing one of the greatest games ever invented."
"A game of skill, agility, cunning."
A game with one simple rule.
Dodge.
Sorry.
"Uh, substitute coach Roth."
Yes?
Ms. Boudreaux never let us play dodge ball.
"Well, Ms. B's in Massachusetts getting married, so we're playing."
She says it's dangerous.
Take a lap!
But...
Go nuts.
Having fun?
The whistle makes me their god.
Right.
Nice shorts.
- What's your name?
- Tia.
- I'm Rocky.
- I'm muscles.
- Crusher.
- And I'm dazzler.
We're the earthquake gang.
Does that scare you?
No.
Let's change our name again.
We gotta have a name that scares.
Yeah.
How'd you do what you done?
"Well, I really didn't do anything."
Yeah.
You a magician or something?
No.
You want to join our gang?
I'm sorry.
I'm looking for someone.
- Thanks anyway.
"- Aw, sure."
I guess you're like the rest of them.
You've heard we're a nothing gang.
"Yeah, well we ain't always gonna be nothing."
Someday we're gonna be the toughest.
Take over the whole territory.
Someday they're gonna run when they see us coming down the block.
All right.
It's just that I've got to find my brother.
What gang does he belong to?
He doesn't belong to any gang.
"We follow you no more, Bloody Big Head."
How dare you?
Off with his head!
"Iracebeth of Crims, your crimes against Underland are worthy of death."
"However, that is against my vows, therefore, you are banished to the Outlands."
"No one is to show you any kindness, or ever speak a word to you."
You will not have a friend in the world.
"Majesty, I hope you bear me no ill will."
"Only this one, Ilosovic Stayne, you are to join Iracebeth in banishment from this day until the end of Underland."
At least we have each other.
(GASPS)
(EX CLAIMING)
"Majesty, please!"
Kill me!
Please!
But I do not owe you a kindness.
-STAYNE:
Take off my head!
-He tried to kill me.
-Majesty!

-He tried to kill me.
-I offer you my head!
-He tried to kill me!

-Futterwacken.
(LAUGHING)
We've got to get it back.
Get it back?
It's absolutely a matter of life and death.
"Well, how do I pull the check out of the bank?"
"You know the manager of the bank, don't you?"
Yes.
Tell him you want it back.
"But that's highly irregular, I..."
"Look, get me that check back and I'll give you $5.000."
"Well, I'll try."
"I don't guarantee anything, but I'll try."
I'll be waiting for you in the coffee shop.
"Something else, sir?"
"Another cup of coffee, please."
You've had six.
"Well, make it seven."
"Yes, sir."
Hello?
This is Mr. Sabourin.
Has Mr. O'Hara come back yet?
"No, sir, he hasn't."
"By the way, Mr. Sabourin, Wentworth Drug is up two more points."
Isn't that nice?
"Yes, yes, thank you."
Well?
Let's talk about me.
What do I get?
What do you mean?
$5.000.
"Oh, no."
"No, Mr. Sabourin."
That check was stubbed.
Letting him loose.
Somebody looking for me?
I can smell something burning out here.
Oh you!
Hi!
Having fun?
Keep going.
My turn now.
Call me.
"One apple juice, please."
How rude!
I'm not used to people not turning around to look at me.
So you are one of those silent types.
You come to a party and then stand alone in a corner...
Waiting for a girl.
"What does someone turning to look at you, have to do with your beauty?"
So that means you are interested in me.
Right?
Right.
"Actually, I have come with someone else."
So...
Oh.
I hope he won't mind if I hold your hand?
Or put my hand around your waist?
What happened?
Oh...
You can't dance.
This is a problem tall girls face.
- Excuse me!
- Yeah?
Let's see.
It didn't seem like you are here with someone else.
I don't have time for his crap.
- You think he made it up?
- I don't care.
- Why would he?
"- Wait, what does it mean?"
That I'm a bastard?
If Raziya's parents hear this they'll take her back to Brooklyn with the kids.
"I'm done for, don't you get it?"
Fuck!
Why did she keep these marbles?
What a moron!
Did she expect me to play on her grave?
Who saves marbles?
"Leave it, just go to sleep."
"I'll clean up, okay?"
"Mom, what did you do?"
What are you all dressed up for?
"Get down from there, it's dangerous."
From where?
What are you talking about?
"Doborobon, don't ask me and I won't ask you."
O-bo-kay-bay?
(Okay?
)
No-bo.
At least give me a hint-.
You're not 5 years old any more.
- Was that a hint?
- Was that a hint?
- Are you repeating what I say?
- Are you repeating what I say?
Do you know what this is?
So I'll call you later.
"Hey, do you mind..."
"uh, driving me home?"
No yoga?
No.
We missed it.
"Um, yeah."
I guess.
"Ok, when did that start and did you know?"
"Well, I mean, I kind of guessed, but..."
Does she know about... you two?
What's there to know?
Hallie should know better.
Seriously.
Anybody that knows you would know that you are so hot for him.
"Becca, I'm not so hot for him."
No.
He's your friend.
And it is so typical of Hallie.
She's a fame whore.
"No, she's not."
It's...
Damn it.
She is a fame whore.
"No, she's not."
"Oh, God!"
"Hallie, it's just frustrating."
It's so much right now.
She doesn't deserve that.
Hallie was there for me when I had that swine flu.
Every time I've broken up with a quasi boyfriend.
And I don't know what I would've done about that stalker if it wasn't for Hallie.
Really?
I don't know.
I think the truth kind of gets you in trouble.
You know what you should do?
Find your dad one of those nice women that we saw in town.
Nice women don't understand him.
I don't even understand him.
"He spends all of his time wading around in mud, cataloging plants."
Good night.
Use the can if you need anything.
Can?
Looks like a boob.
"Hello, V?"
V.
"V, this is Frank."
From the can.
This is V.
My dad thinks you look like Grace Kelly.
Good night.
"Good night, Frank."
"I'm telling you, she slept in the tree house last night."
You're so full of shit.
"Oh, my God-- a ""C."""
My dad is going to kill me.
"What's wrong with a ""C""?"
Her car broke down in front of my house.
She had to stay.
She's there right now.
"She's going to tell on us, I know."
She's not there.
I bet you a zillion billion dollars that you are full of shit.
You're on.
Boy:
Shake it!
Shake it!
Shake it!

They were there when the bomb Rozierovim exploded in his hands.

"Trust me, whatever punishment we give them, it's nothing compared to what's waiting for them at home."
"Those boys know if anything was to happen to that horse, if it got injured, the whole family would lose its ability to plow the field, make food for the winter."

Not for a year and a half.
-What's wrong?
"-He went on leave, didn't come back."
He's listed as a deserter.
"Miss Cross, are you sure you haven't seen him?"
I didn't even know for sure that he was in the Navy.
He hasn't called you or written you?
-No.
"-He disappeared from town... a year and a half ago, deserting his family."
"Well, it looks like he's running true to form."
If you do hear from him get in touch with 1st.

I will.
"Oh, Selena, don't get upset."
It's not your fault they can't find him.
What is it?
"What's wrong, Selena?"
"Mrs. MacKenzie, I've got to tell somebody."
I can't keep it to myself any longer.
-Every time I go out in that yard...

Lucas didn't desert.

"All right, Mrs. Smith."
"Doc, they don't know me."
They're very young.
"It's been two years, Lutie."
You can't expect it.
"No, I don't expect it."
I only hoped.
"Do you remember, I said I'd bring a double present for both of you;"
"-Do you remember, Sarah Beth;"
-No.
"But you'd like to have a present, wouldn't you;"
-Yes.
-Then you wait.
You look at what I have in my bag.
Now you look in the bag.
-Saw her getting off the train.
-Went right over to Doc Reid's.
[CROWD laughing]

"You must leave at once, Brice."
Do you realize I've never even touched him before never been close enough to look into his eyes;
-He's a fine boy.
-You shouldn't have come here.
Brock.
You can do anything you put your mind to.
What would you have done if I wasn't here?
"- You don't like to talk much, do you?"
"- You don't have that problem, do you?"
No.
"No, I talk all the time."
I'm a flibbertigibbet.
"That's what my English teacher, Mrs Wilson, calls me."
"""Tillie Hansen, you are a flibbertigibbet."""
Sounds like a noise a chicken would make.
Mrs Wilson kinda looks like a chicken.
- How come you ain't screaming?
- I am.
You just can't hear me.
"- All right, that's enough."
- One more stitch.
- Don't argue with me.
- One more stitch.
Just tie that off.
Pull it through.
Tie it right there.
Jeez!
All right.
"Here, get..."
Just put that on.
- Here.
- All right.
That's it.
"Come on, easy!"
Do it tight.
"What was that you were saying before to yourself, ""You're one of a kind""?"
I sometimes hear my mother talking to me.
I thought I had improvised well.
"- That's right, sire."
Stop.
We repeat.
"Carlos, please."
"Sire, it is best to avoid any comment."
Sorry.
His Majesty?
Very well.
"Yes, I'll be careful."
"I care for you, do not worry."
"I think so, yes."
"See you, His Majesty."
Mr. Lloyd?
The Queen told me to remember them
To film the speeches from start to finish and to grasp the smiles.
Do we do it again?
"Sire, the press conference will begin at 11pm at Miniatiürk."
"His speech, sire."
The Prime Minister has made some changes.
I remember that Turkey's handshakes are energetic.
Stop.
Perfect.
"Now we can go, sire."
"Mr. Lloyd, can follow us."
It's really tiny.
The Atomium?
"Yes, it's a fiasco."
No.
"Well, that too."
The space reserved for Mini-Europe.
It looks like an extension of Turkey instead of the opposite.
I came all the way here to make a deal.
Jumong?
I might be in hiding but I still know what's going on.
Jumong can't leave Jolbon because of the blockade.
Why would he come here?
We have our reasons.
Daesan.
Yes?
Bring me a big jar of wine.
"Yes, sir."
Let's see if you are who you claim to be.
Drink this.
Drink up!
Tie him to that tree.
"Yes, sir."
I heard Jumong is a master archer.
Shoot that target next to him.
Don't just stand there.
Hurry up!
I don't like playing games.
"If you don't believe me, just kill me instead."
"If you're going to die anyway, shouldn't you die trying?"
I'll let you live if you hit the target.
Commander!
Shoot.
You must be Okjuh soldiers.
Kill them!
Why won't you believe us?
This is Commander Jumong!
- He is!
- Shut up!
It's the army!
Please accept... to pay them all this morning.
Good!
And so it shall be.
"Get behind me, sons of Fakoli."
You deserve a tribute...
O worthy son of your father.
What about the house?
"The sand's been delivered, the other materials are on their way."
Noumouké has promised it by the end of the month.
"Hurry up,"
German and French experts are coming.
Don't worry.
Hurry up!
Where's Diarra?
He's been arrested.
For lack of papers.
And where is he now?
I don't know.
What's the problem?
One of my workers has been arrested.
And I don't know why.
What's his name?
1000 FM to set him free.
I need him free.
You'll get an ID card.
"Thank you, brother."
"Come on, Diarraké."
Nobody's taking my son away!
I am!
"Then, I'll pursue you forever!"
What's going on?
"This witch is after me every day, we're going home to solve the problem."
- And the redhead?
- She's my associate.
You don't fancy her?
None of your business.
What about you?
No girlfriend?
It never works out with girls.
"You're good-looking, you should be popular with the girls."
I'll let you finish.
I'm off to bed.
Catch!
A T-shirt for the night.
"Good thinking, thanks."
- Good night.
Niko?
How's your hand?
That bitch bit through the skin.
You'd better get tested in case she has AIDS...
I'll call you back.
"Hello, Vlad."
How are you?
"Not so good, mate."
Why didn't you tell me a girl tried to run?
"I was going to tell you, but we got her."
Tani took care of her.
We have more pressing matters.
Did you watch the news?
Not yet...
The cops are looking for the football player.
They found his hideout.
Find him and kill him.
I don't want him to talk about us.
I'm done.

You done?
YOU DONE?

"So you're done, eh?"

(spitting)
You done now.

There's no way!
Take a seat.
Let's see...
Posession of marijuana with intent to traffic...
"Certainly not original, eh?"
"Look, I've already told you, I got it from my mates, alright?"
I wasn't trafficking anything.
"But, you're the only one here right now, aren't you?"
"Now, the drugs we can plea out, that still leaves the theft over for the joyriding."
"Oh, come on, really-"
- That's rubish!
"I mean, that's Rudy's father's car!"
"Well, you took his Mercedes without his consent."
"Last time I looked, that's a crime, Mr St. Clair."
"Mr. Irving, will he have to go to jail?"
"Well, likely."
"Since Mr St. Clair took it upon himself to fail to appear, twice."
Worst case scenerio?
Two years.
Run a failed restaurant?
- She probably can't even cook.
- Her vagina insult cut me to the quick... but her crumb cake was like a cloud from heaven.
Yeah.
But it is cake.
"I mean, who needs cake?"
Not exactly the pillar of a meal.
Are you implying that your fish is more important than my cake?
I'm not implying it.
I'm stating as fact.
Really?
Ever heard of a birthday fish?
No.
Dad ever take you on a caking trip?
"Oh, no, he didn't."
[ Exhales ]
Just tell Miss Lohan that I have her dog.
"No, no, no, I'm not a stalker."
I am a fan though.
I loved her in-

Hello?

"Snazzy, the barstool was not put there for your pleasure."
There's a Jessica on line one.
She says that she's an old friend.
"Oh, no."
Not lameJessica.
She just said Jessica.
- Hello?
- Guess who's in town.
- You?
He burned them.
Where?
Where?
In the kitchen.
Bastard!
You!
What did you come here to do?
What did you come here to do?
Ask him again.
What did you come here to do?
To travel.
"To travel, he says."
Tell him I'll throw him in jail if he doesn't fess up.
Tell us the truth.
"Even if I told you, you wouldn't believe me."
He says you wouldn't believe him.
"Look, you translate everything I say,"
- word for word.
"- Yes, sir."
You fucking prick!
Oh...
"You loose-assed, dog-fucking son of a whore!"
"So, uh..."
What kind of tourist hangs pictures of dead people on his wall?
Travel... the dead...
Why was this in your house?
How did this...?
Who the fuck are you?
Who are you?
I know what you're doing in this village.
I saw that room.
And I know what the fuck you're doing to my daughter!
It's ridiculous.
Maybe it's a sign you have to keep it.
"No, Mum."
"It's not a sign, I'm going to sell it."
Again.
Are you serious?
Are you selling this car?
"Ah, yeah."
Sold.
Sorry?
I'm buying it.
It's... it's got rust.
"Yeah, of course it does."
What car this old doesn't have rust?
"Tom, can we take it out?"
"What was it, Tom?"
"""Nice smile, mentally stable."" Ssshh."
I don't want to listen to another word.
Previously on The Fosters...
I gave the money to Ana so she'd change her story.
- You bribed her?
- I'll tell the DA.
"- I want $10,000."
- That freaking woman.
I could kill her.
You are gonna stay as far away from that woman as possible.
You saw Ana Gutierrez in an argument the night that she went missing?
- Is this the guy?
"- Yeah, this is the guy."
- Donald isn't my dad?
- Not according to the birth certificate.
Bastard !
- I know you ?
- You should.
"Well, I guess more people remember me."
Dan Winslet.
Freshman year.
Dansy the pansy !
"What's up, man ?"
I want an apology for what you did.
"Whatever it was, get over it."
"Man, wait !"
He didn't even remember what he did to me.
So he took your life... . and you took his.
Mortality clock.
Counts down the remainder of someone's life.
Or their life sentence.
"Eric, the powder ?"
You were right.
Some of the trace we found in Bob's apartment was cocaine.
What was it cut with ?
"Vitamin A, Vitamin C, and five percent bisacodyl."
It's a laxative.
"Now, we have this mixture in our library."
It's Julio Pena's cut.
Calls it the Colombian Health High.
"Yes, well, it's time for Julio to come down."
"- Good afternoon, gentlemen."
- Julio Pena ?
I wanna know why were you at Bob Keaton's apartment today.
Lily white doper ?
What you think ?
I'm guessing that you might have killed him.
Come in.
Merry Christmas.
It's been a long time.
It is Christmas.
You don't have to explain a gift.
Thank you.
Come in.
Let me take your coat.
I can only stay a moment.
I have to deliver a few more things.
- Can I fix you a drink?
"- No, thank you."
"Well, come in, sit down."
"Well, I really came to... ."
Is it true that you might go to Portland?
"Well, I've received the offer."
"It's a larger school, and naturally, much more money."
- You'll take it.
- I don't know.
I have a week to make up my mind.
Sit down.
- Michael?
- Yes?
You were right.
I never thought I could say it but you were right.
- About what?
"During the past months, I've been able to come to a few conclusions about myself."
- And what were they?
"- Well, Michael, I've lied so long."
"I was everything you said, especially that night in the kitchen."
I wanted you more than you wanted me.
- I had no right to say those things.
He just wants to show off.
Give me 30 of that!
How much is it?
- 15 Mark.
- 15...
"Here, 20 for you."
Keep the change.
"Give me something to drink, I'm quite thirsty."
Life is just wonderful!
"Ah, Reinhold!"
Let me introduce you:
this is my friend Casanova from Casanova.
Make room for him!
Meet these 3 beauties from Pankow.
"Move over, I wanna talk to my friend."
"Reinhold, it's always a pleasure to see you."
No you gotta put him on a radiotor to warm him up.
What's the matter with you?
Don't get mad at them.
"Go away, children, go!"
"I tell you, women are trouble."
"But at home, I have a wonderful one."
A gem!
Then why don't you bring her along?
You better leave the woman you love at home.
They're just too curious.
Now what?
"They do nothing but steal and cheat, these criminals!"
- Criminals?
- And Franz is starting to scare me too.
Franz?
He was in jail already.
- Sorry.
I think I took the last one.
And the bread?
All we have are the ends.
This is like The Hunger Games.
"You do know those books aren't actually about food, right?"
"Sorry, guys, I'll hit the market today, I promise."
- Good morning.
- Morning.
Are we out of... ?
- Everything!
"- Bacon, we've got bacon."
Have some bacon.
Come on.
I made it last night.
I want everybody home for family dinner tonight.
- Five p.m. Yes?
- Wrestling won't be done...
- What about dance?
- Do I hear six p.m.?
Anybody?
"I have work, I was just gonna eat there with Daphne."
But I will eat here instead.
"Um, I'm supposed to go to the batting cages with Connor."
"Batting cages, as in baseball?"
"Yeah, Connor and his dad go all the time."
And they invited me.
"I think that's great, sweetheart."
I never knew you were a baseball guy.
I haven't really played that much.
"But who knows, maybe I'm really good."
"- Yeah, maybe."
Now.
- Na.
I did not remember what I wanted unfortunately.
- Something is other entirely.
- Oh see!
This is the trouble!
The start is very plain though.
"It would be necessary to think of it only, how you did the boxes before me arriving here."
"Ágika cut the cardboards, I folded."
And kind Tót what did he do?
- I got some air.
- Oh see!
Oneagainst one!
"I cut the cardboards alone though now, you though three people you make the folding,"
three against one.
"He has time to look at butterflies at night, to doze and you let your thoughts ramble."
- And why?
- Why?
- Why?
- Ágika?
"I believe it, because the our margin-cutting small."
Bravo!
For your daughter is golden mind.
"Thank you, Ágika."
"Is child's play, the others already!"
"Right, kind Tót?"
Yees!
- Good night!
- Good night!
He kissed me.
"You saw it, mom?"
Daddy!
"Ifyou don't tell me whereJeffrey is, this is your funeral."
Throw this garbage away.
- Give me the money!
- Are you sure you still got bullets?
You wanna bet?
"Jeffrey said, always save one last slug."
"Either foryourself, oryour enemy."
Hurry!
Turn around!
Goddamn it!
Get him!
Promise me one thing:
"If I don't make it, take me to a hospital."
Have them save my corneas forJenny.
Ifthat's impossible... organize my money and send her abroad for surgery.
Don't think like that.
It's the first decent thing I've ever done.
Will you help me?
What's that noise?
"Who is it,Jeffrey?"
Sidney.
Here's your money.
I fought for it like a man.
This is my last tribute to a friend.
"Sidney, you didn't have to do this."
He said I was a dog.
Now I'm not sure if I'm human or a dog.
"Sidney, nobody can call you a dog."
Sidney!
Sidney!
Sidney!
Am I a dog?
- He had killed them both.
Do not listen.

- Do not think about and ...
- Back to the cabin now.

Addons Before you die.

Addons That you are guilty.

Addons Lucy Turner.
Addons Age: 15 years.
Addons You were there.
Addons you all.
"Online Addons, see what happens."
"Addons you must beat all the competitors, and Gwen are the worst."
Addons A false holiness.
A hypocrite hiding behind religion.
Addons Dave really enjoys his suffering ...
Addons and ridiculed it.
"And when it decided to publish it,"
Addons friend Rory also commented.
Addons This kid has a big mouth.
Addons now calmer.
Are you?
"If I've got a plan, what is it?"
You tell me.
That's the way to do it!
Is this a test?
Yes.
What will it do to us?
Kill us.
That's the way to do it!
"So, come on then - plan, do I have one?"
I knew straight away.
"No, you didn't."
Course I did.
Show me!
Why should I?
Because we'll be dead in under 30 seconds.
Do I have a plan?
"If we'd been escaping, we'd be climbing down the building."
"If we'd been hiding, we'd be on the other side of the roof."
But we're standing right here.
So?
So!
After you.
After you.
"After you, I'm wearing a dress."
"Eyes front, soldier!"
My eyes are always front!
Mine aren't.
Stop it!
No!
I understand you're the previous governess.
I regret to inform you the position is taken.
OK.
- OK.
Thanks.
- I hope I get to meet him soon.
- What?
Your boyfriend.
"If you want to keep things private, you got to avoid Noreen."
Yeah.
Thanks.
Thanks for the intel.
I was surprised to hear you were in a relationship.
I just would've assumed you'd say something.
- You're...
You're fishing.
- You're evading.
It's only fair.
You know all the details in my personal life.
"Besides, what's the big secret?"
Is he bald?
A hunchback?
A member of the Green Party?
He doesn't exist.
I don't have a boyfriend.
I lied because I...
"Well, I had to because everybody in this office thinks that you and I are..."
- They do?
- They do.
- But we're not.
- I'm aware of that.
"Every time I tried to tell Noreen, she thought I was lying..."
So you made up another lie.
You'd make a very effective politician.
- Who's on first?
- Sick one.
Frank Chambers.
"Forty years old, severe chest trauma when a walkway fell."
Wrecking-ball crane collapsed.
"BP, 80 systolic, but headed the wrong way."
"Tachy 120, denies LOC."
Crepitus on right side.
Page Surgery.
"- Mr. Chambers, can you talk?"
- Hurts too much.
He thought his ribs were broken.
- You are?
- His secretary.
Sustained a facial lac and chest pain but refused treatment.
- You need to be examined.
- After.
He's decreased on the left.
- Let's hear it.
- I've heard it since Michigan Avenue.
"Ken Ambrose, 34, tib-fib fracture with dislocation."
F. D. had to lift a flower shop off his leg.
Not a shop.
It's a kiosk!
"- Abdomen's soft, non-tender."
"- Vitals normal, tachy at 120 with a liter in."
- Gave him ten of MS.
- Don't touch!
It hurts!
"Okay, bear with us."
We'll give you something.
"- Oh, God!"
How many?
- One.
- Three were pronounced on the scene.
"- Luka, let me take this."
"- It's okay, I got it."
"Officer, make sure these cars don't block that entrance."
"- Breathe for us, Trina."
- Tracheal shift.
Hold up.
Her lung is down.
"- Sats, only 88."
"- Miss, can you describe who did this?"
- Decreased on the right.
- Needle her.
- Want me to do it?
"- No, 18 gauge."
How many were there?
"You' re gonna get your ID as soon as she's stable, I promise."
She's not moving air.
No pulse.
Try the other side.
"- No, pull the dressing off."
- What?
"The dressing on the chest wound, pull it off."
"- Okay, pulse is stronger."
- Good chest excursions.
"All right, let's get her inside."
Luka?
Just need a minute.
"Dr. Lewis, patron saint of lost causes."
- GSW to head and chest.
- Tension pneumo.
Come!
Mada mada da ne.
That'll be all.
Good afternoon!

"Oh, Ryoma."
"Gave me a scare there, what're you doing here?"
Is your mother doing fine?
It's outrageous.
What were you thinking leaving our hometown?
It's called Seishun Gakuen.
Nothing spectacular.
"Why, don't like it?"
"Don't tell me that to get me into that school, you brought me here all the way from the States?"
"Well, you can say that."
How about it?
Let's have a game.
Here then.
I'll crush you.
I took care of his...
Why did you want to kill Serena?
I didn't... get...
Why?
Hey.
"Hey, hey."
"Listen, look at me."
Look at me.
Why such a frowny face?
We just beat fate's ass to the ground.
Guy on the motorcycle...
"DeBray could have a partner, and the partner could have shot him to stop him from talking."
"Hey, Cupcake!"
Tell the lady what you just told me.
We tracked the bike.
Registered to a David Loquasto.
He was in here earlier today to I.D. the jewelry.
His sister was the fifth victim.
I've never seen either of these.
"We couldn't stop the man who killed his sister, so he took care of it."
See?
"You still holding me, Captain?"
Case closed.
What'd I tell you?
Not a partner.
Revenge.
My baby's gonna live.
Yeah.
Long enough to turn into a teenager and make you wish otherwise.
Don't forget about Mimi.
She didn't die.
No.
Yes.
- Who is she?
- Gohar's daughter.
"No, the one I'm talking about is a poet."
What's your name?
Can't you tell me?
It doesn't matter.
"Okay, I'll recite a poem to you."
It will occupy us while you milk.
You won't answer me?
Go ahead.
I was saying that...
"""ln my nighh, so brief, alas"
"""The wind is abouh ho meeh hhe leaves."""
Do you understand that?
The two are meeting.
It's like when you went to see Yossef.
At the well.
At the well?
Bravo.
"""My nighh so brief is filled wihh devashahing anguish."
"""Hark!"
"""Do you hear hhe whisper of hhe shadows?"""
Do you understand the shadows?
That means darkness.
"""This happiness feels foreign ho me."

"""There, in hhe nighh, somehhing is happening."

Thank you.
"Remember, you can come visit me as often as you like."
"It's not that far, and I can come get you."
No choice?
We could sink the ship out on the sea!
- Not according to the British.
- I don't believe them.
"- Well, tell them."
- That's what you should do!
"I did, but it turned out this way."
Taking the lives of 50 innocent people.
You have to stop it.
The bomb is already onboard.
The ferry departed several minutes ago.
- You went for the ferry all along.
- That's not true.
Of course...
Then you'll be done with all this shit  and you can finally go back to Norway.
- Two coffees.
What do you want?
- Juice.
- Good morning.
- 39 barrels down.
Where are the shovels?
It's Karen Hill. I want to talk to you.
Hello?
Don't hang up on me!
I want to talk to you!
"You keep away from my husband, you hear me?"
Open the door!
Answer me!
"I'm gonna tell everyone who walks in this building that in 2R, Rossi, you are nothing but a whore!"
Is this the superintendent?
"Yes, I want you to know sir, that you have a whore living in 2R!"
"Rossi, Janice Rossi."
Do you hear me?
He's my husband!
Get your own goddamn man!
"Wake up, Henry."
What are you doing?
"Karen, what are you, crazy?"
"Yeah, I""m crazy."
And I'm crazy enough to kill the both of you.
"Karen, take it easy."
Do you love her?
Do you?
I love you.
You know I love you.
You don't.
"No, you don't."
"Be careful, baby."
Don't.
How could I hurt him?
I couldn't even bring myself to leave him.
The truth was that no matter how bad I felt I was still very attracted to him.
You leave Lucy out ofit.
Done.
Lucyhas no more to fearfrom me.
You see?
I can be reasonable.
"Of course, I still have a job to do, and the next target will have to be Sam or Fiona or--"
I know.
Mommy.
"Sooner or later, I'll find someone you care about more than Doug."
Soyou call me when you want it to stop.
- [Beeps ]
"- She's not leaving town, is she?"
That'd be a no.
"[Doug] Ifshe knows all this aboutyou, she'll probably come here."
She won't play this out on my turf.
She'll keep the pressure on until she gets an opening.
I-
- I can't believe this.
"I'm a C.P.A., for Christ's sake."
C.P.A. brought down Al Capone.
There's a reason why the feds wantyou to testify.
I saywe hunt her down.
Ammunition's cheap.
"Fi, ifwe go out there without a plan, we're exposed."
She's more than happy to keep killing people until we hand Doug over.
She can come after me.
I'm ready.
Yeah?
- What about Sam?
"- I'm game, Mike."
"What about ifshe comes after my mom, my brother..."
Doug's sonJasper?
And we'll see who's full of what.
"Truth or Dare, Gemma?"
Pick one.
Truth.
Who do you think sent the postcard?
- I don't know.
- I want your honest opinion.
"Honestly, I don't know."
Big bastard!
Let's try that again.
"In your honest opinion, who among the people gathered here do you think is most likely... to have sent the postcard?"
Chris.
"Oh... oh, Gem."
"I'm sorry, I didn't know who else to say."
"Well, she doesn't know, Justin."
She's saying it because she's scared.
Gemma dumped Chris because of Felix.
- Maybe he wanted revenge.
- That's ridiculous.
While we were driving you just said you wanted to hit him.
"- Yeah, I wanna hit everyone!"
- Did you send the postcard?
I did not.
Fuck!
Wait.
What was... what was the postmark?
What was the date on the card?
"7th September, London."
"I was in fucking Spain, you tossers, three whole weeks."
"Paul, Paul, you can vouch for me."
The first week of September I couldn't go to the lakes because I was in Spain.
"He's right, he was in Spain."
- That's not really a good idea today.
- Abby.
Triage needs extra bodies.
They got 20 kids from Kelton Elementary with vomiting and diarrhea.
I'll be there in five minutes.
Abby.
"Abby, it's okay."
I can get to the bus station by myself.
"No, I'll take you."
I'll take you.
"Mr. Levine, what's your problem?"
I just got drunk at a Valentine's Day party.
- Five days ago.
"- Yeah, it was a blowout."
- I wanted to tell you-
- Hey.
No.
Why did you take that out?
It was itchy.
- Altered mental status.
"- Abby, send up admit labs two sets of blood cultures, and grab an LP tray."
- Meningitis?
- Let's find out.
- I'm sorry.
"- It's okay, I'll call you when I get home."
Okay.
- Bye.
- Bye.
"Nurses shortage, you know."
Working in the ER can be a very inconvenient job sometimes.
"I'm sorry, John."
I just wanted Eric to come home so bad so that I could be with my family just for a second.
"Here, in my head."
What's your name?
You don't want to tell me!
What about you?
How old are you?
I see.
You're not very talkative!
Are you hungry?
Thirsty?
Good that's a start!
But I would like to hear the sound of your voice.
Maybe you aren't able to speak!
Is that it?
Are you mute?
"Poor wretches, they are mute!"
"Monique, bring them some grenadine."
I understand.
You have to leave.
Let me look at you a while longer.
I'm afraid I may never see you again.
"Listen, I would never betray you."
You can always think of me as a friend!
Are you afraid of those girls?
Cowards.
Coward
You're running away.
You're terrified.
I'm not afraid of them.
I'm going.
I'll bring you back their heads.
Where are they?
- I'm not afraid.
Either that or you don't know what's funny either.
I... don't know what's funny?
"I'll have you know, at camp,"
"I was voted ""Miss Whimsy""."
"Why, was Miss Irony killed in a canoe accident?"
"Hi, Dick."
"- Oh, uh, Mary."
Just doing some reading.
"Some physics reading, you know."
Okay.
"Say, uh, an amusing joke just came to me you know, out of the blue."
"Knock, knock."
Okay.
Who's there?
Who's there you say?
Nina!
Nina who?
"Ah Nina, she's right here!"
Please let me host that fundraiser!
No!
- Oh!
"Ben Littmeyer just called, he's gonna be a few minutes late for lunch."
"Oh, another lunch with Ben."
I see.
How funny for you.
"Well, would you like to join us, we could make it a threesome?"
I don't go that way Mary.
Fine!
"And last but not least, garlic gum."
"Oh, uh, Harry, how would you like a nice piece of perfectly ordinary gum?"
Okay.
"Mmm, garlicky."
$12.000 is a pretty good price.
But I cannot be bought.
"I might be influenced, but never bought."
"Mr. O'Hara, please."
"Mr. O'Hara, this is Mrs. Ryan."
What is the latest quote on the Wentworth Drug?
I see.
Would you please transfer four thousand shares from Mr. Sabourin's account to mine?
He's right here.
He'll confirm it.
"O'Hara, it's alright to transfer the stock to Mrs. Ryan's account."
I'll be in the office later and consign all the papers then.
"Alright, goodbye."
Here.
Thank you.
Now we have a deal.
Right.
The stock is now up to ten.
What?
Now I've made roughly $20.000 since your offer.
"I outsmarted you, Mr. Sabourin."
"Well, I always admire anyone who can outsmart me."
Goodbye.
"Thank you very much, Mrs. Dodds."
"Oh, Mr. Sabourin."
I have that transfer ready for you to sign.
Alright.
What's the latest quote on Wentworth Drug?
Fifteen.
As of now you have made a profit of $200.000.
That's not a bad day's work.
Where did you get that tip?
This time...
You've done them justice.
Congratulations.
Take your apron upstairs.
Great job.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

Exactly.
We think your niece is involved

"You're on leave, and the Gunzel case is closed."
Gunzel was no serial killer.
Not in the usual sense.
He was filling orders.
And not just for Hiromitsu.
Orders?
From whom?
Someone called lrezumi.
There are collectors...
Gunzel was just the tip of the iceberg.
There are others...
- Schrader!
Gunzel was in prison.
He couldn't have committed every murder.
If it was murder!
All 12 people with a Hiromitsu are reported dead or missing.
Come on.12
Has Gunzel's death been made public?
Tomorrow.
- We have to stop it.
Until we knowwho's behind it.
We?
"- Yeah, I wanna work the case again."
What's the lawyer's name?
Schoubya.
Frank Schoubya.
"Call me by my first name, since we're spending time together again."
I'll clear things with my superiors.

It's the joy of teaching which is the reward.
You don't want to end upNlike Aunt lmogene.

No.
So you'll marry Hamish. and your life will be perfect.
It's already decided.

I'll leave you to it.

Do you know what I've always dreaded?
The decline of the aristocracy?
Ugly grandchildren.
But you're lovely.
You're bound to produceNlittle...
Imbeciles!
The gardeners haveNplanted white roses when I specifically asked for red.
You could always paint the roses red.
What an odd thing to say.
You should know that my sonNhas extremely delicate digestion.
(RUSTLlNG )
-Did you see that?
N-See what?
I think.N-Nasty things.
I do enjoy setting the dogs on them.
Nhe could get a blockage.

Did you see it that time?
-See what?
N-The rabbit.
Don't shout.

-What was I saying?
N-Hamish has a blockage.
Miss.
Are you scared of going with me?
No.
"I'd like to see for myself, what you're going to offer him."
You're insane!
"Why, you as well?"
!
Who are you?
"Tell your leader,"
I'm So Seo-No from Yeon Ta-Bal's clan.
I want to see the bandit leader.
"Came by yourself, didn't you?"
You really are something.
"The Commander isn't here now,"
"Until he comes back, throw this girl into the cell."
Yes.
Miss!
Miss!
What's going on?
Is the entire fleet captured?
"Not that,"
Miss decided to come on her own accord.
What?
Are you crazy?
How can you deliver yourself to him?
A blessing to see you're doing well.
"Seriously,"
Did you really come here yourself?
Yes.
Now... what exactly were you thinking?
Are you hurt?
Miss!
- That's it!
That was one close finish.
You sure made Dinoco proud.
"Thank you, King."
"Well, Tex, you've been good to me all these years."
It's the least I could do.
"Whatever happens, you're a winner to me, you old daddy rabbit."
"Thanks, dear."
Wouldn't be nothing without you.
Kch-i-ka-chow!
- I'm Mia.
- I'm Tia.
"We're, like, your biggest fans!"
Ka-chow!
I love being me.
"- OK, girls, that's it."
"- We love you, Lightning!"
"Hey, buddy."
You're one gutsy racer.
"Oh, hey, Mr. The King."
You got more talent in one lug nut than a lot of cars has got in their whole body.
- Really?
"Oh, that..."
- But you're stupid.
- Excuse me?
"- This ain't a one-man deal, kid."
You need to wise up and get a good crew chief and a good team.
"You ain't gonna win unless you got good folks behind you, and you let them do their job, like they should."
- Like I tell the boys at the shop...
- A good team.
Yeah...
Ka-chow!
Brand new and just for us!

The 99 Euro Show!
"Toni, there is no show."
You're joking right?
That's a joke?

Yes.
I forgot my glasses.
I can't see the keyboard.
Then get your glasses!
God damn it!
Now go!
"Sure, sure, ladies and gentlemen, of course you all want to see Nora again."
"Well, before we get started with the quiz show, here once again is Nora and the Pope dancers!"
Me again?
Yes.
Now what?
"It doesn't matter, just sing it again."
"Once again, from the top."
Everything gets to the point where I just say stop.
A lively hotel.
It's dinner time.
Everyone's dressed up.
The first guests are taking their seats.
And now we're going to the cafeteria.
If I were him I would do the same thing.
What's going on here?
We're having a going-away party.
It's probably for the best.
What?
That your brother takes a vacation.
- Can...
"Can we think about going to the doctor, please?"
Oh.
"Edwin, did you hear my grandson?"
He says I have to go to the doctor.
Is that so?
I was a doctor for 47 years.
How do I look?
"- Oh, okay by me."
Yeah.
- [Chuckling]
- Appointment done.
"- Meemaw, please."
Have something to eat.
The steaks are a buck.
I'm not hungry right now.
Why not?
Is there something wrong with you?
"No, I just..."
I promised Mom that I would take you to the doctor.
That's all.
I'm trying to be a good person here.
I'm trying to be a good son.
I'll tell your mom how fabulous you are.
I'm trying to show her that I have responsibility as well.
Okay?
But you're doing something responsible.
You're-
- You're elongating my life
Because you took me to have a good time with my friends.
- Yeah.
- What could be better?
And I got my period at a very young age.
"Oh, my God,"
I-I got to get out of here.
I-I can't breathe.
I don't know why I let myself get close.
"Christine, hold on."
I don't want to hear any more jokes.
"Come on, you joke about New Christine all the time."
"Like how she's so dumb, she has to take off her shirt to count to two."
"Or when you killed that moth, and you said she moved up on the brain donor list."
"Well, that's different."
That's funny.
"Anyway, it's not just your lame jokes, Richard."
It's everything.
It's the pancakes and the princess and the periods.
She's not my daughter.
I don't want to be her mother.
I thought you liked Papa Jeff.
I do.
I did.
I-I don't know.
I just...
I've just got to get home.
Wait.
What do I tell people?
I don't know.
Just tell them I got sick.
That was my mother-in-law.
She had to leave.
Her broom was double-parked.
It's funny.
"Oh, I'm glad you're home."
Let me hold it.
You bring the drink
No.
This is an important book of our Paşa
What's it?
Give it to me.
I'll have a look
"My Sultana, please"
I said give it to me
Is this İbrahim's handwriting?
"Yes, he always works on this book"
He writes and draws
"My Sultana, let me bring the notebook."
Paşa shouldn't be angry
Alright
Take the important notebook
Selamunaleykum
"Who's the rich man near you, Matrakçı?"
What kind of poet you are.
You first see the colour of money
He's a merchant.
He's not from here
Welcome Figani Efendi
Not really welcomed Hayday Efendi.
Not at all
I wish I didn't see it
What is it?
"I saw such a thing while coming, I'm not cheered anymore"
Who's this guy?
Figani
He's a good poet.
His tongue and also pen are sharp
You have company.
Just texting my girlfriends.
It's time for me to leave.
"Oh, It's only 9:00."
"We could have some coffee, watch a movie."
More cake?
"Oh, the cake was awesome."
"But really, I don't want to overstay my welcome, so, Dylan, do you want to walk me to the door?"
"Go ahead, Dylan."
Go ahead.
Of course.
What are you doing?
Ben has been waiting for hours.
"Oh, I doubt it."
You doubt it?
"Okay, let me rephrase that."
I don't care.
I don't care about Ben.
I care about you.
And I did see you first at that party and I am really smitten with you.
And I'm angry with myself for stepping aside for my friend.
You slept with Ben's wife that night.
"Yeah, I did."
"And it was a huge mistake, huge."
"But stepping aside, huger mistake."
He doesn't deserve you.
He's in love with Amy.
"He's always been in love with Amy, so don't waste your time."
And I hope you'll give me a chance.
"Good night, Robert."
"Good night, Cecilia."
BOTH:
How many Tiles belong?
112.
"You got it, sweetheart."
- Just tell me when.
- Fantastic!
You'll come for dinner before?
- I'll make a brisket.
- I love brisket.
Get home safe.
"Well, I'm taking a cab anyway."
Thanks again.
"Hello, Larry."
"- I got to see you, Frank."
"- Well, here I am."
How about a cup of coffee?
"No, thanks."
We got to talk.
Are you finished here?
"Well, the business of government is never finished."
"Come on, let's take a walk."
Mister A!
"How are you, Milton?"
I'm as corny as Kansas in August
I'm as normal as blueberry pie
No more a smart little girl With no heart
I have found me a wonderful guy
"Speaking of blueberry pies bring us a couple, Milton."
"You, à la mode?"
"No, thank you."
I don't want any pie.
Apple for him.
"And coffee, Milt."
Anybody else?
"No, I don't think so."
Wasn't Bertrand JoyaI with you?
"Yeah, but no..."
Was he there or not?
"He was there in the yard, but he wasn't with us... at the hotel or in the car."
alright.
So when you got there?
He ran away.
And you caught him.
Yeah.
You ran after him?
"Yeah, well Touchy ran, me... with the pick up."
With the pick up?
In the corn?
"Yeah, I've got a bad leg."
So then... you caught him and you brought him back.
What did you do to keep him from running away?
You locked him up?
You aimed the gun at him?
What?
"No, no, we thought that was too dangerous."
Same with locking him up.
We didn't want him to break anything else.
So...
We didn't...
we didn't lock him up.
"In that case, what did you do?"
Did you tie him up?
You tied him up?
You tied him up?
Just like that?
"Wait, don't!"
"Please, don't!"
"Are you gonna talk, Joe?"
"Ok, start giving the kid a workout."
Oww!
"Please, don't!"
Shut up!
Cut it out!
Ok!
Will you talk now?
Ok.
I'll tell you.
Anybody still live in my old Westchester home?
"No, it's closed up."
"Well, out by the swimming pool is a great big..."
"This is the last stop, Joe."
What?
Come on!
"We're saying good-bye, papa."
"The kid, too?"
"Sure, with our love and kisses."
"He must be hotter than a firecracker now,"
And we got enough hot stuff as it is.
"Yeah, you can get to know the kid better!"
Then maybe all 4 of you can live together!
"How are you ducking bullets, Joe?"
"Yeah, the feds will be shooting at you from all sides!"
Thanks for the bus fare!
They ain't getting away with a thing.
That dough ain't going to be theirs for long.
Was there much?
The box looked real full.
I'll have to remember that.
Trevor?
Can I ask you something?
Should my lawyer be present?
Why are you always leaving me such generous tips?
- Do I?
- 20 dollars for coffee and pie?
And entertainment.
- Entertainment?
- You.
"Trevor, you don't have to buy my companionship."
"Sorry, I..."
It wasn't meant that way.
"If you really want to spoil me, take me to a movie sometime."
That's a deal.
"My goodness, there must be a hole in this glass."
I'll get it.
- You waited on me enough.
- Thanks.
It is the last door on the left.
Reznik.
I want you on the Swansea-lathe today.
Where is Sanchez?
"That's an irrelevant question, Reznik, I'm asking you."
Shit!
"- If there's anything else we can do for you, let us know."
"- Thank you, Mr Furman."
- Goodbye.
- See you now.
"Hey, look who it is."
"Bombay Miller, you okay?"
"- Good, good."
Maybe because of this.
"Oh, my God."
Do you think -- I do.
What are we going to do?
Relax.
I'll take care of it.
Just get rid of the evidence.
[ Sighs ]
"Okay, I'm no health nut, but that... is just wrong."
"All right, talk."
This isn't what you think.
I'm not a killer.
"Well, then, what are you?"
I'm a Pishtaco.
A fish taco?
A Pishtaco.
"It means ""Peruvian fat sucker""."
Never heard of it.
"So, what, you're like vamps with a sweet tooth for cellulite?"
Vampires kill.
We're just...
Parasites.
"Oh, well, in that case --"
"Look, I would never hurt anybody!"
"Okay, this -- this is why Larry and I started Canyon Valley."
"We could help people lose weight, and I could feed."
It was a win-win.
"Yeah, except for the two you dysoned to death."
That wasn't me.
"Well, then who was it?"
Alonso.
The dude from the cafeteria?
Tomorrow?
"Tomorrow, can I sleep in your basement?"
Can you drop me at the office?
All my stuff is there.
Because that's where you're sleeping?
Yeah.
And I've got some business that I have to take care of in the morning.
"You know, he's right."
Wasserman.
"About you and I, this connection."
Yeah.
Hi.
"Oh, is Sophie asleep?"
-It's like 12:30.
Yeah.
"- Dr. Storper was right,"
- I don't have a fear of flying.
- Ok?
"He thought it was a symptom, but not the cause."
"He didn't know what the cause was, but I know now."
- Ok?
- I have a fear of losing you...
I have a fear of losing you.
Here.
Thanks.
"See, the flying triggered a panic reaction because it was taking me away from you."
The real life stuff has been taking me away from you.
We talked about this.
We did that on purpose.
I wanna be with you and Sophie.
I wanna help you with her.
"I wanna live here, marry you even, if you're into that."
"Daddy, are you coming to eat?"
- Hold on.
Why do I have to deal with replacing them 3 weeks after the show opened?
"Okay, bye."
Cups.
We got a new announcer today.
Slava Silkis.
He was a very political broadcaster in Leningrad.
"I think they're afraid of taking the risk, so..."
You're not even listening.
I'm listening.
"Slava Silkis, was a very political broadcaster."
"Now I want the lemon, please."
Cut her some lemon.
I'm doing the rice.
"Anyway, Slava Silkis said to tell you he saw the show."
"He hardly understands Hebrew, but enjoyed it immensely."
Let them wait.
Yes.
But I said I was coming.
Bye.
So you spoke with Slava Silkis about the show.
I'm not talking about that anymore.
But you said he saw the show.
- It doesn't matter now.
"Okay, it doesn't matter."
"Goni, the salad."
You have to mix it well after you add the lemon.
It's been mixed enough.
No!
- Goni.
Ora.
I know you told Serena you love me.
Serena heard wrong.
Last year you told Nate.
This year you told Serena.
You tell everyone but me.
Why can't you tell me?
Is gossip girl right about you being a coward?
That's not true and you know it.
Gossip girl can be right about you all she wants
But I won't let her be right about me.
I will not be weak anymore.
You can't run.
You have to stay here and hear it this time.
Chuck Bass...
I love you.
I love you so much...
It consumes me.
I love you...
And I know you love me too.
Tell me you love me
Then everything we've done--
All the gossip and the lies
And the hurt
Will have been for something.
Tell me it was for something.
Maybe it was.
But it's not anymore.
Oh my gosh.
Do you remember the casbah?
That concert?
Barely...
In the best way.
You intend to go to your brother with that?
"Not only go there, but also find out what he has against you."
The number you dialled is not in service.
Come in.
Hello.
Hello.
Is Judge Roban here?
Not yet.
Can I take a message?
Tell him it's all in here.
Very well.
Goodbye.
"Hello, is... is Julie here, please?"
"No, there's no Julie here."
"Yes, Julie... a girl with dark hair."
I don't know.
You must have the wrong floor.
"I'm sorry, but I have been here before."
I can even tell you that the glasses are behind...
"Listen, it's not here, OK?"
"Marianne, did Mrs Courcelles get in touch?"
"Not that I know of, Your Honour."
I should have let her leave in her bra and panties.
Prepare a summons for indictment.
- I'm leaving.
- I am sorry.
She...
"She stopped by earlier, she left... an envelope for you."
- An envelope?
An envelope.
I can't recall where I put it.
Are you doing this on purpose?
Now I understand why that ACP let me go.
So that the Boss can kill you?
So what are you waiting for?
Come on kill me.
Not even your father...
Don't speak about my father!
Because I can endure anything.
But I can never endure anyone abusing my father.
'I can endure anything.'
'But if anyone abuses my father.'
'I cannot endure that.'
Brother!
I'm your brother.
I want to hug you bro.
But... the rascal on the left keeping an eye on us.
Look.
Dad.
The Boss has Shiv in his grip.
Yes.
He's too good.
Now play along with me.
But I can't act.
That's the problem with you new-comers.
That's why I've come prepared.
Look.
Take a good look.
Look.
- This is the lion's paw.
- Yes.
If that's a paw... then I have a strong hand.
And when I pound someone with this... he never gets up again.
Strong arm!
- I'm concerned about this one child...
- Shut up!
"Respectfully, all right?"
"Respectfully, shut up."
Because we've got organs.
"I whish we could get organs delivered, instead of having to pick them up, you know?"
I hate flying.
"I always feel much closer to death on a plane than in the OR, don't you?"
I do now.
I met Izzie the other day.
She's very pretty.
So you--you think she's the one?
I-I don't know.
"Well, I mean, we're at that age, right?"
"Marriage, babies..."
That the plan?
I don't know!
I'm sorry.
"I-I don't make plans, okay?"
"If there's a future there, great."
"If not, whatever."
I'll get over it.
I always do.
Okay?
Okay.
I think it's nice.
Your date.
I think you and the pig murderer make a really good couple.
Okay.
What are you gonna do on your date?
What are you ganna talk about?
- Why do you care?
Fine.
It's very viscous.
It's a...
Cab-Merlot blend.
"Okay, okay, okay."
"Bob, do you know what the wine is?"
It is a blend.
But it's a blend of spit.
Because it's from the spit bucket!
What?
He's right.
Bobby wins.
What?
!
"You drank spit, Rick."
You drank a lot of it.
What?
You poured that from the spit bucket?
Why did you do that?
Because I knew Bob would know what it was.
Why would Bob know that?
"Because we went to see Sideways, and after that we went to the wine bar and I bet Bob he wouldn't drink from the spit bucket and he did."
That's disgusting.
And that's how you win a wine-off.
Ah!
Wine fight!
"No, no, no."
Not the jacket.
"Not-not the turtleneck, it's cashmere."
That's for lying on your profile.
I'm sorry.
"Look, I'm a middle-aged man who's just trying to get back out there and..."
You're damn straight I did.
"I endorsed your reinstatement, Ranger."
That means you shit the bed and I gotta clean the sheets now.
"Thing is, sir, captains don't endorse reinstatements."
- They don't?
- Nope.
"I don't know who the hell you are, but you sure as shit ain't Chance Holbrook."
[laughs]
"Well, you got me there."
"Déjà vu, Rinche?"
You son of a bitch.
Holbrook was a good man.
"Ooh, are you sure about that?"
Because he was going to finger you for Tony's murder.
[grunting]
"- Come on, come on..."
"- Hey, hey!"
"- I wouldn't do that, Kate."
- Scott...
Agh!
"Holy shit, you shot me!"
[grunting]
Let's go!
Come on!
[grunting]
"- [pounding on door] - [Carlos] Open up, rinchesito!"
"It's too late, Carlos."
Your boss already took the key.
It is useless without the map.
"Hand over the bonds, because I am not leaving without them."
"Well, then I guess you're not leaving."
[loud grunt]
Who asked you to lie?
They asked where my uncle was.
I said that he'd left.
They asked how he was and you said he'd left.
We don't want anything from your uncle.
They asked me.
I said that he had left.
They asked how she was.
It wasn't about your uncle.
Have they taught you anything at school?
Yes.
You don't give an answer until you're asked a question.
"Yes, I've been taught that."
I don't want any more bread.
You understand?
"If you have good news, come here."
"If not, don't bother coming back!"
All right.
- Understand?
- Yes.
Put the bread down there and go.
"Hello, engineer."
My mother wants to know if you want the milk cold or hot.
Warm it up.
Good day.
"There's nothing more to say, Mrs Godarzi."
As I told you before.
"No, it's the same."
What?
"No, we don't know what to do."
What does that mean?
"That's impossible, Mrs Godarzi."
- He can find himself another hit man.
- I'm sure.
- I'll tell if you tell me.
- No!
"OK, kids, lunch is ready!"
You should get yourself a new map.
No.
This is my only school prize.
- The names are out of date.
- I know.
The old maps are the best.
The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics - that's a brilliant name for a country.
Are you gonna talk to me?
What do you want to know?
How did you get out so early?
Where are you living?
What are you gonna do with your life?
I'm out on licence.
I'm living in a kind of halfway house.
My life
"- I don't know, Jess."
I need some more time on that one.
- Is that it?
- Course it's not it.
- I did it for you.
- No.
I killed them for you.
- You did it for yourself.
"- Why did you write to me, then, Jess?"
Because I love you and you were the only person I could turn to.
"You're all I've got right now, Jess."
Promise me you won't go away again?
Now I plan to mary and settle down.
Good idea.
Have you seen any girl?
"- No, I haven't yet."
But I will.
I see.
You hide from me?
"Tell me, who is she?"
"Hey, there's nobody."
"Don't wory about me, big daddy."
Find a good girl for yourself and settle down.
I did like a girl.
Butthings didn'twork out.
"Come on, you are good at it."
But I am no good.
I get a bit nervous.
- So what?
I'll speak for you.
"- First, speak for yourself."
"Sheetal, these flowers are rosy in colour like you."
But you are looking more red in your anger now.
"Yes, I'm Vijay here."
I was waiting for your call.
Really?
"So, you were sure I'd call you, were you?"
Of course. I have seen a lot of cases like this.
Tell me...
How are you?
May I ask you why you sent me these flowers?
Just to get a call from you.
And just why did you expect a call from me?
Just because I want to meet you.
- So I'll call you?
- All right.
- Is Stanislav at his work?
- Yes.
Too bad you didn't bring Irishka.
I've missed her so much!
Your glasses gave me a fright.
Thought something's wrong with your eyes.
"No, I'm all right."
"To hell with them, take them off!"
"Here, Shurka sent you a note."
She had a baby at last!
A swell boy!
Could hardly deliver him.
It's about dress patterns.
And she wants a necklace for the New Year.
"- Here, have an apple."
"- I don't want it, mama."
"- What about you, young man?"
- Merci.
What's the matter with you?
"Oh, what are you doing, mama?"
Why did you have to smear it all?
I smeared it all!
Goodbye!
"The general, we rode together."
Handsome man!
Came to inspect exercises.
And in my compartment was the chief engineer of a fishing factory!
About my age.
"I nicknamed him ""a man with a mustache""."
He got a mustache like a cube!
- Shh!
- Shh!
- They found Sally.
- Mm-hmm.
"Atta girl, Sally."
"By tonight, the entire world's gonna hear how well you're breathing."
"Hi, I'm Jack Dane."
This is Mike Makula.
- Hi.
- We're from the Wameru Center.
I'm Captain Stedman from the consulate.
"This is Sergeant McEvoy, and Dr. Alison, our scientific attaché."
How do you do?
Doctor.
We're with the search party.
"Well, thanks very much for your help, gentlemen, but as you can see, we were fortunate enough to have already found Sally."
- Can we see her?
- Sure.
"It's all right, Sergeant."
"Hello, Sall--"
I don't believe it.
That's not Sally.
That's Judy.
She's our chimp.
You gotta be kidding.
Of course it's Judy.
She's our compound pet.
"Gentlemen, you are sadly mistaken."
"Look, she's wearing an authentic NASA space helmet."
"Now, if she weren't Sally, what would she be doing with that helmet?"
"Well, that's a tough thing to answer, but believe me, you are making a mistake."
"Please, young man, we've got no time for jokes."
"Keeps calling me, says.."
..a little investment can take me far there
"But I say, I am too old to settle in a new place."
Johnny bhai.
My money is stuck somewhere.
I will rent the room as soon as I get it back.
Play chess with me every night.
Stay for free as long as you like!
When are you coming to get us?
I'll be there soon!
Why?
Has something happened?
"No, but just come and get us fast."
I'll be there don't worry!
"Hello, Kavita ma'am..."
Mukesh here.
Who Mukesh?
There is no Kavita here...
Don't call back again.
"Hello, Reena ma'am."
This is Mukesh here.
You haven't called last few days so I thought I should call and inquire.
Wrong number.
Mrs. Kajal?
This is Mukesh calling.
Usha ma'am.
This is Mukesh calling.
Mrs. Vandana?
- Wrong number.
"Sorry, I won't call back again."
"Hello, Sarika ma'am... I have told you not to call here..."
Don't call back again.

"'Janet Clark, please report to maternity.'"
"Lena, sit down."
Is someone after Saul?
"Lena, you can trust me."
You wouldn't believe me.
Of course I'll believe you.
- You'll think I'm crazy.
"- Just try me, OK?"
Nazis.
Nazis are after my Saul.
"You see, I told you you wouldn't believe it."
Wait. it's not that. it's just...
- Nazis?
Are you sure?
- Yes.
"I mean, how do you know?"
"Lena, of course I believe you, but... you just don't hear this kind of stuff in Hawaii."
Why would Nazis be after Saul?
Saul was a member of something called the Masada Team.
- Saul was an Israeli agent?
"- Tom, you know of the Masada Team?"
Yeah. it's a secret Israeli unit that locates and captures war criminals.
They got Eichmann and only they know how many others.
- I was in naval intelligence.
"- Oh, yes."
I forgot.
"If the Nazis were gonna murder Saul, why would they bother..."
- I'm sorry.
"- No, no."
You're right.
You're right.
"Well, you can't."
You can't just ask her like that.
- Why not?
"- It would be terribly rude, asking someone if money is theirs."
That would be so embarrassing!
"Rubbish, Basil."
"Hello, Fawlty Towers."
Polly Sherman?
"Yes, certainly, I'll get her straightway."
Hang on.
Polly!
"Terry, where's Polly?"
In there.
- She saw you with the money!
- What?
She saw you counting the horse money!
She's just coming...
"oh, hello, dear."
Here she is.
Found her in here.
"As I was just saying, Polly, my wife would like a word with you about a slightly delicate matter."
"It's not delicate, Basil."
Don't be silly.
He thinks it's embarrassing for me to ask you about that money I saw you with earlier on in the office.
I wondered if someone had handed it in.
Mrs. Richards has lost some.
The money?
In the office?
"You were counting it, weren't you?"
Did someone hand it in?
"Oh, no."
"No, it's mine."
Ha ha!
Captain Kirk.
"You must try harder, Captain."
This is too easy.
Enterprise...
"Enterprise, can you hear me?"
"Touche, Captain."
Touche.
"I must confess you scored first, but after all, I never played this game before."
And now let's have at it again!
Ha ha ha!
Enterprise...
Enterprise...
Aha!
Tallyho!

"You made a noble fight of it, Captain."
"Remember, you promised to let my ship go."
But this is such sport.
I must fetch all the others back to play.
So this is victory.
It has a sweet taste.
"Down, Captain-- on your knees!"
"You haven't won, Trelane."
I could run you through!
But you haven't won anything.
"On your knees, Captain!"
No!
Does it still taste as sweet?
I order you.
You've been beaten!
But I'm not defeated.
"Give us back our jobs, you arsehole."
Not now you all hate me.
The workers united will never be defeated!
..cheaper grain.
When do we want it?
Now!
What do we want?
Cheaper grain!
When do we want it?
Now!
Delphine?
What are you doing here?
"What are you doing here, Marcus?"
You said you'd cut grain prices and then you raised them!
I had to!
"Can you not protest against me, please?"
Why would you do that?
"Because he's looking after himself and his cronies, love."
"Mate, I'm trying to have a conversation with my girlfriend."
You go out with this arsehole?
"I do, yes."
And stop calling me that!
You could do a lot better!
Thank you.
"Shut up, please."
I'd dump him.
Dump him!
Dump him!
Dump him!
Dump him!
Dump him!
"I mean, this is not how I thought today would go."
Let's go.
"No, no."
We can't do that.
"What, you got a better idea?"
"Come on, dad, our window's closing, and we need to dine and dash now."
"Excuse me, sir."
Sir!
Wow.
I can't believe you did that.
"Yeah, neither can I."
That is so not you.
Can I ask you something?
Sure.
"So, where are you and Martin going?"
Dad.
What?
"Come on, I don't wanna talk about that."
"We're just gonna fight, ok?"
"Forget it, then."
It's ok.
"Well, I should get back."
"Oh, Martin said that you had 'till 5:00, right?"
"Sarah, I really just... just wanna tag along with you, see how you spend your time."
I'm not gonna interfere.
"I'll just sit there, won't say a word."
What is it you think I do?
Steal cars?
Vandalize private property?
Beg?
"Sarah, I have no idea what you do... and that's why I'm asking."
This is a life drawing class.
"Yeah, sorry to disappoint."
I'M THE ONE WHO GETS YOU THERE.

"CARE FOR A NIGHTCAP, CONGRESSMAN?"
"WHAT, ARE YOU DRUNK?"
YOU'RE NOT DRUNK ENOUGH.
WOULD YOU COME TO BED?
WE SHOULD BE CELEBRATING.
AREN'T YOU EXCITED?
WE WOULD BE SCRUTINIZED UNDER A MICROSCOPE.

WE HAVE ANYTHING TO HIDE?
OF COURSE NOT.

"WELL, JAMES ISN'T LIKE HIS FRIENDS."
HE OBSESSES ABOUT PRESIDENTS
THE SAME WAY OTHER BOYS OBSESS ABOUT DINOSAURS.
"I MEAN, ISN'T THIS EXACTLY WHAT YOU ALWAYS WANTED?"
WHAT?
I JUST NOTICED HOW ADORABLE YOU ARE IN MY SHIRT.
-Start with the truth.
The super saw you leave her apartment before water came through the ceiling.
Let me ask you a question.
What question did you just ask me?
What was the question you asked me?
When the last time you saw her was.
"I told you the last time that I saw her alive, right?"
"-When I saw her after, she was dead."
"-Why didn't you call it in then, Mike?"
I had a couple of changes of clothes and shaving stuff in the apartment.
Where's the stuff now?
"It's in my locker, John."
Couple of shirts and some shaving stuff.
"Come on, let's go."
SlPOWlCZ:
Come on.
KELLY:
Let's go take a look.
"Beautiful, beautiful."
Great.
That's beautiful.
Embarrass me in front of the department.
Great!
-Nobody's gonna embarrass you.
ROBERTS:
"Yeah, right."
-What's it look like?
-l don't know.
-He deny the super's story?
-Says he was there after she died.
-Only time he was there.
-Believe him?
Good for the pain within.
Very good super aspirin.
My body feels light.
Soon you'll feel much better.
I think the Paki fancies the pusher frau.
Hossein is no Paki.
He's Persian.
"Well, then the Persian fancies the pusher frau."
"- Hi, Steso."
"- Maria, get dressed."
- It smells of... opium!
- Against pain.
Too expensive for you.
- Fucking Paki!
- Persian.
"Fucking Persian, then."
Asger?
How's my credit?
- Very bad...
- Right.
I'll just hang around then.
"We're all waiting for something bigger and better to hit us, right?"
I'm not waiting for anything.
"Will you let Asger tattoo your hardened, Middle Eastern body?"
Having tattoos is a sin.
Your body is a temple.
It's sacred.
"You don't tag your own temple, do you?"
"- And you, Steso."
You got any?
- Plenty.
Look!
It's Dave and Sharon's engagement party.
That's what I'm saying.
"Obviously, we don't report it tonight."
There is a dead fucking st-rotting corpse in the storage unit.
You can't smell anything as long as we keep the door closed.
Wow.
It's been down there a week.
What's one more day?
Uh-uh.
Look.
"We let the party happen, we look at tomorrow's photo... and if it shows the cops taking our testimony and shit, I'll call 'em myself."
I have to admit.
I am kind of curious to see one more photo.
All right.
Fine.
One day.
But... one day.
(MUSIC)
- What time is it?
- Twenty till.
"Well, just in case tomorrow's photo shows the end of the world-"
(INHALES) I'm going to enjoy myself.
Do you want to dance?
And he adopts his classic glazed-over look.
What?

(MUSIC)
"-Yes, sir."
-You got the cigars?
"-Yes, sir."
"Now, you boys have done a darn good job."
"Uh, uh..."
what's your number again?
"-Uh, 43, sir."
-43.
-Your number?
"-27, sir."
27.
"You take care of me, I'm gonna take care of you."
You boys may be used to deadbeats but not in this corner.
"You're in good shape, I'm taking good ca..."
"On the double, walk, hup, hup!"
"Here we go, hup, hup!"
"All right, now, look."
BELLHOP:
"Big doings tonight, eh, sir?"
We're going to have a big-time reunion-- my old squad coming.
-Yes...
"-These poor souls never lived before, like I'm going to show 'em."
"-Look, uh..."
"-Yes, sir."
No reason why I can't shack 'em up here.
No use in them getting a room.
"What the management don't know won't hurt 'em, you know?"
"-Get that stuff out of the bag, will you, kid?"
"-Yes, sir."
I tell you what I have to have done.
A lot of things have to be done real quick.
"You're doing a good job, kid."
You are biting off more than you can chew.
"If you talk about Tangak once more,"
I will slap in your face in the way you have not seen it before.
That's it.
Bashirou!
What a nice shirt.
It looks great on you.
"If I wear gunny, you know what's gunny?"
If I wear gunny it will looks good on me.
Now I bought something for you that it looks so great on you.
It goes with you so much.
Thank you.
Bashirou!
You've forgot it again.
- Where are you going with such clothes?
- Tangak_
You won't go to Tangak_ I will.
I said you can't go to Tangak_
"How great you are going there,lf not you had made me disappointed."
"Go to stay with your father, wretched slatteml"
Get in.
Hey!
Hey!
Mister!
Hey Mister!
Stop your car!
Hey!
Hey!
Stop it!
Hey!
Stop!
Hey!
Next up there...
Carlos.
They will be the local authorities.
Good morning gentlemen.
We came from the Balkans.
This is the king of Belgium.
We are a diplomatic mission.
Excuse me?
He is Albanian.
She does not speak Italian?
We are in Albania.
How 'in Albania'?
"Oh, I do not believe it."
Are you sure?
- Yup.
Let's go down and ask for a phone.
"Carlos, what happened?"
- They'll be the currents.
How 'the currents'?
- There are so many currents at sea.
Well then we go down.
We went to Montenegro.
There we bought a boat there.
We were to get to the sea.
"No, excuse me, in Italy."
The captain of the Albanian port was not impressed.
He smoked a lot
While Ludovic tried to explain the situation.
But nothing to do.
"For him, we were just the sociable."
- Can I have a glass of water?
Please...
Put the web cam in on.
I will watch it all.
- Done brother-in-law.
"Bring faster, like a bride!"
My friends arrived!
Hi..
"Hi, buddy.."
- Hi dude.
Happy marriage anniversary!
- Thank you!
Come.
All these are my childhood friends.
Hello.. hi.
"You would have passed Degree, by the age they were in diapers, right brother-in-law?"
"Do not search for logic, you will miss magic."
Happy wedding anniversary Tukaram sir.
- Thank you very much..
Our Vasundhara madam has sent this gift for you.
Oh..
Thank you.
Take and keep this inside.
"Madam, this is your marriage day."
Can we see your marriage album?
That is..
Album got burnt in the fire accident.
"Buddy, let us start the party."
"- PK must come, right?"
"You mean PSPK, Is Pawan Kalyan coming for the party?"
[PSPK:
PowerStarPawanKalyan]
It is not PSPK who is coming.
"Just PK, my friend."
But you can tell me some of the stuff you write about.
What for?
You wouldn't understand.
Why wouldn't I?
Because you live different.
That's true.
But I've also lived like you.
I also wrote in my diary.
Do you still have it?
I've lost it.
But do you remember the things you wrote?
Some of them.
Tell me.
See how one can't tell a thing about that?
It must've been too boring.
Why?
I remember how I wrote the things that happened to me.
For example:
"""I woke up at 8."
"It was cold."""
The bed was warm.
"""I was almost late... because Jacoba took too long to make breakfast."""
Things like that.
I've dreamt about dogs.
-With dogs?
Yes.
That happened very often.
I saw a square full of dogs.
"They moved, sniffed around..."
There wasn't any people.
Only dogs!
"And sometimes, me."
Me?
No.
I'd make a terrible husband.
Huh.
All men say that.
"Even I say that, and I have 1 0 children and 43 grandchildren."
But you didn't come all the way out here just to hear an old man bragging.
"Well, Rick sent me."
I'm looking for a woman.
"You don't look like you need any help, but the best one I got just went in for the beer."
"Oh, no."
"See, you don't understand."
I'm not just lookin' for any woman.
"I mean, not that Kiki's any woman."
She's beautiful.
"I'm sure she's a special, sweet girl."
"Hey, brahda, just kidding."
Just kidding.
"Who's this wahine, this woman, you're looking for?"
- Did you ever hear of the Wiki-Wiki Club?
- Sure.
I was the bartender there... from '39 to '43.
Good club.
High-class wahines.
Not like the girls working the streets today.
- Did you know many of the women who worked there before the war?
"- Hey, brahda, I knew them all."
- You know what I mean.
- How 'bout this one?
Her name was Diane Westmore.
She disappeared in the attack in '41 .
"Sorry, brahda."
Trust me.
This is it?
What do we do now?
I don't want anybody getting hurt.
No matter what you see... stay in the car...
until I say.
Okay.
Thank you.
Where's your son?
Where's Jasper?
Look.
This is about me.
I'll do whatever you want.
Just don't go after my son.
You people killed my wife.
Isn't that enough?
A basic rule of covert ops... is let someone else do your dirty work.
Let someone else find the guy you want to kill.
Oh-
It's a great technique... as long as you're not the someone else.
Move!
Move!
Where's your son?
- What?
You come here to kill me and now-
- I'm not here to kill you.
- That woman out there is.
- Who's she?
I need you to stay away from the windows.
- Where is your son?
- He's not here.
I sent him to stay with friends.
- Fuck you!
Fuck you!
- Hello.
- Hey.
Don't hang up.
"Look, I'm so sorry about before."
I think...
"God, I must've had too much to drink or something, but if I promise not to try to kiss you or anything, will you come over here and talk to me?"
I really need to talk to you.
Anna?
Anna?
- Hi.
- Hey.
I promise I won't touch you.
Hey.
I don't care about tomorrow or anything else.
I just care that you're here.
Fuck!
"Oh, fuck!"
Why'd you leave without saying goodbye?
I have to go to this work thing.
I didn't want to wake you up.
Have you seen my keys?
"You can't wait to get back to her, can you?"
Can you just please help me find my keys?
What did I do?
"You didn't do anything, Kim."
You're amazing.
You were amazing.
Last night was perfect.
Here.
Thank you.
I see the red smoke.
Come on in.
Out.
COLEMAN:
Give them a hand.
"- Morning, Max, Collier."
"- Morning, sir."
- Hell of a mess!
- Looks like we'll float away.
What's this outfit coming in?
COLEMAN:
"That's Captain Nim, your counterpart with a patrol that just got zapped."
- Joe.
"- Yes, sir."
Alert the dispensary.
Tell them casualties are coming in.
L'll go find Colonel Kirby.
It was a close one.
LIEUTENANT:
Get those casualties over to the dispensary.
Let's go.
Snap it up!
The rest of you get some dry clothes and chow.
Report for debriefing.
Move it out!
Fill me in.
"As you know, we were hit yesterday."
Three casualties.
This is sure Charlie's weather!
But they didn't follow us.
- You sure?
- Affirmative.
"Please, my friend, what is the matter?"
I fetch the water.
I shall get it for you.
"If you want water, I will get you water."
"No problem, no problem."
I thought you were dead.
You must have switched baskets.
Are you hurt?
No.
"You have to get me out of here, quick."
They're gonna be back at any minute.
Cut me loose.
Quick.
They keep asking about you.
What you know.
What's wrong?
Cut me loose.
"I know where the Ark is, Marion."
The Ark's here?
"I'm coming with you, Jones."
Get me out of here!
Cut me loose!
You can't leave me here!
"If I take you out of here now, they'll start combing the place for us."
"Jones, you've got to get me out of here!"
"Come on, Jones, are you crazy?"
!
"Marion, I hate to do this, but if you don't sit still and keep quiet, this whole thing is going to be shot."
I'll be back to get you.
"Jones, what's the matter?"
That's it.
Who knows?
Yan-ling was killed by the Wu-tang.
Which one of you killed her?
- We didn't kill your sister.
- Liar!
Your sister was killed by someone else.
"Trust me, we're friends!"
I ain't your friend!
I'm your enemy!
Yes!
Use full strength!
Stop talking!
Fight!
Go!
"Ming-kai, use 8-divine Sword."
"Wu-tang, why didn't you use full force?"
How did you know?
Go on!
Why did you intentionally miss him?
How did you know I missed him?
Chin Kang Fist?
8-divine Sword?
Yes!
You better not play any tricks!
We won't.
"It's just a contest, so there's no need to kill each other."
Nonsense!
What do you mean?
Mean?
Chin Kang Fist and 8-divine sword are both impressive.
I can't distinguish which is better.
That's why I invited you both here.
I want to know which is better.
"Cover him, Ria."
Mr. de Vries... you're a doctor.
Mr. Reve!
Calm down.
What a shame we have to meet here.
Tension gauge.
Life takes strange turns.
I didn't know you were a doctor.
That's why matters of life and death interest me.
Bloem!
"Thinking of death I cannot sleep, remember?"
How is he?
How's Herman?
- He's in very bad shape.
- Dead?
Yes.
A friend of yours?
A relative?
The fourth man!
I told him but he wouldn't believe me.
"Doctor, the liver."
"Now Herman can go into a vase too, he can..."
- Enlarged but intact.
- Normal reflexes.
- She's done it again.
- You've had a lucky escape.
But she's done it again the fourth man.
She takes him like a spider a spider also fucks her mate and then devours him... dead!
Quite a shock for you.
"Keep on talking, it'll settle you down."
"She's a spider, a witoh."
She leads men to ruin.

Maybe the circuit is busy.
"Oh, circuits, my ass!"
He doesn't give a shit!
"Why don't you let me-- no, I've got it, Sharon."
It's all right.
"Operator, don't tell me there's no answer."
It's the hotel excelsior in Rome.
"Would you try it again, please, and let it ring?"
Hello?
Yes.
"No, operator,"
I've given you the number 4 times.
"What do you do, take an illiteracy test to get that job?"
"Don't tell me to be calm, God damn it!"
[Ring]

Yeah?
You're kidding me.
Ok.
I thought I just went to bed.
Yeah.
"Hey, what are we doing, scene 61?"
Ok.
"Oh, just remind flo about that blue belt."
"Yeah, I'll see you."
What are you doing here?
My bed was shaking.
FINN:
Maybe.
Or-
Or what?
The camera took a picture ahead of time?
(SCOFFS) Give me a break.
"I mean, just look at it."
"The placement of everything, my canvass."
Your canvass has looked like that for months.

WOMAN:
"Oh, my God."
This was last Wednesday.
Remember you broke the mug with your four-iron?
"Oh, yeah, right."
Thursday.
Friday we went to the movies.
"Saturday we lost power, used candles."
Sunday.
Monday.
"That's tonight, Tuesday."
Tomorrow.
Bullshit.
"Mr. ""B"" invented a camera that takes pictures of the future, and he only used it to look in our apartment?"
Doesn't make any sense.
"Well, maybe he's testing it."
"Yeah, and this thing isn't exactly portable."
"Well, he's a scientist, so there's got to be some sort of logs or documentation somewhere."
"Your Grace, we've got it!"
In a Cage!
"How did you catch it, Jean?"
You have to be smart
- No more love-turtling for you.
- No more letters.
"She'll forget in time, and your day will come."
A pretty little widow she'll be.
Let me finish it.
"No, I like it, it's like a teeny weeny hell."
You'd do better to make some doughnuts.
We haven't had them for ages - yesterday.
"It's so far, it takes time for the pigeon to find him."
It'll come flying in soon.
I've waited for so long.
It could have lost its way.
Maybe it can't find Henry.
"I told you umpteen times that with my kerchief on, he can't have anything bad happen to him!"
"Henry, d'you hear me?"
- Jacob!
- I brought you some food.
- Have you seen the pigeon?
-No.
Could all my loved ones have forgotten me?
Henry!
What's happening?
Good gracious!
"Jacob, what's going on?"
Jacob?
!
Let me out!
"Oh God, a bad omen."
It was a passionate affair.
I knew it was wrong.
What am I supposed to do?
"Said she'd kill her husband, I should kill my wife so we could live together."
I just let it go.
I thought it was talk.
"The next thing you know, lo mató, Mr. Garcia is dead."
She did it.
Son of a bitch.
But I'm still thinking that she did it because he was beating her.
-This is when I talked to your detective.
-Detective Kelly.
"Yeah, yeah."
Then she gives me a call three days ago.
"She calls me from prison, right?"
"""l did my part,"" she says."
"""Now you gonna do yours. """
That's why I was upset when you came over.
Now I realize that she's crazy.
She says she murdered him so we can live together forever.
-Your wife knows nothing about this?
-l confessed.
-She knows I'm here.
-You did the right thing.
I had to.
What about if she gets off on bail?
"She's angry with me, the next thing you know--"
SlPOWlCZ:
Yeah.
-M.E.'s office says Devlin's on his way.
-Toxicology?

- So no sex?
"- No, we just ended up watching the DVD extras of ""Happy Feet 2"""

"Oh, that's tough stuff."
"- Hey, no, ma'am."
- What?
"I only have three backup trays of those pigs in a blanket, okay?"
"Okay, you need to relax 'cause this is way too many apps."
- Mm-mm.
- All we're doing is meeting.
Bruce's girlfriend.
What's her name again?
- Nancy.
"- Yeah, she's probably, like, a out of work temp with a terrible bob and rosacea."
"I'm sure she's very sweet, okay?"
And I would just like her to feel welcome in my home.
A lesser woman might be freaked out about meeting their ex-husband's new girlfriend.
- Not this old gal.
- Nope?
"I'm very happy for them, and I think it's gonna be good for all of us."
"Judy, honey, come on over here and untie Jack, and you get a great big banana."
Two bananas?

I promise.
(SQUEAKS)
"All right, Judy."
You've had your fun.
Now untie us before those soldiers get back.
(CHATTERING)
"Oh, now where's she going?"
She's making like an astro-chimp.
What else?
What else.
"Oh, here they come."
We couldn't find her.
Did she come back?
- Yes.
She came back.
- She went that-a-way.
"Oh, wise guy, huh?"
"Hey, fella, are you and American citizen?"
Of course I'm an American citizen.
"Well, I'm gonna see that your passport's revoked and that you're shipped back to the States."
"Captain, she really is our chimp."
"Look, I don't know what your game is."
Are you trying to get publicity for your compound?
Is that why you scared Sally away?
Forget about them.
How do we get Sally back?
It's very simple.
"Let's take a look at the board because the last show,"

"Tony Hawk is on there, Bret Michaels still."
"Now, this is mid-pack."

"You don't have to, like..."

This is where it's really gonna hurt.
Stiles... you make a good Batman.

"You just wanted Erica to confirm it, didn't you?"
I'm gonna help you stop him.
As part of your pack.
"If you want me in, fine."
But we'll do it on one condition.
"We're gonna catch him, not kill him."
And?
And we do it my way.

He killed Sean.
"Honey, the police know."
They don't...
They didn't see it.

Is that Shou?
What's he saying?
What's he saying?
"Okay, Cooper."
We're gonna commence with deactivation.

We need you to follow instructions and make it to the access point.
The access point?
Great.
Where the fuck's the access point?

More stairs?
Come on!
- Just one more level.
- Trust me.
- Okay.
Left at the top.
"- Okay, which door?"
- Room at the end.
What is it?
There's gonna be something behind there.
I can feel it.
- Something like...
- Like what?
Some personal fucked-up shit.
Like...
"I don't know, I could feel it digging around in my head."
"So it's either B-ball with tall, dark and uptight here, or nothing."
- I got all the time.
- What do you get if we lose?
I get the pleasure of beating a cop's ass in front of the whole yard.
"Oh, yeah, play basketball, it's not like we have a killer to catch."
The clock's ticking.
He's our best lead.
"All right, game's to 21."
- Ten.
Man's in a hurry.
"Okay, since, uh, you're a guest in my house, you take it in."
I got a tip.
"So you know, the other guy putting the ball in the hoop is bad."
"Danno, shut up."
"Please, don't call me Danno, huh?"
"- Yo, How long you two been married?"
"- Come on, play ball."
"Okay, all right."
Time out.
Time out.
"All right, time."
"Ahem, you, uh, never played basketball, have you?"
"- No, I've played once or twice."
- Yeah?
I could see that.
"It looked like I was watching LeBron, maybe he's just this much better:"
"- Football was my sport, okay?"
- Now you tell me that?
- Ready to quit?

"Master, we shouldn't show them too much of our sword fighting."
"Master, they'll imitate our Chin Kang Fist."

The Shaolin won't imitate your Wu-tang sword.

Not like me!
Yes... you're more handsome.
Ridiculous!
What do you mean?
Don't stop me!
Please be more polite!
That's none of your business!
Don't get angry!
"Shut up, or I'll beat you!"
Get up!
Let's go and have a look.
What's happened?
Don't go!
Every bit of it has been skewed and twisted.
It's Crystal.
She's the one who's done this.
It has to be her.
Hi-yah!
Come on!
Yah!
Hi-yah!
"- That's it, that's all of 'em."
- Close the gate.
"All right, you two, you're finished here."
"It doesn't have to be like this, Matt."
But you don't get to decide that.
I don't want you near those horses again.
Same goes for Will Vernon.
You tell him that.
Let's go.
"We can't let this happen, Ty."
All those beautiful horses.
He's gonna send them to auction.
He's gonna let them die.
"Okay. don't worry about it, all right?"
"We'll figure this out, just one step at a time."
"Amy, look."
At least he's still free.

Oh... you're up.
I thought I'd bring you a cup of tea.
"Er... come and sit down, Tom."
There's... something I'd better tell you.
"I'm going to divorce you, Tommy 'cause I want to get married again."
He's...
He's a good man.
He lives in the next village.
He's a plumber.
"Oh, come on."
You didn't think I wanted to grow old on my own.
"Well, speak to me, then."
I'll bring this in to Frances.
She'll probably be glad of a cuppa.
"- Frances, can I come in?"
- No.
Go away.
"Oh, please."
"Hear me out, Frankie, will you?"
I brought a nice cup of...
- Did you listen?
I said no.
- Please.
I just want to talk.
Huh?
Here...
I don't know where to start.
(Bicycle bell rings)
"And remember, best behaviour, Simon."
"Ah, Peter!"
"Susan, you remember Peter Kingdom, don't you?"
"Yes, of course!"
How very nice to see you again.
"And you, Mrs Barkway."
"Um, go ahead, my dear, I'll be along shortly."
"Hello, Mrs Barkway."
And Simon!
Something of a surprise.
I heard you were dead.
"- Funny, I heard the same about you."
"- No, no, no, very much of the living."
"Well, ""As a dog returneth to his vomit,"" I suppose."
"Um, Professor, I was rather hoping we might discuss my speech."
"Of course, of course."
I've had the porters prepare your old rooms.
Come and see me when you've unpacked.
(Hums happily)
(Rock music blares)
"Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
Hey!
(Music off)
- Keep the noise down.
"This is a place of work and I'm in charge, so you do as I say."
- Mind if I make some calls?
- Whatever.
No sex lines.
PROFESSOR BARKWAY:
"Janet, please, we must discuss this sensibly."
"Janet, please, the research."
"If you don't want to add being poor to that, don't provoke me!"
I'm very sensitive.
"In Yoon Jae's hospital, wearing Yoon Jae's clothes, and laying down on Yoon Jae's bed..."
You really seem like Yoon Jae.
-Well...
Ummm.
-Don't say anything.
Give me your hand.
"I knew it, it's not warm."
Your temperature is different.
Since you're not Yoon Jae...
You're not as warm as Yoon Jae.
That's a relief.
Since I want to be cool.
Let's go now.
I...
I...
I... grabbed his hand!
What?
In the water...
I thought I was going to die...
But Seo Yoon Jae reached out his hand towards me.
If I were to live...
I thought I should go towards him...
So I grabbed onto his hand.
I wonder...
If that's why I came in this body?
If the switch happened because you and Yoon Jae grabbed hands...
"Do you think if you held hands again, you two will switch back?"
What if he doesn't wake up?
I'm sure he'll wake up!
Hurry up and grab it.
Mommy just has to have some tests done.
That's all.
There are more schnitzels in the fridge.
I'll make some.
Leave her be.
Have a seat.
I'd rather stand.
Would you like something to drink?
- No.
How's your father?
He's in the hospital.
- What's wrong?
Do you really care?
Yes.
I saw a picture of the musical in the hallway.
You and Dad are embraced.
How idyllic.
"That's all over, Goni."
All the big hits in this theater were his.
His name is on half of the posters in the hallway.
No one can take away the credit for the things he did.
"Yes, but no one's giving him any work either."
Including you.
How old are you?
25.
Why?
Did you know that my son is 21?
"I came to talk about Dad, not your son."
Do you know how long he's out of work?
I know.
You used to be friends.
There are things you don't know.
It was he who arrested 10 years ago following a settling of drug-related.
That's him.
All 2 at the height of summer was messed 10 pairs godasses.
It must have cost money...
- Matsuda!
That's not the problem!
- But yes!
"This is not money, but their legs !"
We can do nothing without money !
It was an expensive summer.
"M. Yagami, you got it!"
Congratulations.

Mom
- Dad!
Why is he nosing' around?
"Oh, great."
Goons and government.
That's big time.
"That's mob, Thomas."
"Rick, I am not jumping to any conclusions."
just 'cause it looks like... just cause it looks like he is a government witness.
Whoa.
Roger's a mob stool pigeon?
"Bullets flying' all over the place, and you got a race?"
"You really believe her, huh?"
Rick!
"Okay, okay."
"I told you I'd check it out, and, Thomas, I will check it out."
"Um, Thomas, listen."
I thought after the race I'd throw a little celebration.
Like a congratulation gesture.
"Yeah, yeah."
Just us guys.
Yeah.
And maybe a couple of TV reporters.
"You know, a human interest story."
Get a little publicity for T.C.
"You know, war buddy helps pal."
Yeah.
TV reporters.
"And how about some wire service stringers,"
"Rick and a couple of photographers, Life Maga..."
Thomas?
Thomas.
"Magnum, it's here."
Ta-da!
not a clairvoyant.
Go inside and keep Charles quiet.
Go inside now!
asshole.
This is private property.
it is.
I believe it belongs to a multinational smelting company based in Shanghai.
Where are you keeping the old man?
Hmm?
Is he over there?
Or is he there?
That'd be smart.
I'd like to meet him.
I'm told the HSA classifies his brain as a weapon of mass destruction now.
what happened back east.
He's been dead for a year.
I need the girl.
What girl?
The one that goes along with that ball you're holding.
There's no girl here.
I know you went to the motel.
I was called there.
There was no girl.
It was just the woman.
Just the woman.
Such as she was.
you saw Gabriela.
But you didn't call me.
That hurts.
did you?
did you?
I asked you first.
- Where?
I can't see you.
Come down to the beach and walk to the left.
Left?
Towards the inlet?
"Yeah, turn left and straight on."
Hurry up.
"Okay, be right there."
You told him to walk down that way?
"Yes, in the meantime we should go back to our rooms."
It feels so weird.
- Yeah.
- Where are you?
I see nobody here.
Keep on walking to the end of the beach.
All the way to the end?
Yeah.
It's so wonderful.
I'm hearing so much about films from Director Kim.
Keep on walking and you'll see us.
"Alright, wait for me."
Okay.
What is it?
A splinter?
I think so.
I'll poke it out where there's light.
"Yeah, thank you."
Let's tell him that I vomited.
That I got a bad stomachache.
And we had to run to the pharmacist so that's why we missed each other.
Are you worried?
"Okay, we'll do as you say."
Your old man gonna be okay with this?
Don't worry about him.
He's fine.
"Yeah, I won't worry about him when he's ripping my fucking dick off."
Do you need me to sign something?
Good.
Relax.
"Look what you're doing with your shoulders, right?"
It's...
- Right?
- Okay.
Don't be wild.
And turn it over.
Nice and relaxed.
"Yeah, we're having fun."
You're not leaving yourself any room.
"So, what is she doing wrong?"
You need to stay back.
You're crowding your punch.
Crowding your punch.
"You come in here, you're not getting the full extension."
Right.
"The first one is here, here, and here."
You know what it's setting up?
"- Look what's coming, right?"
- Mm-hmm.
"If you throw it and you stay there, what's gonna happen?"
"I'm gonna knock you the fuck out, all right?"
Good.
"Come on, move."
Move.
Here I come.
"Oh my God, you're serious!"
So where were we?
What am I wearing?
"Well, nothing, naturally."
Ha!
Ha!
Charles?
Hello?
Charles?
Charles!
Battery!
No!
[ Her screams echoes. ]
[ Amaar is banging his head on the table. ]
I can't believe you built a bomb.
I didn't build a bomb!
I merely collected a bunch of things that look like bomb-making things!
"It was not a crime, just suspicious and very costly."
"- Well, you proved your point."
"- I know, and it breaks my heart!"
"Then why'd you do it, Baber?"
Because I was happy with the way things are!
[ He starts whining. ]
OK!
"Baber, that's what this is about?"
"Look, nothing's going to change!"
The mosque will always be there for you.
It doesn't matter anyway.
"By this time tomorrow,"
We'll be in solitary confinement together.
[ The door opens. ]
OK!
Go!
"Konichiwa, Jessie."
"You know, I like you, I think you're a fantastic personality,"
I just don't think this is the way to achieve your objective.
That's all I'm trying to say.
Last suspect was sweet shop owner Alan Sugar.
"We had to be quick, because like a badly stocked spice rack, we were running out of time."
Hello?
Hello?
No-one home.
No.
"Listen, O'Leary..."
Yeah?
Mayor Cowell was going to close this place down.
Hygiene or some crap.
So they've all got motive.
"Oh, yeah."
"Listen, do you see what I see?"
Sugar ain't around.
He must be upstairs.
Yeah.
Maybe we should get his attention.
"Well, no, maybe we should just look around and try and find clues."
"Smash, smash this place up a bit."
Smash the table.
I don't want to...
Let him know we're here!
Like really smash it up.
Argh!
We're here!
PHONE RINGS I've got...
"O'Leary, I've got to take this."
Excellent.
Hotel Lunik.
What can you do for us?
"Hi, we're with Hannes."
We're supposed to take some photos here.
I have a list of names.
Could you round everyone up?
I'll take care of that.
That'd be great.
"Photos, of all of us?"
With or without the mask?
He likes to wear a mask.
Is that alright?
"No, not at all!"
With the mask!
Alright!
I'll be right back.
Very nice.
"The man in the mask, in the middle."
Everybody a little closer together.
Are you a part of the group?
Why doesn't your boyfriend join us?
Why doesn't your girlfriend join us?
Why don't you both join us?
Come join us!
They can make fools of all of us.
It'll be good for you!
Come on.
I'm just a guest.
This time you're the subject.
"The more people we have, the livelier it will be."
Very nice!
Please leave.
If nothing had happened... there is no need for you to get furious.
Manoj!
Manoj!
"Manoj, open the door!"
Open the door!
Hello!
Where are you going?
You can't leave the place without answering us.
I have no obligations to do so.
I'll tell what I have to tell at the police station.
I'm a cop myself!
You can tell me.
- Auto!
Why is he so adamant?
I don't know.
Start the bike.
Come on.
I'm dead!
"Though I wasn't a super-cop, I was at least called a mediocre one."
"I might lose that even identity now, because of you!"
"Keep going, Panju."
Will you drive recklessly just because you are cop?
Can't you be careful?
Where is your helmet?
"Let's go, Panju."
"Sorry, man."
Idiot.
He went inside!
How do I always find one like this!
Hey!
Inspector Arivazhagan?
"Rose, I came by your office today for lunch, but you weren't there."
- Were you at a staff meeting?
- I had lunch with Henry.
"Rose, he's a friend of mine, but you have to watch out for him."
"Believe me, I'm not his type."
He has trouble controlling himself.
- Oh.
- What?
What?
What?
- Did you pull something?
- I think so.
Right here.
A little lower.
Lower.
Closer to the spine.
There.
"Oh, yeah."
Lean back into it.
I thought you might like to meet me in Europe after your classes end.
We never had a honeymoon.
That's right.
I would love that.
- Would you?
- Mmm.
- Am I pressing too hard?
"- No, but I'm all sweaty."
And I have to floss.
"When you've got to floss, you've got to floss."
"Claire, I don't know how to ask for it."
"We're so polite, I feel like we're roommates in a charm school."
- I'm putting you on the speaker.
"Oh no, no thanks I'm cool."
You smoke too much Jivers way too much.
What?
It's all natural Organic.
No chemicals.
Is this new?
It is.
It's about a girl.
Who's it about?
That blonde?
Blonde?
No.
No blondes.
"There ain't no words that I can say, cause words would just get in the way."
"But it is written in the wind,"
"This is where it all begins,"
I've been dreaming you right.
I've been holding every night
Now you're wanting me to stay.
Keeps getting better everyday.
Everyday.
I'm so happy I could cry
I think about it all the time.
I'm so happy I could cry
I just can't get you off my mind
I found the reason for living
I found the reason for love.
I found the reason for living
Later.
So how is Jill's wedding coming along?
Um it's pretty good.
There's a bit of drama though.
"Sure, but do you ever do anything about it?"
I lay them by the dozen if need be.
Don't you?
What do you think I did with Chrissy last night?
But Christine has often walked down the aisle.
Never had any luck.
Take me to the studios some time.
Stupid bitoh!
Wait... stop!
Stop!
You got something going with her?
!
I saw that woman in a dream!
Ma'am!
"Nothing, I guess."
Probably screwing on some tombstone.
I read about them: cemetery whores.
- Damn weather!
- There!
We'll get soaked.
- That one's open!
- ln that tomb?
!
"Dead men don't bite, only live ones do."
Do you want to get hit?
It wouldn't be the first time.
- But you won't.
- Won't I?
No.
Do you think I'll like it?
I'm gonna try...
"Keep going, Gerard."
"Well, congratulations, sire."
We have a champion.
Good.
Where is he?
They haven't found him yet.
- Is that good?
- Yes.
That's what makes him a champion.
I see.
"They will find him, won't they?"
- You must be very proud.
"- Proud, you shit?"
Shit!
- Isn't that a great honour?
- Maybe he'll get the honour.
I'll get a dragon's tooth up my bum and a shilling-a-year pension.
I'll have to sit vigil with him all night as well.
"Christ, what luck!"
I promised my body to a woman tonight.
Maybe I could go and tell the lady that...
Wait a minute.
Maybe you could do it.
Certainly I could.
I'll tell the lady...
"- No, no, not that."
Sit the vigil.
- Me?
"I could give you my hat, my cape."
Just keep your head down.
He'll never know.
- I can't do that.
It's not right.
"He's mine, and no one is taking him away from me."
What are you talking about?
Where's that bonding strip?
"And another thing, stop with this spaceman thing!"
It's getting on my nerves!
Are you saying you wanna lodge a complaint with Star Command?
Okay!
"Well, so you wanna do it the hard way, huh?"
"-Don't even think about it, cowboy."
"-Oh, yeah, tough guy?"
The air isn't... toxic.
How dare you open a spaceman's helmet on an uncharted planet!
My eyeballs could've been sucked from their sockets!
You actually think you're the Buzz Lightyear?
"Oh, all this time I thought it was an act!"
"Hey, guys, look!"
It's the real Buzz Lightyear!
"You're mocking me, aren't you?"
"Oh, no, no."
"No, no, no, no, no."
"Buzz, look, an alien!"
Where?
Yes!
It's Sid!
Don't move!
I thought he was at summer camp.
They must've kicked him out early this year.
"Oh, no, not Sid!"
Incoming!
-Who is it this time?
-I...
I can't...
Addons
- They divert attention.
- No one cares about it.
Nothing is kept in mind.
Asshole.
No one will know of this incident.
"Addons Eli and me again, Jo."
This has created Addons The best video game.
"Addons Of course, all about my identity, will be removed."
"Addons Before your death, to be watched again and again ..."
"Addons Eye for eye, my dear."
Addons What have you done with my daughter?
Please.
It's okay?
Addons I'm afraid not.
Addons That's very nice and interesting.
I do not believe it.
You're a liar.
He is calling your name.
Addons
- I think it will stop ...
- Do not believe you.
"Addons I and my family, Jo."
Addons like you.
Addons I am very busy.
"Addons Busy, with wild animals."
Cursed be you.
He and an honor to be your daughter?
Have you ever thought why her daughter was murdered?
"With a father like you, it's no wonder."
Addons 6 minutes into the deadly crash.
"Addons Goodbye, Jo."
On the double!
"Well, at least the search is on."
- Is that everyone?
- One more.
Stiller.
He's bringing the mail from Pasco.
He knows to keep his eyes open.
Got about two hours of light left.
What a mess.
Then let's go down the cliff.
- Why do you do that?
"- We can't make it, that's why."
Those wolves are gonna hang around.
"Anyway, we were dead the minute the engine quit."
- I didn't wanna say anything.
- Why talk that way?
- It's the truth.
- It ain't.
It's what you think'll happen.
- You made a snare and shot a rabbit.
- So what?
I'd rather be trying things than sitting on my butt.
All right.
All right.
Let's go if we're going.
Take what you need.
I was thinking more like a couple of sweaters.
See?
I told you I grew up with boys.
Jesus.
- Do you live by yourself?
"- Yeah, that's right."
That's why I wanted to retire.
Sorry.
"No, I'm sorry."
"I'm so sorry, Blair."
"Look, I shouldn't a..."
I shouldn't have pushed us to do all those jobs.
I shouldn't have gone back into that fucking house.
I should have put you first.
Hello friends!
Are we having fun yet?
"Listen, this is what's gonna happen, all right."
"They're gonna come in, I'm gonna lure them away, you find a safe place to hide until somebody gets here."
I'm not leaving you.
"No, they're gonna come for the sheriff, so you gotta stay alive until then."
We have to stay together.
Please.
Please.
"You have to swear to me that you'll run and hide, okay?"
Swear to me.
"It's the only way, Blair."
"Blair, come on, you know it's the only way."
Okay.
Okay.
"I love you, okay."
Get ready to run and hide.
Oh Jesus!
Get back.
"Oh my God, Connor."
Ow.
Sorry.
"Come on, hurry."
"Go downstairs, go downstairs."
- l will take you to Bombay.
"- No, no!"
Brother...
"Unless I don't work hard, I won't get the fruits."
Fruits?
I can see the fruits that you've got.
And about that back-breaking drill that you spoke of what is that?
- That was about parades!
- l see...
So you call it parade.
And what do you do?
- Love!
- Love?
"That's only part-time, brother."
"Otherwise, she studies too!"
I can read you too!

Your chest is 42 inches.
You like light-brown clothes.
You have an import-export business.
And you don't know swimming...
"Enough of it, Pooja."
"No, Pooja...don't!"
"Brother, whose car is this?"
It cannot belong to you.

Or a girlfriend?
A lovely friend!
- You?

I have opened this shop recently.
"Where, sir?"
Behind that vision in white.
You ready?
I'm frightened to death.
You're in the circle now.
"You've got the prettiest feathers in the room, now spread them."
"Right this way, mr."
Fisk.
Look at our jim fisk.
"Oh, that is mr."
"Jim fisk, eh?"
There she is.

"Right over there, behind that railing."
With my maid!
And my dress!
Here she comes.
"Don't worry, i got ammunition."
"You make a fool of fleurique, eh?"
"You steal my clothing, eh?"
"Here, throw these."
"Well, if you don't want to throw them, eat some of them."
They'll cool you off wonderful.
Look at the food mr.
Fisk buy.
Mm-hmm.
I think i'll let her wear the dress for tonight.
That's very considerate of you.
"Well, now that we're all friends, let's get together."
"They made a mistake about your table, jim."
We waited for you over there.
You want to know how that lucky piece landed?
It's amazing.
- You serious?
Oh you can get that.
"Oh no, it's OK."
But you can get that.
Sorry.
Oh it's Hallie.
Just 2 seconds.
Hey!
Um yeah I'm still here.
Um sure that's fine.
"Wait, you didn't really just do what I think you just did, did you?"
Because I kind of had plans to just spend the night with you.
Um she's outside.
How did she get my address?
"I don't know, not from me."
Hello...
Door's open.
Hi.
Dale said she was coming by to shoot the band so I thought I'd surprise you.
Hey.
- Hey.
We actually finished a couple of hours ago but um...
Really?
Why don't you sit back down.
You're not...

You should see the show she's casting it is so funny.
"Look you could stay, have another beer."
Oh I'm sure we'll do it some other time.
I'll see you guys later.
Just one second.
What!

I'm already married.
No.
You're not.
That was private.
It was a private conversation.
Yeah you said you bought a ring yourself at Woolworth's.
When times got hard he tried to send you back to Wales.
And he's disappointed in you?
He's a stupid bloody fool.
But he's not as much a fool as you.
He changed a name for Christ sake!
Where's your fucking self respect?
How dare you?
You have no one.
You don't know.
I know you deserve better.
You?
You're the better!
Catrin I...uh...
Look I think...you must.
And I think...you're a drunk squalid bully.
Quiet!
Hush.
You are speaking of flight lieutenant Lundbeck?
Cha?
You know he didn't have any film roles under orders.
"They told me I would be good for ""Eagle Squadron"" recruitment, Sir."
He's desperate to get back in the air.
Poor boy.
Tea sir?
Who are you?
I can't see very well.
Shall I read for you?
I'm a cop.
Pardon?
How can I help you?

She's my eldest daughter.
The kid is my youngest.
My son is on the top.
And the one below is my son-in-law.
Son-in-law?

"From now on, just answer yes or no."
"No explanations, no short answers, no multiple choices."
"Hasn't been that long since this circus opened, right?"
Early this month it...
Answer yes or no.
No.
"It hasn't been long, I see."
So about 4 weeks?
"Well, not that long."
Yes or no!
No.
- About 3 weeks?
- No.
- 2 weeks?
- No.
"Please, do not do it"
"What are you waiting for, Mike?"
Shoot him!

You coward.
"Good job, Mike."
"Now, I've been national i.ne."

Collect them all.
Statues take him from here.
Come on!
Let's go!

I'd like a word with you.
It's me.
"I'm going, and I'm not gonna fail."
- You're new here.
- It's about getting back to Henry.
I don't care what I have to face.
You're not gonna argue with me?
Would it do any good?
No.
Anything in that bag that's gonna help me with a giant?
A hook.
Hey.
Come with me.
This...
Powder made from poppies.
He has to inhale it.
Your sword... how strong is it?
The most powerful blade in all the realms.
Is it strong enough to cut through that beanstalk?
Indeed.
Give me ten hours.
"If I'm not back, you cut it down and keep going."
Snow won't like that.
That's why I'm asking you.
"If I don't get back, you get her home."
(Hook) Ladies.
"In this world, we are slaves to time."
And ours is running out.
"In other words, ticktock."
(Zips sleeve)
I was hoping it'd be you.
Just get on with it.
Put your hand right here.
- A gunshot.
"- Quickly, put her down."
"Nurse, check her blood pressure."
Prepare her for surgery.
Oxygen mask.
How is she?
Blood pressure unstable.
Weak pulse.
Blood pressure low.
- Have you seen a man carrying a child?
- He went to casualty.
- Detain anyone suspicious.
"- Yes, sir!"
Are you related to the patient?
How was she wounded?
"Sir, you can't leave now!"
I have to registeryour name.
Where is he?
I'm an inspector.
Just continue.
"- Right, nurses, ignore them."
- Yes.
Don't disturb the doctor.
Put your guns down.
- What happened?
- There was a gunshot.
- Where?
- Over there.
Get everybody out.
I'll call H.Q
- Any progress in the Weng case?
"- No, none at all."
Sure.
"Uh, I can't."
I'm actually going to a book signing with Ezra.
- Leonard Addams.
- Addams?
I thought you hated Addams.
I liked his early stuff.
- Rain check?
"- Yeah, rain check."
Toby?
Can I talk to you a second?
I can't talk.
Something's up with the DA.
The lawyer's driving me over to Dad's office.
"Tell me, was that supposed to be a joke?"
Were you trying to get back at me?
- Lf you were...
- I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm talking about what I found in my book.
- The braille you wanted me to have.
- That was no joke.
Bad?
"The message was ""bad."" What does that mean?"
Am I supposed to buy a Michael Jackson album?
You're reading it wrong.
I can't do this now.
Come back Saturday in the morning.
Jenna's out at her flute lesson.
I think you're taking a big chance with this guy.
"Okay, I am a very good judge of character."
Is that why you fixed Aria up with Noel Kahn?
Noel Kahn had everyone fooled.
Now.
"Come on, up the rigging."
Get up!
Come on now!
"Up the rig, there."
Have they died up there?
Keep it moving!
Much better.
You've accomplished wonders with them.
"- Thank you, sir."
- Don't press them too hard.
Twelve minutes 45 seconds to beat.
They'll do it this time.
- Is he badly hurt?
"- Leg broken, sir."
Get him to the surgeon.
- That'll be enough drill for today.
"- Carry on, down below."
- Dismiss the starboard watch!
- Mr. Scott-Padget will you have dinner with me?
- Starboard watch secure.
"- Thank you, sir."
- What about the man injured today?
- Not too good.
I may have to take the leg off.
I'm sorry.
Mr. Scott-Padget asked if he can return to duty.
- You don't like him.
- I've served with him before.
- When?
- In the Beedle.
"Bad ship, that was."
"You know, if I was a Cajun man, I'd say, ""Orange and dorange""."
(Stephen) What would they mean by dorange?
- Door hinge.
- Door hinge!
(laughter)
(applause)
Definitely two points for you.
"Now, young girls and the expanding universe are also famous obsessions of Allen Stewart Konigsberg."
- Or better known as Woody Allen.
- Woody Allen.
"Yes, Woody Allen."
Well done.
Half a point for knowing Woody Allen's real name.
- (Alan) A tiny fragment of a point.
"- (Stephen) Yeah, a fragment."
A pebble.
A little pebble.
An Alan of a point.
But Woody Allen is by no means the Alan with the worst reputation in Hollywood.
"Who is, Rich, would you say?"
The Alan with the worst reputation in Hollywood.
"It's Alan ""Big Al"" Allinson, who was so taken by his Celtic Breton background that he killed a lot of people with rocks."
No.
Would it help if I told you his name?
- (Peter) I think I know what it is.
- Yeah?
- Is it Alan Smithee?
- Yes!
Oh!
Ten points to you.
- Well done.
Absolutely right.
It trusts me.
But you're going to put it in a cage.
It's cold.
It knows it'll get some crumbs in a cage.
Thought wild things liked their freedom
"Freedom to starve is no freedom, sir."
"Is that why you joined the British army, Harper?"
Maybe
Can't be easy to be Irish.
Wearing the uniform of England
"No harder than it is for yourself, sir, having to walk into the officers' mess wearing the uniform of a gentleman."
"You fight dirty, Harper."
"So do you, sir."
Morning Miss Teresa
Good morning.
"Morning, Lieutenant."
"Morning, Miss."
Hope you slept well.
I slept safely.
Thank you.
"Now, there's a woman worth fighting dirty for, sir."
Do you smell danger?
I smell French cavalry.
Horse sweat and saddle rot.
- They were here.
- Nonsense.
Casa Antigua is ahead.
"My own people, they would have warned us"
Smoke.
Village on fire!
- My village.
Vamos!
No smoking.
No smoking.
We need fitness if we're gonna get this job done.
We need fitness if we're gonna get this job done.
OK?
OK?
"Give us a hint, Ray."
"A bank, payroll, armoured car, what?"
"Give us a hint, Ray."
"A bank, payroll, armoured car, what?"
You'll know when you need to know.
You'll know when you need to know.
"Hey, fellas."
Ray.
"Flannery, what are you doing here?"
"Hey, fellas."
Ray.
"Flannery, what are you doing here?"
Thought I could lend a hand.
Thought I could lend a hand.
"Wheelman, second gun, whatever - I'll do anything, mate."
"Wheelman, second gun, whatever - I'll do anything, mate."
"Look, I don't know what you're talking about."
"Look, I don't know what you're talking about."
We're just getting ourselves fit.
We're just getting ourselves fit.
Yeah?
Yeah?
Yeah?
"I'm already fit, mate."
Yeah?
"I'm already fit, mate."

Otoharada Kuro...
You go end up like me!
DEATH NOTE...
If you're true then kill him!
Creve!
40!
Next to the armed man
- the psychological impact must be such that ...
"- Come on, get out."
"Go, go!"
We just heard a shot
A shot was produced within !
- M .
Mogi!
- The assault!
Launch the assault!
For the moment at the time of the shot the assault was launched
It evacuates a victim
One hostage was released
"The hostage would be the owner of the residence , 36 ."
Is she accompanied the police officer
The two hostages are safe .
"- Chief, are you okay?"
- Good.
- Eh.
- Yes.
What was that shot fire?
A risky shot.
Otoharada was caught pain.
Creve
A sort of spasm?
Put me down!
Put me down!
I can't go!
I've got to stay!
Put me down!
Stop!
Stop this sled!
Whoa!
What's the matter?
- You untie these straps.
"- Oh, no, no."
You might fall off.
I'm doing this for your own good.
Later on you'll thank me.
"I hate you, you beast!"
Let me out of here!
"Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can never hurt me!"
Whoops!
Ha!
- Let's go!
Mush!
- Mush.!
Beans.
"It's customary up here, Mrs. Blake, for everybody to pitch in and do their share."
"You've been with us two days, and you haven't done anything but sit around and look nasty."
Can you cook?
"Yes, I'm considered a very excellent cook."
Huh.
"Well, how about giving these beans the benefit of your talents?"
I'll do nothing to help you.
"I'm your prisoner, and since you seem to want me with you, you'll take care of me."
Want you?
"If anyone's going to make it in this town, it's going to be me and my band The Teardrops."
"Livi is recording in my sister Megan's studio, so she's hooking me up with some sweet backstage passes."
"Gotta go, amigos, don't want to be late for the rehearsal."
See ya.
I'm sick of Tanya throwing shade on us.
I gotta go.
I'm late for the hotel.
"Come on, buddies."
Oh.
"Mia, hang on a second."
Let me get this straight.
- You're going to Heartlake Hotel?
- Yeah.
Because you're the official dog walker?
So you've got access to where Livi is staying?
I guess.
"Olivia, memory-stick me."
Voilà.
The key to our success.
But Tanya said that Livi's going to Heartlake Studio.
Even better.
Give it to her there.
This is it.
Stardom awaits.
"Argh, slow down."
"No, I could have done, he said..."
Excuse me.
"Yes, I'll be sure to pass that on."
Thank you.
Deliveries are around the back.
"Actually, I'm here to see Livi."
I'm sorry.
- Mary?
Mary who?
"Mary, the Mother of God."
"She, in person she helped me."
The woman in blue.
Mary helped you.
"It all checks, it does."
"She was on the train, with the blood on that picture."
She wanted to warn me.
And later in the Beauty Salon she was lying beside me.
"""When you're warned, you must listen..."""
And she was at the cemetery this morning.
Mary is with me.
Mary is among us.
Mary is among us... in Vlissingen?
"I'm a Catholic myself, Mr. Reve."
"I've got six kids and my third name is Maria but that Mary would be among us in Vlissingen to help you against Christine, beauty specialist and witoh!"
Lie down!
There she is!
The Godforsaken witoh!
Godforsaken witoh!
I'll kill you!
Nurse!
Injection!
10cc!
Mary...
"Easy, it'll be alright."
Easy...
"This one to the morgue, the other to neurology for now, Ria."
"And your prognosis, doctor?"
"No alcohol, then prolonged psychiatric treatment."
I'll take him some time to collect his wits.
- What's wrong?
- What?
What's wrong with me?
What's wrong with you?
Hanging out with that... grunge poser.
He's beneath you!
- Why do you care who I hang out with?
- He's beneath you.
Let's not get started people hanging out with people... who is beneath them.
Are you talking about my cover girl?
"My sexy, gorgeous cover girl?"
Just look at her!
Everyone else wants to sleep with her or bathe her.
- Everyone except me.
- And what is that about you?
How you can see through her?
"- Hey, man you like this music?"
"- Yeah, I think that's great choose."
"Terrific choose, man!"
Yeah!
Take it easy!
You should go for Resin.
She's looking for you.
"- So, Resin was coming..."
"- Oh, hi!"
I assume this is finally my iced cappucino.
- Yes.
And your change.
- Thank you.
Geez!
You really sucked that puppy back.
Are you sure this was skimmed milk?
I might know more than you.
That's why I'm not afraid.
Hold up.
I've met other people who talk like you.
They don't have anyone in their lives to care about.
Are you one of those people?
I think your diagnosis has gone too far now.
Being called out nosy is actually quite harsh.
I didn't mean it like that.
Okay.
It's a doctor's duty to never turn a patient away.
So I got to continue treating you.
Sorry for wasting your time.
"You still have the medicine, right?"
Here.
"Next time if you want to change doctors, you can."
Just inform them at the counter.
Never felt lonely.
"Because I have me, myself to care."
"Damn, so music video of you."
Up yours.
What's wrong?
Are you sick?
No.
You sure?
You want to see a doctor?
Damn.
To say sorry
I have to wait another month.
Yoon.
Yoon.
Yoon.
"ADMIT IT, MICHAEL."
YOU NEED ME.
YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE YOUR OWN HAIRPIN.
I DO NOW.
YOU HAPPY?
"WELL, YEAH, I KNOW A FEW GUYS WHO DO I.D. WORK, MIKE."
"BUT, YOU KNOW, THE FEDS ARE GONNA BE ALL OVER THEM, TOO,"
ESPECIALLY NOW.
"FEEL THEM OUT FOR ME, WILL YOU?"
"MIKE, THEY SAID IF YOU LEAVE MIAMI,"
THEY'RE GONNA PICK YOU UP.
"IN D.C., THERE'S GONNA BE SOMEONE THERE"
WHO IS GONNA RECOGNIZE YOU.
THE BEST FAKE I.D. IN THE WORLD ISN'T GONNA CHANGE THAT.
THE GUY THAT BURNED ME TRIED TO HAVE ME KILLED.
"AS LONG AS I'M IN MIAMI, HE CAN FIND ME."
I'LL TAKE MY CHANCES IN D.C.
YOU KNOW WHO MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP IS LUCY.
"SHE CALLED A WHILE BACK WITH A JOB,"
BUT YOU WERE PRETTY BUSY
"WITH THIS WHOLE BURN-NOTICE BUSINESS, YOU KNOW."
WHAT'S THE JOB?
"WELL, I DON'T KNOW THE DETAILS, BUT I DO KNOW"
THAT SHE WORKS WITH SOME REAL ARTISTES.
THESE ARE THE GUYS
WHO CAN GIVE YOU A WHOLE NEW LIFE TO GO WITH YOUR I.D.
YOU INTERESTED?
LET'S GIVE HER A CALL.
CORPORATIONS NEED SPIES JUST LIKE GOVERNMENTS DO.
"OF COURSE, THEY'RE NOT CALLED SPIES."
THEY'RE CALLED SECURITY CONSULTANTS.
THEY'RE BASICALLY MERCENARIES WITH NICE SUITS.
- There's that one.
- Is that a pentagram on the wall?
"Hmm, it kind of depends what you mean by pentagram."
I think he means this five-sided witchy-shaped thing here.
"Oh yeah, it is a pentagram."
I think we'll take a pass.
OK.
This building's on fire!
I'm 25% sure that fire has been put out.
Next.
[ sigh ] Oh!
"Well, what about this one?"
This one looks kind of perfect.
Yeah!
It does.
Can we see it?
Can we see it now?
Well...
I'll just get...
another one.
- Please.
"- Eat, eat."
Maybe we should wait outside.
"What if the police come by, and"
- I'm not there to be arrested?
"- Face it, Babs,"
They're not coming.
"Now, let's go play some lawn darts!"
But this is so unfair!
Why won't the police arrest me?
They're just not that onto you.
"- What's worse, I spent all that money on that bomb-making stuff."
[LAUGHING]
- So you still wanna have coffee?
- Absolutely.
"Oh, great."
"Okay, I really will stop gushing in a minute."
But when we walked out into that parking lot and I saw that you drive a Prius too...
[LAUGHS]
- I almost wept.
- I know.
I'm not alone anymore.
Oh!
"I didn't ask you, though."
"Are you married, or?"
Mm.
Divorced.
Are you kidding me?
That's fantastic!
My marriage was a miserable failure too.
No.
"No, actually we're still really good friends."
Yes.
I'm still really good friends with my ex-husband.
- You're kidding.
"- No, I am not."
- We are the exact same person.
- I know.
Let me ask you something.
Do you ever let your armpit hair grow out just to see how long it'll get?
Eww.
No.
Do you?
No.
Would you rather I'd lied?
Maybe.
"Well, I'm sorry."
I didn't think you'd want to sleep in the same bed...
"Oh, believe me... we are not sleeping in this bed."
Yaah!
Ugh!
So where are we gonna sleep?
Don't know.
Maybe I should just go home.
No.
You are home.
And we're not spending our first night back together apart.
"Look, I'm hating this as much as you are..."
Uh-huh.
...but we've got to move forward.
What's done is done.
You slept with morning.
I slept with rob.
And Matt.
We're still counting that?
"Oh, it counts."
You were with two people.
I was only with one.
"True, but I slept with two people only once."
"You were with one person twice, so, in effect..."
apples to apples...
I think we're even.
And I think your maths only works if you're fucking the apples.
"Look, I'm just trying to help us get through this."
How?
How can I get through this?
is he putting any food on the table?
We've got to help each other.
"We got to be really, really careful while we do it."
"I don't want to hear a word about her anymore, Henry."
Never.
-Daddy!
We missed you.
-Are you here to stay?
Did you see our pictures?
I did the one with the house and rainbow.
I did the sun.
My chorus concert is in two weeks.
Are you coming?
Do you like the house?
"-Karen, get packed."
We're moving out of here.
-With what?
Don't worry with what.
"Just start looking for a new house, ok."
I got to go to Pittsburgh in the morning.
"Those guys up there owe me $15,000."
We'll be alright. I got things lined up.
Pittsburgh?
You have to go see your parole officer tomorrow.
"Karen, don't worry about it."
Everything's gonna be fine.
Who wants to go to Uncle Paulie's?
What do you want?
"Sweetheart, let Mommy eat."
You look good.
Did you eat this good in the joint?
I don't want any more of that shit.
Goodnight.
- Don't you think you exaggerated?
- What organization!
- It went well.
"- No, she wants to stay."
- In CasteIIabate?
"- No, nearme!"
Then it can't be helped.
- How do I explain it was fake?
- tell herthe truth.
"Now that it's working between us, I ruin everything?"
You heard last night.
"In spite of everything, she loves you, why not be sincere?"
I don't accept advice from ajerk who can't tell his mother he loves anotherwoman.
Who said!
You're no betterthan me on courage.
I'II talk to my mom when I want.
You worry about talking to yourwife.
"So, I'II talk to my wife and you talk to yourmother."
deal?
- Lookin' for somethin'?
- The Post Office.
You have to go to CasteIIabate.
- We're in CasteIIabate.
- Not on yourIife.
CasteIIabate is up there.
- You're sure?
- I'II take you.
silvia!
Mrs. CoIombo!
"Here we are, I'II help you down."
- Thank you so much.
Varun is one of the best visually challenged chefs...
Stop... stop
I feel shy to hear my own success story.
Will you please keep the book and leave?
You are taunting me too much.
Bye.
Thank you.
Don't mention.
Rhino!
Bake it.
Who is it?
Is the restaurant closed?
Yes.
Sorry.
The closing time is 10:30 PM.
An elderly man on the platform told that he was hungry.
He asked me if he can have something to eat.
There is no other hotel nearby.
That's why...
Please wait.
Let me check.
Somehow I managed this with the leftovers.
Take it.
Sorry for disturbing you...
I didn't know about your condition.
Nothing to sympathize.
This is my restaurant.
This is my job.
Okay.
Thanks.
You can visit the elderly man if you would like to.
He is nearby.
I don't have a cat.
You don't have a cat?
"Well, how do you explain this?"
"(STUTTERING) Well, uh, maybe the wind blew against it and knocked it over."
"Nancy, there's somebody in here."
Are you accusing me of hiding a man in here?
"I'm not accusing you, Nancy."
I trust you.
I don't trust Wilbur.
How can you pick on anyone as sweet and fine as Wilbur?
"I know him a lot better than you do, Bobby."
Leave me.
Wilbur is not what he seems to be.
"Oh, you found that out, too."
The first night.
First night?
"I know he seems kind of silly and awkward, but inside he has a fine and sensitive spirit."
"""A fine and sensitive spirit""?"
Wilbur?
I don't want to talk about it anymore tonight.
I've had a hard day.
Why don't you go to bed?
I will.
I will as soon as I take my shower!
(SHOWER STOPS RUNNING)
Wilbur?
Yeah.
Oh.
(EXCLAIMS)
(DOOR OPENING)
BOB:
Nancy?
I love this scene.
You're terrific in it.
It's almost one take.
"- Oh, really?"
- Yeah.
"One-Take Cera, huh?"
One-Take Cera showed up.
"No, no, no."
We did multiple takes.
But what I mean is it's one angle.
- This was like...
- Almost one take.
There's one cut.
- I love that part.
- Me too.
One-Take Cera...
Did One-Take Cera show up?
Because One-Take Dennings never showed up.
- One-Take Cera did not show up.
- Okay.
But that's because One-Take Sollett was not on the premises.
I don't even think One-Take Graynor has ever been uttered before.
I used to say before we started to shoot a scene:
"""This is One-Take Dennings."
"One-Take Dennings."""
"And I thought maybe I would get it in one take, but it never happened."
"In ADR, One-Take Dennings maybe showed up once."
- There you go.
- She did show up.
- In post.
- She showed up for post.
She was in L.A. the whole time.
Shut up!
Help!
...
Saw your bro's name card and I saw a deal.
The person who killed your bro has a tattoo.
It's a scorpion.
Take it.
Thought you've principles?
Why pay me?
For your medical bills.
Thanks Mr. Lin.
I'd waited for you whole night.
Our fight is not over.
You still want to fight?
I'm not in the mood.
Then I win.
Since I defeated you
I'll help with your bro's case.
I'm the best cop around.
Even when suspended?
"Suspended, not resigned."
I've the highest record for cases solved.
Widest network of informers.
I know.
Using money.
Can you not shoot me down?
I'll find the killer very soon.
How soon?
I give you 3 weeks.
I don't need 3 weeks.
"Once done, you go back home quickly."
To your place of origin.
-Okay.
"So, just for fun, what would happen if I wasn't here on Monday?"
EMERSON:
Has there been a horrible train accident?
No.
Train's here. I'm just not on it.
It wouldn't be fun.
"Come on, what would happen?"
I'd have to make a phone call.
You'd have to make a phone call?
I would make a phone call.
-No fun.
-Company man.
(GUNSHOT)
Hi.
-How you doing?
-Good.
katherine:
You should have seen your face back there.
EMERSON:
What?
katherine:
"When I didn't get off the train right away, you looked like you were about to have a heart attack."
-How was your weekend?
-Good.
"I had a great weekend, thanks for asking."
So you got that text?
Confirming the...
What I already knew.
"Yeah, I got it."
Did you get mine?
"I was trying to make a joke about the White House Correspondents' dinner, but my phone spell-checked it into whorehouse correspondents' dinner."
She and Agesha would yo along well.

He's high

"Jagadish, you knock"

Reason being...

I even okayed her
But who is she?
She's a foreigner.
But she's Indian

Speechless.
- I guess you don't like it.
- Don't like it?
I'm in shock.
I...
I come home to find a completely different woman in my apartment.
Why did you do it?
Wait a minute!
Why do I have to EXPLAIN this to you or ANYBODY.
"- I'm not anybody, I'm your husband."
- You could've fooled me.
And I married a woman who looked a certain way.
"- To tell you the truth, I feel sort of betrayed."
- Betrayed!
Oh!
Please!
"Gregory, c'mon!"
- You had no right.
- I had no RIGHT?
Why did you do this to me?
Do WHAT to you?
I don't do ANYTHING to you!
That's the problem.
What's the difference what I LOOK like?
You never looked at me ANYHOW.
"- ""stupid record's"" uncalled for."
"- okay, i cannot do this anymore."
i cannot do this anymore.
- what?
!
honey!
what?
!
- i've had it.
- what are you doing?

- you've got it!
"- no, we don't."
"- baby, please, don't -- - come on."
- don't go.
i'm -- i'm begging you.
- looks like he loves her to me.
"- [sighs] that is pathetic, bob!"
- we're gonna go stay with my parents for a while.
- it's christmas.
- that is so wrong.
she knows how bad bobby felt when our daddy left us on christmas.
- i don't want to leave!
i want a christmas here with everybody!
"- honey, it's okay."

[sniffles]

You boys get him down off this slope and somewhere safe before dark.

Glass is to be cared for as long as necessary.
And a proper burial when it's time.
He's earned it.

Get me the hell out of this godforsaken place.
(JIM SCRAPING FLASK)
Ree done that to you?
I'm just asking.
"Yeah, they done it."
They took their sweet time with it.
"At the start, I didn't feel nothing."
I just heard the sound of the knife scraping against my skull and them all laughing and whooping and hollering and whatnot.
Then the blood came.
It was cold.
"It started streaming down my face, in my eyes, and breathing it in."
Choking on it.
That's when I felt it.
What a fine seat that fellow George has.
"Madame George Sand, dear."
The authoress.
(coughing)
(horse neighs)
- Are you ready now to face me?
"- God, MaIIefiIIe!"
Not now!
"Yes, now."
No kisses?
Where's my greeting?
Didn't you get my letter?
Yes.
Your message was clear indeed...
between the lines.
- I will defend my position.
"- Oh, balls!"
You're not in the army any more.
"You had an affair, not a pitched battle."
"Oh, MaIIefiIIe."
Poor boy.
It won't hurt for long.
- I know it must seem unfair.
- George.
- You promised to love me.
- I didn't promise to succeed.
- Whom did you come here to meet?
- No-one.
help me off with my boots.
He should write his epitaph because I'm going to kill him!
Your rival is imaginary!
"If you're not going to help, go and find somewhere to sleep and leave me!"
"Laurie, mom!"
I want to show you guys something.
I had an idea.
"Actually, something mom said gave me an idea."
So I took the van to...
"Here, just come with me."
[ Chuckles ]
[ Sighs ]
Meet the Winebulance.
"So, you're out of wine, but you don't want to go to the store, so you call Gulfhaven's only mobile wine bar."
What do you think?
This is the greatest idea ever!
Or the worst.
Laurie?
I think it's great.
"No, really, Travis."
"I-I-- actually, I think it's brilliant."
"[ Chuckles ] Oh, hey."
"Here, take a flier."
I knew Travis was a genius!
"God, you know what?"
"I have to say, ""You were right."""
And you can really tell he's been working out.
"Uh, you can't."
He hasn't.
I mean...

Who is it?
It's Mickey Mouse.
What does he want?
He's come to say good-bye.
What are you waiting for?
I'm a cop.
I don't shoot people in the back.
Another way we're the same.
"No, we're not the same!"
"I uphold the law, and you break it!"
Chang died because ofyou.
I swore I'd get you this time.
"I'm sorry, but I won't let you lock me up."
"Ifyou must take revenge foryour friend, shoot me now."
Don't force me to kill you!
- You'd really kill me?
- I won't let you go this time.
Go ahead.
You can't win all the time.
"Jeffrey, where are you?"
Where is he?
Right in front ofyou.
- Don't take him away.
-Jenny!
Jeffrey's promised me he'll never kill again.
Put that gun down.
"Jenny, put that gun down."
Not unless he leaves us alone.
"I beg you, please, let us go."
I'll never let you arrest him!
Did I kill him?
ls he dead?
"Come, we're going in."
There.
"So, please come."
Come along.
Good girl!
Always keep this finger straight.
"At most like this, always away."
Why?
To avoid the trigger.
People always have their finger on it.
It goes off and someone's dead.
There was just another incident in the army.
Some guy shot another in the neck.
"""Weapon malfunction,"" it says in the paper."
Malfunction?
He had his finger there and pressed.
And it fired.
"All shooters, 99% of them."
Hunters too.
always have their finger in there.
It happens so fast.
Your finger's the no. 1 danger.
"He picks up his gun, finger in there, and it goes off."
"You take it like this, with your finger out."
The animals hanging behind me...
This one here's an oryx.
That's an impala.

"Old waterbuck, white-tailed gnu, female Warthog."
"Gnu, bontebok, jackal, Warthog."
Jackal.
Two bonteboks and a bushbuck.
-Bail reports.
-Thanks.
Bull.
Right on time.
And in perfect order.
Billie. look how neat that is.
Yeah.
I didn't drool on it or anything.
Look.
Bull.
I'm sorry about what happened in the cafeteria.
It doesn't bother me that you laughed at my rhyme scheme.
You laughed at me.
Oh. come on.
Bull. that isn't you.
You never missed the boat of life.
Besides. there is no boat of life.
It's called a metaphor.
Harry.
A literary device used to illustrate dissatisfaction with my current status in the cosmos.
-Come again?
-My life is poo-poo.
Bull. we all feel like that from time to time. right?
I mean. everyone wants more out of life.
It seems to me like you've got it already.
You're a judge.
You stand for justice.
You're a public defender.
You stand for the underprivileged.
I'm a bailiff.
I stand.
Kind of like cattle.
What is it?
"""Ochie and Friends."""
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
"""Ochie and Friends."""
Great.
"And who is Ochie, or what is it Ochie?"
"They're, like, these beings from, like,"
"Far, far into outer space."
And they're in their own kind of solar system.
But they have to go to a totally different planet.
"And they're only, like, 12."
But they still get all this stuff.
And they get rockets.
It sounds too good for Troma.
It sounds like big Hollywood.
We're a small company.
"You guys haven't seen any of our movies, probably?"
No.
Our movies are kind of raunchy.
So it sounds pretty good.
"Let's get together, and maybe I can be helpful."
And I'll certainly try to help you with it.
"It's nice of you to help your brother, too."
Yeah.
Good older brother.
"Well, we'll try to-"
- Troma team will help the Ochie team.
"Anyway, have a great day and thank you."
Thank you.
Good luck with it.
Thanks.
Bye.
Lieutenant Columbo.
"No, that's all right, Danny."
Just hold on a second.
It's all right.
Never mind the security.
Okay.
Take five!
"You'll have to excuse me,"
Lieutenant Columbo.
I'm terribly sorry.
How can I help you?
"Oh, that's very nice of you, sir."
I appreciate that.
After what I did.
Gee whiz.
Where was I?
This is a little difficult.
I'm looking for a Mr. Daley.
Sid Daley?
"He wasrt at his house last night and he wasrt there this morning, and they just told me at his office that they don't know when he's gonna be in, so I was wondering if, you know,"
I thought maybe somebody here would have an idea where he might be.
"Yes, this is about Claire, isn't it?"
"Yes, sir."
Yes.
I'm afraid it is.
I heard about the shooting on the radio.
And I still...
I still can't...
I mean I...
I can't quite...
I keep expecting her to walk in through the door.
I know it's silly for me to think that...
You'll be fine.
"I'm not actually talking, am I?"
This is bad.
I'm just going to go call for a...
Just try not to move.
This is really bad.
If there's a Smokey or a mobile EMT unit with your ears on...
I got a seriously injured fellow here on Route 7.
"I got you, good buddy."
He's on the shoulder and...
Good.
Block him from oncoming traffic... with your truck.
Don't run him down.
I don't think the company would be too crazy about...
Just do it.
I'll call the Sheriff's Department...
"This is Deputy Frank Downes, Oxford County Sheriff's Department."
I have my ears on and am en route.
Copy.
"All right, so are we, Deputy Downes."
"Kingdom, this is Castleview 19."
Do you read?
"Five-by-five, 19."
We're going mobile.
"Sir, can you hear me?"
"Sir, can you move your arms and legs?"
How's he looking?
The right pupil is fixed and dilated.
The left pupil...
I don't know.
"Say again, Ollie?"
"It is Ollie, isn't it?"
"Oh, my God."
I don't even feel anything.
That's usually a bad sign.
You always know what to say to a girl.
Up.
"You have training in this kind of a thing, right?"
What?
-Field surgery?
Dressing wounds?
-Yeah.
"I mean, it's not my area of expertise but I know a little bit."
Okay.
is all this blood normal?
"Well, you have a piece of truck in your leg."
No way is a joke gonna make me feel more comfortable in your ability to not kill me right now.
Grit your teeth.
(GRUNTS)
Looks like we missed the artery.
"But it's gonna be okay, right?"
You could still bleed out.
"Emerson, lie to a girl, will you?"
-Bite down.
-l think it's starting to hurt.
Bite.
(breathing heavily)
(panting)
(MUFFLED SCREAMS)
(GASPS)
That was bizarre.
(sighs)
(EXHALES)
Emerson!
Are you really gonna show me the bingo prizes?
"Just for you, Goten."
This way.
Sorry.
Hey.
Huh?
What was that?
"Okay, let's open this up."
Right.
Whoa.
Are these all bingo prizes?
Tsk tsk tsk...
"Goten, don't go getting surprised yet."
Click.
What's this?
"Oh, Goten."
Of course it'll hurt if you just rush in and touch it.
"Whoa, that's some tough security...."
Mum's invention.
She says that nobody will find the grand prize when it's in this.
Then we won't be able to see it either...
Don't worry.
"Mum's inventions may be great, but..."
See?
They've always got some sort of flaw.
"Great job, Trunks-kun."
"Okay then, I'll show you the grand prize."
Whoa.
I'm hungry...
"It's your own fault, Pilaf-sama."
We've had nothing but grass to eat for three days.
"That's a harsh diet, even for a dog."
Was it...
Too much tongue?
- N...
- Not enough tongue?
N...
"Well, not enough."
"No, Kendall was right."
This is not a game.
"If Austin Elektra is in fact The Phantom, then we are walking right into the lair of a serial killer."
I'm sorry.
"Repeat everything you said after ""not enough."""
"Oh, God help us."
[Computer beeps]
Esposito:
"Hey, Kev."
Hey!
"Hey, hey."
"Hey, hey."
"What's up, partner?"
Castle and Hayley might be onto something.
Turns out that movie director was in New York during two of The Phantom's murders.
What about the third?
"Based on financials, there's no indication of where Austin was."
Which means he could have been here committing that third New York homicide.
This could be our guy.
"Yeah, I'm gonna keep digging."
"Oh, and, uh..."
[Computer beeps]
"What is this, bro?"
"What are you hiding from me, and who is Tyler Ross, and why are you running a background check on him?"
Tyler's nobody.
"Um, well, you see, um..."
"–Oh, sure I can."
"The truth is, the people we save from the worst day of their lives... never gotta see us when we have to face ours."
"Hell, and why should they?"
"We took the job, not them."
"–No, that's not right."
"–What you gonna do, man?"
I'll tell you what we're gonna do.
–Fleetwood's got a warehouse full of stolen merch.
–No.
I say we nail him.
Sell half the stash to my new C.I.
–We get you some new digs.
"–I can't let you do that, all right?"
"Hey, I'm just..."
I'm just trying to do some good.
"You know, and deliver some karmic justice."
"Now are you in, or are you out?"
Easy.
Don't suck on his tailpipe.
One second.
–Yeah.
–It's me.
–Where are you?
–Home.
"–What, our home?"
–Yeah.
The keys still work.
–Are the kids with you?
–Yeah.
We're all here.
"Oh, thank you."
–This doesn't change things.
And then you tripled them.
"Well, yeah, I guess I was overdoing it a bit."
I wanna do something fun.
I'm gonna take Quinn out of school tomorrow.
Douglas Park.
We ain't been there in years.
Uh...
"Yeah, about tomorrow..."
Um...
My man died.
Leonard died.
- This past Monday we lost him.
- What are you talking about?
You were in transit.
I had no way of contacting you.
"- When I left, he was in the hospital."
- I know.
Leonard died?
His funeral is tomorrow.
I thought he was gonna make it.
Come on.
"Yeah, I don't feel right."
I can't.
"You're getting out of this car, and you're gonna pay your respects to his family."
- I can't.
I'm gonna stay here.
- He was your commanding officer.
He was our country's hero.
He was like a son to me.
You owe it to all of us.
You got five minutes to get your act together and get out of this car.
"You hear me, sergeant?"
Still using cooking as therapy?
yeah.
Ooh.
Excuse me.
Sorry.
"Good morning, everyone."
"Oh, look at all of this food."
It's obscene.
You okay?
How are you feeling?
Can I get you something?
"Please, everyone, relax."
What I need is
For the people who love me to treat me like they always do.
Has anybody heard from Chuck?
"Yeah, uh, he's-he's sorry he couldn't make it."
Charles has the right idea.
"If he were here, then I'd really worry."
"Anyway, one thing I'll say about William's treatment..."
Is that I have not lost my appetite.
I want waffles.
Music to my ears.
Dad.
What's he doing here?
I invited him.
Hmm.
"Looks great, Lil."
Really great.
So I hope you'll all join me
For this doctors without borders gala tomorrow at Columbia.
"I must admit, I feel a bit silly about the whole thing."
"Clearly, Columbia's run out of alumni to honor,"
I'll force him to fight!
What do you mean?
"If you kill them, how can we tell which faction is superior?"
So you tricked us!
You filthy woman!
You induced me to avoid the archery.
You all go out!
"Sister, what are you doing?"
"Brother, you must not kill them now."
You go away!
"Brother, forget about it!"
Brother!
"Jun-kit, what strike is that?"
Please excuse me!
Come on!
Good strike!
You haven't learned this sword before.
He certainly hasn't!
"Fung-wu, I'll give it back."
You fight better than me!
Take the sword.
Just fight!
You haven't seen this Chin Kang Fist before.
"Brother, stop."
He's changing styles.
I'll see what else they've got!
How about my fist?
You want to learn?
"Brother, are you hurt?"
"It's alright, I haven't hurt him!"
Ridiculous.
Go!
"Hey, come on."
Get that out of here.
Come on.
"- Jim, Butch, Mac, where you going?"
- Get out of here.
- Get out or we'll give it to you too.
- What are you trying to do?
Go to the pen?
You can't get away with this.
Go back there and put out that fire.
- We're gonna finish the job.
- You're playing into Thompson's hands.
- He'll hang you for this.
- Thompson's dead.
Thompson's dead?
"- Yeah, we took care of him."
"- Listen, kids, you gotta stop where you are."
Whatever you do will be another rap to beat.
I wouldn't give you a bum steer.
I'm in as bad a fix as you are.
- You think I ran out on you?
I didn't.
"- Sure, you ran out."
You ran.
Go on.
I didn't.
I meant to come back the day after I left.
I got into a fight and shot a rat.
I think I killed him.
I'm on the lam now.
"If they get me, it may mean the chair."
- What do you get for--?
- The kid had a steering wheel lock in his hand.
Your tire blew.
You're fucked up and you wasted a pair of shit-bags... who aren't worth the hair in the crack of your ass.
So you cool it with the patty-cake morality.
"Because without me, kid, those stiffs'll put you in a room..."
- where you will fuck your uncle and everything he's built.
"- Hey, Leo."
The black van's gonna be here in a minute and I haven't done shit.!
- What I'm doing is highly--
- Sympathetic.
"- [ Leo ] Yeah, damn right."
- It is.
"- Ray, we don't have to do this."
- [ Ray ] Calm down.
"Fuck, Ray!"
"Ooh, baby!"
"Hey, we got it."
"- Look at that, huh?"
We got it!
"- Yo,yo,yo,yo."
"- What the fuck are you doin', man?"
- I found their piece.
- Found their piece?
"- Ah,Jesus!"
- That wasn't in there.
- What do you mean it wasn't in?
It was underneath the floor mat.
"Bullshit, man."
You can't do that!
Shut the fuck up!
Do what?
It was underneath the fucking floor mat.
Haven't we all?
"After he died, I"
- I found a change in myself.
My body changed.
Everything changed.
I know if any
- I don't know if anyone has ever told you that before.
And this is the first time I'm talking about it.
[Laughing]
He was one wonderful guy.
But I had a wonderful life.
And that's the thing.
I was one of the luckiest women.
And then he left me.
God took him away... and left me with three small kids.
[Laughing]
And now when I look back at it...
I can't understand how I did it.
I can't.
I went to work.
I had three kids.
I put them
- I took them to a nursing school in the morning.
I picked them up after 5:00.
We came home and we had dinner.
Sometimes I cheated.
I used to go and buy dinner and then pick them up.
[Laughing]
"Ah, dear."
But they liked me to go to the store with them.
Ah.
Where did the years go?
AKAN:
"Memories, memories, memories."
My first batch of cyber soldiers.
"With everything that you have experienced today uploaded into what's left of their brains, all they remember is waking up in the lab with their wife screwing their legs on."
"I love you, Charlie."
"I love you, Edward."
"I love you, Thomas."
You recognize these?
No?
That's odd.
They're your wife's.
(SNIFFING)
Mmm...
I smell what you like about her.
(BEEPING)
This one is almost ready for you.
"But I'm warning you, their boosters make the one you have in you now..."
Look like a fucking 9-volt.
Go ahead and fuck him up.

"Well, you-- you should go do that."
I don't want to keep you.
- Abby.
- Yes?
What are you doing here?
And why aren't you in uniform?
"Look, I really didn't want to talk about this here."
"I was gonna tell you all last night, but then I thought I should probably tell you at Sunday dinner."
"- Abby, you're rambling."
"- No, I'm not."
Isn't that that bitch from I.A.?
"Her name is Lina Flores, and she's not a bitch."
She's my partner.
"Well, she might be a bitch."
I don't really know yet.
I just started.
- What are you talking about?
- Partner?
I made detective and took an opening in Internal Affairs.
- You what?
- Does dad know about this?
No!
And please don't say anything.
This is so typical of you.
What is that supposed to mean?
Figure it out.
He--
Abby.
Those your brothers?
Both cops.
And you never once even noticed me.
Exactly how you're not noticing me right now.
* You got the epic mother... *
Guys!
What the hell's going on?
Hey!
Enough!
Enough.
* You got the epic mother... *
What do you idiots think you're doing?
Jackson!
Calm down!
"Mr. McCall, you wanna explain yourself?"
Stilinski!
You dropped this.
You and you... actually... all of you...
Detention. 3:00.
"Hi, there."
"Oh, I'll make an announcement, have Scott brought to the office."
"Um, actually..."
I came here to talk to you.
Me?
Busy after school?
Always.
"Well, unbusy yourself."
I wanna talk to you.
"Actually, I want to show you something."
I thought we'd gotten past the slightly rapey language.
And...
Bring the flower.
"Oh, uh... we can't be in detention together."
I have a restraining order against these tools.
Okay.
Forget I said it.
"-Say, Josiah."
-Yep.
Have you ever thought about marriage?
"Well, animals mate."
"Plants grow, flowers bloom."
Seems to be the natural order of things.
Maybe that's it. lt ought to be natural.
Right?
It's not something that's forced on you.
JOSlAH:
Exactly.
Then again...
... couldbethefates sending you a blessing.
BUCK:
Yeah?
Fine wife.
The life of a child.
Most men would live and die for that.
Yeah.
"Well, tell me this."
How do I know that Lucy is the one for me?
"I mean, I hardly know her."
Seems to me that would be a good starting point. lf you want it.
"Well, what do you mean?"
Get to know the girl.
Circled back two miles.
Looks like they gave up on us.
Probably fixing to break camp and get the hell out of here.
"If they're smart, that's what they'll do."
He ain't getting away this time.

- I don't believe you people were invited.
- We've come to take Adam back.
"How dare you barge in here, you ill-mannered trash?"
You mongrels.
Bet you didn't even wipe your feet.
"No, but we'll wipe them on the way out."
"If I wasn't holding this, I would totally high-five you."
"Oh, yeah, you come in here with your ridiculous blunt morality and you understand nothing of his world, nothing of his needs."
I tell you what.
It was in Algeria.
That's where she met him.
Met who?
Maurice.
"He wasn't handsome, actually."
"He was thin, black as night, but she didn't care."
A 16-year-old girl.
Our father wanted to die when he found out.
He made her life hell for a whole year.
He locked her in her room so she'd jump out the window.
Until they decided to run away.
Only I knew where they were hiding.
I was afraid for her sake so I told.
That's the big secret?
That Morn had a lover when she was 16?
What was his name?
Maurice?
Maurice what?
- Was he older than her?
"- No, he was just a boy."
An orphan.
They said he was a Communist.
- That's why they kept them apart?
- No.
- Then why?
"- He was an Arab, I think."
An Arab?
- Are you sure?
- I'm not sure about anything.
"Okay, what happened when they got caught?"
They sent her to Paris and made her have an abortion.
Why?
I thought it was an apron.
"And this is supposed to be the new me, doing things properly."
Beggar!
No - this needs more than a beggar.
This needs a bugger.
Bugger!
"Oh, heck."
Oh... oh... oh...

"Letting them stay all night now, are you?"
What?
"We saw your fancy man come, but we didn't see him go."
"Hey, Mam!"
I'm doing me hair like Mr Kirkby's.
You're not going.
Get upstairs.
- Yeah.
Michelle.
She's awesome.
She's out in New York right now doing a play.
You two would totally hit it off.
She loves hot gay dudes.
Always trying to convert them.
"Hey, uh, you into the Lakers?"
What?
The basketball team?
My agent got me floor seats for tonight's game.
We could go if you want.
"- You know, grab a couple beers after."
"- Yeah, sure."
Cool.
Come on.
Let's go.
Lola!
"Lola, come on!"
She's a good girl.
What a waste.
You're going to one of the biggest games
- and I'm stuck at home.
- Stuck at home?
Every time I turn around you're racing to get out of here.
"Yeah, but I'm exhausted."
"You know, Julia woke me up at 5 AM."
Not in the mood for an erotic wake-up call?
Not at 5 AM.
The guy is messing with my head.
"In the gay column I have flirting, giving me shoes, Lola the pug."
"And in the straight column I have girlfriend, Lakers and use of the words ""dude"" and ""bro."""
"Listen my words, Michelangelo."
There is one life only.
Hmm?
We got precious gift from Lord God.
"N... no matter if nobody speak your name on television or nothing the Lord God, he know you are there."
Hmm?
"That's why, to him, you never invisible."
OK?
"It's not your fault, Michelangelo."
It's not your fault.
Even if you invite them to come here the childrens choose to come.
Everybody choose what they do.
Mm-hm.
"It's OK, it's OK."
Michelangelo.
Give me that.
"It's, like, my turn."
My mother used to say this about residency--
It takes a year to learn how to cut...
It takes a lifetime to learn not to.
I'm up.
I'm here.
What's going on?
"Uh, Jackson's BP, it's a little down from yesterday."
"No big deal, but if we make a few calls, get pushy, maybe we could get him bumped up a few spots up on the transplant list."
"Dr. Bailey, you-- you paged me 911 at 2:30 in the morning, uh, to chat?"
"Uh, you..."
like to chat.
- You're chatty.
- Not at 2:30 in the morning.
"Look, he's young."
- I'm open.
- Come on.
Move it around.
- Watch out.
Watch out.
- Hit my blocker.
Hit my blocker.
Can't feel it.
"Okay, put some mustard on this one."
"Yeah, right."
"Come on, man, keep it going."
"Let's do it, man."
Ten bucks for the first one who gets one past my glove.
L'll make it 50.
"Put that puck in the net, or we'll be here all night."
I am not pleased.
Cross!
Cross!
"Move, move!"
"Nice save, my darling."
Come in.
"Mr Mayor, thanks for driving over."
Never miss a practise.
Have you heard?
Newman failed a surprise inspection today.
This report should sway public opinion and clear the way for my purchase of the land.
What about the boys?
"Well, I love kids just as much as anyone, but..."
Excuse me.
"Do I need to install tampon dispensers in the locker room, ladies?"
Hit someone.
But there are...
Thank you so much for seeing me.
- You look beautiful.
- Thanks a lot.
- Let me get that.
It's my pleasure.
So how can I help you?
- They're going to throw me out.
- Who?
- Morty Brill.
- No one'll throw you out.
He says I'm under-occupied.
Can I help it if my daughter moves out?
Isn't she entitled to a life of her own?
Of course.
How is Helene?
- Still working at the navy yard?
- Thanks to you.
"So what can you do for me, Mr. Anselmo?"
"Well, it's simple."
See that Mr. Brill obeys the law.
You're grandfathered in over there.
"If he says you're not, call me."
A landlord like Morty Brill looks for ways around rent control.
How would he understand a law meant for working stiffs like you and me?
"Thanks, Mr. Anselmo."
Thanks a lot.
Mr. Schwartz is right outside.
"Thanks, Clara."
- I'm sorry.
- Would you come speak to my club?
Which club?
Terrible Tiles Mahjong Club.
"If she's happy, that's good enough for me."

Guy YASKO
"Can I help you, ma'am?"
"well, they told me to take a streetcar named Desire and then transfer to one called Cemeteries and ride six blocks and get off at EIysian fields."
There's your car now.
Thank you.
"When he got home, she was waiting."
"Boy, you never heard nothing like that."
"What's the matter, honey?"
You lost?
I'm looking for EIysian fields.
This is EIysian fields.
What number you looking for?
Six forty-two.
You don't need to look no further.
"I'm looking for my sister, stella DuBois."
"I mean, Mrs. stanley KowaIski."
"Yeah, that's the party, all right."
"You just did miss her, though."
Yes?
-Can this be her home?
-She got the downstairs here.
I got the up.
"Oh, she's out?"
You notice that bowling alley up the street?
-I'm not sure I did.
"-well, that's where she's at, honey."
She's watching her husband bowl.
BIanche!
"BIanche, honey!"
Buckley and I could tackle the new ending in the office.
You'll enjoy the studio.
Change of scene.
Excellent.
Excellent.
Slowly forward.
Two steps.
- Look to the side.
- Like this?
"No, left side to the camera, your good side, and now raising your eyes and turning as the Stuka..."
"Please, if you don't mind..."
Stuka.
- Johnnie is hit!
Can you bring the light over here?
Thank you.
"Could you move, please?"
We're trying to get big boy up there.
- Sorry.
- Tea.
Excuse me.
- Coming through.
- Anyone for a cup of tea?
"I thought that was really rather convincing,"
- don't you think?
- Very real.
"Oh, I say, are those rock cakes?"
Ooh!
They want to know when it'll be ready.
It's very much on its way.
"Only you keep saying that you'll be sending over the new ending, but..."
- It's almost ready.
- Oh.
20 for the first 12 months.
See how useful you are.
20 for the first 12 months.
See how useful you are.
"Plus bonuses on a case-by-case basis,"

"Rub me off, I'll shoot you in the head, cut your ears off,"
"Rub me off, I'll shoot you in the head, cut your ears off, post them to your mother."
post them to your mother.

Wouldn't I love to see her face?

MAN:
It's getting so we're scared of driving down our own road.
No idea.
The murderer would be dead inside .
The police officer has not received the shot the killer allegedly shot because of pain .
We repeat
The murderer...
So...
It was a real...
Dad!
I'm fine.
Where is Light?
Party somewhere.
We can not count on him.
How it is possible...
I would have preferred to live .
without knowing such a thing
I killed
2 persons...
Me?
Sorry.
Papa.
You want to die?
I am the former owner of the Death Note .
I am the God of Ryuk death.
Do not be so surprised.
"From now on, you had to understand that it is not a simple notebook?"
How does it feel to kill?
Shit!
Papa.
Sayu.
Farewell.
You do not want this notebook ?
My presence does not mean that you will soon die.
- Shut up?
How long you been waiting to say that to me?
You two.
I need an explanation that doesn't involve my dad coming back from the dead.
_
_
_
What is that?
What language is that?
What are you saying?
!
Don't even bother.
It's some twin thing.
"It freaks me out, too."
[Stammering] That's what freaks you out?
!
"Hey, get your panties out of a twist, take a deep breath, and admit you know who I am, kiddo!"
- Don't call me that!
- Don't call me that!
"Now, you hate being called kiddo 'cause you're a grown man."
You took care of the family when I wasn't around.
"That's right, isn't it, kiddo?"
It's a mind-bender.
I know.
Imagine how I felt.
No.
No.
- Don't backslide.
Stay with it.
"- No, no, no, no!"
I know this is a lot to take in.
No.
- Clark.
"Uh, yeah, I know, I know."
This...
This is my home.
It is!
Rough day?
Y-yeah.
Were you -- were you saving this?
"No, no."
It's fine.
"But you don't usually drink, Clark."
What's wrong?
"Martha, you know how much I love you, don't you?"
Of course.
But with this job...
I can't always be as...
honest as I would like.
"Well, I know that."
"Thing is, you don't know."
"You don't know, so stop saying that you know."
Okay.
"It's okay that you have moods, Clark."
I'm not afraid of the different sides of you.
I love all of you.
"The world is an ugly place, Martha."
"And it is full of brutish, cruel, nasty people."
I heard something on the recording from Gaad's office.
Is he in more trouble?
He's probably gonna lose his pension -- maybe even go to jail.
- You shouldn't feel sorry for him.
"- Well, how can I not?"
- Martha.
It's the same shirt.
That was Haskell DeBray.
He was already dead.
Who was?
Don't let Serena out of your sight.
Hey.
Look up.
- What?
- Look up.
What are you doing here?
Brother wasn't the shooter.
That was a decoy.
The brother was somewhere else.
It's worse than that.
DeBray was killed five days before
"Serena disappeared the first time, in a hitandrun."
I saw the footage.
"It was him, Nico."
DeBray isn't the one who's going to kill my baby.
The real killer is still out there.
It's not over.
"You can just get into traffic cameras, just like that?"
- Public access to public security.
- Mmhmm.
That was the guy we're tracking?
"- Yeah, backwards, from the police station."
- Okay.
Shooting happened a couple minutes before 12:00.
Go for something on...
Broadway and Van Ness.
Hey.
"Mimi's vitals are Aokay, getting Aokay'er."
Off to meet girls.
I've got a 30-foot range.
"- (girl) Is that you, Shawn?"
- Get out.
Fine.
No girls for me.
"I'll just study and get good grades and get smart and become a famous scientist, and then I'll build a wife."
I'm bored.
- (♪ jazz)
- What's that?
Mom?
Dad?
Are you home?
"- Cory, we're studying."
- So am I.
"Don't go, Rebecca."
Sorry.
I really don't feel like being here anymore.
You haven't seen the whole house.
Let me take you up to the roof.
"Actually, Eric, I think it's nice we didn't go any further than we did."
- Thank you.
- No prob.
Why don't we just study together like we planned?
- I need to study alone.
- So I'll see you Friday?
No.
"OK, then!"
"So, what's new?"
- I'm gonna kill you.
- I have you.
"I'm gonna kill you, I'm gonna bring you back to life, and I'm gonna kill you again."
What a catastrophe...
Didn't you find her?
Yes.
Amelia.
The husband tried to throw us down the stairs!
She was completely fat!
They say us singers end up fat.
I'm sure you won't.
Laura says hi.
How is she?
-Fine.
She's still my guardian angel.
Always worried about me.
She asked me how were you doing.
And what was your answer?
That you look so great!
And what do you think?
I think you have a normal look.
"A moment ago, I was thinking how would you look without beard."
Taxi!
Luisa!
Make him come to the concert!
"Hey Max, if you don't come, let's not wait another 10 years huh?"
"Do you like singing, right?"
Yes.
It's what a like the most.
And do you like that song you sang before?
I know that poem is yours.
It'd be better to say it was.
I wrote it more than 20 years ago.
How were you like back then?
Without beard.
- Internet?
- We can help.
Find out what makes us hostage.
Must enter the cabin.
Addons Your job is not complete.
I tried ...
I tried!
Addons Do not let him reach the trunk.
Addons stopped him!
Addons you have 3 minutes or she would die.
Can see and hear everything you do.
You should not mix.
"But, you have to do something, Gwen."
- I have to get out.
"- No, no, no, please!"
Addons three minutes.
Gwen Addons and you fail in your mission.
"Addons View Hi, if you die, Just like your friend ..."
Addons not have to kill his brother.
"Addons Come, Jo, you lose the show."
Addons I think you like these things.
Addons may prefer younger men.
What is your problem?
Addons I put a mirror in front of you.
Addons To see how good you are.
Addons Although ...
Addons All of us have blood now in our hands.
"No, please, do not do this."
It's the only way to save my child.
Please.
No!
You should get the boot.
Lemon pudding's not bad.
Be back in half an hour.
Like a sauna in here.
- My toes are like icicles.
- Warming up?
Slowly.
What'll it be?
"A burger, fries and a Coke."
How is the lemon pudding?
- Homemade.
- I'll give it a shot.
- To go.
- You got it.
"Say, why is this called The Floyd Diner instead of Floyd's Diner?"
"Because you're in Floyd, New York."
Who'd have thunk it?
"Floyd, New York."
"Like Clyde, New Jersey."
Could you imagine spending your life in a place like this?
I can.
I grew up in one.
"Ferriday, Louisiana."
There's something special about small-town life.
So what are you doing in New York?
Every Louisiana boy catches politics like a disease.
I didn't know that.
"That's a fact, and I was no exception."
After law school I headed where?
"Floyd, New York."
Washington.
Leapfrogged from staffer to congressional assistant until the mayor of New York City came down to testify.
And he gave a speech that day that will stay with me for the rest of my life.
Really?
That should be OK ln you get
What is it?
is something wrong?
Should I leave you alone?
Of course
- Gentlemen
- Sir
- Are you OK?
"- Yes, sir"
Here.
Two boys were caught in the cemetery searching a grave I'm dealing with it
Searching a grave?
Why did you do it?
It wasn't desecration was it?
What were you after?
It was Camille Séguret's grave
Did you know her?
Where is the body?
"When the watchman caught you, it was gone lt wasn't there"
- Where is it?
- We never touched it
Where is Camille Séguret?
What do you mean?
"She was buried there, wasn't she?"
So where is she now?
I think she's back
Back?
Back from where?
From the dead
It's hard to describe
"First, I saw a great light that dazzled me lt felt like I was going blind"
Is Lieutenant Papadol from Toronto?
Yeah.
Transferred here a few years back when he married a local.
Word of advice-- don't mention the Stanley Cup.
"Oh, park it there."
You looking for their horns and pitchforks?
No.
Yes.
Sorry.
We're checking out Roy Taggot and George Lee.
You know 'em?
No.
Good.
"Heads, you take Taggot, tails, Lee."
"Officer Taggot, Detective Kowalski."
So...
What happened last night?
- Read my report.
- I did.
"You spelled ""verbal"" wrong."
Complaint stated that you slammed a bar stool over Mr. Penn's head.
The guy was a jackass.
The guy was a jackass?
Seriously?
That-- what does that mean?
"Are you saying that's why you hit him, or are you just commenting on his personality?"
I'm trying to help you.
This isn't your first complaint.
You already have a prior for fighting.
Do you really want this on your record?
"Look, Taggot, I get it."
I do.
But I'm so close.
Okay.
Do I need the thing to get out?
"Oh, great, you're here."
Let's go down.
Look at this.
"Wow, that's amazing."
Were you able to talk to Patrick about the maintenance?
"Yeah, we spoke this morning."
"Well, it really is amazing."
It just looks so real.
Like this wrapper.
It looks like a real hamburger wrapper.
"- Oh, that wrapper is real."
- What?
Yeah.
I always throw in a few real things.
Kind of cast a glow over the plaster objects.
"You know, kind of bump it all up a notch."
Did you do this at the MoMA show?
"Were there real things in that show, or-"
"Oh, yeah."
Course.
This is mine.
You got it from the staff kitchen.
"No, I made that."
This stuff is really good for your skin.
It has like all these minerals in it.
- Let me see!
- Let mejust finish!
- It doesn't match at all.
- It will.
"So, when did you get back from the States?"
2 years ago.
2 years?
"I know, I know."
I should've contacted you all.
"But you know how it is, it's just work and"
I married an American.
Stuart's a workaholic.
"And, well, I've got a little girl now, Nico, she's nearly 6."
"Ah, she's cute."
I have 3 myself.
Which is at least one too many.
"I kept meaning to, I kept putting it off."
And then one month turned into 6.
"I don't know, I don't know..."
You don't have to explain anything to us.
"We're big boys, aren't we?"
Here we are.
It's happened.
The 4 of us.
Grown up.
And Slade running a shelter.
How did that happen?
Says the doctor...
"Private doctor, actually, so..."

Sandman.
Golden age.

- Nice.
- Thanks.
So what are you pulling out of him?
"Oh,why do I have the feeling you already know the answer to that?"
"- That one,please."
- Okay.
Is that a Laurel wreath design?
It looks like some sort of badge or military medal.
"- Hey,did you see psycho there?"
"- Oh,yeah."
I have a comic book shop over on Columbus.I have every issue of sandman.
"Mint condition.You know,if you're ever interested."
I thought you said that you were her partner.

Again.
Why don't you just hit him with a sledgehammer?
"If you're offended,Doctor,by all means,wait outside."
Dueling sawbones.Toe to toe.
Old school versus the avant-garde.
My horse!
Why did you let the general escape?
"Go, look for him!"
"Don't move, your Highness."
It's me.
Henry from Bavorov.
"Oh, dear God."
Thank you.
"If we survive, I'll fulfil your every wish."
"Come, your Highness, down to the water."
"Bring back the general, dead or alive!"
"Too late, soldier."
"No, just a few more steps!"
Get to the water!
We must cross that mountain.
- It's a precipice!
"- Jump, don't be afraid."
Now he's trapped!
We'll drown!
"Please jump, your Highness!"
Now!
The devil took them.
"Look, aren't they beautiful?"
!
The finest in the world!
You can't eat toadstools.
Show me what you picked.
"All these, look, all beautiful..."
The red ones are poisonous!
Pick only the boletus!
So they're all ugly and poisonous and that's a red one too.
"No, that's an orange-cap, a good one."
There should be a cross passage about three yards from there.
"Tac Team leader, bring that *** down by agent Mei."
Guys...
It's Sara's.
We got a heat source.
"Wherever the reading's coming from, it's not on the blueprints."
Let's go.
"All right, we got something."
It's about five meters down the access shaft.
Hold your 20.
Lin's team will be on the flip side of the shaft in three minutes.
This is Alpha to Staging Command.
Can't read you.
We're going in.
There's our heat source.
That looks like a piece of her dress.
She was here.
Check it out.
Cover!
"Alpha, this is Staging Command."
Do you read me?
Do you read me?
!
"Kelton, answer me, damn it!"
Monroe!
Where's Kelton?
I couldn't get to him.
There was too much debris.
We can't get through.
Roof collapse.
"I repeat, we cannot get through."
"All right, call in Search and Rescue now."
Let's get some vacation time telling them you need to rest since the accident.
"That's that, but what about the wedding?"
Do I have to do that too?
!
I'm sure he'll be back by then!
He will!
"Even if not, I have no intention of doing that."
Should we do a little cleaning while we wait for Se Young?
"I've washed Yoon Jae's body for him, now I have to do that to his house too?"
Forget it.
"When you see Se Young, greet her with manners."
Don't stare at her with lusty eyes.
I'll look at her with innocent eyes.
Where is the vacuum...
Here it is...
It's heavy.
I guess the bag isn't empty.
Yoon Jae's packed his suitcase...?
I wonder where he was planning on going?
He's never mentioned anything...
Where was Yoon Jae planning on going without me?
Yoon Jae...!
Hi.
I've been so worried!
"If something like that happened, I should've been the first to know!"
Hey!
What are you doing?
!
Yoon Jae...
I love you.
Yoon Jae...!
"Seo Yoon Jae, you son of a bitch..."
"Gigi, he is not interested."
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
"Alex, this is jacked."
The hostess is giving me shit for not wearing a black shirt.
- It's not black.
- Look at it.
Not a black shirt.
I see it.
It's not black.
This shit is black.
"If a guy gives you his phone number instead of taking yours, he's not interested."
He took mine first.
Then he gave...
"And also, if a guy wants to see you, believe me, he will see you."
I once called 55 Lauren Bells until I got the right one.
That's cute.
What happened?
"Oh, yeah, as it turns out, her ass looked really huge in the daylight."
[GIGI LAUGHS]
Is it your sensitivity that makes you so popular with women?
Don't call him.
He doesn't like you.
Don't tiptoe around my feelings.
"- Well, I'm just trying to help."
- I know.
Thank you.
Sure.
"I gotta get back to work, but good luck."
"Okay, bye."
"Hey, buddy, you home?"
CONOR:
Yeah.
You're the most beautiful person I've ever met.
Even with ridiculous red hair.
"- Candace, will you marry me?"
- Yes.
_
So you know how my mom calls us Jay-Z and and Beyoncé because
I've got the great moves and now that I'm engaged I can do this.
- You do the all the sick rap rhymes.
- All the time.
I love rhyme.
Is that a crime?
Every time I climb a
Mountain you make me cry.
But it doesn't matter because I pull off some lines and make you cry because I love you so much.
M'mm.
You're mine.
"Baby, sell the bar."
Let's take it on the road.
"Anyway, so now that we're engaged, she's calling us Jay-Z and Fiancé."
"- Not really that funny, is it?"
- No

Danny?
Why do you have a child on your head?
"Good, he's still there."
"This is Will, Charlotte's kid."
Oh.
"Hey, big guy."
Yeah.
He doesn't really talk that much.
It's made bonding awesome.
I need to talk to you.
It's important.
"So, I got offered a job, a couple days ago in Houston."
And I've been giving it a lot of thought.
And I'm gonna take it.
You remember how much we all wanted to get out of here when we were kids?
ANd you guys always had Galveston.
So Wes' lawyer told me that you missed counseling.
So what she's advising me about is....
In Wes' best interest.
That he come with me to Houston.
Get out' my house.
Get out!
Get out!
"Wait, Hollis."
"Jacob's gonna end up in Juvie and you know it, and then what?"
Wes too?
"Next time you come back over here, you'll be bringing him home."
I just want what's best for him.
Travis left 'cause you didn't want kids.
"You never wanted kids, Pam."
Why the hell 'you tryin'a take mine?

"""Hi you reached Pam -and Wes- leave us a message"""
"Hey Wes, this is Jacob."
Just call me back okay?
[Roaring engines]
Look at this jackass.
You're responsible for the death of hundreds of people.
You know the punishment for that.
Listen...
I've found a way to live with the blood on my hands.
But can you?
(BODY TH U DS)
Why won't they come out?
"All I know is it put me in a sleeping sim, and then I woke up to all hell breaking loose."
Hec!
Don't play with it.
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)
You all know what this means.
Thank you.
For helping us.
I wish I could do more.
I had no idea Jeanine was capable of something like this.
It's time we fight back.
We don't have the numbers.
We will.
Once we get to Factionless.
WOMAN ON PA:
Strict curfew until further notice.
FOUR:
You heard Eric.
Jeanine's never gonna stop coming after you.
It's our only option.
JEANNE:
Tris Prior.
Of course. it had to be her.
Is she still off the grid?
Yeah.
But I think I found a solution.
"Ugh, poor Colleen."
"Yeah, we got to do something."
"- Hey, what if we had a girls' night?"
- (gasps)
"You know, like, to let her know we're still friends."
"Oh, yes, I have such a great idea for that."
"Wait, me, too."
Wouldn't it be cool if we had the same idea?
- Yeah.
"- Okay, let's say 'em at the same time."
- Ready?
- Okay.
"- Three, two, one."
Get wasted.
- YouTube dance tutorials.
We could do both of those things.
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
Or we could just do mine.
"All right, here, to girls' night."
HEATHER:
Girls' night.
- I need this so bad.
- Yeah.
I've been a wreck.
"Oh, honey, it's gonna be okay."
Mmm.
You know what we're gonna do?
We are gonna dance the sad right out of you.
"I was thinking we start with the Charleston, and then we just move forward chronologically."
"Yeah, and by the time you get to the Electric Slide, you're really gonna feel better,"
- because you're going to be bombed.
- (imitates explosion)
Do you feel older?
Yes.
So when is your tour starting?
"You know, we actually just had to push it another month."
Our tour manager totally screwed it up.
She got the dates wrong.
"Actually, Cece, who I think you've met."
Oh.
The blonde.
"Yeah, the blonde."
"At the park, and at the show."
Right.
"You... you had a thing with her, right?"
No.
"No, no."
She works with me.
"She's my tour manager, and not into guys."
But what makes you think that I was into her?
The fact that I'm now officially an idiot.
His lesbian tour manager?
Oh.
What's this?
It's a birthday present.
It'll bring you luck.
And I thought you could use a little bit.
Thank you.
It's beautiful.
You're welcome.
"You're not mad at me, are you?"
No.
"No, it's actually just the opposite."
And that's the problem.
These objects were taken from him and these are the personal belongings found in his cell.
You have to sign here.
Sir?
You have to sign here.
"Benigno, it's me."
Alicia is alive.
You woke her up.
"When I heard your message,"
"I raced back to the jail to tell you, but Iwas too late."
I put Alicia's hairclip in your pocket.
"And I also put in a photo of her and one of your mother,"
so that they'll be with you for all eternity.
Waves.
Cruel waves.
"The male below, the female above."
I find water.
You sit down.
Are you all right?
Yes.
I don't know.
I'm much better now.
What?
"Come along, let's go inside."
"OK, you are shaking."
OCR failed!
What is the matter?
What did you say to her?
Nothing.
I saw you talking.
Alicia asked me if I felt all right and I thanked her.
"If you see me in your neighborhood, don't worry."
I live across from your Academy.
- Ok.
- What?
Nothing.
"It's just, you're so bossy sometimes, it's kind of a turn-off."
Bossy?
Wow.
"Well, I only said that because..."
"No, that's cool, you know."
"I'll just, like, turn my brain off whenever we're together."
- That's not what I meant.
- So what?
"Did I, like, trick you into this or something?"
Did I pretend to be someone else that you... ?
No.
"I mean, I like how independent you are."
I just feel like sometimes it's kinda like you're dating yourself.
Like it doesn't even matter whether I'm here or not.
"Well, congrats."
It doesn't anymore.
Emma.
Emma!
Your secret admirer's outside.
"It's all about the Benjamins, baby."
Just what do you think $100 is gonna buy you?
'Cause you know what?
I don't want your guilt money.
"Yeah, I know who you are."
You're Robert Quinn.
"I Googled you, when you didn't show."
"Ok, look."
I'm sorry.
I took your DNA test.
"Hey, asshole !"
Come!
Get it!
You created the wrong gangster!
I love the taste of black blood in the morning!
The thermal camera did not recognize its pattern.
I thought he was dead.
The turns of electronics.
We are approaching the death zone.
You're good?
Motherfucker!
"The electronics are fine, Commander."
"Well, Kix!"
What a sight you have so extreme.
I've never seen a noid with hair.
"Because they do not grow hair, asshole."
Mutated Humanoids.
True.
- This is a Sammy 69-7-H.
- A Sammy 69-7-H?
"This is an old model of pleasure, is not it?"
"They probably lost their virginity, did not they, Hatta?"
- Are you cold?
- No sir.
Pack it in the tank!
Can you walk on that leg?
Yes.
"You're going to make it, brother."
Ice teaches all humility.
It shows us our limits.
Our weaknesses.
Our humanity.
"Right again, Mr. Monk."
An electromagnet.
Battery operated.
Strong enough to pull these six balls and only these balls up the chute.
"Well, we didn't put that there."
"Oh, Miss Teeger, please."
Don't insult us.
You started working here two weeks ago.
You had access to the equipment.
"Suddenly, your friend wins what?"
$106 million.
I suggest you both get good lawyers.
What?
This is nuts.
"Hey, Monk?"
Monk?
Have you got anything?
There were two winners.
What happened to the other man?
The truck driver?
Eugene Maddox.
We've already talked to his lawyers.
He's agreed not to sue us in exchange for a rather generous settlement.
I'm sure he did.
Waiter!
Yo!
There's something wrong with my glass.
It's empty.
You know what?
Hell.
Just bring the whole bottle and charge it to the room.
"I'm afraid you can't afford it, Billy."
"Uh, okay, sure."
Why not?
"My name is Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali, and this is my friend Dr. Sheldon Cooper."
Hi.
There's no need to interact with me.
I'm just here to observe.
What's he observing?
We're scientists.
We observe everything.
"Here, go buy yourself a scone."
All right.
- And what is your name?
- Angela.
"Oh, derived from the word ""angel."" Appropriate."
You're cute.
I'd like to buy a scone.
"Oh, I'm sorry, we're out."
We have muffins.
"They sound delicious, but this money is earmarked for scones."
What are you doing?
!
"Oh, just getting comfortable."
So how long have you lived in Los Angeles?
I...
They were out of scones.
"Sheldon, I'm talking to someone."
You're being rude.
I'll bet you're an actress.
"If not, you should be."
You have a very expressive face.
"Oh, my God."
"Wait, where are you going?"
"Aye, aye, sir."
"On deck, Mr. Pardoe!"
Mr. Crawford!
Mr. Crawford!
- Find the senior midshipman for me.
"- Mr. Kilpatrick, sir?"
- Tell him to see me in the gunroom.
"- Aye, aye, sir."
Get that hatch open.
Let some air into the magazine.
Did you hear what I said?
Open that hatch.
"But we had it open yesterday, sir."
I don't care if it was.
I'm giving you an order.
Open that hatch!
- Orders is weekly.
"- Stand, you insolent dog!"
Mr. Kilpatrick?
Mr. Scott-Padget wants to see you.
- What's he want?
- I don't know.
He said now.
- Get that hatch open at once.
"- Aye, aye, sir."
"Carry on, Sergeant Kneebone."
- Three more.
- I've got seven.
- Only five.
- Good enough.
"Only a few more, and we'll have the whole ship."
"- Now, we write our petition."
Because he didn't want to go to a foster home.
He didn't want to leave and I didn't want him to leave either.
"It's like, you force me to live amongst these... these pod people and the first cool person I meet, it's like, you kick him out of the house."
I did the best I could.
So did I.
Come on.
Police want to ask us some more questions.
You and I need to talk.
And this time I want the truth.
I'm sorry.
Ryan Atwood?
We got some questions for you.
It was an accident.
"Yeah, you were there?"
Yeah.
"Then we got some questions for you, too."
"Officer, I'm Mr. Atwood's attorney."
Please don't ask him any questions unless I'm present.
"Ryan, keep your mouth shut."
"You, too."
Vic!
"Come on, dude!"
–Tell me you're leaving!
–That which doesn't kill me...
Come on!
Come on!
Let go!
Vic!
Hi.
David Aceveda.
Vote for me.
She's suffering from amnesia.
- Amnesia.
- Yes.
She didn't recognise me.
She doesn't remember anything.
I've got to go to California to see her.
She'll recognise me.
"- Oh, she won't know you."
"- I'm her mother, she will."
"No, listen to me."
"It was one of the worst moments of my life, one of the most painful."
"When I stood in front of her after all this time, she had no idea who I was."
Oh.
"Oh, God, she's-"
"She's ill, she's in trouble."
"She needs me, Blake."
"No, damn it, no."
We've got to follow doctor's orders on this.
She is in very fragile condition.
"Now, she's not to be pushed, not under any circumstances, is that clear?"
Not any.
All right.
I won't go.
Good.
Good.
Thank you.
But we have another daughter who needs help.
"Now, Amanda's been going through a terrible time."
And I haven't been much good in helping her solve her problems.
"She needs your help, Alexis."
She needs you.
Mm.
His traces only exist in the past.
Like a ghost hunt.
Ghosts have a soul.
He does not.
"From a technical point of view, A mind is a soul."
"This is not funny, Bishop."
I've seen them kill.
Suicide would be the best option.
"If you're afraid,..."
I get it.
Just put me in the right direction and I go alone.
We must find Cage.
That's not my style.
Not like a hiding place.
Cage is a man!
An old and nasty fighter.
With many weapons.
"He lives four days walking, Inside the death zone."
No human is so crazy.
"I did not say, that is not crazy."
Come.
I know the way
"Hello, guests."
My name is Sara.
"Sorry, my husband is not there."
Will come back later
We wait.
"Cookies, that's milk."
"I can see that, Sara."
Where do you get them?
"I made them, of course."
They try my husband better than his mother's cookies.
"Bob, what's the matter with you?"
"If they catch you here, the two of us will be thrown out of school."
You mean the three of us.
I saw him come in here.
You saw who come in here?
"Your boyfriend, Wilbur."
(NANCY CHUCKLING)
"What's wrong with you, darling?"
"Oh, save your ""darlings"" for Wilbur."
"I tell you, at this moment, Wilbur is in his room sound asleep."
He's not here?
He's not here.
He's in his room sound asleep?
He's in his room sound asleep.
"Okay, I'm gonna find out."
You do that.
Good evening.
(MUMBLING)
We're delighted that you both could come.
We were happy to come.
"Would you excuse me, please?"
Certainly.
Enjoy yourselves.
I've been trying to see you all day.
I locked my windows.
And what's that supposed to mean?
You can figure that out for yourself.
(ALL APPLAUDING) Maybe Wilbur can help me.
"Bob, I don't know what's come over you lately."
You've just got to stop picking on Wilbur!
"Bob, what are you waiting for?"
What?
Now snap out of it and be a part of this family again.
"- Okay, fine, I'll go sledding."
- Good.
Because your attitude is starting to affect the children.
Just look at Bill.
"Come on, come on."
What's wrong with you?
"Oh, it's beautiful."
Murphy family fun day starts now!
"- Ah, Christ, Bill."
Maybe he won't notice.
"- Hey, Frank!"
Hey!
Looks like your boy dinged my dangler.
I thought that was my job.
You sexy thing.
Excuse me.
Vic?
Sorry about your van.
I'll pay for the damages.
I can't take bread from my main man who lost his gig.
I remember once I was out of work for a whole winter.
"Oh, wait, that was a vacation."
Hawaii.
"Hey, Frank, you should go to Hawaii, man!"
It'll do you wonders.
"See a volcano, drink a volcano, be a volcano."
"Have fun in Hawaii, Frank!"
This isn't my snowmobile!
He's such a kind soul.
"He's a drug addict, Sue."
This day sucks knob already.
'Cause that's loaded.
Yeah.
Michael's father had a Winchester single-shot.
I think I may still have it.
So you want a beer?
You kiddin'?
Doug is sleeping peacefully.
- You gave him something.
- Maybe.
"Well, half of somethin'."
Sam got in touch with his buddy at the U.S. Attorney's.
Bringing Doug in tomorrow mornin'.
Great.
We can talk finally.
There's nothing to talk about.
You were right.
I was wrong.
I'm sorry.
"It isn't that simple, Michael."
"You think you can let the job be who you are... all you are, and you can't."
It's dangerous to think that you can.
I know I can be...
passionate...
- but I'm good at what I do.
- I know.
- It's no secret that things between us have been-
- Little rocky.
It isn't easy for me either.
"Evelyn comes along, and she's attractive... sweet, needy."
Don't deny it.
Fine.
"Isn't it interesting that she turned out to be... well, who she turned out to be?"
Why did you go there?
Don't you get a newspaper at home?
You are changing the topic again.
You can try.
You cannot avoid me.
- Why did you go there?
- Shiv!
What's wrong...
What's wrong with you?
What's wrong with me?
What's wrong with you?
I am getting married.
Okay?
And he's just the type of guy I want.
"Intense, charming.."
Silent.
Silent in bed as well?
Stop your nonsense and leave!
I am the one talking nonsense?
I am the one talking nonsense?
He's just your type?
He's charming?
What were you doing with me?
What were you doing with me?
"Tell me, what were you doing with me then!"
Tell me something.
Listen... please.
I won't do anything.
Listen to me.
I understand that economics is important.
"I am a banker, I understand."
But doesn't chemistry mean anything?
They could have had David and Meredith's code but not ours.
Where are they?
Take a deep breath.
We're gonna walk.
We're gonna call for help.
Okay?
"""Cardiff, Aberdeen, Glasgow, Belfast, Oxford, Slough."""
Operator.
- Blackleg Miner Station.
- Go ahead.
The station's been compromised.
Requesting immediate evacuation.
One moment.
- Evac authorized.
- ETA?
Four hours.
"For now, standard protocol."
Secure location.
Retire asset.
Repeat.
The code has been compromised.
Retire your broadcaster.
Did you copy that?
Got it.
What?
What'd they say?
Four hours.
Sit tight.
Did you hear that?
They're drilling through.
Let's go check the security cameras.
Find out what happened to David and Meredith.
"Everything is fine, Franz."
The bar clown next door wants you to sing for him  for his ridiculous event.
Toni wants me to sing?
You can sing?
Can she sing?
I just want to let you know that I've cancelled it.
But why?
I could just sing for him once.
I would gladly do it.
I don't want her to sing for Toni.
Toni is a slave driver.
"You said it yourself, Franz."
They work all night long.
She's not working for Toni.
"If you have to, you can sing for him once."
Sing him the Internationale.
He'd enjoy that.
What?
The international workers anthem!
There were workers here once.
Screw it.
"I'm sorry, Franz."
I'm singing.
I'm singing!
I don't want to go to Toni's.
I won't go in there.
I've never been in there and I never will.
Once again....
You've sold the doors and the door frames?
Why?
I mean what could you get for a door plus the frame.
"Excuse me, but I have no idea."
What happened?
I yawned.
Will be best if I am packing and i'm on my way.
"I think, I was not the wrong one."
"I asked it, you are not sleepy."
"But, he not sleepy, respectable major lord."
Why did he yawn then?
Why you yawned my Lajos?
I don't know.
Only some.
Only some?
Did you yawn because you feel well possibly?
"Yes, major lord."
"Here you go to believe, major lord."
That's right.
"Please make a statement, dear Tót."
What would you do now the with pleasure?
- May I be honest?
- Of course.
Well...
I now the with pleasure...
I would make a box a little.
Yes?
"- And you, Mariska?"
- I too.
- Ágika?
"- I too, of course"
If you insist on him this much...
I do not regret it.
"I ask you for it only, let this not occur repeatedly."
No.
Never again.
"I always wanted to dance, sir."
"Good, then."
We can always use a go-go dancer.
"I am gay, sir."
"We can't hear you here, speak up!"
I am homosexual.
How can we be sure of that?
I brought you pictures.
"Here, take these."
What's this look?
What does yourdad have to say about this faggotry?
"Sir, my fatherwas a commanderlike you."
He died in combat in southeastern Turkey.
"Not sure, what he'd say now..."
Give me the envelope.
So?
"Sorry, wrong envelope."
We'll show you how it works.
Take him.
"Dad, I am fine..."
You forgot these in the car.
We'll take care of that.
I have to be honest.
I don't need these anymore.
Shove them up yourass.
How about shoving them up your girlfriend's ass.
Stick them up your mother's cunt.
"Pick on someone yourown size, asshole."
"Dad, I will go faraway."
Forgive me.
I am a faggot.
It's all my fault.
I like her.
"Okay, so good."
You could use a friend.
Especially one who cleans.
"Hey, maybe you could make a second friend who cooks."
"I haven't had a homemade meal in, like, a year and a half."
I'm gonna go change for dinner.
"Wait a minute, why are you here?"
I took Ritchie and Matthew to the batting cages.
He's been feeling neglected since the divorce.
- Ritchie?
"- No, surprisingly, Matthew."
"- He almost hit the ball, though."
- Matthew?
"No, surprisingly, Ritchie."
"Well, I just have to finish this ironing, and then we can take off."
"Okay, well, take your time."
This is nice.
I love a basement bedroom.
This is where you wanna be during a tornado.
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
"Belinda, I..."
Oh.
"Sorry, I didn't know you were entertaining."
"- Hello, Christine."
- Hello.
"Uh, the book club is here, so if you could set the food out, that'd be great."
"And, uh, you girls can help yourselves to a couple of sandwiches."
Just a couple.
Heh.
"- Oh, thank you."
Thank you.
-Mr.
Wheeler.
-Mm-hmm.
Is this toad flax?
"No, that's lmpatiens capensis."
That's also known as touch-me-not.
"You guys, I found a touch-me-not."
"Untouched, unspoiled, here in the middle of suburban uniformity, you can find..."
a tiny wilderness.
Dad.
"Brian, don't be an idiot."
"Hey, Dad... whoa."
I need to talk to you for a second.
I didn't know he had a daughter.
I need you to fix my car.
I was planning on fixing that after school.
I can't wait that long.
"I mean, I need to leave town."
I've got to get out of here right now.
"T ell me about it, lady."
We all want to get out of here.
Are you late for an appointment with a client?
Are you a religious fanatic or something?
No.
Why?
Oh... 'cause you're just the most understanding man
I've ever met.
Thank you.
"Wow, look at this place."
What is this?
This is the...
T anapaya Wet Lands.
He's the birthday boy.
He's just like his father.
Nice kid.
I'm so hungry.
Dump your rubbish here.
Dump your rubbish here.
You can go.
We'll make a short tour through the Efteling Park.
"Finally, we can sit."
We'll get that bloody fascist.
No matter how.
"That's only for laughs, mom."
What's this?
What does Queen Beatrix want with that comedian?
"One moment, sir."
"-It's from last week, mom."
"No, last week's one was about Martine Bijl and that tall man."
What's his name?
From that comic duo.
"No, that's Prince Pieter, who can't play the piano because of his hands."
Terrible... cancer in your hands.
"-Yes, terrible."
Money can't buy happiness.
"-No, but it's nice to have."
We'll buy this one.
"Look, Marco Bakker will never sing again!"
With a record!
-We'll play it on the stereo!
Fantastic!
-We'll get this one too.
Anything else?
"-No, that's enough."
"Of being shivved for being a traitor, you lying grasser!"
"I'm shutting you down, mate."

Put down the prom baby.
(BABY WHEEZING) Now!
We tried to unplug you nicely even though we knew that you beamed your video to Akan.
No?
What's this?
(ECHOING) What's that?
You're broadcasting that to Akan!
Enough!
Enough.
"Even if I did believe you, I still have to... (WARNING ALARM BLARES)"
(GROANS)
Fuck!
"Henry, no!"
No!
(SCREAMS)
You brought them to my lab!
I trusted you!
"Henry, please kill me."
Akan won't.
"He'll make me live in this straightjacket of rotten, smelly skin!"
What the fuck was I thinking that Akan's toy robot was my friend?
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
"Thank you, Henry."
"Fuck you, too, but mostly thanks."
"My lab's compromised, but I can build a new one using Akan's equipment when we go get your wife together, right?"
Like Kay.
Have kids.
Have a family.

"It's not easy to be a son, Fredo."
It's not easy.

"You're no gypsy, Fredo."
"Mikey, I was mad at you."
Why didn't we spend time like this before?
"You want a drink, right?"
Waiter!

-How do you say Banana Daiquiri?
-Banana Daiquiri.
-That's it?
-That's it.
Uno Banana Daiquiri and a club soda.
Senator Geary flies in from Washington tomorrow with some government people.
I want you to show them a good time in Havana.
"-That's my specialty, right?"
-Can I trust you with something?
"Of course, Mike."
Later in the evening we're all invited to the Presidential Palace to bring in the New Year.
"After it's over they'll take me home in a military car, alone."
For my protection.
"Before I reach my hotel, I'll be assassinated."
-Who?
-Roth.
"Tom, it's time."
"I'm gonna have to strap you up, Tom."
"Earl, I'm sorry I busted your head so hard against those bars."
"That's all right, Tom."
This is Father J. P. Rank.
- How do you do?
"- Fine, Tom."
You?
- How long you had that Bible?
- Twenty-eight years.
Got her about bucked out yet?
I think so.
- You ready?
- Yeah.
"- I understand you're getting married, son."
"- Yes, I am, Mr. Horn."
"You take good care of her, now."
"Right there, Tom."
"Keep your nerve, Sam, because I'm going to keep mine."
All right.
"Tom, step back on the trap."
There.
"Sam, I've never seen... such a pasty-faced bunch of sheriffs in my life."
"- You wouldn't ever forget me, would you, Bobby?"
"- Diane, I love you."
"I want you to find a woman, a woman who disappeared 40 years ago."
She worked in a club on Hotel Street.
- She was a hooker?
- She was also my wife.
- He hired me to find you.
"- Don't toy with me, especially about Bobby."
Cynthia!
Cynthia!
Hey!
Cynthia!
Thank God.
Thank God that is over!
"I mean, who jumps out of the canoe?"
You could have really hurt yourself out there!
Put these on.
Cynthia?
"Jason, I have had it!"
I can't do everything exactly the way you want!
I can't control the ocean and row the boat and stop the waves!
Calm down!
And I can't do anything about the fact that I can't get pregnant!
This is nuts.
"No, it's me."
And I just really need some time right now.
"Please stop following me, 'cause I need to be away from you."
Come on.
What are you doing?
"Hey, hey, where you going?"
That's a jungle!
You know what?
"I'm gonna go check on her, okay?"
"Great, thank you."
"Yeah, you guys go ahead."
I'm gonna make sure she's okay.
"Honey, I don't think it's a good idea that everyone separates right now."
I really don't think we have a choice.
Let me just go talk to her.
"No, Jason, she really needs a minute, okay?"
"And, like, after he hurt his knee, he won all 24 again?"
- Yeah.
"- He's like an American hero, you know?"
"I mean, who doesn't respect that guy?"
- Wes...
Bookstore's closing soon.
- I got to go.
- Wes?
- What?
"- I'm gonna make it right, okay?"
- Okay.
- Who's that?
- Jacob.
"- All right, kid, come on."
"- You know, Ricky just has the drive to win."
He wasn't afraid of the work.
He always trained harder than anyone else.
- He's a role model to young ones.
"He shows them that, you know, you get out of life whatever you put into it."
"- I mean, ten titles in a motocross class... that's crazy."
"- Every time he goes out there, he's thinking about nothing else but crossing that finish line first, and he does."
- The big difference between Ricky and all...
"- Yeah, Jacob!"
- Awesome!
"- Whoa, nice little jump."
- Yeah.
- Whoo.
"- Dude, this is gonna be awesome."
"- Hell, yeah."
- ♪ She wore a cloak of feathers ♪
- Here he goes.
- Yeah!
I see it.
And I make every effort to prepare them for what's coming.
"Well, I think I've heard enough for today."
What exactly are you trying to tell me?
Are you trying to tell me I'm going to die soon?
Is that it?
I told you everything.
You know everything.
Go fuck yourself.
Hurry up.
Sam.
"Sam, hurry up."
Bring that over.
Hurry up.
"Breathe, breathe, breathe."
We need a neck brace and a splint.
Get that here.
Look straight into the light.
Don't move.
The smell of the ghosts.
Follow the smell of the ghosts and you'll find the flower.
"What did you say, sweetheart?"
It's a cactus.
"It makes a flower once a year, at midnight."
Only once.
"At 12:00 noon, the flower dies, and it smells like ghosts."
The flower smells like ghosts?
"Yeah, but it's real nice."
Mommy says ghosts smell good.
The Night Blooming Cereus.
"Yes, I remember."
Mommy told me about it too.
Cross over those territories in such an unstable period
Is definitely out of the question.
Why never?
Because they are the Balkans.
So?
I said the Balkans.
- Yes and then?
Unstable.
Unstable.
"There is Bulgaria, Serbia..."
"Romania, Albania, Macedonia..."
Excuse me.
- His Majesty.
Excuse me.
We'll have a meeting.
We will return.
- All right.
She must understand...
- Sire.
Wait a moment.
We have to find a solution.
"It is not possible, Your Majesty."
"Sorry, I have to go."
"Mr Lloyd, not now."
I try to speak with Turkish security and Mr. Bulut.
Maybe even with the ambassador.
I'm going to take the luggage.
"Sire, I see if there's a field above."
Excuse me.
Where is the Ambassador?
"One time, I documented wars and revolutions."
"Then I drank for a decade, persecuted by nightmares."
Hee hee!
You've bust it.
How fast were you going?
"In the car, it was 124. 9."
"More, and the other side will go."
No.
Ready?
That's it.
'Didn't quite manage it that time. '
I'm not quitting.
I'll have another go.
You better succeed.
One of the strangest things about being over 40 is that you start to want contestants on game shows to win.
"You also start to like game show hosts, even dressed as deck chairs."
Richard Whiteley!
APPLAUSE
Wow.
How are you?
Have a seat.
I've got to be careful with this.
It's back to Bridlington tomorrow.
How much do you get for renting that out?
"Mind you, I'm not one to talk."
Let's be honest - really.
Let's do your career history.
Born up north.
Yorkshire.
Which is fine.
Educated at Cambridge.
Wooh!
Someone has to be.
You were the first person on Channel Four.
It isn't hard to find.
Is it true what the newspapers say?
That you never drive a car?
I never have to.
I was thinking of helping you... with communcations.
"Well, that should be fine..."
Now to test it.
Want to come with me?
"Yes, with pleasure, but what was the problem?"
Nearly nothing at all.
"Just old, I think."
The damned motor was stuck together with wire when I got here...
But it's been fixed.
I hope so.
"Enough, enough!"
Did General Cork send you to be my latin lover?
Enough!
- Confess.
"- Yes, yes, enough!"
"Forgive me, I was cruel, forgive me..."
Everyone is cruel sometimes.
"Hey kid, come here."
Let's go have some fun.
"Two, two!"
Careful.
"Yes, five dollars."
"You're disgusting, stay away from me!"
You depraved animal!
"Cretin, pervert!"
How can they do it?
"My god, how can they sell their own children?"
They're hungry.
"Gambling is illegal, to be sure but the city is aware of it and approves."
"My house encourages tourists, pays large tax es...."
Coming out of it was like after being tapped on the button.
"Everything foggy, an anchor on my head and ringing in my ears."
"Rip, this is Coral, Dusty."
What happened?
I don't know.
Don't you know?
I just woke up in my garage.
That's a great place to wake up.
Mr. Martinelli is a fine....
Remind me to put him to sleep sometime.
My head's splitting.
Look in your bag.
See if you've got your money.
Just a minute.
- Murder.
- What'd you say?
I said murder. I just sat up.
"- The money's all here, Rip."
- lt is?
Then I can't understand why he slugged us both.
"- What's your phone number, Dusty?"
- Surf 3181.
I'll call you back.
I've got company.
It was Louis.
His neck was broken.
My brain began to unscramble.
"Louis, Johnny's letter."
That was the joker.
Then Martinelli was tied to Johnny's death.
Okay.
Where you going?
Away.
With a man I met from est.
"What do you mean, ""away""?"
Away.
I don't know.
For a few days.
"We've, um..."
[Sighs]
Had this emotional connection for some time... and we just want to see if there is something else there.
You're telling me you're going to have an affair?
- Sandra?
- I might.
I don't know.
At least I'm being honest.
Go ahead.
Tell me that you're not having an affair.
I'm...
You know what kills me about the whole thing?
Is that you didn't have any idea anything was going on.
"You, Mr. Counterintelligence Genius."
You just didn't see it?
So you either didn't want to know or... you didn't care enough to pay attention.
Who is he?
- It doesn't matter.
- Who is he?
It doesn't matter who he is.
What are you gonna do?
Go arrest him?
[Laughs]
Sandra.
Clamp.
Clamp.
Keep steady pressure.
3-0 silks.
3-0 standing by.
More gauze.
Gauze.
- Got it open.
"- Okay, clamp it."
"Here you go, doctor."
- Keep the pressure on.
"- Yes, sir."
Let's get some more gauze in here.
"Okay, she's under."
I want you two stationed right here.
Do not leave unless you hear directly from me.
"Okay, Jack, those are all the questions I'm obliged to ask."
"If you got anything else you want to add, Jack, now would be the time."
"That's my statement, as it is."
"My god, Tony."
Nina tried to commit suicide.
"She jammed her neck into Richards' needle, ruptured an artery."
Where is she now?
She's in the clinic being operated on.
Who's with her?
"Don't worry, Jack, she's sedated."
I saw her go under.
Who's with her now?
"Tony, who's with her?"
!
Damn it!
Which way did she go?
"Souta-kun is a good person, and kind too, and we get along well, and it's fun to spend time together."
That's why...
"I was being two-timed, huh."
Two-timed?
- Eh?
Why does that sound like a question?
"Well, it's a regular two-timing, right?"
"You were continuing with your boyfriend, and also going out with me."
Going out...
Eh?
!
"Umm, Saeko-san."
"Saeko-san and I were going out, right?"
I asked you to go out with me and you said okay.
Eh?
Ah...
Yeah.
- These two months.
"It's just been two months, but."
"Well, look, we even kissed, right?"
"Ah, but, we didn't have sex."
"Oh, I see."
"If you don't have sex, it's not called going out."
So it's not two-timing either.
...What?
!
Is that how it is?
Is that how society works?
"Saeko-san is correct, and I'm wrong?"
I don't know what's what anymore.
Wait.
Let me collect my thoughts.
Later I find out it's not.
I've been conned.
- What are my options?
"- Just drop it, right?"
- I'd say so too.
- Aren't there any legal measures?
- I'll look into it.
- I'll treat you to dinner.
Oysters?
- Oysters are just fine.
Call me.
- This weekend.
Mia's got a bag.
- Mia hasn't got a bag of oysters.
- I didn't buy them.
- You get them in a basket.
- You don't catch them in a basket.
"No, but you sell oysters in a basket and clams in a net."
You're confusing them with shrimp.
Way to go!
- Good morning.
"- My, fresh rolls and everything."
- Thanks for a great night.
"- Well, thank you."
You were great.
"It was mind-blowing, Frank."
"- Yes, I performed my magic."
- I've never felt anything like it.
"When you told me flat out, I was hurt, I have to admit."
- But Casper knew this little trick.
- You talked to Casper about it?
Yes.
♪ this is how I want it ♪ uh ♪
♪ this is what I like ♪ yeah ♪
"♪ this is how I want it, this is what I like ♪"
Wow.
I can't remember the last time
I did it missionary style.
That is one of the top two moments of my whole life.
The other was with Stephen Hawking.
"Oh, we didn't do this."
I just met him.
"♪ This is how I want it, this is what I like ♪"
- Morning Ri.
- Hey Sara.
"So, how are things going with Dr. Lonsdale?"
Eh.
What?
What does that mean?
Meh.
Okay.
What are these sounds?
What's going on?
Nothing's going on.
He just did something before we had sex that turned me off.
- Maybe he was trying to be considerate.
- Yeah.
But then he did something after we had sex that really turned me off.
This is bad.
"This is very, very bad."
What am I gonna do?
Don't worry about it.
Everett and I have zero chemistry together.
"I guarantee you, he feels exactly the same way I do."
Great.
I've got your assignments.
"Briefing room, five minutes."
Is everything okay with Kayla?
When was the last time you saw your roommate?
- Last night around 6:00.
- She didn't come home all night?
I don't know.
I slept at my boyfriend's.
Any idea where she might have gone?
There's two million single men in L.A. Take your pick.
"We found her car in the garage, but not her purse or keys."
Is there someone close?
Somewhere she might have walked to?
Wait a minute.
Is Kayla dead?
We have every reason to believe that she's still alive.
'Cause I don't wanna be a bitch... but our rent's due next week.
- Vic.
I got great news.
- What?
Just be glad you hired me and not the brain-dead idiot your wife did.
Jerk off privately.
What do you got?
"Corrine's P.I., they're making nonsecure calls from his cell phone."
I caught one.
Found where she's at.
- Beauty.
You got the address?
"- Yeah, sure."
"- Oh, geez."
- Corrine...
Where is she?
You go to hell!
You gonna burn.
- Garcia.
"- [Garcia] Friends, we're on three-way."
What's going on?
"Hotch, we found some pictures of Kaman's girlfriend at his apartment."
[Garcia] So I blew up those pictures.
"In one of them, she appears to be in a restaurant."
"So I zoomed in on the sign that says ""O'S,"""
cross-checked that with restaurants in the area.
There are five diners.
"Three are in the suburbs, two are in Highland Park, ...and one is in Rivertown."
- [Hotch] What's the name?
Jay-Mo's.
And this appears to be Kaman's and that girl's favorite place 'cause all the pictures were taken there.
- Have you heard of Jay-Mo's?
- It's a few blocks from here.
"Good work, Garcia."
We're on the way.
"You're sick, Kaman."
We done talking!
This ain't the way.
Then tell me where she is.
"If she ain't with you, I know where she is."
[Man] Don't do it.
Leave Tracy alone.
Kaman... [shuddering breaths]
It's too late for her.
And it's too late for you.
Kaman!
"[Garcia] Hotch, a fire alert just went out."
-Swimming?
Can not know what we become.
"Beauty, eat plankton the rest of your life."
"But that's what we are, are herbivores."
-We are vegetarians.
What?
For everyone devour us.
I am no longer so to be on the menu.
-Where you going?
-Go up the food chain.
Food chain?
"I chew something that has ""Face."""
I do not remember that.
It always seems that everything different in the back.
So I think we should go the other way.
The land of emperors is opposite.
Why not go there.
"No, no, this is better."
-But shortcuts are shorter.
Not always.
"What is, is not that far."
"Guys, stop."
"Erik, I had to stop."
Okay.
Okay.
"Continue, but pay attention and go slowly."
"It is best not to look down, okay."
"Atticus, what I said."
"Good day, a champion!"
Where to go?
In-house.
-It is.
Sir...
I'm a blind man.
How would I know such details about the car?
Am I the one driving the car?
Who drives it?
My driver.
Until a couple of months ago.
After that?
He didn't maintain.
the car properly
"Also, I didn't use it much."
So I had to relieve him from his job.
No one used the car after that.
I take an auto or cab if necessary.
So...
No one has used the car for 2 months now?
Yes.
Anything else?
We will contact if anything else needed.
I have some work now.
So... 2 thugs came home...
Your sight?
"Greetings, Sir."
"- You are Moorthy, right?"
Sculptor Manoj's Driver?
I was working as his driver 2 months ago.
Didn't you continue after that?
"No, Sir."
Don't lie.
You have driven his car and got it into an accident on the 18th.
I'm working here for the past 2 months.
It has been while since I last saw Mr.Manoj.
- Mr. Charles.
- Charles: goodbye.
We've got to do something about your...
- Your issue.
- Your narcolepsy.
What?
- You're going running again?
- yeah.
"That seems like that's all you do, regina."
You need to be out looking for a job.
Stop trying to run away from your problems.
What?
!
"Come on, mom."
What are you talking about?
- Oh.
- Excuse me.
"Well, if you can't hear me,"
Maybe i need to write it down
So you can read it.
"you need a job, regina."
Tell me something i don't know!
Don't you ever raise your voice
And use that tone to me again.
i am your mother
"And i will be until the day i die,"
And you will not disrespect me.
"Yes, ma'am."
"I'm gonna go run now, ma'am."
Do i have your permission?
"Go on, regina."
"Lord, i ain't slapped nobody in 20 years."
It was only for a month because the competition was in May
And in June Montenegro declared itself independent.
"Since they are from Montenegro, they gave the title to a Serb."
Bitch.
I remember this story.
In Belgrade they got stubborn and they gave me this job.
"It's not a happy ending, right?"
"I'm sure, Mr. Duncan Lloyd,"
This is a very interesting job.
Serbia enjoys dancing.
"- Thank you, I'll do it."
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
"Incredible, I really recognized it."

Does the camera make you feel right to dig in the lives of others?
It depends.

"Boy at 18, nothing to boast;"

"Woman at 80, sparkles and glows!"
"Man at 80, coffin soon to close."
What's your rank?
"Supermac 99, and yours?"
Supermac 98!
You've been found out.
You're done!
What shall I do?
"Only the Commissioner's fiancee, who can save you."
But I don't want to see her again.
This is an order.
Go immediately!
Why are you here?
You remember what you said to me yesterday?
I don't remember.
But I do. I remember it too well.
You said you'll never see me again.
I was just joking.
I don't mean what I say.
"But you said you love me, do you mean it?"
Of course I do.
I need you help.
My help?
To go after some girl?
Can't you even get Dumplings on your own?
All I want is to get the 'Beast'.
But Hiroshima has escaped and identified me.
I was told that only you can help me out.
Mrs Andrews?
Hi.
Probably don't remember me.
I live next door to Bob.
My name's Gil Raymond.
"Just thought I'd pop by, see how you were."
Gil?
"Oh, Gil."
You picked up my spoon.
Excuse me?
In the garden.
You picked up my spoon.
Erm....
"Oh, so I did."
"Oh, God, listen, what a day that was."
She never wanted me there in that house in the first place.
"Oh, I'm sure that's not true."
You don't know her.
She's a nasty piece of work.
The way she used to treat me sometimes.
And the things she used to say.
And he was no better.
Wouldn't lift a finger for me unless he had to.
And then....
Then he started mucking about with prostitutes.
"He was a pervert and... she was a mean, spiteful bitch."
And I tell you now... they deserved each other.
"Oh, well, my gosh."
How about I pour you another cup of tea because....
What do you think?
This one looks like it's getting a bit...cold.
Darling.
"Tony Weng, we're protecting that scum."

You'll be all right.
Don't be afraid.
Don't cry.
- He's down there!
Step on it!
- Okay.
- Any hospitals nearby?
- Think he's got a conscience?
He won't let the little girl die.
"Nurse, where's casualty?"
I am prettier than you.
And I am smarter than you.
"And humbler, apparently."
"But guess what, Allie."
What?
I'll always be crazier than you too.

Wow.

"You know, it's..."
Let me tell you.
"And so now, now sex is like bowling."
It's just like bowling.
"Because afterwards, you're like, ""That was fun."
That was great.
"- We should do that more often."" Ha-ha-ha."
"My wife is amazing, and I love this woman to death."
"But like most women, she loves to talk about her feelings."
- Know what I'm talking about?
"- Oh, yes."
- Do you like to talk about your feelings?
- Absolutely.
Of course.
It's like asking a klepto if they want a handbag.
I have to get him.
I have to get him.

Let me go!
I have to get him!
I'll drag him down to hell with me!

- How?
See what it says?
"""Blond hair."""
Still don't get it?
Sure.
But won't that get you in trouble?
Nah.
You just say you saw them together in the car.
Near my place around 9:00.
"No, make it 11:00."
COURT OF JUSTICE
Fifteen years' prison for Reinhold.
Pretty stiff.
I'm here to kill you.
What did I do?
You want to keep my boss's land!

"His Refugee, Will it be a hit or flop?"
"Tell her, Who's the king of Mumbai?"
Who?
Brother...
Apparently she's the king and the king Kong.
Poor Laxminarayan.
Badla Bhai told his mother.
What did he say?
Laxi's mother...
Steel from the gun and child from the womb.
They never go back.
But only mother knows her pain.
Right?
I thought he'll do few murders in his life.
I thought he'll get settled.
I wanted to you marry the daughter of Chota Khujli.
But came out useless.
Take your argument at home.
Bhai give me one chance.
No one gets two 4s at one ball and two chances in one life.
Stupid fool like you Laxminarayan is no one else in the world.
"Shoe is chewing me, then you chew it."
"This is Laxminarayan Two, MBA from Jharkan University."
He has just two rules in life.
"Rule no 1, Boss is always right."
"Rule no 2, If the boss is wrong then follow the rule no 1."
"Sofa or Chair, Sir?"
Chair.
"It's not your problem if I get sick, so mind your own business!"
"Tell my mother for all I care, she won't say anything."
Oh shit!
Come on everybody!
"What time do you call this, Mr Boglio?"
I'll let it pass this once.
"You, recite your homework."

"Ok, that's enough."
Bring me your exercise book.
"Boglio, show me your weekend homework!"
Is oat grown in your area?
Your answer... yes.
"Beetroot, yes!"
"Rice, yes!"
"Tomatoes, no!"
There are no tomatoes?
What about fruit and vegetables?
"Yes, gladioli!"
"Tell me this, are you trying to be funny, saying there are no vines?"
Is that what you call homework?
!
"I didn't do it, sir."
Who did it then?
Maybe the Dad did?
Maybe!
You have to come to school.
The teacher wants a word with you.
"Come on, the change will do you good."
Carry on without me!
Where do you think you're going?
Hop on the back.
We'll check the lists.
Come here.
What are you waiting for?
I have to check your behind.
Turn over!
I don't think I can.
Wiggle a bit.
"Where are you from, son?"
Urfa.
"Wow, Urfa."
Not a traitor but a taker.
What do you do for living?
"I am a Zenne, sir."
Would a real man shake his hips for living?
"I always wanted to dance, sir."
"Good, then."
We can always use a go-go dancer.
"I am gay, sir."
"We can't hear you here, speak up!"
I am homosexual.
How can we be sure of that?
I brought you pictures.
"Here, take these."
What's this look?
What does your dad have to say about this faggotry?
"Sir, my father was a commander like you."
He died in combat in south-eastern Turkey.
"Not sure, what he'd say now..."
Give me the envelope.
So?
"Sorry, wrong envelope."
We'll show you how it works.
"She looked at me, but didn't see me."
"- But, tonight..."
- Tonight?
"Hey, I buy her!"
- What's going on?
- What do you think?
"Passports, tickets, cha cha cha!"
Duvigny.
Defarge.
Theron.
Fuselli.
Salesman.
Ten foggy days in Budapest?
"I just started my shift, detective."
We're just chatting with a friend from Budapest.
"We're in first class, coach 15."
Hungarian.
Thank you.
Can you show me your luggage?
"of course, enthusiastically sir!"
To be enthusiastic means to be inhabited by God!
Brilliant.
Hey...
"If cops freak you out, how will you ever make it with women?"
Brothers with different names...
and I'm not a friend from Buda.
"Hey, Dumbo!"
Look!
Isn't it grand?
"You will meet her, you will see her, but you will never believe what you see!"
Isn't Paris more rich than your Buda-shit?
- Nobody picking you up?
* What I know of it has me up a tree *
* Love is crazy
* After full of it what's come over me *
* We both said goodbye and parted *
* We agreed that it was there *
* Now I've got to make up all of it *
* Why haven't I confessed?
* I'm in love
* All over [banging on the drum]
* Tell me what did you do You're better than you * [whispering] What do you mean by bringing those people here?
Take off that uniform and get out.
You're fired!
You're fired.
He beat you to it.
Shh.
Get those people out of here.
[mark tree jingling]
"Oh, I beg your pardon, sir."
Young man..
I'm looking for the Patio Bar.
- Good idea.
"- Yes, indeed."
"- Hi, Doug."
- Hi.
"Let me see, just-just where are we now?"
"Hello, pop."
I thought you were going to Patio Bar.
"Well, bless me, so did I."
- What place is this?
"- Well, sir.."
You're now in the locker rooms of one of the largest enterprises in the world.
Complete with...
"Yeah, I do, too, but don't cling to it."
It'll make you lazy and angry.
- Your work will suffer.
- I'll keep that in mind.
And I don't believe you need to exacerbate these instincts in yourself more than you already do.
You got it.
"(TYRES SCREECH, CAR HORN BEEPS)"
(♪ MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO)
"Ah... now, your room's out the back."
"I, erm..."
I have to go to the city for a couple of days.
- Do you think you'll be all right here?
"- Yes, I do."
I thought so.
(DOOR OPENS)
Hello?
Dad?
PHILIP:
Hello?
Are you that kid?
"You're the caretaker, Melanie?"
Dad mentioned you might be here.
"So, this comes as no surprise."
"Not to me, no."
"""Dad""?"
Beautiful sunset.
- Productive day?
- Not particularly.
I'm glad that he's replaced himself with a younger surrogate to handle the forlorn moping.
I'm glad it pleases you.
He'll be back in a few days.
I know.
"Come to that window, Come on."
"Take your photo, It came to me by mistake,"
Yes Sir!
"It's your photo, You came here for this,"
"Ones, Twos, why it doesn't explodes?"
"You are the sharp shooter,"
I don't wear kafan to people but under garments.
"You didn't came here to kill her, Then who came here to kill her?"
"Third Laxminarayan, who came to me,"
"There she is, there she is, Stop!"
Stop!
Stop!
"Come on Pintos, Come on Pintos, No, No, Papa!"
Please!
Please!
Please!
"Please don't press the remote,"
Is he your father?
"Namaste,"
"No, No, He is not my Papa,"
"Every one calls him Papa, that's why I call him Papa too,"
"D'melos Yadav Gangster,"
"Nobody will move, Other wise I'll shoots,"
"Take out, who ever have what,"
Laxminarayan!
"You came here to kill me, to kill D'Melos Yadav."
Ones!
"No, Papa!"
Twos!
"Don't press the remote, Bomb will be explode,"
Where is that Bomb?
"In your Bag,"
AUDIENCE LAUGHS
Do you have it on your mobile phone?
Do you...
Yes!
When you ring your mobile...
"Yes, yes, I do!"
What I'm interested in is how you got on in our reasonably-priced car.
Oh.
This is very embarrassing.
Shall we find out?
Richard's lap.
TYRES SCREECH
Here we go...
You're putting a lot of effort into this.
Knackered.
This is where he said don't brake.
I've got to.
Quite smooth... quite fast.
Ish.
And into the last corner...
That's a nice line.
Well.
We have the time.
And I'm afraid it's a sad day in Top Gear history.
And a sad day for Harry Enfield.
AUDIENCE:
No!
Richard Whiteley is the slowest man ever with a time of two minutes six seconds!
Enfield is going to be absolutely apoplectic.
His proudest boast to date was he was so slow and you've beaten him!
By miles!
"Frankly, your life is now ruined."
It's just that I've got to find my brother.
What gang does he belong to?
- He doesn't belong to any gang.
- [boys snicker]
I never heard of a Guy that never belonged to a gang.
I'm sure something's happened.
I've got to find him.
"If anybody could find him, we could."
"I mean, we know this town inside out."
"Oh, would you?"
"Hey, yeah, sure."
"Listen, you done us a big favor, now we'll do it for you."
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
"Hey, come on, let's go."
That Tony sure made himself scarce.
- We better walk you home.
- Where do you live?
I...
I was supposed to stay at a hotel.
But I don't know which one.
You could stay in our hideout.
- [boys] yeah!
- Thank you.
We'll look for Tony tomorrow.
If we aren't busy beating up goons.
- Yeah.
"- Hey, it's yo-yo."
- Get down.
"- Come on, hide."
- Did he see us?
- I don't know.
Hello?
Okay.
We will add numbers to the beginning and end of the old number.
Try all the combinations.
What's this?
"If it were a test, I could skip the questions I can't answer."
"Excuse me, ma'am."
Can you come down to the cashier?
Why?
What happened?
"This way, please."
The alarm went off.
It's almost one o'clock.
Where are you?
I tried.
I tried them all.
None of them worked.
That's impossible.
I am out of here or we'll get caught.
"No, wait."
Try again by putting them at the beginning.
"Ma'am, there was a little misunderstanding."
Please forgive us.
There's no need to apologize.
"Actually, I was kind of in a hurry."
You've wasted my time.
"Come on, baby."
Let's get out of here.
It's not working.
None of it's working.
"Come on Uluc, work your head."
What password would a mathematician use?
They were tied with bows.
"I tried to grab on to them, but they kept popping away."
And then I started to sink... like a stone.
There was nothing I could do.
I was falling.
But it felt good.
I was letting go.
I was letting myself go and... all I could see...
was black... and all I could feel.
was the darkness above me and the lights... coming from below.
I knew I was dying.
And then
I heard this voice.
like somebody whispering in my ear.
"""Wake up, number 37""."
"""Wake up"""
And then I woke up.
What do you think that means?
Number 37?
I have absolutely no idea.
I met him.
The guy who told me about the plane crash.
You met him?
Yeah.
I met him.
"Last night, coming home from work about midnight."
I'm driving past the cement plant... out bythe chemical factory.
Right.
Something happened.
Bright...
Lightning.
Something encircles me.
Don't bathe in the evening!
You could have a chest-congestion!
We Brahmins always bathe before we cook.
Great woman!
She observes cleanliness even at this age!
"You bathe everyday, don't you?"
What do you mean?
"I mean, it's good to bathe everyday!"
Wow!
She is even religious...
What a chaste woman!
Jai!
What are you up to?
The water wouldn't flow the drain!
So I came down!
Jai!
What's that?
You're wearing a matrimonial necklace!
It belonged to my mother.
When she died... my father asked me to preserve it carefully.
And what's that...
on your forehead?
"Eyebrows, eh?"
It's a dot!
This doesn't belong to Mom.
Aunty gave it to me and said...
"""You have a necklace."
"Complete the picture with a dot""!"
You must wear it on your forehead.
Jai!
I'm here too!
"Talk to me, when you're through with her!"
But we're not supposed to leave.
Miss Pearl made that very clear.
You gonna stop me?
I didn't think so.
- Anna.
- Surprised?
I thought you and your mom were leaving town.
Change of plans.
"I'm sorry, I thought you'd be psyched."
"No, no, no."
"I mean, I am."
Of course I am.
"All right, then."
Step aside.
Heh.
Don't be grumpy.
It can't be that bad.
You'd be surprised.
"My primary reason for existence has abandoned me and after today's events, the remains of the shaky ground that I walk on are about to go kaboom."
Let's get hammered.
Let's.
- Whoo!
Ha-ha-ha.
- Ha-ha-ha.
At least they're having fun.
They're drunk.
Remember when Elena's parents busted us here after homecoming?
"- Oh, my God, yes."
- We were wasted.
It was the first time I got drunk.
I blame Matt.
Her parents got seated at the next booth.
A palace in which there is no king or queen...
"... ordukesor earlsorprinces, but subjects all."
Subjects...
... beholdentoeachothertomake...
... abetterplacetolive .
is that too much to ask?
Are we asking too much from you?
is it beyond our reach?
Because if it is...
... thenwearenothingbutsheep ...
... beingherded to the final slaughterhouse.
I will not go down that way!
I choose to fight back!
"I choose to rise, not fall!"
"I choose to live, not die!"
And I know...

That's why...

That looks like an industrial park.
"Well, it was, but now it's slated for demolition."
I'll call Booth.
(glass breaks)
BOOTH:
Looks like this is where he set up shop.
Look at all this stuff.
Booth?
Yeah?
Look at this.
There's parish records.
News clippings about Aldo.
Discharge documents...
This X-ray is not Aldo's.
It's of somebody else.
How do you know?
There's a stellate-shaped wound directly above the right squamosal suture.
Gunshot?
Yes.
The extent of the damage indicates a high powered rifle.
Perfectly placed.
Not too many people can make that shot.
BRENNAN:
The writing is Cyrillic.
Serbian.
That is correct.
Where are you going?
Over here.
Going behind door number two.
Look at this.
This is not good.
(clears throat)
5th Army Cameras!
Turn that... thing.
Oh my!
"General, there was a small accident but we'll go on."
Continue.
We better go now.
I'm sorry about that.
"I'm sorry, we better leave."
The ambulance is on its way.
"You can go, Jimmy."
You are the winners.
-What's the matter?
-A transfer instability.
It may be only temporary.
Something's wrong.
"Yes, you're right."
It's getting smaller.
-Can't you do something?
-I don't understand.
I don't understand.
But the Doctor's in there!
-It's your codes that are doing this.
-This is unheard of.
"-Well, how do we get him out of this?"
-A fault in the computation.
But there must be something you can do to put him right.
Take the machine to the Central Register.
What're you going to do with it?
"The Central Register, quickly."
There may still be time.
The honour of Logopolis is at stake.
JESSIE:
"Oh, God!"
You kids do watch too many movies.
Come on in!
I don't have my suit on.
"So, Mick, do you like girls better than frogs yet?"
I don't like frogs.
Nice evasive move.
- What?
- Nothing!
"Mikey, you're staring at me."
"No, I'm not."
"Hey, it's okay to look."
"It may not be polite to stare, but looking's nothing be embarrassed at."
Just promise me one thing.
"When the girls you look at, they start to look back, make sure you're real nice to them; okay?"
"If I had a girlfriend, I'd do anything for her."
I bet you would.
MAN:
"Oh, my God!"
What the heck are you watching?
Just a horror film.
"Sorry, Buddy."
I don't feel good about you watching that kind of stuff.
"Besides, it's bedtime."
So what kind of fun stuff did you do today?
- Dad?
- Yeah.
How do you know you love a girl?
I don't know.
You just know.
It makes you feel good all over.
"Henry, no."
I'm instructing... shit.
"Good job, Charlie Bronson."
Bravo 2-0.
Lights up.
Play video.
Dawn of Twilight... a cyborg era.
"Thank you, sir."
I've lobotomized everything not essential... not essential to soldiers.
"Personal memories, speech, sense of taste... it's all gone."
"May still have a bit of an issue with emotional motivation, which..."
Motivation?
"Try your fucking paycheck, James."
"My paych... yes, okay."
"- What the shit fuck, James?"
"- I'm sorry, sir!"
I'm so sorry!
"Oh, shit!"
Open the doors!
Please!
Open the door!
We've got a malfunction!
"Let me out, please!"
"Uh, I'll fix it."
I doubt it.
Fucking idiot.
"You know, Jimmy, something about a spine snapping... it never gets old."
- It sounds like...
"- The end, the beginning."
Or are they the same?
"Have a seat, Henry."
"When a man is first crippled, there's always one question on everyone's mind, especially his... does his dick work?"
- Hey!
- Get this lion off of me here.
- No!
No!
You stop it.
This is my fight.
Do you understand me?
I'm sick of men getting in my way.
This is my fight.
You hear me?
- You hear what I'm saying?
"- Maybe we should leave these two alone, huh?"
Okay.
"We'll see you next Friday, huh?"
"""Beauty Versus the Beast II."""
"Come on, Brianna."
Here we go.
- You're not ready for this fight.
"- Oh, I have an idea, Dad."
Why don't you shut your fat little monkey face and hold the bag?
I'm gonna paralyze this bitch.
"Yes, Dad, I know the fight is in a few hours, all right?"
I'm trying to find my goddamn headband.
Is that okay?
Is it okay with you if I find my headband before I come down there?
"Is that all right with you, Dad?"
Jesus!
Why didn't we get the orange one like I said?
This one might as well be goddamn camouflaged!
"Oh, good."
Are you happy now?
I just punched a hole in my wall!
It's too dangerous to go on.
We should return to Puyo.
Sayong's right.
Guys with grudges will hunt you down like a mad dog.
Mad dogs are best when avoided.
"Let's turn back, Miss."
I heard they still call him commander.
Commander?
But they're bandits.
- That's nonsense.
- It's not that simple.
(Oi) They train harder than soldiers do.
They're willing to die for their commander.
(Mari) No wonder the soldiers are no match.
(Hyupbo) This is bad...
Captain.
There's no point in pushing forward.
We should go back to Puyo.
He's right.
Talk to Sosuhno.
"Actually, I want to go to Gosan no matter what happens."
But Sosuhno is our leader and we should wait for her decision.
Come with me.
Where to?
To the bandits' hideout.
What?
What for?
I want to check them out.
Cap...
(Puyo Palace)
What do you want?
"(Yangjung, Hyunto governor) We're going to attack the Southwest Yi."

"Yeah, yeah, get over it."
"Truth or Dare, Mr. Gimp?"
"Truth, probably."
"- ""Um, truth, probablah."""
- Truth it is.
Be nice.
"So, Felix... tell me... if you had a golden ticket... and you could pick any girl... or any guy... to take upstairs for a very quick, no strings attached, no questions asked shag... who would it be?"
"In fact, here... it is."
"Your ""free shag"" ticket."
"Who's the lucky girl, Felix?"
"Who is it, Felix?"
"Who's the lucky girl, Felix?"
I'm sorry.
"I want to play, I want to play, come on."
"Come on, let's play, Truth or Dare, bitch?"
You and me.
"Put your knob away, Chris, we're just mucking about."
- Truth.
Do I look like a muck to you?
- No.
- So why're you pissing on my patch?
- I was just...
"- Ahem, I was just playing..."
"- ""I was just-just..."""
- just playing the game.
"- Oh, just playing..."
"- You fancy your chances, do you?"
- No.
No?
"Well, we better find out what's on offer, then."
- I think Gem should know.

"Well, Uncle Rusty stood me up."
What?
Yep.
A little embarrassing.
I was the only one there without a special friend.
At least Charlie's grandpa talked to me for a while.
Did you know president Obama's not a U.S. citizen?
(Crow cawing in distance)
"Damn it, Frankie."
I knew asking my brother was a bad idea.
(Beeping) This is your parents' fault for going on that stupid cyber cruise.
They're old.
Why do they gotta learn new stuff?
(Sighs) (Clink)
Ohh.
"Thanks, dad."
You got in my line of vision.
"I was at level five, and now I gotta start back at the beginning."
(Door squeaks)
(Door closes)
"Oh, hey, Sue."
Do you got a minute?
I was just gonna go run my line.
"Oh, I think that can wait."
"Listen, honey, I have some terrible news."
Grandma died?
No.
"No, but keep that in perspective as to what terrible news really is."
"Listen, gene talked to me last night, and he said he was really sorry, but unfortunately... (Sighs) You're off the play."
What?
!
Hello.
It's the other lens.
It looks like you were right.
Nobody jumps after putting in one contact lens.
Want me to put it in this evidence bag?
Bag number 32.
Hey. 32. 32. 3-2.
32.
"Mr. Monk, are you mocking me?"
In public?
I don't make fun of your job.
That's because I have a real job.
I'm solving a homicide here.
"Well, I have a real job, too."
I'm changing people's lives.
I'm making them rich.
Yeah.
You are not making them rich.
You're not giving them financial advice.
You're just reading little numbers off little white ping-pong balls.
"And if it wasn't you, they'd just hire some other bim..."
Some other what?
Bim what?
Bimportant person.
"Mr. Monk, do you think I'm a bimbo?"
"Look, I know what I do isn't the most bimportant job on the earth, but what do I do for you?"
Hand you wipes all day long?
Pick up your laundry?
"You know, people admire me now."
And I admit it.
I am enjoying the attention.
I guess I needed it.
We're doing this my way.
"Ah, yeah, 'cause it's your way or the highway."
"Oh, God."
Not the highway.
You always want me to be his dad.
"Well, I'm being his dad."
"Oh, uh, I-I'm really scared, Jay."
This is what we're fixing.
"Look, when I was a kid,"
"I lived by a big, scary black lake."
I always thought there monsters in there and whatnot.
"One night, my dad dragged me out of bed and tossed me right in that cold water."
I was never scared of that lake again.
"Now, give it some gas."
- Mama!
- Aah!
"That's another habit I wouldn't mind breaking, but, you know, right now we... have to..."
"Oh, what am I doing?"
I hated my dad for that.
"I ended up scared of him, not the lake."
"Manny, it's okay."
Over there!
On the bike!
The white guy that stole my phone!
I don't see anyone.
Yes!
He just turned the corner!
The phone burglar!
He's getting away!
Not this time.
Up there to the left!
I don't see anyone!
"She said, ""I thought you were going to..."" What?"
"It sounds like, ""I thought you were going to Star City."""
DUD:
"And then the other girl says ""I am..."" Something."
Play that again.
(DISTORTED) What are you...
"Hey, girl, I thought you were going to Star City."
LILA:
"I am, tonight."
It does sound like Star City.
"""I thought you were going to Star City."""
"Dud, check this out."

"Jimmy, you there?"
JIMMY ON RADIO:
"Yeah, Dale."
Come on back.
"Yeah, listen, I'm just coming back from the courthouse."
I checked the records on Ray Malcolm.
"He was born here all right, but he hasn't lived here in 20 years, so I'm heading out to the uncle's place right now."
I want you to do me a favor.
Call Charlie and tell him to come to work early tonight.
Tell him I'm going to stay out there waiting in case those folks show up.
"If they do, man, we're going to be laying for them."
"Damn, this could be a big one."
I was thinking...
I only smoke when I'm with you... wonder why.
I can't thank you enough...
for the other day... for tonight.
You're such an inspiration.
The way you've changed.
"""Evolved"", I guess, is a..."
"better word, into this beautiful... smart... very sexy..."
I think I must have loved you all along...
I just... didn't know it.
What an idiot.
Ha...
"Hannah, this is... this is ridiculous."
"Gregory, I really can't talk now."
"She can't not talk to me forever, I..."
I've got...
"Gregory,whatareyou doing?"
There're certain things I have to explain to her.
"I think it's a little late for that, Gregory, don't you think?"
What!
?
"I said, ""I think it's a little late for that, Gregory""."
"No, I don't think so."
What Rose and I have goes far beyond what normal people...
What's all that noise?
"What are you trying to say, Gregory?"
"Gregory, what is going on?"
Could you just...
Gregory!
Hannah!
What!
?
"- All right, go ahead."
- Thank you-
- Horace... (Mary Ann gasps)
- I told you to cut your hair.
"- So, anyone have an opinion on this peanut farmer, Jimmy Carter?"
Looks like he's floating to the top of the sewer.
Could be our next president.
"- Well, anything to throw that fuckin' bum Ford out of there."
"- Okay, now, what's your problem with Ford?"
- Are you fucking kidding me?
"You know what he said, he--"
Here.
"I saved it, all right?"
"""Ford to City:"
"Drop Dead."""
Horace:
He's been saving that headline for a year now.
- Yeah.
Fuck this guy!
He can go fuck himself forever.
You know what?
I wish I had Squeaky Fromme right here and I could fucking teach her how to shoot a gun.
Jimmy:
Oh.
"- Fucking hippies, they send in a girl, you know?"
"I mean, she had a clear shot at Ford and she throws the bullet like a girl."
- Holy moly.
Pete.
"I understand you have a hate for the president, but it's pretty severe."
Jeez.
"- Oh, wait-"
- Wait a minute.
I told you he was guilty.
Who would've thought he was capable of such atrocities?
"Oh, Slink, I hope he's okay."
"Oh, a survivor."
Where's the rebel base?
Talk!
I can see your will is strong.
"Well, we have ways of making you talk."
Where are your rebel friends now?
"Sid, your Pop Tarts are ready!"
All right!
Are you all right?
"I'm proud of you, Sheriff."
A lesser man would've talked under such torture.
I sure hope this isn't permanent.
Still no word from Star Command.
We're not that far from the space port.
The door.
It's open!
We're free!
"Woody, we don't know what's out there!"
I'll tell you wha...
"They're gonna eat us, Buzz!"
Do something quick!
Shield your eyes.
It's not working.
I recharged it before I left.
It should be good for...
You idiot!
You're a toy!
Use your karate chop action!
-Get away!
We're not the same breed.
Definitely not.
"I kind of like you, though..."
I know.
Me too.
I feel like getting closer to you.
Too bad I'm in a hurry.
I coulïve invited you to lunch.
You little bastard!
Isn't it nice here?
When no one bugs us we're content with simple pleasures.
"Just like flies, always buzzing around our balls."
Like we're indispensable.
Everything falls apart without us.
Don't go so fast!
My balls hurt!
Then stand up!
I win the prize!
Stupid ass...
Damn!
What a dumb way to get caught...
He's still thirsty.
Don't go away!
Give little Jesus a drink.
Here.
Take it and give him a drink.
Why?
I don't want your money.
Come on...
Don't give us a hard time...
Your tits really turn me on.
I'm meeting my husband.
Let's go in.
Get some dragon-gall grass to cure my wound with
Go on!
Go on!
"Rest a while and you'll be okay, Uncle"
"Look, Big-cup!"
Shoot it with your coin and my tiger tooth!
"Wake up, Seventh Uncle"
"I'm thirsty, Yu-lu-get me some water I'll worry about you here alone"
"I'll be okay-go on, and hurry back!"
I know there's a cave up there
They're in there for sure!
Divide in two groups and surround them!
Okay!
Let's go!
Seventh Uncle!
I knew you'd pass by here
Enemies are bound to meet I've already chosen this place
To be our grave!
This fine White Cloud Mountain
Master arranged it all
His purpose in having us come in was to learn this kung-fu well!
I think his arrangements will be right!
Let's go ask Master
Right!
Let's go!
Yu-lu!
Master...
Master...
Where's Yu-lu?
Yu-lu...
Take care of her well
Move it!
He's hypoxic.
"All right, let's move!"
- Clear the blades and we'll shock him.
- Where's the crash cart?
"- All right, the paddles."
- We just landed at County General.
- The doctors are taking out paddles.
- Charging!
- Clear!
- One hundred!
Several doctors are trying desperately to revive Ben Larkin.
- One-fifty.
- Clear!
- So far their efforts are failing.
-0.4 epi.
- Charging 200.
- Clear.
- Will he make it?
- Shock him again!
One more time.
- Charging 200.
- Back.
- Let's get him inside.
We'll try it again.
- Are we gonna lose him?
- Got warming blankets?
- We're all set.
Damn.
"We'll shock him again, then we'll try rapid rewarming."
- Get that gurney out of there!
- That little girl?
Good!
Because this is only the beginning.
I'm going to love you and hold you and feed you and dress you
- and cling to you...
- Yeah...
Hang on to you and smother you with my love.
- Yeah...
- Forever and ever and ever
- and ever and ever...
"- You know, it's gettin' a little stuffy in here."
"You know, I might go get some air."
"Oh, no, you don't."
"Oh, no..."
Not without your umbrella.
- Come on!
"- Here, let me get that."
Wait for me!
"Sugar, could you just do me one small, little teensy favor?"
Anything.
Could you leave me alone for like 30 seconds?
Anything but that.
"You know, I forgot my gumdrop buttons."
Yeah!
"Could you run over there and get 'em for me, please?"
"Sure, I can."
I'll be right back.
"♪ Gingy, Gingy ♪"
"Run, run, run, as fast as you can if you wanna remain a gingerbread man!"
Oh!
"- Oh, Gingy."
- Whaa...
I don't understand.
"You're a loyal citizen of Germany, and I can respect that."
Sometimes I just don't know when to stop doing my job.
Thank you.
I wanted to ask...
How are they?
Ollie and Billy.
Oliver was killed last year in action.
- I'm sorry.
- And Billy...
William now...
He's missing in the Pacific.
I hope he will come back to you soon.
"I'm sure your father wants the same thing, Klaus, and I wish I could give it to him."
"But that's not the game, is it?"
"No, it isn't."
Thank you.
For your kindness.
It's the least I could do.
Maybe we can talk again.
Maybe.
- Soldiers are safe for now.
- That's great.
The Germans searched the Abbey last night.
They didn't find them.
We shouldn't leave them there too long.
We're gonna need a new camp.
Somewhere we can bring them longer term.
- Yeah.
- Varges is close to here.
Varges?
"Yeah, we talked about it."
Might be a good place to recruit more locals for the POWs to train.
"Let's leave it to Adam, eh?"
"So, Adam, what's it to be?"
"A life of comfort and privilege, and all the pleasures that a young man could ever dream of... or hardship, desperation and hunger?"
I choose them.
"Er... you may need to be a little bit more specific, Adam."
"Oh, yeah."
"I mean you, George and Nina."
"I choose you, yeah."
- Ooh!
- Yes.
What did you say?
"Well, I don't want this."
"I mean, it's completely fucked up."
Look.
"Adam, for goodness' sake, drink the man's blood and have sex with me on the billiard table."
- You are embarrassing us.
"- Look, get off me, you munter."
- Adam!
"- And up yours, you no-neck gaylord."
Hm!
Don't you dare speak to your father like that.
Father?
He's not my father.
Right.
I've had enough of this.
Oh.
"Ah, these are not your people."
These animals!
"Yeah, tell it to someone who gives a shit."
"- OK, I think we've made our point."
"- Come on, come on."
"Oh, take him and his ingratitude."
Nice.
Where'd you get these things?
- How do I look?
First I gotta know where you got 'em.
I see.
You'd rather look like a tramp than accept something from me.
Take 'em back where you got 'em.
Got that?
Then maybe I should just leave too.
Maybe you should.
"Where'd you get these things, Cilly?"
A girl gave them to me.
I won't ―
I'm telling you:
Watch your step.
"Don't be angry, Franzie."
"None of us are angels, are we?"
Enough!
Let's get down to the bar!
- You really mean it?
- Why not?
Stop pestering it all the time!
And you get out of here with that cigar!
The air's bad enough.
You're nuts!
They've never been in a cage.
They don't understand.
So what's the story?
He wouldn't take the clothes.
"Well, I want Biberkopf, and that's that."
"Well, I won't help."
"I want him, and that's that."
Take look.
This uniform transforms a common man into a hero.
- I see.
This uniform can turn an out-of-form guy...
- into a macho-man.
- Idea.
What?
Idea.
Only you can save me from suspension now.
- What?
- You take my place.
Go posing as inspector Zoravar.
- Zoravar can...
- Hold on uncle.
This is impossible I cannot do it.
Why do you think the ACP chose me?
Because he knows it's just a formality.
And I assure you... she will believe you're Zoravar.
Because she has never seen me.
It's headfirst to Delhi.
It's just fo rthree days.
Here's her photograph.
What's the problem?
- Ankita!
- Yes she's...
You know her?
Yes I know her very well.
We met last year during the Jaipur lnter-college festival.
Her voice.
Her eyes.
That mind-blowing attitude.
Different.
"302, 00:23:34,330 -- 00:23:35,286 Okay."
You guys need anything ?
"No, we're good."
So how long have you two been friends?
"306, 00:24:06,820 -- 00:24:10,689 I'm not suppose really to talk to you any more, so ..."
Oh wait !
I think you got a phone message.
But that's all I'm saying.
Now I got to zip.
You have one new message.
This really is the last time I'm going to say this to you...
Okay ?
Or anything else.
I don't want you to send me anything anymore.
"313, 00:24:43,023 -- 00:24:45,515 I don't..."
I threw out the flowers.
"314, 00:24:45,734 -- 00:24:47,942 You can't fix it!"
And I'm really done with you.
"I don't want to talk to you again, I don't want to hear from you again."
I want you to leave me alone ...
Um... me and Vi have been friends for a pretty long time...
Maybe three years.
What?
You asked how long we have been friends a minute ago.
Oh yes .
Right.
We met in the hospital.
In a hospital ?
Yea.
"326, 00:25:36,910 -- 00:25:40,620 It was that dull hospital over at Lexington."
Know it?
No.
"I want you... to stop what you're doing, and leave this village quietly."
I mean it.
Leave.
Quietly.
This is Gokseong.
My turf.
Don't mess around and get yourself killed.
Just leave.
"If you don't leave, you'll die."
"If you heard me, say something."
Or at least nod your fucking head!
Please answer.
"So, you're..."
"Shut up, bitch!"
You're blowing me off?
"Oh, I'm just not worth answering."
Is that it?
"You're not even gonna listen, right?"
Ain't that right?
"I'm trying to speak to you, but you're not listening!"
What's this?
What the fuck is this?
What the hell is all this?
What the...
What the fuck are these rituals you're doing?
!
What the fuck are you doing in my town!
Do you know whose daughter you're messing with?
Son of a bitch!
Look out!
Jong-gu?
Now what?
"Mr. Zuloaga tried to dissuade him, but Benigno wouldn't listen, he was very upset."
He also said he knew a lot of married couples who didn't get along half as well as he and Alicia.
"JORDAN, EIGHT MONTHS LATER"
"Lydia Gonzalez was buried yesterday, April 13, in the Almudena cemetery."
"The 33 year old bullfighter, daughter of Antonio Gonzalez, had been in a coma since..."
"""The Forest"" Clinic."
May I speak to Benigno Martin?
He's on the 2nd floor.
He doesn't work here anymore.
"Excuse me, miss..."
Are you sure?
Absolutely.
And nurse Rosa?
Who's calling?
Marco Zuloaga.
I'll put you through.
To get a referral slip stamped?
"Along the corridor, Administration."
Who is it?
It's Marco Zuloaga.
Marco.
I'm calling from Jordan.
I read that Lydia died.
"Yes, that's right."
"I'm so sorry, Marco."
I would like to have been told.
We've had so many problems here.
What's going on?
They said Benigno doesn't work there anymore.
Benigno's in jail.
In jail?
Why?
Go sit down.
"Bo, it's raining.!"
"Bo, it's raining."
"- It's raining, Bo!"
"- It's raining, Bo!"
You're on punishment when you get home.
You're on punishment when you get home.
And you're on punishment when you get home.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"It's gonna rain on your head, Bo."
"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen... and welcome to St. Joseph's Annual Basketball Awards Dinner."
We had a... difficult year.
Most of you are aware of that.
"When I first went to St. Joe's,"
"I really did sleep, eat and drink basketball."
That was all I did.
But it became more of a job than a sport to play.
Things here have not changed since-
"You know, Coach Pingatore just had these dreams in his head."
hejust wanted me to go the same route he took Isiah.
The most steals.
he played as a freshman.
Not even Isiah was a four-year starter.
"You know, basketball was just like- he was possessed with it."
"You know, it was his life."
And he wanted it to be everybody else's life too.
All-conference in the SCC.
All-state in the Sun-Times.
A McDonald All-American nomination.
"M. V.P., 1990-1991 season, William Gates."

- #... but they were only satellites
# It's wrong to wish on space hardware
"# I wish, I wish, I wish you'd care"
# I don't want to change the world
# I'm not looking for a new England
# I'm just looking for another girl #
Thanks.
Come on.
Let's get home.
"No, Tommy."
- You smell gorgeous.
- I said no.
You know you love it.
A bit of the old Tommy magic.
"It doesn't work anymore, Tom."
Shit.
"Ooh, shit!"
Wait...
Why me?
- 'Cause you're different.
- OK.
"# My love, you got me spinning like a wind-up toy"
"# Hot kiss, won't you tell me what you miss, boy?"
"# My love, you got me spinning like a wind-up toy"
"# Oh, Father!"
I pray to thee!

Can't even entrust you with a simple task.
And to think we're leaving the nation in your generation's hands...
Open the door for me.
Why do you sit there like an ass?
"Give it a rest, Pavel Ivanovich."
I am not your lackey.
--I'm an engineer.
--Engineer?
!
Where did you get the money to buy this car?
My dad gave me the money.
--And who's your dad?
--A lieutenant colonel
Which division?
"Oh, whatever."
Do what you people want.
I no longer give a damn.
About everything.
Anyutin Lane.
Taken
Stop
"--Where is ""she""?"
--She?
"--I don't know when they woke up --The rope you hid from him, where is it?"
--Oh...it's here in the kitchen --Give it to me.
--Here --Thanks
You're welcome.
I am so glad you arrived.
You spoke so strangely on the phone.
--I must inform you in advance...
--No need.
"See, Sasha speaks of you in not so flattering terms."
So you and Finn don't have to keep living in sin.
Whatever.
"- You hear that, Finn?"
- What?
You're off the hook.
"Oh, he's just daydreaming about two paintings a day instead of one."
"Well, I don't know."
Just give a guy a second here.
I need to think.
"(WHIRRING, CLICKING)"
"Ah, I never get tired of that sound."
"(BULB POPS, WHIRRS)"
Finn.
"All right, come on, guys."
It's not like I want to do this.
"Okay, then let's not do it!"
"Uh, do I need to remind you about the roasted dead guy in our basement?"
"We got to do what's in the photo, right, bro?"
How the hell did this happen?
I don't know.
Maybe it's a fucking dare.
- Maybe we're drunk.
- Maybe it was an accident.
It's a fucking lip lock.
We didn't just bump into each other.
"Say something, Finn."
We should destroy that machine.
What?
We can't do that.
I know.
It's too late.
It doesn't matter why we do this.
"Maybe if I was like that movie kid, Haley Joel Osment I could pay her that much."
"But if that meant being good at drama, forget it."
I was crap at drama.
'Cause I hated standing up in front of people.
"So, basically, I had to go to school."
"The sad fact is that, like any island dweller from time to time I had to visit the mainland."
This is Imogene.
You can hold her if you like.
That's...
"Well, okay."
Yeah.
Got her.
Lovely.
"Yeah, she's delightful, isn't she?"
I know.
Isn't she?
"To tell the truth, I'm being crap with her."
You better take her back.
She could've been yours if you got your act together.
"Just think of that, yeah."
"So, the place is looking really nice."
"Barney, Barney, Barney."
"Say hello to Will, Barney."
Here we go.
It's the Antichrist.
"Hello, Barney."
How are you?
-He's lovely.
-Yeah.
"And what about you, Will?"
Any desire for a family of your own yet?
I'd rather eat Barney's nappies.
Oi!
They're going down the science block.
Come back!
Halls of residence.
Shall we?
Good afternoon.
How may I help you?
We're seeking shelter from the fascist oppressors.
And we're wet.
Can I interest you in some hashish?
I'm not really supposed to.
Drugs do odd things to me at the moment.
Aren't they supposed to?
This is Matt.
You want a hit from the bong?
He is an artist.
"Truly, an artist."
I'm Toby.
His roommate.
"And this is of the purest, highest possible grade."
I assure you.
Cool!
Bravo!
All splendid fun.
Polly!
My little chaffinch.
How the devil are you?
"I'm going to pretend that I don't smell that, Toby."
"Smell what, mon petit chou?"
"It's very, very naughty what you're doing, Toby."
Quite possibly.
Anyway.
"For the sake of my happiness, won't you let me have a month of my life?"
"Please Babuji, give me one month"
Go.
Live it up
My baby
Where's Simran?
Where might she be?
- Has she slipped in the loo?
I told you to wake up Raj Did you?
No
Open sesame
Do you have the keys to this?
Anybody home?
No one at home
Haven't I seen you somewhere?
"At Robbie's party, no?"
I don't go to parties.
- Great!
"Nor do I, ever"
Your eyes...
What's wrong with my eyes?
Reminds me of someone.
- Of whom?
My grandmother.
"Like you, her eyes too had hues of yellows and blues"
Keep reading.
I only wanted to find out how you read upside-down
This is the limit!
"Simran, you're here?"
I heard you've missed the train.
"- No, I took it"
I was afraid...
One's clear.
Hey.
You all right?
Yeah.
I'm a little nauseous.
It takes me a couple days to get back up to terminal.
- What's going on?
- There was a shooting across the street.
- Anybody you know?
"- No, but still."
- Kind of scary when it happens so close.
- Yeah.
So I heard you' re getting released today.
"My next round of chemotherapy's in about two days, so I thought I'd come by, say so long."
- How's your mom doing?
- You mean is she still pissed at you?
"No, I didn't mean exactly that, but..."
- She's still pissed at you.
- Good to know.
"She's upstairs with the ""doc."""
Does she know you' re here?
I kind of snuck off.
I actually might need one of those basins.
I think you need some IV Compazine.
- That sounds good.
- All right.
I'll go tell your mom you' re here.
Will you watch him for a minute?
I'm not a child.
"Yeah, Marky!"
"Yeah, Marky!"
- Yeah!
I told them how the world really works.
"How there were predators, how we had to adapt."
"I led them here, under the great ice."
No one can find us here.
But we're still at the bottom of the food chain with no significant purpose.
"Well, we all have a purpose."
Yours is to change the world.
What possible difference... could one krill make?
"Wait and see, Will."
You wait and see.
[ELEPHANT SEALS GRUNTING]
[BOTH ROARING]
- What are you looking at?
- What are you looking at?
"Don't know, but it sure is ugly."
"Notice, boys, the witty riposte as weapon?"
Right.
"Outside, now!"
We are outside.
"- Come on, then."
- No... you come on.
MUMBLE:
Excuse me.
Bryan?
- Huh?
MUMBLE:
Down here.
"Ah, g'day, chief."
What are you doing here?
"Bryan, I need a favor."
A big one.
"For you, champ, anything."
"- Look, Cohen, I think we need to really talk."
- Hey!
There you are.
"Look, some guy just puked all over an amplifier, and... -"
- Why was that tattooed girl just telling you about vomit?
"- She's, uh..."
She's my boss.
I actually work here now.
- What?
- Yeah.
It was the only way I could get those tickets.
- But why?
"- Well, I needed the tickets to show you that I could be selfless, and I needed to be selfless to get you to stop"
"- Cohen, that was really sweet. - Pathetic and sweet?"
"- No, just sweet."
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
"Oh, God."
Oh.
"Come on, I'm sor..."
"Summer, just wait a second."
- You are unbelievable.
"- Not in a good way, right?"
- I thought you just wanted to be friends.
- I do.
"- Oh, well, then what was that, that kiss?"
- I don't know.
I didn't mean for it to happen.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- So this whole night wasn't just a plan to get me back?
"- No, absolutely not."
You can reach your weight-loss goals.
We did.
But only if you reach for the phone and call Canyon Valley...
Now.
How far away is that place?
Couple of hours.
[ Engine revs ]
Sam:
"We were really, really moved by the online testimonials."
"Oh, yeah."
That was some powerful stuff.
Maritza:
And you boys are both certified personal trainers?
Yeah.
"Yeah, personal training brothers."
"Kind of like Hans and Franz, but, uh, less German."
[ Laughs ] And you're certified in...
Makin' people sweat!
Yeah.
Kickin' ass and takin' names!
That's how we do!
Uh...
[ Both chuckle ]
"Uh, to clarify, uh, what my brother's trying to say is, w-w-we both have a passion for-for fitness and helping people."
"Oh, us too."
Hm.
"In fact, that's how we first met."
I was Maritza's first client back in Peru.
"I was on a student visa -- homesick, stressed, eating my troubles away."
"Oh, he was the size of a casa."
"Oh, it's true!"
[ Chuckles ]
"""Redress,"" that's the sort of word."
And a lot of other words.
- Men have been here for years.
- Why don't they leave?
Leave?
Get caught and flogged like him?
- I won't join a mutiny.
- It's not a mutiny.
- And you're gonna prove it.
- You're taking the oath.
What are they doing there?
- What's this gathering?
- Just making rope.
With these louts lying on it?
Move!
Let's move it!
Don't quit!
Get moving!
Watch out or next time you'll get it.
I'm sorry.
It's my fault.
- Yours?
"- I pulled on the rope, tripped him."
"Don't have any more accidents, Vizard."
Or I'll have a look at your backbone.
Boatswain?
What's the matter?
Are you crazy?
"Vizard, I will join."
Good lad.
You'll be flogged for this.
Sergeant!
"God, this is so romantic."
Have you noticed that there's no other cars on the road anymore?
Cars?
Attention.!
Subject vehicle is 500 yards and approaching fast.
All personnel stand clear of the barricade.
"Oh, my God."
- Strap in!
"- Oh, shit!"
Strap in!
Hang on!
Maybe this whole thing wasn't such a hot idea after all.
This is it!
- This is more exciting than election night!
- Box 'em in!
Box 'em in!
- Do something!
- Like what?
I don't know!
Anything!
- What are you doing?
- Anything!
Holy shit!
This is unheard-of!
The surprise roadblock has backfired!
- Hammond's outsmarted the cops!
- Get in control out there!
Stop that damn car!
Don't panic!
- The tension is unbearable!
- Shit!
"- Yes, sir!"
"Hot, maybe?"
Very hot?
What is this?
This is water?
- It's a mousetrap.
"-Heh, and this?"
My grandmother's earmuffs.
"Heh, look at them, lieutenant."
Everybody is a clown.
How do you expect to win the war mit an army of clowns?
We sort of hope you'll laugh yourselves to death.
Yes.
"Now, outside, everybody!"
Everybody out for the blankets!
- Clear out.
Here we go.
"-Hey, you too!"
Outside!
Get going!
"Hurry up, boys."
"Oh, that Schulz pig."
He knew where the radio was all the time.
"Whoever that stoolie is, he's sure batting 1000."
Now the guy I want to talk to is Sefton.
Has anybody seen Sefton?
"Cookie, you haven't seen Sefton, have you?"
"No, I haven't."
"Krause, you here."
"Hoffy, I'm very sorry about the mousetrap but the war news are very depressing anyway, huh?"
I might as well also confiscate the antenna.
American know-how.
"All right, let's hear it."
I MET THIS GUY WHO SUGGESTED I COULD MAKE A LOT MORE MONEY
JUST GOING ON A FEW DATES FOR AN AGENCY.
HE WAS RIGHT.
THAT HOW YOU MET THE DEFENDANT?
NO.
ELITE ENCOUNTERS ONLY SERVICED VERY HIGH-END CLIENTS.
"POLITICIANS, PROMINENT BUSINESSMEN."
"I, UH, SAVED THE LOWLIFES FOR MY PERSONAL LIFE."
WOULD YOU SAY THAT YOUR EXPERIENCE MAKES YOU
AN EXPERT IN LYING?
NO.
"NO, IT'S -"
- IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT.
IT'S ABOUT FULFILLING PEOPLE'S FANTASIES
WHILE MINIMIZING THEIR GUILT.
I'D SAY BEING A LAWYER
IS PROBABLY BETTER TRAINING FOR LYING.
BUT YOU DO HAVE A CRIMINAL RECORD.
NOT FOR LYING.
WOULD YOU TELL YOUR PARENTS ABOUT IT?
IT'S NOT LIKE I WAS A STREET WALKER.
YOU THINK THE JURY WOULD PERCEIVE THAT DISTINCTION?
THE MEN WILL.
- WOW.
- HMM.
YEAH.
I KNOW I SHOULD REALLY PUSH THE PARENT ISSUE.
THE JURY MIGHT GET PAST IT
IF THEY SEE HER AS AN ABANDONED KID UP THERE.
MAYBE.
EVERYONE'S GOT A DARK SIDE YOU DON'T NORMALLY GET TO SEE.
I THINK JURORS UNDERSTAND THAT.
One breakfast like this could end all the day worries.
What an easy remedy.
As simple as making it everyday.
You'll have to come and make it.
I'll do it for a reasonable price.
Where will you say you stayed the night?
What is the matter?
Will you lie?
Nobody will ask me.
Where did you meet mom?
At college.
And had you met other girls before?
Yes.
Specially one.
What was her name?
Why do you care?
"Come on, tell me."
If you tell me about your writings.
That's blackmail.
Then I'm not telling you her name.
Her name was Amelia.
Was she pretty?
No.
"But she told me that she liked me, and that she was feeling good with me."
Are you and mom still arguing?
Much less now.
Poor Clara...
"Why do you say ""poor Clara""?"
-It's just a manner of speaking.
She says the same about you.
Is that right?
You're sad.
Yeah.
That would be best.
I want to...
"It's my job, Chief."
We're going to get these sons of bitches.
I'll be waiting on you.

When did you guys get back?

"Oh, Wednesday night."
That's no honeymoon.
You should have stayed longer.
"Well, Earl had to get back to work, and I'm starting a new job next week."
What are you going to be doing?
Keeping books down at the rice mill.
I went down and talked to old man Hosey.
He hired me on the spot.
You guys take it easy.
Take it easy.
Dale...
"Well, that's good."
"Well, congratulations."
"Thank you, Dale."
We better be going.
DALE:
Okay-doke.
"Do you want some of this, baby?"
"""now that you explained it,"
"It's comin' pretty easy."""
"Axl, ever since we got home,"
I can't stop thinking about aunt Edie.
That bone spur thingy on her foot?
"No, but ew."
You know what we need to do?
We should totally take her to dig up that old time capsule!
"Yeah, I'd love to drive my dor sister"
"And senile aunt around, then dig hole."
Let's go!
"Axl, you need to start thinking outside of yourself!"
Look at beyonce she has every reason
"In the world to be selfish, and she still gives back!"
Wouldn't it be amazing if we could find the capsule
For aunt Edie and make her dreams come true?
!
Sorry.
My time is way too valuable.
Hoo!
Ha!
Hoo-ha-ha!
Hoo!
Oh!
I know this one!
Ha!
I got one before you.
"Oh, so you finally got one, did you, dear?"
Why don't you come to the board and show us your work?
"No, no, no."
I'm good.
I wasn't asking.
Get on the stage now!
Big Mouth...
"No, no!"
Here to collect the laundry money again?
- Stop!
- Forget about the money!
Forget it!
Wash my wife's underwear as well!
In that case...
Are you going to do it?
!
Yes.
But my big sister will not be happy.
I'll throw you out!
No!
Help me!
"Help me, please!"
"Wong Fei-hung, that's the end of your lion."

"We've been partners before, but now I want to stay on the right side of the law."
"White Tiger, you shouldn't cause any more trouble."
We were once like brothers.
Have this to tide you over.
"Look, I've got a few students working in the opera troupe."
Go and hide there until this case blows over.
Then we'll talk again.
"You can owe anyone money, but not me, or I'll destroy you!"
I just had to.
"Now, I know all about everything."
"You know if you're found, you'll be in a terrible jam."
- I don't care.
"- Oh, sweet...."
- What are you doing away from the school?
- I'm out.
Thompson fired me.
- He what?
- That's nothing.
That's part of it.
You should know all he's done.
- Tell me.
- We had a terrible row over the food.
That's why he fired me.
The boys can't eat it.
It's worse now than ever.
They won't stand for anything more.
All they need is a spark and they're capable of anything.
"Defendant, you're charged with the murder of Johnny Stone."
He knew Johnny was sick and he put him in the cooler.
"And you knew it too, didn't you?"
"You dirty, squealing rat."
Yeah.
"And you, Thompson, you killed Skinny."
"No, no."
"No, I didn't, boys."
I didn't.
I didn't know he was so sick.
I never would have done it.
- I ain't gonna let you throw yourself--
- Mind your business.
"Oh, yes."
Of course.
How could I forget!
You looked very handsome that night.
And I remember thinking: wow... my new stepmother's about 10 minutes older than me!
"Whatever's going on, whatever trouble he's left us with,"
I'm here.
Is it that obvious?
"You're not alone, you know."
It's all so confusing.
You smell like him.
I feel like him.
"No, Adam!"
"Well, hello!"
Hi!
"Sophie, you came!"
Yeah.
"Sophia, if you see your brothers, send them my way."
"Yes, Mother."
So nice to see you.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Georgina!"
"Hey, Georgina!"

"Madame, pleased to..."
"Hey no, no."
"Dont talk to me, madam!"
Why?
- I have stolen and sold all..
..thejeweIIery of little miss.
What nonsense are you talking about?
"Hey no, I am telling the truth."
I am telling the truth.
I am a thief.
Athief!
And why are you talking to me?
You should hit me.
Hit me.
- Krishna!
"Madam, I didnt feel bad.."
..when Vicky brother slapped me.
I even endured when sister-in-Iaw Naina called me..
..a dog.. a dog that but today..
"..today when sir slapped me, it didnt hurt me here.."
"..it hurt me here, here."
"What, he slapped you?"
-Yes!
"He not only slapped me, he has.."
..so asked me to leave the house!
"Now even I wont stay here, I am going."
"And listen madam, forgive me if.."
..unknowingly I have hurt yourfeeIings.
What is this that I am hearing?
You raised your hand on Krishna?
You told him to get out of the house?
What do you think can our Krishna steal?
Even if God comes down and testifies..
It's none of your business anyway.
No.
It is not slowing anything down.
These conversations are slowing us down.
I can't believe I'm listening to this.
That was totally patronizing.
Claudia.
It's lan McKnight.
Lovely.
"I don't know why you're so fascinated with our sex life but for the record, Jane's an amazing shag."
"More to the point, we're just about done with the single."
I'm sure you'll be orgasmic when you hear it.
Let's give the telephone a rest.
Cheers.
Great.
You're a fucking diplomat.
This is it.
It's going to hell.
Fuck her.
Who cares?
We'll take it somewhere else.
-You hire a lawyer.
-That's how I want to finish.
"-What, with a lawsuit?"
-No.
With that song.
-Which song?
-The song I just played you.
-It's a ballad.
-So what?
-You want me to hand them a ballad?
-That's right.
- What took you so long?
- I needed a cigarette.
"Got a problem with that, little miss?"
- Can I have one?
- Yeah.
"- Oh, do you have any weed?"
"- No, can I have my mail?"
"- Hello, baby."
- Would you like to take Evie?
- Certainly not.
I can't afford to smell of vomit.
"- Yeah, I know, I remember."
- Maybe one of the other girls can take care of her.
- Is M free at the moment?
- Thank you.
- Um.
What did you do that for?
"- 'Cause it's not the first time a client's written me a love letter, Lily."
- Really?
Like what?
What kind of stuff do they write?
"Well, like what?"
"Roses are red, violets are blue,"
I pay you money and we fuck.
"- Yeah, pretty much."
"- Now then, Joey is it?"
- Yeah.
Katy.
Katy.
- I'm an employment officer here at the Elizabeth branch.
Do you know why Centrelink has called you in today?
- 'Cause it's my birthday?
Maybe it was.
"He could have been right, you know?"
But...
"You know, he was capable of that kind of thing too."
- At 3:00 a.m.?
"- Yeah, at 3:00 a.m."
He didn't know what time it was.
- Did you ever drink with Lou?
"- Oh, yeah."
"Oh, you should ask my first wife."
"Hello, Mr. Katz?"
This is Nathaniel Kahn returning your call.
"Yes, I would like very much to hear what you saw that night in Penn Station, New York."
What an incredible coincidence.
"Please give me a call back and let me know where I can meet you, or I'll try you again later."
Thanks.
Bye-bye.
Are you David?
"No, I'm not David, no, sorry."
I'm supposed to meet somebody right here.
... Me too a guy named Richard Katz.
What are you doing?
"Actually, this guy Richard Katz was... my dad died 26 years ago, and he was with my father in Penn Station, New York."
- Is that right?
"- Yeah, and"
I don't know the story of what happened.
So Richard Katz is coming to tell me.
- Is that great?
- I don't know if it's great.
"- It's something, anyway."
- That's... yeah.
"- Yeah, I hope he shows up."
"Lisa""s body fits perfectly next to my body when we sleep."
You hold her?
All night long.
"You never hold me like that, David."
Never.
"Right now, you""re old news."
"You""re the same face Pete""s woken up next to for 12 years."
"What""s wrong with my face?"
- Nothing.
"- Crow""s feet."
I had my eyes done when Jim went through his phase.
A little liposuction.
A little breast enlargement.
"You don""t want to pay less than $5,000, believe me, or you""ll look like it."
So I should mutilate my body to make my husband happy?
- No.
- Yes.
Women are stronger than men.
"You suck it up, Joan."
Do what you have to.
"You""re in a life-and-death fight for your family."
"You don""t have the luxury of pride."
This may come in handy.
Good luck.
"It""s the baton twirler."
"I can""t prove it yet, but your husband""s shacking up with the baton twirler."
"- It can""t be."
"She""s my friend."
"- I know, sweetie."
We met her and her husband.
- What is it?
- Danny and I... we met Shannon in Lamaze class.
"No, look!"
He's breathing.
He's so beautiful.

Sit down.
"Jeez, I'm sick."
"Toni, come here quickly."
Here.
Use this.
OK?
Shoot him if exaggerated.
Bu!
"Man, this is illegal."
"Yes it is legal, it took me the cell, not in the shack."
We can not be more legalistic.
No new evidence.
Really?
Why do not you arrest me if you have new evidence?
I like it here.
Is relaxed.
It seems to me that you are trying this trick before.
"If you think that this type of to break me,"
You've already seen it does not work.
-Yes.
What if I told you that your drug Lu Bates connected with the murder of Hastings?
"If Lu did it, arrested to me."
Do not worry.
We'll take you to the station.
Do not worry.
"Please, let me go!"
I can't stay here.
They told me to stick with him at all times!
Who?
The president of Yong Moon Plan...
I have to listen to him!
"Please, let me..."
You have to hide out somewhere that no one can find you!
"What bastard, in his right mind, stays home after stabbing a man?"
This is his house.
Stay here until things quiet down.
You...
- You can't call my mom.
- I don't even know her number.
I only stabbed him once...
Only once.
Do you think he died?
"What do I do now, Han Gyul?"
"Hey, how long will he be here?"
Suck it up...
You little...
Your phone.
You better never record me again.
Your voice recorder.
I gave that to the police at the station...
"Oh, is this it?"
The three million won you owe me?
Yes.
"Since you paid me back, aren't we done talking?"
Representative...
I'm a little scared.
Of what?
-Wait.
These are the guys I told you about.
"Theywere captured bythe Germans, and nowtheywant back to the Red Army."
-As we've agreed.
-And we didn't come back empty-handed.
We've released comrade captain from the Germans.
Comrade captain!
Comrade captain!
Get yourthings together.
-Where is the girl?
- Overthere.
"- Let's go with us, Marek!"
"- No, I'll stay behind."
- Somebody has to pouryou some vodka after all that.
"- OK, everybodyto the truck."
Hurry up!
Come on!
Go!
"Folks, may be we should leave the house intact, eh?"
Are these two Vlasov soldiers captured by our scouts here?
"Yes, they are."
- Have you terminated them already?
"- No, I haven't."
I return the favor.
They've brought me back.
Howwas it to be a prisonerwith the Germans?
"OK, let's make a deal while I'm kind."
These two boys are to be handed overto Malyutin.
- l do not have the right to do that!
-What?
And are you still croaking about rights!
- Not me.
Freddie's got a brother from Oxford.
They want another girl to make it a quartet.
He's a bit of all right too.
And we're going to the Empire.
- The Empire?
- Yes.
"Oh, it's ever so gay there, lvy and the show is grand."
It's just where all the toffs go.
"- No, I don't think so, Marcia."
- Why not?
I just don't feel like it.
That's all.
"You ain't afraid to go, are you?"
Afraid?
- Why should I be afraid?
"- Oh, I don't know."
I just thought...
"Well, I ain't afraid of nobody."
"But you ain't been out for ever so long, have you?"
"- No, but..."
"- He ain't your lord and master, is he?"
I should say he ain't.
Or is it because you ain't got a nice enough dress?
Of course I have.
"What are you standing there for, then?"
Go and put it on.
All right.
What's that across your back?
What?
There's nothing.
Did he do that to you?
- Let me see.
She did work for me.
"I've, uh, got some paperwork in the car we need to fill out."
"Uh, sorry."
Nonsense.
I'm only sorry we had to do this at all.
Yeah.
"[ Lyle ] Be right with you, sir."
"Melvin, why were you contradicting Mr. Truesdale?"
"Well, it seems like the girl meant a lot more to his son than he wanted to let on."
The man was embarrassed.
Of what?
Of Greg's weak stomach.
"Melvin, if it wasn't for Mr. Truesdale, you wouldn't be coroner."
I'd remember that.
[ Woman ] That was her mother's.
It's the only thing she had left of her family.
They all died in the war.
Her father in North Africa... and her mother and her brothers in the firebombing of Dresden.
"Oh, Hillie."
Why?
After surviving all of that?
Why?
She was my friend.
I should have known.
I should have... stopped her.
Friends always feel that way when someone close to them dies.
Those are Hillie's.
I have to get them cleaned.
"No, no."
It's okay.
"No, I have to."
Hillie's clothes were always perfect.
Only they want him alive.
They don't want him dead.
"You see, before Saul retired from the Masada Team, he was a deputy commander and he knows operating procedures, he knows names, lists."
They will keep him alive at least for a while.
- It's all right. it's OK.
- 'Dr Sigapelli to cardiology.'
"Lena, we're going to have to tell the police."
- No.
No.
- Lena.
No.
Saul knew we were being watched.
Our people are coming.
They will take care of this.
There is nothing for the police to do but stand in their way.
Please.
"Please, Tom, trust me."
Please.
I have been through this before.
Please.
Please.
"'Dr Haywood, you're wanted in paediatrics."
Dr Haywood to paediatrics.'
"Lena, look, you asked me to trust you."
"- You're gonna have to trust me, OK?"
- OK.
"Feeling calmer, Lena?"
"'Janet Clark, please report to maternity.'"
"Mr Magnum, did you find out why they kidnapped her husband?"
- They must be meshugina.
- What?
That's Yiddish for crazy.
Or through the rear window if you're brave enough to turn round.
It's so big!
We've passed the single tree.
And loads of others.
Two more up there. lt's beautiful!
I said we're reaching two single trees.
It would help if we could ask someone.
"Don't worry, we'll find someone."
We can ask them.
Slow down a bit.
- We may not find anyone.
- We will.
"This is farmland, they're out working."
We have to ask.
"Don't worry, we'll find someone."
I can see a black spot in the distance.
Over there.
He can't hear us.
"Wait, I'll go and ask him."
Ask that one.
Ask her.
"Hello, ma'am."
"Hello, I'm honoured."
How do we get to Siah Dareh?
"200 yards after the junction, turn left."
Thank you.
Good-bye.
"Look, it's behind the hill."
Wait till we pass that tree.
Look into the distance.
On the hill.
- Siah Dareh's over there?
"--Oh, that's what it's about!"
"Grandpa, you accidentally forgot that you gifted this junk to your grandaughter for her birthday"
"So if you're missing your music, please buy yourself a new one"
And do check that all your forks are still in place!
Why do you need that casette player?
--What for?
"--Yeah, what for?"
--In order to record how you snore --Who?
Me?
!
Enough.
I endured it for 30 years.
"Now, enough."
--I snore?
!
"--Enough, Ira dear."
"--If I were you, I wouldn't touch this topic."
--The lowliest dog has a right to mercy.
Tell me why you all hate me.
--For what?
--Who ?
Who hates you?
What are you talking about?
I've always given you my money to the last penny.
I never cheated on you.
I devoted my whole life to you people
"--Pavel, what are you...?"
--Don't!
Just don't say that I am old and bald
--When did I ever say that?
--...that you are ashamed to be seen with me.
I am only human.
- Would you use it?
Of course.
If necessary.
Jo asked me to say good night to Daddy for him.
He loves you very much.
I love him.
"But, darling, you don't show it."
You never tell him.
You never hold him.
Don't be afraid now that he's growing up.
Afraid of what?
What the hell have I got to be afraid of?
"I'm going to go for walks with him, aren't I?"
And swim with him and play football with him.
- David...
"- I want him to be proud of me, don't I?"
"To grow up like his father, a legless fucking joke."
I suppose you and your mother had a lovely time discussing me.
She's very concerned about you.
I don't need anyone's concern.
I can manage alone.
I can't.
"David, I need you."
- I love you.
- Don't.
"Please, don't."
I want to sleep.
"For God's sake, let me sleep."
Thank you.
You haven't let this room to anybody since the death of Mrs Garden?
"No, sir."
Not since Billy Parkin lived here.
Let me go!
You swine!
I'll give it to you right in the face!

You know how Franz lost his arm?
He wouldn't obey either!
So I grabbed him just like this and pushed him out of the car!

What's the matter?
Where's Mieze?
I heard her yelling.
She's not yelling anymore.
Let's go!
NO SHORT SWIM TRUNKS ALLOWED
Mieze's run away.
What can I do?
She left her clothes and everything behind.
- Did you hit her?
- Yeah.
What's she doing with a louse like me?
It was just the one time.
One time or ten ― it's the same thing.
I know who she ran off with.
- Who?
- A guy she knew before.
Do you still have the photographs?
"Yeah, I have everything inside."
"Stuart, can you go grab my negatives for me?"
Copy that.
"Be right back, billy."
What are you hoping to find?
We're trying to clear a good man's name.

"Eric, go back."
Go back.

"Evidence marker number four, eric."
"Number four, that's the cuff link."
That's the missing evidence.

"With her drinking, how am I going to control myself?"
I'll get you one right away!
Wonderful!
She'll sure get drunk!
is this my heart beat or yours?
Or are our hearts beating as one?
Someone's knocking at the door!
Never mind him!
Answer the door!
How can I leave you alone?
Go and answer the door first!
"OK, stay where you are and reserve a place for me."

This is the fee for 3 months.
Don't you ever bother me again.
But you haven't paid for 6 months.
Can't you just take this first?
Nobody's going to disturb us now.
You take a shower first!
Good idea.

I'm taking my shower.
"Bridget, I'll be real quick."
I mean I'll be quick at taking my shower!

"Wal, you're living in a bubble."
"Mate, those seats are gone."

And I don't mean that in a nice way.
That's the status quo.
We're not married.
Every year they hold the State party conference in a different place.
That's usually a lot of fun for the wives.
"You know, my Joe's got his eye on your David."
Why?
Is he gay?
"Oh, I don't know what he is sexually."
I'm just married to him.

"Wendy, Wendy, stop yelling."
Thank you.
"Listen, Wendy!"
Just don't speak to John Bartrop.
Do not speak to him.
"There's no point in speaking to Bartrop, OK?"
Leave the school out of it.
I'll talk to Fuzz.
Leave it to me.
I'll talk to him and Mrs Robinson.
Yeah.
Who's John Bartrop?
"A puff of air in a mohair cardigan, and my new name of choice for telemarketers and Mormons."
Right.
Bang!
"The first cut gets him there, and then he's down, he's dead."
"And then bang, bang, bang, three symmetrical wounds there."
And then...
- horrible!
Who's this?
"- My father, rest his soul."
They've done fireworks for generations.
Mattia does them too.
That's why the explosives...
He's tops.
And this is forthe curtains.
And I thought...
But I'm a little sorry that you're not sleeping at my house.
Who'II steal yourwaIIet now?
I don't know how to thank you.
- How much?
- What are you doin'?
- We did it in friendship.
- We don't even know each other!
We'II learn to.
I owe you one.
The curtains will come later.
There's the sea!
I hadn't realized.
"One of these evenings I'II invite you to dinner at the sea, to thank you."
"Okay, this evening."
- But you're our guest.
"- I can't, my back..."
"Why, you eat with yourback?"
"Whitebait omeIet, cianfotta, cecata soup and soppressata."
"Stuffed anchovies, fusiIIi with meat sauce and white CiIentan figs."
- What?
- You have to taste everything.
Why just taste?
Let's eat it all!
- talking about?
"- Your date, Audrey?"
She got a visit from your wife.
Grace cancelled her.
Grace did?
You had no idea?
Do you know how this impacts my business?
Audrey Richardson?
She's one of my most important clients.
"Well, if Grace thought it was a bad idea, then I'm fine with that."
I'll find Audrey someone else.

With all the sexual role-play that implies.
I like it.
I like it a lot.
"That was inspired, Neil."
Clara is right.
Mum's used to speak badly of you.
But I always defend you.
Don't do it.
It's useless.
-But it upsets me.
"If I'd say bad things about mom, would you defend her as well?"
I've never heard you dissing her.
Well I can do it.
Mom is so selfish.
She just wants everybody saying good things to her.
Everybody like that.
"Yeah, but maybe there's someone thinking different."
Clara demands everything and she's right.
Mom says you're a looser.
To whom?
I heard.
She said that so you'd listen to it.
-No.
But I'm sure she knew I was listening.
With whom were she talking to?
Could you guess?
I met a woman once...
-Aren't you interested in what mom said anymore?
"Once, I met a woman who told me to write down 7 numbers."
-And she told you each number slowly without failing.
And all the numbers were odds.
"Well then, with whom were she talking to?"
To Juan.
Juan?
Clara is dating Juan?
You're never aware of anything.
- What is it?
- It's people seen from above.
From the sky.
"See, these are people walking."
That's a person lying down.
And that's a person standing up next to a person lying down.

It's not a regular thing.
Last week I had to leave early one day-
Why did you have to leave early?
Is everything okay?
"Honey, go back to bed."
Was it the boys?
No.
Jesus!
"I have a personal life, you know."
"Oh, okay."
So I'll take them for longer next week.
"But you have'em this whole week... because Dave and I are going to the coast until Saturday, okay?"
But also continuously.
Martin?
-I'd like to say something.
-Yes.
"If it goes on like this, it will come to an end."
-Yes.
-I mean yesterday.
Yes.
Why did you let that idiot be with you?
We could have had a nice evening.
-Yes.
-Who are you constantly calling?
-Are you even listening to me?
-No.
I mean yes.

What do you have your guinea-pigs for?

And some are unbreakable.

And hang up when I'm speaking with you!
"No, I can't stand it."
When will this misery end?

Some things can open normally.
And some can't open at all.
But they can.
We must close the opening so that something else won't fly away.
-Some things play.
-And some things don't play.

"No, thank you, I just wanted to explain my position."
"Oh, nothing to explain."

"Well, you know mothers."

Great.

"Is that OK with you, Fiona?"
"Oh, you're not staying?"
"Finnegan, would you mind grabbing my purse?"
I think I left it in the car.

"- Whoa, baby!"
- What are we celebrating?
We're celebrating that we've been living together for a month.
Almost.
OK...
To being flatmates for a month.
- Almost.
"- Sit down, please."
"So, what are we having, then?"
- Having?
- Dinner?
In the oven!
Did you like what you just saw?
Yes.
You're a very attractive woman.
But I think we should just keep it as flatmates.
Having a good time doesn't have to change anything.
"You have needs, and I have needs."
What would be more sensible than to try and fulfil those needs   in the comfort of our own home?

"Camilla, I don't..."
Just relax.
- Camilla...

But how is it that Wayne McNut is your type?
"I mean, you're married to a man who's barely a buck -- wet."
What can I say?
Sometimes it's nice to feel a little give.
Oh.
"Yeah, I get that -- a little extra cushion for the, uh..."
Help me understand something.
"If you loved Wayne, why did you put a curse on him?"
It wasn't a curse.
Putsi bags are also used for blessings.
I wanted Wayne to win.

"Plan was, take the prize money, get a quickie divorce, and then tie the knot in Orlando."
"Wayne used to call me his ""Princess Jasmine."""

"But if he's a god, that shouldn't be a problem, should it?"
"He's a fickle and incredibly fearsome god, you see."
A fearsome god?
"He governs over the destruction in the universe, and... destroys planets and lifeforms at the slightest peeve."
And you have a son...
But I'm your wife forever.
"So, when you die.."
The house is for me.
"If not, why would I last this long."
It's better to leave her rest.
-I'm not tired!
Why did you leave the house and came here?
Do you want me to take you home?
-What are you saying?
That would kill her!
Máximo can't be good to me!
Yes..
Take me to my house!
"When you recover, you'll can come back."
"Now, you have to be strong."
-I don't want to be strong.
And you better realize this:
I don't have anything to thank you or your parents for.
It's better to leave her rest.
I was leaving...
-She can't be moved from here!
I suppose...
-She's perfectly fine!
- Máximo!
Come closer to the window.
Have a look.
They say breads are falling again.
Watch out!
Working conflicts.
Pensioner's home.
"Yes, put it through."
"- So, what happens to her?"
- I was just gonna ask that.
- She probably dies.
"- Now, that's cool."
"- No, that's depressing."
"- Oh, I give up."
Excuse me.
- (quietly):
What's going on?
"- Christy, I can't do this."
You should just take her home with you.
No.
I already have a daughter I screwed up.
This one's yours.
But it's so awkward.
I have nothing in common with her.
So what?
"She needs a home, she doesn't need a buddy."
"I know, but I really want her to like me."
Then you shouldn't have signed up to be a mom.
"Hey, how about, how about you and Bonnie come live here and help me with her?"
We might have to take you up on that.
Let's see how the banana bread goes.
"Oh, great."
Now I don't know what you're talking about.
"Christy, this was a mistake."
"When people don't like me at first, they never like me."
I don't have a chance with her.
That's not true.
I didn't like you at first.
You didn't?
Nope.
"Now he can not, he wants not, he knows not."
Thanks.
I'll do it.
Here comes the soup for my first broken Venom.
"Mickey's a mover and a shaker, but this mean Matalan, he's angling for..."
"If this is still a man, he wouldn't take it, lying down!"
It's manhood at question now.
Man's ugly business.
"Honor, power..."
Gonna start moaning?
Was my mom moaning?
Me?
I faked the screams!
"A spoonful, my love?"
"Love is a miracle, you want to see a miracle?"
I'm just following your laws.
You really are the puppet they made out of you.
Fucked by a grenade.
"You can't fuck over, or even just fuck!"
Anyone!
Anyone!
Go away!
Can't you understand?
I'll come!
"I'll come, I swear!"
Shall I decorate with his brains too?
I'm not ashamed.
I'm not ashamed.
It's not my fault.
It's mine.
Idiot.
So you're in?
How is that different from what I was doing?
And I don't think you need to introduce the writers to the tour group.
I agree.
"I thought they would find it interesting, but they really did not."
"Well, Kenneth, just respect their privacy."
"I promise I'll do better, Mr. Hornberger."
I'm sure you will.
I just...
I just love television so much.
We all do.
"Liz, they want you and Pete on the 50th floor."
"Who, Gary?"
"All right, tell him I'll be up in half an hour."
"No, they said now."
"If they've got cookies up there, grab some."
"Ooh, and get them to pay for my samovar."
Of course.
I assume that's what we're meeting about.
What about Ray Romano?
Can you do Ray?
"[lmitating Ray Romano] Hey, aah, ho, Debra."
There you go.
My brother's tall!
[Normal voice] Right?
Are we in trouble or something?
No way.
Gary loves the show.
Pleased with the ratings.
"Right, of course."
They love us.
Where's Gary?
Gary's dead.
"I need to go back to Abnegation, maybe."
Sort out what our parents left behind.
At least I'd be useful there.
"Caleb, there's nothing left at Abnegation."
Yeah.
You Okay?
Just need to get to Candor.
Tris.
"I know you think Caleb is your responsibility, but he made his own choice."
You can't protect everyone.
(CHUCKLES)
I can't protect anyone.
Nobody can.
Him leaving isn't your fault.
None of this is your fault.

Johanna was right.
You have to forgive yourself.
Thank you.

That's 13 miles over the speed limit.
Thirteen miles.
Do you know that?
"Yeah, all right."
Just keep it under 55.
And consider yourself warned and advised.
Boy.
Why am I such a nice guy?
Now you stay by the window and watch.
Every move is a picture.
"Now, go on by the window."
Is she still out there?
"What ""Uh-oh""?"
Is she with another guy?
What's he doing here?
I don't know.
Maybe he heard about Melinda.
"If he's here, it means we're in trouble."
But what did we do?
Which one?
The one with the red lid.
It's just soy sauce.
Bring it over.
"What, are you deaf?"
"Out of the way, come on."
Stand back.
What is that?
I'll be fucked...
It's a real wicked spirit we've got here.
"You don't want to leave, do you?"
Let's go!
Stop it!
Hyo-jin!
"Come here, you!"
You met up with something recently you weren't supposed to?
I don't follow you.
Did you disturb someone?
"Of all the evil I've seen, this is the strongest."
You disturbed it.
"Oh, God!"
What do we do now?
Who is it?
Who did you disturb?
Tell him.
A Japanese man...
I knew it.
That's no man.
That's a ghost.
All the things happening around here are his doing.
"If nothing is done, it's not just your daughter, but everything that walks on two feet will perish."

"I wanted to free myself, but I was gagged, and they pierced my arm with something sharp."
I lost consciousness.
"I wanted to scream, move, but I was powerless."
I sank.
"But who are you, sir?"
The Commissioner eighteenth borough.
"When you were attacked, you were alone?"
I've been in a lot of scrapes.
What about that one?
That was teenage experiment.
Wanted to see if I could take the pain.
And could you?
Comfortably.
We're gonna do some balloons.
I've got a better idea.
Truth or Dare?
Dare.
Any suggestions?
I think we need to sex this party up a bit.
"- What do you think, boys?"
- Yes.
I can do sexy.
Eleanor...
"I dare you... to give Gemma... a long... hot, wet kiss on the mouth."
- Tongues?
- Absolutely.
"Excuse me, do I get a say in this?"
"- No, no, no, no, no..."
"- Rules of the game, babe."
"Oh, yeah, I've still got it."
And I hope you're not expecting me and Chris to do that.
We don't need any of that queer shit.
"Yeah, that-that-that's what I'm saying."
I get enough of that in the army.
"Okay, stop being weird and spin the bloody bottle."
"Truth or Dare, Gemma?"
Um...
"I don't know, truth."
Will you take me back?
Better come with me.
Did everything go alright?
Not now.
"Hi, Kelly."
"My regular, Willy."

Yeah.
Can I buy you a drink?
I got one.
"Hi, buddy, what'll you have?"
"This is for hers, and I'll have a cognac."
Thanks.
You just get off the boat?
"Yes, how did you know?"
It shows all over.
Where are you from?
France.
Hm... where did you learn to speak English so good?
I studied at a great school in Oxford.
Oxford...
I oughta go there.
They'd be more likely to study you there.
Are you being insulting?
"No, I just meant that you'd make a fascinating course in anatomy."
Thanks.
How come you just get off the boat and head straight for a bar?
Looking for company.
"Hm, what sort of company?"
Your sort.
How do you know what my sort is?
"Well, you're not a school teacher."
"Yeah, I'm--I'm buying all the hot dogs."
"Oh, come on, lady."
And I'm giving them to the good people.

Kicking it down the street
Causin' a stir.

Who's hot and you know that she knows it.

We head for Rochefort and the blockade squadron.
Sails on starboard bow!
That's the squadron.
"Deck, there!"
Flagship on the starboard bow!
- Strike topsail!
"- Lively, there!"
Stand by to drop anchor!
Wagstaffe?
Get your signals party ready.
Wait here.
You're mad!
You're all out of your minds!
- Dealing with an admiral?
- Jackson's an honest man.
He'll listen to us.
He'll agree until we surrender.
- Then he'll hang us.
- He won't.
I served under him in '89...
You'll see.
Mr. Crawford.
Vizard?
- Which of us goes to the flagship?
- None of us.
Why risk being clapped in irons?
I'll make them come to us.
Let go of the anchor!
Boat ahoy!
- Flagship!
"- Both your oars, up!"
Sergeant.
"Hey, man."
Yeah?
So Caroline tells me you've been on your own the past two weeks.
Is everything okay?
You're asking me about my mom?
Seriously?
Why don't I have her give you a call when she blows through?
Dude.
"That's not what I meant, okay?"
I'm just trying to...
- I don't know what to say.
- Good.
"Don't say anything, because you're a dick, end of story."
I know.
"Yeah, whatever."
BONNIE:
"Hey, thanks for meeting me."
- I wanted you to see this.
- Is that Emily's spell book?
I've been going through it since Grams died.
Check this out.
- That's the vampire compass.
- Yeah.
"According to Emily, Johnathan Gilbert never succeeded in inventing anything."
Emily secretly spelled them all with magic.
Compass.
Rings.
The mystery device you told me about.
ELENA:
"Yeah, that's it."
"Well, part of it."
Damon only has the one piece.
Worse than you?
You don't say anything but I hear it.
Go away.
"You can't do it, I'll deal with him myself."
Here he comes.
You are...?
Don't you know me?
How can I not know you?
What's this?
You don't know me but you know her?
You stop.
"We are friends, right?"
- You come with me.
- Where to?
Dicky?
What's this dicky?
Not only at night he's different in day time also.
Actually we are not friends but lovers.
Are we lovers?
I don't believe it.
You must believe it.
How can I?
Was I such a violent guy?
- Remember it?
- Remember it?
How can he remember past with just one scene?
Continue it.
It happened like this then...
When?
"Did you think I forgot everything, right?"
I remember everything.
"What do you remember, sunny?"
"- Boys, boys."
"Boys, stop."
It's the truth.
I swear Patsy's telling you the truth.
"I'm willing to take my chances, see this thing through."
We're in the same boat.
I'm not leaving here until they come and take me.
"If there's quitting to be done, you're gonna do it."
Don't be chumps.
Don't let them pin anymore on you.
We've got a rap to beat.
The way to start beating it is by putting out that fire.
"Now, what do you say?"
Do we do it?
"Jim, Butch, Mac, do we do it?"
"Casey, what do you say?"
"- Okay, come on."
- Come on.
Come on--
"- So that's it, eh, Charlie?"
"- Yes, sir."
"All right, boys, you can go."
There's no doubt that this tragedy was Thompson's own fault.
"- You agree, coroner?"
- The sheriff and I both agree.
"Mr. Gargan, I owe you a sincere apology."
"Oh, forget it."
"Hey, wait a minute."
They can't do nothing to him.
The guy's gonna be okay.
"Besides, he pulled a gun on Patsy."
- Shut up.
"I don't know, kid."
I'm too old for you.
I'm 31.
How old are you?
Almost 17.
"Means when I'm 21, you'll be almost 36."
That ain't so bad.
"- Edgar, I have to pee."
- God!
"How are you back there, Tillie?"
"- Hey, I'm pulling."
You talk.
- It hurts too much.
You talk.
It's hard for me.
I haven't had a lot of practice at it.
"When I was a kid up in Michigan, we'd go hunting."
For three days we'd not say ten words to each other.
Everybody just does what has to be done.
- Never told you about my first instructor.
- No.
His name's Sloaniger.
"God, he could talk."
"He'd yell at me, scare me to death."
"I was all thumbs for a while, the way you are."
"Dammit, he stuck with me."
"You know, he finally sent me off soloing."
I cried.
It's true.
"Before, I never felt I belonged anywhere and my parents didn't bother with me."
I kinda grew up all over the place.
That day I was up there by myself and I was just... weaving through clouds and...
"I saw the line of people waiting for the ""Haunted Montecito Tour."""
You want the suite back?
You give me twice what I paid.
Twice?
I'll tell you what I'll give you twice of...
- Ed.
- What?
Can I speak with you for a moment?
Excuse us.
What is it?
It's worth it.
Monica.
"You know even dead, that bitch is givin' me a headache."
"I don't know what you want, but don't you try any of that reverse psychology stuff on me again."
It won't work.
"You hear me, Sam?"
Will not work.
Relax.
I have a simple question for you.
"Oh, a simple question?"
"What's this, reverse reverse psychology?"
"[Laughs] Touché, Ms. Marquez."
Touché.
"Okay, l-I have no idea what you're talking about."
"Oh, playing the innocent."
Very clever.
You okay?
"This ghost stuff is getting to you, isn't it?"
Maybe a little.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
"Anyway, what's the question?"
"No, he wasn't there."
He really was a bus driver.
It looks like he got sick and quit about a week ago.
And what is he doing now?
I don't know.
"If he's sick, where could he have gone?"
You look sick too.
You should go home and get some rest.
I'll take you.
"I'm not going to go home, I'm going to see my mother."
"Well, I'll take you there."
Pull yourself together.
Let's go.
No one's here.
Woman Come in.
Where's my mother?
She just stepped out.
Is she going home?
"She did say that she'd be going home, yes."
This is a nice studio.
It has your mother's mark on it.
When did I last see her dance?
Hmm...
It must have been just as the Pacific War was starting.
That's right.
"When the war got worse, she stopped dancing in public."
She was dancing with Kayama-sensei.
Your mother's dancing was beautiful!
"You've danced with Kayama-san, too haven't you."
"Yes, many times."
He took me to many ballet performances.
"You can't forget Kayama-sensei, can you?"
Hey...
"I'll pay these guys back, I'll be back here"
"- in an hour, tops."
- Griffin...
"I'll come back here Sandy, we'll call Dad."
We will work this out as a family OK?
I promise you.
"Hey, it's Griff."
You know the drill.
"Hey, Griffin."
"It's me, your father."
I just want you to know that I love you.
And that we all make mistakes.
"You're responsible for your actions, I'm not saying you're not, but"
I want you to know that you're not alone; you have me and your sisters and even your mom.
I got you your job back.
I know it's not...
"It's not the best, but you know, maybe you're doing some good there and we're there for you, and... um, you can..."
"So just call me OK, just call me please."
"Would you do that, please?"
"And you're not alone, Griffin."
You're not alone.
- Long night?
- Yup.
- We should sleep.
Talk later.
- No.
Talk now.
OK.

"- Yes, Your Majesty?"
- Sebastian.
I'm concerned about Ariel.
Have you noticed she's been acting peculiar lately?
- Oh!
"Uh, peculiar?"
I'll come back.
Are you staying?
You haven't seen my colleagues?
No.
Madam.
You left the baby!
I went to fetch you some milk.
You haven't seen my colleagues?
No. I only saw them this morning.
This morning.
And this afternoon?
- Did they have the gear?
"- No, they had nothing."
I've prescribed her some pills.
Give them to her to ease the pain.
We don't have a car to get to the chemist's.
Give her medicine.
There's none left.
What's the matter?
It's her prescription.
Whose?
The invalid's.
The old woman?
I'll fetch it.
Can you drop me off?
"Yes, of course."
Good-bye.
Drive safely.
I'm like a general without an army.
Where do you want to go?
I'm going to the hospital.
Are you worried about your car or about the victim?

"You weren't thinking of leaving, were you, Diane?"
Not with two years left on your contract.
"You can't hold her, Jessie."
"Think not, kiddo."
"Of course, if you want to buy her contract, it's worth at least 20 grand."
"But I like you, Bobby."
I'll let you have her for 1 5.
You haven't got 1 5?
That's too bad. [ Chuckles ]
"Well, I suppose I'm just gonna have to keep her."
"Well, of course you can visit Diane... for a more reasonable fee anytime she isn't occupied."

"- That's up to you, Bobby."
"Bobby, no."
Get in the car.

"The disputed islands lie here, off the coast of Argentina."

This is my pride and joy.
I've had hidden cameras planted in every home in Springfield.
"I got the idea from that movie, Sliver."
What a delightful romp.

Are you talking to me?
"- Yes, but..."
As soon as we arrive...
The Prime Minister will never accept her
First hear him ask him.
"Yes, but the Prime Minister..."
I hear things... \ It's strange.
This experience is like...
Like a gift.
"Here, among the people."
"I understand, sire."
"They're so welcoming and open, and..."
Here people do not have much.
Here people do not have much.
But I'm still...
That must be the Serbian border.
Let me do this this time.
Sire?
"You will not want the protocol to waste time, right?"
"No protocol, Ludovic."
"Carlos, take the camera."
Hello.
"- Passports, please."
Good morning.
Do the Serbian phones work?
- No phones.
How come the welcome concert?
- It is the Serbia In Ball dance campaign.
The state wants us to give a positive image of Serbia to foreigners.
Go for a walk.
You have a familiar look.
It looks like Miss Serbia 2005.

"- [Both cackle] - [Ursula] Nice work, boys."
That was a close one.
Too close.
That was a close one.
Too close.
The little tramp!
"Ah, she's better than I thought."
"Well, at this rate, he'll be kissing her by sunset for sure."
"Well, it's time Ursula took matters into her own tentacles."
Triton's daughter will be mine!

- What?
"Shoes, 300 quid, come on."

Hop on.
"Right, here we go."
So...
How've you been?
Good.
"Great, actually."
- You?
- Okay.
Course has definitely been an eye-opener
Really?
"Yeah, you meet all these different kinds of people."
"I mean, most of 'em work their arses off to get what we just take for granted."
Makes you realise you're not quite as special as you once thought.
"Bloody hell, Chris, that was bordering on self-deprecation."
Is it working?
"You haven't changed at all, have you?"
- What's the matter?
- Not funny...
Great.
Hi.
- Yes.
Mr. Seymour!
Mr. Seymour.
Yeah?
You told me that Danny watched the game tonight?
Yeah.
I took two bucks off him.
[Chuckles]
"- Well, it was just a little bet."
"- Now, he watched it, just didn't listen to it on the radio?"
"No, he watched it on TV all night."
"As a matter of fact, Jones made a great catch."
We had an argument about whether it was over the fence or not.
"Yeah, he saw it."
No doubt about that.
"If Zucco was watching the game on TV, there's no way he could've been on that train to Rockville Center."

I don't see why I should have to pay for my food.
"Listen, dickhead-no money, no food."
Ah.
Ooh.
You're the sort of girl I could fall in love with.
"However, no time, because Richie?"
- Yes?
- Run!
- I meant through the door.
"- Oh, sorry."
I thought they'd never give up.
Mr Forsyth had some stamina.
Safe and sound now and time to get on with my wonderful dinner party.
That's what you think.
But I have been thinking.
So you didn't do anything to those women?
No.
Then where did you go every night?
- My part time job.
- Job?
Part-time?
So you bought meat with that money?
Yeah!
So why did you bring that dog here?
It's only skin and bones.
Not even worthy to eat.
Big trouble!
Big trouble!
Come out!
Your daughter and Mr. Hong...
Mr. Hong kidnapped your daughter!
Come out!

I came here to take the plates back.
Hold on tight!

Hey!
Stop the car!
Get closer!
"This motorcycle is so slow, what's wrong with it?"
Pull me up!
That damn bastard!
Is everyone still on?
"Dad, over there!"
I wasn't planning on killing you.
But you're just like the other bitches.
All hookers like you playing with all kinds of men have to die.
You know I got to go do this thing.
Where are my keys?
Over there.
It's a mess. lt's like a pig pen.
"What do you think I got you the dishwasher for, huh?"
I hate doin' the dishes...
Fucks with my nails.
You gotta be smart.
Look at all this powder around here.
It's enough to put us away forever.

Loosen up.
What are you doing?
You don't have to go anywhere.
Make them wait.
Nobody knows for sure just how much was taken in the daring pre-dawn raid at the Lufthansa cargo terminal at Kennedy Airport.
"The FBI says $2,000,000, Port Authority Police say $4,000,000."
"The city park says $5,000,000"
Those son-of-a-bitches!

It looks like a big one.
Maybe the biggest this town has ever seen.
"Come here, you!"
Come here!
Look at this genius.
This genius!
"Merry Christmas, Jimmy!"
-Who's this?
-That's my wife.
"Come here. I want to show you something, Jimmy."

Sorry.

"Illegal missions unsanctioned by the UN, that's why it's all hush-hush."

You go ahead.
I need another minute.
That's weird.
Whoa... ahh!
Ugh!
They're after the president!
"You're too late, Nuktuk."
"Soon, my doomsday device will shoot this block of ice into the earth's core, freezing the entire planet."
And I will be the ruler of ice earth!
I don't think so.
I don't think so!
Huh!
Ha!
"Mr. President, get back!"
I'm here to help.
Looks like there's nowhere to go.
Uhh!
Secure the president and call for backup immediately!
"Nuktuk, look out!"
"Bolin, look out!"
Hyah!
This is unbelievable!
Hang on.
Let me close the restaurant.
He is here.
Take it.
Thank you very much.
I'll leave.
Shall I drop you somewhere?
Thanks.

"- What side of the street does he live on, huh?"
North or south?
"North or south, huh?"
"I don't know what you're talking about, man."
I don't know—
I'm asking you what side of the street he lives on!
"Hey, shithead, when was the last time you picked your feet, huh?"
"- Man, what's he talkin' about?"
- I've got a man in Poughkeepsie wants to talk to you.
You ever been to Poughkeepsie?
Huh?
- Have you ever been to Poughkeepsie?
"- Hey, man, give me a break."
- I don't know what you're talking about.
"- Come on, say it."
Let me hear you say it.
Have you ever been to Poughkeepsie?
"You've been to Poughkeepsie, haven't you?"
- I wanna hear it!
Come on!
- Yes.
"Yes, I-"
"- You've been there, right?"
- Yeah.
Yeah.
"You sat on the edge of the bed, didn't you?"
"You took off your shoes, put your finger in between your toes and picked your feet."
- He is no criminal!
"- So, he's starting to act like that again?"
"Not him, me!"
You darling?
Ah well.
Kiss me!
Kiss!
What a fine girl you are.
Just how I like it.
He's hanging around with scum like you!
Shame on you!
"Yeah, I'm ashamed of myself!"
- Let me go!
I can't breathe!
"- Feel free, there is plenty of air!"
You think you can just run away and ashame me in front of my friends later tonight?
"Reinhold said Kiss me, follow my order!"
Let me go!
I'll take anything I can find and throw it in your face!
You know how Franz lost his arm?
"He behaved just like you, unwilling to comply with my rules!"
So I grabbed him like this and threw him outta the car!
Killer!

You just killed a good man...
And my legs hurt.

Not every one.
"""Twin Tree""?"
That one went off 20 years ago.
- How many people went with it?
- Not a soul hurt.
- You're lying.
- Okay.
"I planted that mine on mount Sutro,right on the trail everyone took to the top."
No.That land was already sold to the state when you planted your mine.
No one's taken that trail in 50 years.
Hauser.
But thanks for telling me where to dig.
So have you found the twin tree?
It's you.
- You're here.
Can you not read Korean?
My name probably appeared on the phone.
It only said 'dog' and 'bird' (wordplay for son of a b*itch).
'Dog' and 'bird'?
Son of a b*tch?
"Anyways, Eul cannot take the call right now, so call later."
"If the person calling right now happens to be Sin Joon Young,"
I don't think there will be a need for you to call back.
"- Not too long ago, she got fired from your documentary project."
- Who are you?
Who are you to tell me what to do?
Ah
- Haha...
Do you happen to be her husband?
Oh!
My phone.
Are you Eul's husband?
Hello?
Why aren't you replying?
Are you Eul's husband?
Why are you picking up my calls?
Hello?

No.

"Oh, I'm so stupid."

"Hi, Special Agent Henson, FBI."
Thank you for coming.
We're grateful for the warning.
"Well, you should know that our people will be at the rally regardless, looking for the individual planning the attempt."
"Once word gets out Mr. Dellaman won't be attending the rally,"
I'm sure she'll be long gone.
"I hope that won't be the case, but unfortunately, you may be right."
Have a good day.

Hey.
Are you okay?
What?
The girl was only after the papers.
Sondra?
The papers are gone.
She took the papers?
I tried calling her.
The line's disconnected.
I even went to the coffee shop.
Turns out she doesn't even work there.
She totally faked me out.
I don't believe this.
"How could you let this happen, Jerry?"
This is just fine.
Thank you very much.
No.
Thank you very much.
You've made me very happy.
"Very, very happy."

Didn't I tell you that I'd absolutely fix it?
How about that?

Awed by the color it did yield
A never-ending fascination
For the crimson color
Of the rose standing in the field
Bravo!
You sound like angels.
This was amazing.
Is this Uncle's room?
This is your bed.
"Oh, my God."
Okay?
Okay.
Not bad!
Yeah.
"You know, I'm glad you changed your mind."
"Oh, yeah, I'd much rather be in here than out there."
"I know, you can room with my brother."
He's just about your age.
"Oh, won't that be a lot of fun."
"Bob, will you take him over to my house?"
I'll join you later.
"You know, there are 200 girls waiting to meet you."
"Oh, and I just can't wait to meet them."
"Come on, Wilbur."
He's a remarkable boy.
GIRL:
"Come on, hurry!"
Come on.
"Oh, get it!"
"No, no!"
"Catch, Uncle Bob."
"Wilbur, come here."
(STUTTERING) Thank you for the game.
"Come on, come on."
Come here!
"What is this, an obstacle course?"
Wilbur!
"Come on, Wilbur."
"What kind of school are you running here, anyhow?"
"It's a school for girls, and the reception committee is going to be here any minute."
I don't need no reception committee.
Of course you do.
Why should you be any different?
Because I don't think I need a reception committee.
(BAND PLAYING)
"Ham and cheese, chicken, or egg and cress."
Egg and cress...
Isn't life wonderful?
You looking?
I don't... what?
"Few scars, few marks..."
What do you think of them?
I think they're horrible.
"At least I got 'em, mate."
Cos I fucking wear 'em.
Right...
How about you?
Do you... have any marks?
- No.
I'm fine.
"- Oh, yeah, course you are..."
You're fine and dandy.
Right?
Egg and cress...
It's a little fucking miracle.
18 years old.
The age of opportunity.
I bet you can't wait to come here!
"Imagine it... being able to live away from your parents and you can do anything you like, like stay up all night and eat ice cream!"
Derek.
"Thanks, Polly."
So.
"New home, new friends, new horizons."
"The good times, the bad times..."
The parties...
"oh, my God, the parties!"
"The loves that will never be, even though they seem so right."
I know what's gonna happen.
You have to leave now.
I have to report to work.
We can talk about this later.
- Governor?
"- Good to see you, John."
I need to speak with you.
It's urgent.
"- What's this about, John?"
- It's the tour.
You can't do it.
You can't go.
Listen to me.
Cancel it.
Cancel the tour.
Cancel it.
Make them shut down the plant now.
The plant's gonna blow up while you're there.
Where are the cops?
What are they doing?
- They don't know yet.
Have you received a bomb threat?
I didn't say anything about a bomb.
There's a source.
- I know this sounds...
"- You're messing up here, John."
Get me Cyrus Bills at the Post.
Our top story takes us tonight to Point Pleasant...
- where Virginia Governor McCallum...
- Turn it up!
Russ McCallum and the governor Harris toured the Edgewater Petrochemical plant.
In what he's called a successful review...
# He sang as if he knew me #
Will.
# In all my dark despair #
We're finished.
# And then he looked right through me # # as if I wasn't there #
"Will, come on."
"Will, we're finished."
"So there I was, killing them softly with my song."
"Or rather, being killed."
"And not that softly, either."
I was singing with my eyes closed.
Was I frightened?
I was petrified.
This was definitely not island living.
# Killing me softly #
# With his song ##
"Thank you, Finsbury."
I'd like to introduce one or two members of the band.
Marcus Brewer on vocals and tambourine.
And that's about it.
Let's get off quick.
Get off.
"Marcus, thank you."
For the song.
You were terrific.
- You think so?
- Yeah.
"As a matter of fact, I think we should celebrate."
Okay.
How about McDonald's?
- McDonald's?
- Yeah.
The dress says you have.
Oh no!
Oppa!
Welcome.
"Oppa, she said I gained weight."
Did I gain weight?
Does it look like I did?
"I don't know, I can't really tell."
What do you think?
Right.
It's nice.
Shouldn't you be a bit more excited?
Why are you so uninterested?
"He's just like that, don't worry about it."
Here.
The groom's suit!
"Yes, please come this way."
"Don't make any adjustments, I'll lose it by exercising more."
"I'll exercise and starve myself, so don't make any adjustments, okay?"
"If you can't breathe, you'll faint during the ceremony."
"It'll be healed by the wedding, right?"
"Yes, it'll be fine."
Wait.
I can't stand it.
It's old-fashioned.
She's my daughter.
Oh my!
She's beautiful!
I guess.
Ma'am...
She looks like an angel.
How could you have come up with such a phrase?
- You can't handle this!
- What about this little puppy?
There's enough mist in this thing to save ten masturbators!
[Rock]
Ain 't no big thing to wait -
- That's an ugly turn of events.
- Mm-hmm.
- Mmm!
What is this?
"- [Continues, Faint]"
Schnapps?
"What, am i in third grade?"
"- Can i have a drink, please?"
"- Let's talk this through, shall we?"
"You're saying that Russ, in his infinite wisdom,"
- Yeah.
- sold the ticket for a 100 grand.
Can you believe it?
A $6 million ticket!
- I've got more brains in my... shoe!
- [Glass Shatters]
"Russ never really had the stomach for this sort of thing, did he?"
"I do, and I want that ticket back, and I want Dick Simmons dead!"
Do you hear me?
Fine.
Fine.
Speed dial.
I love it.
And I want his head cut off so i can hang it from my rear view mirror!
- That's just your anger talking.
- Yeah.
Dale.
No.
The question remains the same.
Who would want to kill Mr. Malhotra?
Chelsea.
Chelsea?
What?
You guys don't follow football?
Chelsea has to win if they want to stay on top of the table.
Unbelievable.
I need some fresh air.
Hopeless.
Football?
I'm not going to let you die.
"22nd August, 2007."
You have two new messages.
First message.
"Neil, Ranbir here."
Call me back.
Second message.
Neil... it's been three months now.
You keep saying that you'll come here.
I guess it was naive of me to believe you.
Anyway...
I just want you to know that...
I'm pregnant.
"I'm sure, this is the last thing you needed to know."
"Neil, I've treasured every moment of my life since I met you."
"And, I'll always love you for that."
The number you've dialled is currently switched off.
The number you've dialled is currently switched off.
Neil.
Who won?
Um...
We think... we think... that you were shipwrecked.
[Imitates wind]
Oh!
And you managed to swim to shore.
"And somehow, you, um, broke your ankle."
You broke your ankle.
"Dr. Mead, um, the doctor, he thinks you need much rest."
[Speaking Polish]
[Kisses]
[Speaking Polish]
But you don't think he's German?
"- Oh, no."
- Just as well.
"[Mouth full, indecipherable]"
"- Oh, Ursula."
Please.
Sorry.
He seems to understand the language.
"- Oh, really?"
Since when did you speak German?
"Well, I..."
How is he?
"If he drinks any more tea, he's gonna need a chamber pot 'cause he ain't fit to walk to the bathroom."
You finished with this lot?
"Yes, I think so."
What's he gonna do without his clothes?
His own are ruined.
I thought perhaps some of father's might fit him.
"I doubt it, but you could try."
You want me to get the chest then?
"If you wouldn't mind, Dorcas."
Welcome.
- Thank you.
- This is my wife.
- I see.
Have you met Anna?
You must.
"- This is Jacob, who I told you about."
- Congratulations.
Christian.
This is Christian's mother.
There you are.
Care for a drink?
"Yes, please."
- Cheers.
Welcome.
- Thanks.
- Can I play?
- Yes!
Are you any good?
Good?
!
I'm the best.
Aren't you playing together?
"I stand not just before you, Anna   but also my boss and father-in-law, Jørgen   and Helene and, of course, the rest of you."
"Anna, we met at Jørgen's firm when it was in the suburbs."
I didn't dare speak to you because you were the boss's daughter.
Then one day you needed to borrow 1000 kroner.
Jørgen wasn't there and so I had to lend it to you.
You'd think he was marrying Jørgen.
"But Jørgen and Helene, I would like   to thank you for the way you've welcomed me into the family."
I know you think it's early for Anna to marry   but please know that it feels very right to me.
"Anna, I love you more than all the world."
You want one of me too?
Recording bombing victim number six.
Severe lower body trauma.
Powder burns extending to mid-torso.
Becca.
- Hey.
"- Hey, how's it going?"
I hear you went to the dark side.
Federal task force.
Yeah.
I'm working the Pine Street Bombings.
"I'm her partner,"
Dr. Diego Soto.
Hey.
Sandman.
Golden age.
Nice.
Thanks.
So what are you pulling out of him?
"Oh, why do I have the feeling you already know the answer to that?"
"- That one, please."
- Okay.
Is that a Laurel wreath design?
It looks like some sort of badge or military medal.
"Hey, did you see psycho there?"
"Oh, yeah."
I have a comic book shop over on Columbus.
I have every issue of Sandman.
Mint condition.
"You know, if you're ever interested."
I thought you said that you were her partner.
"Oh, I am."
"No, I'm good."
All right.
Don't got to worry about me.
"You say you're okay, I take your word for it."
Medical suspensions?
[Chuckles]
"That's for the fucking nanny state, and I don't play that bullshit."
But do me a favor.
Put the glasses back on.
You're giving me a fucking headache.
"So, what's the deal?"
You got a spot on this card for me or what?
I can find a spot for you.
It's in Fresno.
It's only a week out.
It's not a problem.
Okay.
- Who's the guy?
- Local kid named Vargas.
He's aggressive.
"Not a lot of skill, but he's a tough motherfucker."
- 155?
- Ish.
"If either one of you's a few pounds over,"
I'm not gonna dock you.
I'll make it.
Even better.
"Unfortunately, though, not a lot of money."
I just want the fight.
All right.
It's a deal.
I'm excited.
- Shut up.
"And what's ""Oschwitz""?"
The word is Auschwitz.
"Oschwitz, Auschwitz, it's the same crap."
Stop it.
- Where to?
- To sleep.
- Dad's inspection.
- What?
I cracked the case.
I spent all night with this garbage.
"The delightful record of an obsessive cheapskate, but it's also the entire history of this family,"
"- before I was born, of course."
- Where did you find Dad's whistle?
Don't interrupt.
"Okay, as we all know, Mom and Dad got married in 1965."
"Morn was 19, and that's when Dad started keeping records, right?"
"You, Natanel, were born in 1976 and Dad bought a stroller."
So?
It took them 11 years to have their first child.
So what?
We know that.
Look.
"Exactly 9 months before Natanel was born it says: ""June 23, 1975, plane tickets to Paris for Yonah,"
"""1,400 liras"""
What's your point?
- She visited Aunt Rosa every year.
- Right.
"9 months before you were born,"
"9 months before Dorona was born,"
and 9 months before I was born.
What does it mean?
It's Peter.
Right?
Yeah.
"And, Jeanine, can I just say that it is truly an honor to finally meet you in person?"
FOUR:
"Congratulations, Mother."
You got your war.
I know you wish there was another way.
But there isn't.
I'm the lesser of two evils.
Is that it?
You'd better be.
JEANNE'.
"Tell me, why did you surrender to Erudite?"
What do you want?
I would like a position in your regime.
"Ideally, I would like a position with some advancement opportunities."
(LAUGHS)
"I may be Dauntless, but I'm not just a meathead."
"No offense, Max."
(SCOFFS)
Prove your worth to us.
Then we can discuss your ambitions.
Great.
When do I start?
Let's talk about your friend Tris Prior.
How do I flush her out?
"PETER""."
Simple.
The girl's a walking bleeding heart.
She was born Abnegation.
That's her weak spot.
How can you say that after what happened to you?
- That kid's dead.
- Dean.
I'm gonna rip his lungs out!
- It's not a big deal.
- Not a big deal?
"Sammy, look at yourself."
If dad was here...
He's not.
"Well, I am!"
And as soon I'm finished with that dick...
"Shut up, okay?"
!
I don't need your help.
"That's right, you don't."
You could have torn him apart.
So why didn't you?
"Because I don't want to be the freak for once, Dean."
I want to be normal.
So taking a beating -- that's normal?
Any word from dad?
"He called this morning, said he's going to be another week at least."
We weren't supposed to be here this long.
At least you've got Amanda.
She's cool.
"Dude, she wants me to meet her parents."
I don't do parents.
"Mr. Winchester, can I talk to you?"
Um...
I'll wait for you outside.
"Look, if this is about the fight, I didn't start it."
"Oh, no, it's not about the fight, Sam."
I love them when they're silly.
"But if they get too silly, they have to come see me."
"- ""Silly""?"
- Mischief.
- Trouble.
- We use gentler terms.
As a policy.
"Well, so what happens when they come see you?"
"Well, we do things a little differently in our program."
The approach is progressive and positive.
"We issue a hug consent form to parents, which allows us to hug their kids."
"Because 99% of the time, all kids need"
- is a hug.
"- ""A hug""?"
- A squeeze.
"- Well, you squeeze 'em."
- An embrace.
- Oh.
- Oh?
- Well...
- What is it?
- Nothin'.
- Wayne.
- Yeah?
- Speak freely.
"- No, I'd better not."
That's the only way we'll get to know each other.
But do you ever smack 'em?
- Excuse me?
"- Like, give 'em a good whack?"
- I don't follow.
- Do you ever hit the kid?
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
"Sifu Wong, I propose a toast to your health."
- You're too kind.
- Thank you.
"Cheers, everyone."
I'll help myself.
- It's an honor to know you.
- Don't mention it.
- Let's eat.
- Let's eat.
It looks like I blew my chance to be Sifu Wong's student.
Let's get out of here.
We're like brothers.
We'll find a way.
I've got it!
What?
You have to continue with schemes to show your heroism.
I promise this scheme will work better.
I don't want to be a hero.
You've got to appeal to Sifu's compassion.
"Good, that's the look!"
Let's go!
"- Sifu, we're in trouble!"
- What is it?
"A band of robbers was raiding the bank and Mousy was brave, he stood up to them without thought for his own life."
He beat them.
- What happened next?
- It's bad.
He's severely injured.
Were there any police around?
They disappeared when the robbers arrived.
Your father and your uncle and your grandfather are fools.
"Thank you, Leena."
- You're welcome.
"Thank you, Grandma."
"Enjoy your food, my darling."
"Why are you hitting me, fatso?"
"Liyova, take another meatball."
"I'd love another one, thank you."
Daddy.
What?
They're waiting for you to finish.
- What?
They're waiting for you to finish.
How long can one eat?
What did you say?
- Never mind.
I take it he doesn't want any dessert.
I'd love some dessert.
The Rustaveli Theater is coming to do Richard III.
"Can you get tickets, Yitzhak?"
No chance.
It's not some little operetta.
Does he have to do it now?
He'll just kick up dust.
"Yitzhak, why now?"
Why now?
Ask your mother why now.
It'll kick up dust.
"Tell her that if it kicks up dust, I'll clean up."
Why does he always have to ruin Fridays for us?
"Yes, every Friday."
Would you prefer another day?
"Hiya, Sangita."
It's Nicki.
Hiya.
You all right?
No.
Not really.
I just did a pregnancy test and I... tested positive for baby.
You neverI
I'm pretty sure I followed the instructions OK.
"Well, you're gonna have to go see a gynaecologist."
What good's a bush doctor gonna be?
I'm pregnant.
I know I am.
"I haven't had a period since the ""Eurovision Song Contest""."
- And what does Moz think?
"- That's just it, see."
It might not be Moz's.
What d'you mean?
"Well, he's got a one-in-three chance."
There's only one thing for it.
I'm gonna go in there and I'm gonna tell him the truth.
I'm just poppin' out to get some tampons.
"- Get us some fags, will ya?"
- Course.
Sure.
I'll get you some fags.
Why not?
China.
Good to see ya.
- Broke up with Psycho Paul.
- Smart move.
"As a rule, never date anyone whose nickname suggests anger-management issues."
"I'll marry a cold fish, then cheat the rest of my life."
An apple doesn't fall far from the tree.
But the graduation dance is important.
"You want a new car, don't you?"
Betty?
"Hello, Betty."
This is Rodney.
"Look, Betty, this is so terrible, I don't know where to begin."
Tell her.
"Betty, the graduation dance is off."
She hung up.
What a fine graduation.
- I know someone you can take.
- Who?
Allison MacKenzie.
Her mother kicked me out of the house for kissing her.
I'll talk to her mother.
Allison's a girl of quality.
"Quality's a very good thing in woolen cloth, but it's very dull on a big date."
"I didn't know you were such a good dancer, Allison."
- Thank you.
"- Yeah, sure."
"- Hi, Rod."
"- Hi there, Allison."
"Hey, Rodney, looking for someone?"
"After the dance, shall we go to Rockland?"
Okay.
"Oh, really?"
"- Some more, Mrs. MacKenzie?"
"- No, thank you, Ms. Thornton."
"May I have this dance, Mrs. MacKenzie?"
"I haven't danced for such a long time, I'm afraid I'd be terrible."
Only that you keep saying you'll be sendin' over the ending'.
It's almost ready.
Well...
let me know when it is.
Goodbye Parfitt.
Mrs.Cole
Excuse me?
I bet...you know!
just this way...
Cigarette?
I've never seen much point in men.
Still I do hate to see you plaining.
Oh!
I'm not plaining.
Ellis moved out weeks ago.
I'm already used to it.
It wasn't Ellis I was thinking of.
Forgive me.
"It's just the...when we were shooting in Devon, you always seemed so... vivid."
Perhaps I'm in a sentimental mood.
"My landlady was killed yesterday,"
I could hear her husband crying through the wall...all night long.
"It seems to me when life is so very precarious, it's an awful shame to waste it."
"I was wondering on page 76, I say..."
Getting worried.
About the ending.
Turned Ministry spy now?
Is that it?
Did I...
Sorry!
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean...
strict dress code at this place.
I do recommend the pumpkin ravioli.
They're very subtle.
"So, Tracy, this Jack Donaghy guy wanted me to talk to you about joining the cast of our show."
And I don't know how you feel about that--
Lemme ask you a question.
Everybody at this table.
"Did he just say the word ""pumpkin"" to me?"
"Yes, um, pumpkin ravioli."
Yo!
I'm buggin'.
I can't do this.
I cannot eat here.
I can't eat here.
I got to go someplace where they make food that I like.
"Lemon, let's go."
I will not work with Tracy Jordan.
It's just a rumor.
Have you seen any of his movies?
The guy's sensibility is just cretinous.
"I saw the one where he plays, like, five different characters."
"Yeah, Black Cop/White Cop."
No.
Who Dat Ninja?
"No, he-"
- He had to pretend to be this old lady...
"Ooh, ooh, ooh!"
Goodness gracious!
You hooligans better watch out.
'Cause this honky grandma be trippin'!
"Oh, yeah."
That movie was hilarious.
"Um, cool."
Cool!
Now I get to go yell at 1 2-year-olds.
"Um, Karen, thank you."
Uh...
This is a good thing you've just done.
"Well, I hope so."
[Rick] And you called him at home?
And you still have the messages from yesterday?
I need to know if he's getting these messages or not.
"Okay, well, look, if he calls in, just tell him again."
[dialing]
- Who are you calling?
"- Uh, Miles."
You've called 700 times since yesterday.
Cell phone.
"Oh, well, that makes it all make sense."
I think Miles may be in flight.
He just got back from vacation.
As in fleeing.
A fugitive from justice.
Should I put a hold on the concrete?
"Judy, I'm not allowed to talk about it."
Because I'm not.
If you could please respect that.
"Lily, I need you to come in here for a second."
- How much do you know about it?
- Excuse me?
- Lily.
- What?
Stop pretending.
You know what I'm talking about.
It was supposed to prevent!
I was supposed to protect them!
I should have expected this!
It was supposed to prevent!
-Enough.
It was supposed to prevent!
It's okay.
You're supposed to stop it!
It's okay.
Okay.
"You're supposed to stop it, Bobby!"
Look at me.
You're a good man.
You're a good man.
"Come on, we have to stand up."
"If Ray came to the road, they will have to hitchhike."
We have to catch him before than catching a ride.
Listen to me.
"When you come to a fork road, turn left ."
This will take you back to the place where you took the family.
I doubt that headed for the highway.
I will go in that direction.
Take this.
I have one in my car.
Bobbi.
-What is it?
Are you in trouble about all this?
I do not know.
I do not give a fuck.
"I'm dying, do you remember?"
What the fuck!
Ti.
Where's your friend?
-Ariving.
Your cop friends?
Around are.
Are they here?
Just me now.
You and that fucking gun who do not know how to use it.
What happened Luu?
Dead.
What?
Fucking son of a bitch.
"This is a big problem for your friend, you know that?"
I do not think so.
Do not you know?
What the fuck do you want?
You and that stupid gun.
I saw how much you're handy with miracle.
-Sit down.
Have a seat.
Sit down or I'll kill you.
"Listen, man."
Why is a nice guy like you hanging out with a guy like Andes?
He kills people.
You kill people.
"Deserve it, your wife and child."
You mistake me understand.
It was an accident.
-Accident?
People have to come to me with a certain respect.
Some things can not tolerate.
"When someone accuses me of something,"
I take that as an insult.

Sonakshi I really liked that you attended the party.
Me too.
I swear.
- All right.
I'm looking forward to it.
"All right, I got news."
You ready?
- Gary Fogel had cancer.
"- Oh, yeah, I knew."
- You knew?
How did you know?
- He told me a few months ago.
Why did he tell you and not me?
- I don't know.
- How are you closer to him than me?
- So is he okay?
"- Oh, yeah, he's fine."
"He was in bad shape for a while, though."
Really?
How bad?
Was he on his deathbed?
"No, he was on his regular bed."
So why didn't you tell me?
- He swore me to secrecy.
- So?
It's not like you're my wife.
I still think you should've told me.
You were better off not knowing.
It's not easy to deal with someone in a situation like this.
I was so nice to him I almost made myself sick.
I'm gonna talk to him about this.
That's right.
You let him have it.
Who is he not to tell you about his life- threatening illness?
"- It""s okay."
- What am I gonna do?
"You are gonna lay in bed and you""re gonna cry your little eyes out."
"Then you""re gonna get up... you""re gonna put on a smile and go find those babies."
"And you""re gonna tell them, ""Mama""s here and everything is fine and dandy."""
"But he""s already filed for divorce."
"He wants the house, the cars."
"He thinks I""m having an affair with a woman."
- I have never cheated on my husband.
- I know that.
"- But he""ll win anyway?"
"- No, he won""t."
"- He""ll take my kids."
"- I won""t let him."
"- L""ll fight with you as long as it takes."
- It is too late.
He has pictures.
"Oh, my."
Who would take pictures like that?
"We took those pictures, Jesse."
"We""re knee-deep into this."
Let me see that camera.
Hurry up.
"- Jesse, what""s the matter with you?"
"- L""m sorry."
"Sorry doesn""t cut it."
Not for Pam Caine.
Hand me the binoculars.
"Jesse, you never get over something like this."
Never.
"Go see if the camera""s broken."
Mr. Rodriguez has had this appointment for weeks.
If you are planning to blow your brains out... ..could you wait till you're out on the high seas?
I just mopped these floors.
I don't need this shit.
you asked me to help you.
And God knows I've tried.
not really if you're not going to talk to me.
I hear you at night.
You're not sleeping.
You don't wanna talk about that.
Or the booze you're drinking.
Or the pus you're wiping away from your knuckles.
Or the blood I wash from your clothes.
Or the fresh wounds in your chest.
The ones that aren't healing.
And I'm pretty sure you don't wanna talk about the fact that you can't read the label on that bottle.
Ibuprofen.
That was my favorite mug.
Stay out of my shit.
Logan.
On the inside you're sick.
I can smell it.
{\i1\cH00ffff}Best night ever!
driver.
I love you.
I love you.
You're such a doll.
Mr. Logan.
Jesus.
Please.
We need a ride.
Not available.
Call a cab.
"Oh, my God!"
This is Helmut Lang.
- Are you sure?
- Uh-huh.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Dripping with edge.
"- You know you're never gonna get it back, right?"
- Fine.
I'm gonna rock this forever 16 jacket forever.
"You know you're cooler than any guy, right?"
Let him know that.
- I love you.
- I love you.
Bye.
"Yeah, now would be good."
Thanks.
"So, Tracy, how long has this been going on?"
"Three weeks, and it's getting worse every day."
"All he talks about is God, God, God."
"This morning, he gave away our house and $12 million."
Gone.
"Oh, you remember that?"
That's the shelter you helped fund in Port-au-Prince after the earthquake.
"You know, they're still housing 30 homeless people a day thanks to your generosity."
Adonai machasi u'metzudati.
"Come on, man."
You know I don't speak Hebrew.

Psalm 91.
"Well, I doubt all those homeless kids feel the same way, Jacob."
"""He that dwelleth in the shelter of the most high will rest in the shadow of the almighty."""
"- I mean, you got your ass kicked."
- Why wouldn't you tell me?
I could have taken a dive.
I wouldn't have had to get my ass kicked.
"Mac, it had to look real."
Were you gonna tell me eventually?
- Yes.
- Yeah?
- I was going to tell you eventually.
- Yeah?
You know what?
Stab this son of a bitch.
"Oh, wait a second."
"Oh, come on, Mac."
"Don't be like that, man."
You would have done the same thing.
"Come on, don't act like a baby."
Please don't stab me.
"Bash this ugly jerk's face in, Daddy."
- Your last chance to chicken out.
"- That ain't gonna happen, Bobby."
- I've been waiting for this for a long time.
"- All right, Frankie."
Seeing that we're a couple of old men here...
I think we should lay down some ground rules.
Now.
Number one.
Holy shit!
"Since I was currently homeless,"
Turk and Carla were letting me crash here as long as I needed.
"J.D., you have to get out."
Move!
Go!
Go!
- Najim!
"No, wait He's coming."
He's coming.
Stop the car.
- Quickly.
- Come on...
Come on...
Good boy.
Well done.

That's not my usual fantasy.
Usually you're wearing latex and a strap on.
"I see the bullet hasn't improved your sense of humour, then."
And Stonebridge?
You found his corpse yet or are you still looking?
We don't know that he's dead yet.
He's been looking for that bullet ever since Kate died.
You knew that.
And you fucking used it.
You knew he'd go the whole nine yards to rescue some damsel in distress.
"Too bad your perfect plan fucked up, huh?"
"I liked him too, Scott, you know."
But unfortunately I can only rescue you at the moment.
Lucky me.
Bitch.
Nothing.
I think we're good.
They're just chasing blind.
For now.
"in purple trunks, Stoker Thompson!"
- Give him a gun!

And in this corner!

Tiger Nelson!
"Yeah, Nelson!"
Let's get it over with!
"Don't hurt him, Nelson, he's an old man!"
"Okay, you know the rules!"
"I want a nice, clean fight!"
"No heeling, rabbit punching, gouging!"
Break when I tell you!
Go to a neutral corner in all knockdowns and keep them above the belt!
The customers came to see a good fight!
Shake hands now and come out fighting!
May the best man win!
"Don't bend, Pop, you'll never get up!"
"Don't forget, stay away from him!"
That's the stuff!
Stay with him!
"Oh, quit stalling!"
Let's have some action!
That's it!
"- Don't worry, I ain't gonna finish you yet!"
- You ain't finishing nobody!
"Let him have it, baby!"
Let him have it!
Daddy.
Go crazy.
And here's a tiny little schnitzel and I'll take a tiny little bite...
"No, don't eat mine!"
I'm late for rehearsal.
"Go on, go to your rehearsal and don't do us any favors."
I know your assistant director can do the replacement.
"Sure, why not?"
Why don't we let Slava Chaplin do it?
Silkis.
Silkis.
Hello.
Are you Yitzhak Ben-Shmuel?
- Yes.
We have a search warrant.
"Yitzhak, what's going on?"
We have a search warrant.
What are you searching for?
"Goni, go to your room."
Why?
Come in.
Check the bookshelf.
Take a look in the bedroom.
"Don't worry, Goni."
They'll be leaving soon.
Don't you think you're out of line?
What do you think you'll find here?
"Tell them to stop, Yitzhak."
You and your damn police have some nerve!
Ora.
There's nothing we can do.
Let them finish.
There's a lot of it.
"Okay, sure."
Be right back.
Why me?
Is everybody in your family a loser?

So slap on a bra because you're about to have a bad trip to the San Cortez Regional Correctional Institute for broads!
"See that, kids?"
That's the kind of man you want to be: self-employed.
- You're already on probation.
- How long have you been a cop?
- How many years?
One?
Two?
- Long enough to know the rules.
Partners back each other up.
You have no business telling me how partners should treat each other.
- You had a gun to his head.
- I wasn't going to shoot him.
- I'm trying to solve a murder!
- What murder?
"I hate to tell you this, but you're not a homicide detective any more."
"- 9221, this is base."
Come in.
- Hardy.
We've got another 111.
Northshore.
East of Glenwood Bridge.
Get the bow line.
This is Hardy.
We're on our way.
Let's go.
Now!
"If the kids have any bad dreams, call this number."
We'll send a counsellor out.
Get the kids home now.
"Kids, come on."
Let's go home.
- Why didn't you question them?
- What for?
- The body was dumped last night.
"Personally, I don't feel too comfortable working with you."
You made me nervous.
"You look like shit, acting all crazy."
What's up with you?
Nothing is up with me.
"It was an accident and I am the one who gotta live with it, not you."
"You ain't hearing me, man."
Nobody wants you here.
Nobody.
See you tomorrow.
Hey!
Hey!
"Howdy, partner."
You gotta go back to the shop.
Tucker needs to see you.
- What about?
"- I don't know, but it seemed important."
"Well, he's gonna have to wait."
It's Miller time.
We need to talk.
Follow me.
Come on!
Another Bourbon.
Make it double.
You shooting coke or something?
You look like a dope fiend to me.
No offence.
I don't use drugs.
I mean I don't even drink.
How about abnormally?
I see Reynolds is back to work.
Gets to make bail.

Yes.
You've come to me because all other efforts have failed?
I have.
How far are you willing to go to reclaim his love?
To own it it forever.
As far as I need.

"Now, what's he going to do?"
What's he going to do?
And...
Wait.
Don't tell me.
"Sound engineer Billy Logan, right?"
"Oh, my God."
What are you doing here?
"Oh, my God."
"Come in, come in, come in, come in!"
"Oh, I can't believe this."
Here.
You've been taking pictures of me.
"Yeah, I thought I saw you."
I hope you don't mind.
"There was nothing on the website, so, I took a few candids."
They're for the next issue.
"Cast and crew, after hours, behind the scenes."
"While I have you here, I have a couple of questions."
It's not your lucky day.
What a shame.
Just a kid.
At least he didn't hit anybody when he jumped.
Are we sure he jumped?
"""Tired of losing."" Not much of a note."
"Brevity, the soul of wit."
But he was a writer.
Look at all these letters.
No.
There's something weird about this.
"Monk, look around you."
That note's probably the least weird thing in the whole apartment.
Who visits him?
Nobody.
He is all alone.
"Earlier his daughter would write to him, every week."
- That doesn't happen anymore.
- Why not?
"She died, poor thing."
"It was a car accident, January 2006."
Since then he hasn't spoken with anyone.
"Poor man, all broken down."
I understand.
What was his daughter's name?
Natasha.
Natasha Malhotra.
Can I get a copy of Mr. Malhotra's admission form and medical reports?
Why not.
But it could take some time.
"I'll have to go through some of the old files, you see."
Sure.
I will have someone call you later.
Is that okay?
- No problem.
- Thank you.
"We're done, let's go."
- Thank you so much.
- Welcome.
One thing is certain.
The murder wasn't committed by Iqbal Chand Malhotra.
Right.
But he was the reason for it.
Being cryptic suits you... not this case.
Okay.
I say we go after it now!
No-one's going anywhere.
We'll handle this!
Stay calm.
How is he?
"I've given him something for the pain, but his injuries are too severe."
He's not gonna make it.
This can't be happening.
It's not possible.
I'm sorry.
Don't blame Ellia.
It was my idea.
You have to understand.
"When I found her, I'd just lost my own wife and son to a fever."
She was just lying there helpless.
"When I saw her, I knew what I had to do."
"As I told you, in the beginning she survived on food and water, like any young girl."
Then the hunger came.
It's alright.
Take what you need.
I can't!
Yes you can.
"She took what she needed from me to survive, until I perfected the serum."
Father?
Father?
I'm so sorry!
"She never fed on anyone, after that?"
No!
Alright!
"Teyla, Ronon, you're with me."
"The rest of you, stay here!"
Colonel!
It's on me.
Get a life.
I've got yours.
It's quite enough.

He was nominated like everybody else.
Everybody knows the party arranges nomination of judges.
Whose side are you on?
I'm on yours...

But I smell a hanging party.
We should put distance between ourselves...

Distance!

Nancy.
Nancy?
What are you doing here?
I saw someone crawl through this window.
You're mistaken.
You mustn't let them find you here.
Men aren't allowed in this building.
"I know, I didn't want anything to happen to you, but I saw a white thing crawl through here, and it looked like Wilbur."
NANCY:
"Oh, that's ridiculous."
Wilbur wouldn't do a thing like that.
"You're very fond of him, aren't you?"
Very.
I wish he belonged to me.
"You could do with a little of Wilbur's manners, you know."
"I'm sure they must be very charming, but he certainly didn't have any trouble worming his way in."
"Well, no, he didn't."
"And he doesn't come climbing into people's rooms in the middle of the night, either."
What was that?
NANCY:
I don't know.
BOB:
Let's go find out.
(MEOWING)
"Oh, a cat."
-Would you do this for me?
-Nathan.
I'd be honored.
What in the hell kind of sissy rig is that?
"Well, evening, boys."
"Mrs. Standish in there, I hope."
-You must be Mr. Wingo.
wingo:
My reputation has preceded me.
Happy to hear that.
Oh.
Maudie.
"-Oh, Maudie, light of my life."
-You skunk.
"You're a beautiful woman, Maudie."
And even more beautiful when there's fire in your eyes.
"You put those cuff links in my bag, didn't you?"
Admit it.
-Say the word and I'll set you free.
-Never.
When as in silks my Maudie goes
-Don't try to sweet-talk me.
-Then methinks how sweetly flows
You tell these people I didn't take your cuff links and get me out of here.
-Then when I cast my eyes and see
"-Quit it, I hate that poem."
-That brave vibration each way free
"-Ezra, make him leave."
"Oh, no, this is beautiful."
"God, I can't bear it."
"Maudie, I've substituted your lovely name for Julia's."
I don't think Robert Herrick would have minded.
Is it?
It was right about then that a question started nagging at me.
Is Phil sexy?
Hey.
You feel like doing something a little crazy with me?
What?
No.
What?
No.
"Hey, honey."
"Phil, honey, how you holding up?"
Good.
I'm at the beach...
Long story.
I was hoping you wouldn't mind waiting at the house for Luke's tutor.
"Actually, I would mind."
I'd mind quite a bit.
- I'm kind of busy.
- Okay.
"Cam, there's something that Claire would never approve of that I've always wanted to do."
Always?
We're gonna want to put a blanket down on that backseat.
This was a huge mistake.
I am jammed in the backseat with a hairy Peruvian biter.
It's spring break '92 all over again!
"Well, speed bump coming up."
Hold the leash taut.
It's supposed to keep her calm.
I got lucky.
I don't think this one's a spitter.
Ohh.
"Uh, I spoke too soon."
And... guess what?
- What?
- I'm done.
I've sewn myself up.
- Huh.
"- You did great, buddy."
I'm proud of you.
I can't believe I did it.
I'm so strong.
"Ooh, we're crossing into Virginia."
"Virginia is not technically a state, but a commonwealth."
"Oof, poor Jake."
"Uhh, this might be the Ambies speaking, but this in-flight movie sucks."
"So, uh, you already moved the twins onto a booster seat, huh?"
Aren't they a little young for that?
They're four.
"Nikolaj is four, but we're sticking with the car seat as long as possible, but you know me..."
"I'm a ""safety at all costs"" kind of dad."
Mm-hmm.
"Sarge, I need to go to the bathroom."
We just stopped for gas.
I asked you if you had to go.
I didn't have to then.
So does this van have side-impact airbags?
Not in the back.
Oh.
Interesting.
No judgment here.
"Sarge, I have to pee now too."
Seriously?
"You, Diaz?"
"Look, I'll turn off at the next exit, okay?"
Hello!
Help!
Help me!
So you've been looking for the daughter of Milonkovic?
Why?
We think it would be in the car.
We began the search yesterday.
Daughter reported missing in Sweden.
She lives with her mother in Gothenburg.
Did you know about the person in the trunk?
-Yup.
-What Was the fucking game then?
Why did not you tell us?
Hello?
-I Can not say.
All right.
Let's forget whims and pride and work.
You then have the theory that she was in the trunk?
-Is It possible.
-And She was saved by someone that killed the other?
-Deixamos All options open.
"-Legal, Sikkeland."
Mutual-confidence now?
"-surely, On my part."
Where is she from?
Stay there!
-Fatalidades Or injury?
-Still Are there.
-Milonkovic Was there?
I do not know.
The explosive was in the back.
I suppose you have a good view of it and the league-Z?
Every fucking little pigs
"You don't see this one very often, Do you?"
"Jonathan, how are you doing?"
"Right here, Madison Square Garden."
I'm hanging around with some nails.
Are you ready?
Holy shit...
Sick!
Amazing Mister Lifto of the Jim Rose Circus is going to attempt to lift up...
this chair...
Shit!
- Don't lift up!
Lifto?
!
Are you all right?
"We're on the road, 48 weeks out of the year, staying at hotels just about every night."
"And at each one there is a person at the desk, that says if we need help lifting up the luggage... and We say Fuck You!"
We've got the amazing Mr Lifto
Fucking Samsonite gorilla !
3 days bro.
"As soon as the tour, this leg is over..."
I'll sit down here and have a long talk to myself.
I have to get to know Jim again.
Are you having fun yet?
"so the fuck are we but he's not through,"
We're gonna take 100 firecrackers and light him on...
FIRE!
Fire!
Fire!
Fire!
Fire!
YES!
-Alice has returned to Underland.
-Where is she now?
-In Salazen Grum.
Forgive me.
I allowed her to divert from her destined path.
"No, no, no, no."
But that is exactly where she will find the Vorpal sword.
We have our champion.
Rest now.
You've done well.
(SQUEAKING)
ALICE:
Have you seen a hat around here?
"You must find Alice, Stayne."
"Without the Jabberwocky, my sister's followers will surely rise against me."
Ugly little sister.
Why do they adore her and not me?
STAYNE:
I cannot fathom it.
You are far superior in all ways.
RED QUEEN:
I know.
But Mirana can make anyone fall in love with her.
"Men, women,"
(ANIMALS GRUNTING) even the furniture.
Even the King?
I had to do it.
He would have left me.
"Majesty, is it not better to be feared than loved?"
Not certain anymore.
"Oh, let her have the rabble."
I don't need them.
He was stabbed many times?
Not just once?
"Hey, where is everyone?"
We got some new information.
We're all going to Im Tae Ho's house.
What?
Oh...
Put him in handcuffs immediately!
Everybody is going crazy...
Starting with President Seo.
"Hey, take those off."
"Wait, what's going on?"
Why do you need to see our car?
Please cooperate.
Please... open the door for us.
We need to do this to prove Tae Ho's innocence.
Why are you trying to prove the innocence of a person who did nothing wrong?
Three million won per week...
But Mr. President...
Where did you get this new information?
It was from an anonymous source.
Anonymous!
"- Hurry up, get in there."
Hurry.
- Yes.
Honey.
Are you okay?
Did you get any sleep?
Yes.
Once this is over...
I will get my revenge on President Seo for this.
Yoon Sang Min and Park Seon Woo... and... anyone else that is involved.
- Do you remember at all?
Just over there where the lounge is.
- Do you remember anything about a rabbi?
- I don't remember anything.
Do you remember talking to a rabbi?
Or do you remember a rabbi... giving a talk about Max?
I guess I was in too much of a shock.
You don't recall any of this?
- I was in too much of a shock.
- Mm-hmm.
Must have been that.
Because he was my best friend.
I know.
We all know that.
We were very close friends.
"That wasn't when my daughter put me in here, was it?"
- When did it happen?
- Nine days ago.
Oh.
So I was here some time already.
"Oh, you"
- I think you've been here for a few years.
- Pardon?
- I think you've been here at Baycrest for a few years.
- Was I here a few years?
- I think so.
I think so.
"Yeah, my daughter never had time for me."
"- Why do you say that, Claire?"
- [Mutters]
Because she went to business.
And I was home.
"Look, Marsh."
The missing space helmet.
Judy.
"What's going on here, anyway?"
"Well, that, Marsh, is a bit of a story."
"At any rate, this is Dr. Alison and Captain Stedman of the American consulate."
Sergeant McEvoy.
How do you do?
They've been out looking for Sally.
"Well, I certainly hope Judy hasn't caused you any trouble."
"Oh, no."
No trouble at all.
She merely convinced us that she was Sally the astro-chimp.
With this helmet on I can understand how you could've made that mistake.
"Yes, now we're right back where we started from."
Unless we can get Judy to help us to find Sally.
(CHATTERING)
"Gentlemen, I think I have a pretty good idea where Sally is."
You have nothing to worry about.
She's safe and in good hands.
Chin up.
That's a girl.
Fine.
And again.
And once more.
That's fine.
"Well, Sally is in splendid shape."
"Thank you, Miss Tracy."
Let me see the results of the tests.
Sure.
(PAULA):
All I did was follow Dad's instructions.
Jesse Viljanen.
Your turn to give a speech.
The kingdom of flames is powerless against my super strength.
"Die, you flames!"
Are you alright?
Sure.
"After some strange turns, I've become The Flame Man."
Right...
"First, sick leave, then office duty with the girls."
"But first, firefighter of the year""."
Jesse Viljanen.
Marjukka!
Bring me another beer!
Your old friend Jesse Viljanen is in the news!
"What next, firefighter of the year, Flame Man Jesse Viljanen?"
Home to Puotinharju.
I need to rest.
See my friends.
They must be proud of you.
I guess.
The flame performance we saw...
What an earth is he wearing?
-Mom knows all the idiots...
"At home, I thought..."
My friends gave me the costume and I thought...
Is it your inner flame that makes you do these things we just saw?
I don't know about flames but I have dreams.
Jesse's nothing but dogshit from the garbage can!
He saved your life.
"Ostrich farmer Einu Palunen, your farm's been vandalized again."
What's all that noise?
Look!
I'm not sure I should send Neil to the garage.
Those men sound like brutes.
I think it was just hijinks.
"What, three dirty men throwing a naked young boy into water?"
- The mind boggles.
- I never said Will was naked.
I thought you did...
Not quite the outcome I'd hoped for.
Neil's dad imagining me naked.
"When it comes to love, they say a gentleman never tells."
But I wasn't a gentleman.
I was a twat.
Guess who got a date with Charlotte Hinchcliffe?
- Donovan?
- No.
I bet it is - he's probably balls deep in her right now.
The answer... is me.
- No way.
"- Yes, way."
Of sorts.
- Of sorts way.
- How?
I've no idea.
"Honestly, and I'm not going to stop and ask her."
I don't know why she likes me but I'm going to do my best to keep it that way.
Sounds like a good plan.
- When is it then?
- What?
- Date.
- Friday.
- What we up to Friday?
- Same as every Friday.
It's no more invasive than having your ears pierced.

- Just a moment.
Alright.
I'll just wait... here.
What the fuck?
- All good?
- All good.
What we're working on is an interactive augmented reality system.
- Like VR?
- More like layers on top of reality.
Oh.
Okay.
Um...
Ow.
Um...
- What's that?
- We call this a mushroom.
- Like Mario Brothers?
- If you like.
"- You're qualified to do this, right?"
- I haven't killed anyone yet.
May I?
Yeah.
He's my brother.
[ Breathing heavily ]
I knew you were a lost cause.
"Unlike your sister, you're weak."
"Good to see you, too, Larry."
How could you do this to her?
To us?
Do what?
[ Scoffs ]
This.
"Oh, that."
"Oh [scoffs] yeah, that."
You know what that means?
Huh?
Now there are hunters here!
"It's your fault, blanco!"
"If you didn't starve me, maybe -- Listen, freak!"
Your sister and I spent years building this operation.
"And if you think I'm gonna let your gluttony destroy it, you got another thing coming."
I want you out.
Now.
I'm not leaving Maritza.
"Well, I got news for you, pal."
"She doesn't want you here, either."
Either you leave... or I'll make you.
[ Man screams ]
[ Clatter ]
[ Sniffles ]
"[ Voice breaking ] I brought Alonso here from Peru to show him a better way, a more civilized way."

That the secret to coexisting with humans was just... eating enough to get by.
You shouldn't be stuck in some stall balling.
And isn't there someplace else you'd rather be?
"- With my mom, but..."
- But what?
Where's she at?
At the hospital with him.
But it's... it's kind of upsetting there.
- You should be there.
"- l know, but..."
Angelica.
"Oh, my God."
We have to go with Sharon to the hospital.
I'll get Tino to drive us.
He loves hospitals.
"And Ricky will come, too."
The four of us.
Right?
Come on.
I have really been cutting Bio a lot.
"So, I should probably skip the hospital."
So I'll see you later.
Hey.
is this where you come to smoke?
"I'm always doing that,  I'm always asking questions I already know the answers to,"
"- So, are you crying or something?"
- l guess.
- How come?
"- Because I'm lonely,"
"Because I have no friends,"
"Because I'm a terrible, terrible person,"
Because of my friends father is in the hospital.
And he could die.
There was little p.çleri. Now the dead.
I killed them.
A few friend like that.
"Around out there, the drugs sold."
All the dirt was making them.
I was doing the right thing.
I was going great.
Cleaned the streets.
Was wrong.
No one did not work.
Drugs flowed somehow.
The bad one always remained poor.
"Everything is about money, son."
Now I'm happy to be on this side.
The money side.
So do you.
- Okay?
"I'm doing it for you, you know?"
- I understand.
I understand.
- I am very grateful for everything you did for me.
- I love you.
You are my son.
Hallederken this job if you need me call me.
I call.
But you will not need to.
"However, take care."
To fix this problem.
"- If you are going across borders and customs control of the If I had transportation, it would be OAN'de."
- Oan?
- Public Transport.
"- Tool, the other should have been hired."
"I mean, why am I lying to my husband about whether or not I put gas in the car?"
It was stupid.
And we each thought the truth would destroy the other person.
Funny how that happens.
But we all want to have sex with someone new.
"It's risky, it's exciting, and that's okay."
But divorce over that?
I would never leave my husband for a better orgasm.
"Thank you, honey."
Do we have to do it in here?
"There's a private office downstairs, I think."
Mmm.
"Oh, God."
Hold that thought.
Hang on.
_
Is everything okay?
"Let me get you another drink, okay?"
There's no need to rush.
We're here to take our time.
You want me to wait?
You know what happens to those that wait.
Good things.
They come.
"Oh, God."
"Oh, excuse me."
"Neil, there you are."
What's wrong?
Adriana's done a very bad thing.
I don't know if I can fix it.
What the hell?
"- Oh, no."
"It's enough to make you scream, you know!"
People are supposed to sit here all night waiting for tickets!
Is it war or what?
"No coming, no going."
And no one to complain to.
No one to tell about it.
Such huge trains are running and they can't take just one person on.
What kind of business is that?
Parasites!
"- Hey, man, what's that you got?"
- A ticket.
- For the next train?
"- Right, it's coming."
- She said no tickets.
- This is WL.
It's expensive.
How expensive?
"Well, it's not that expensive, but it's good because..."
Oh shit!
"Make way, women!"
Can you hear me?
"Aunt Katya, take a broom and come to the buffet."
"Folks, who ties animals to the ticket office?"
"Someone tied a dog, now it's a steer."
It's no way.
"Untie him, please."
Hello.
Good day.
- Hi.
- It's occupied.
Oh God...
- I'll be right back.
"I was just, you know..."
- How are you?
"- I'm fine, I guess."
"Actually, no, I'm not fine."
I just broke up with my boyfriend.
(EX CLAIMING)
- I'm so sorry to hear that.
"- No, it's..."
- Do you want to hang out tonight?
- Sure.
- It was so fun.
You guys liked it.
- It was the most...
- Please tell me you got in the window.
- I got in the window.
(ALL CHEERING)
What is going on?
What is the window?
"You know how everyone has that guy or girl who, no matter what happens, you always remember them being the perfect one for you?"
- Mike Scharz.
- Lily.
That girl right over there.
"Well, that girl for me was and still is Maggie Wilks."
We all went to college together.
She was awesome.
Everybody loved her.
I think I know what we're dealing with here.
Tell me when to stop.
It wasn't that Maggie was hot.
She was...
She was the ultimate girl next door.
She was the ultimate girl next door.
"Then, we can have... fun afterwards."
Let's do that.
"Enough, okay?"
"I'm really sorry, so let's stop."
I'm a bastard.
"No, I'm an asshole, okay?"
I didn't ask you to apologize to me.
Have I ever done this to you before?
You've done wrong today!
What's wrong with you?
Is that the restaurant you mentioned?
"Yes, it is."
Let's go in.
We'll eat and have a drink.
You must be hungry.
You should eat.
"Let's have a drink, okay?"
Let's go.
Let's have some sushi.
- Welcome.
- Hello.
"- We can sit over there, right?"
- Yes.
- There's three of you?
- Yes.
I thought about it as I was walking.
You're too opportunistic.
Why all the fuss?
You nearly brought tears to my eyes.
What about me that's so opportunistic?
"Frankly, it wasn't tears but disgust."
You were just trying to show me that you're a man.
-lt is a question oftime.
-What are you talking about?
-And you?
-About this sniper.
-Have you swallowed some gas as well?
"- This was a gas canister, after all."
-Where is it?
- Overthere. lt has a hole in it.
I long for a drink right now!
Did the canister remain in place afterthe shot?
I'm not so stupid as to carry it here afterthe shot. I was underthe fire.
I ask you again.
Did it remain in place?
"Yes, itjustjumped up a little bit."
-Where is that place?
- On the road to the farm of Marek.
-Do you want me to showthe place to you?
"- No, I'll find it myself."
"-Listen, and why did you take me?"
- l did what?
-Why did you take me as a mate?
- l like your looks.
Do you?
"Listen, I can marryyou."
I need a woman like you who is serious and beautiful.
Eh?
Let's go.
We have no more business here fortoday.
You smell medicine.
It resembles some perfume.
Asya and I helped to bandage the wounded.
"You know, there are so manywounded people."
Sent it already.
Turn off the computer.
Turn off the computer.
Turn off the computer.
Turn off the computer.
Turn off the computer.
Damn it.
You shook her hand once.
Now you're all messed up inside.
That's the bravest you've been in 7 years.
The last time you were in bed before 9 was 7th grade.

Hold on.
"I have another deadline on Wednesday, right?"
Damn it. 7 hours gone with the wind.
I should have fixed the nail.
Shit!
I'm lying down but can't sleep.
Her nail is still broken.
Forget it.
No one will see it.
"But if you can see it, someone else might too!"
How could you send such crappy work like that?
Shit her nail is broken.
"If you try too hard to sleep, you can't sleep."
"If you want to fall asleep, don't try so hard."
But her nail is broken.
Sleep tight.
Good night.
"Good night, Morten."
"Good night, Martin."
It will be fun to see what important thing I forgot.
"Yes, it will be lovely."
"As long as there's food and wine, everything will be fine."
- You're not nervous at all?
"- No, I'm looking at it as a test."
- Of what?
- Anna will marry many times.
The first wedding is always hard.
"With a little luck, it will be okay."
Jørgen...
Jørgen?
Yes?
"- Mother, aren't you in bed?"
- I can't get on line.
Don't speak to me like I'm senile.
Why can't I get online?
There's poker in three minutes.
Why did we have to get that damn wireless network?
But it's working now.
Thank you.
- Sleep tight.
- Don't stay up all night.
Sorry.
- Could we teach her to knock first?
"- I've tried, but she's senile."
Only when she wants to be.
- I'll send her to a home tomorrow.
- Do you promise?
"He already fired Pete, who is a great producer."
Fire Pete?
He can't fire Pete.
You know what?
I quit.
He can suck it.
Mm-hmm.
"Yeah, suck it, Pete."
"No, you're not listening."
You're not a good listener.
MAN:
20 minutes to air.
But Liz said we were cutting the cat-lady sketch.
She said it stinks.
Ouch.
This is why Liz is wrong.
Animal humor is universal.
I just don't think that I'm good in it.
Do you think I'm good in it?
I think this is your opportunity to go out there and prove everybody wrong.
What?
What do you mean?
Who's everybody?
"The network that wanted to fire you, the focus groups that said you had a weird eye..."
You mean this eye?
"Okay, this eye, it doesn't open all the way because when I was little, my sister peed in it."
Tonight is your opportunity to go out there and change all of our minds.
What?
!
Where is Liz?
!
Liz!
We're allowed to have a bit of a difference of opinion.
Tell me we're not rushing Dallas.
We're not rushing Dallas.
"You know what I'm talking about, right?"
"No, not really."
"Mel, Dallas is happening."
"I have job and it looks like you have a job too,"
- if you want it.
- Maybe I don't want it.
You said you did.
Things change.
People change.
- So you're not coming?
- That's not what I'm saying.
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying that I'm nervous.
- I'm getting scared.
- Doc?
Sorry...
Just hang on a sec.
- Mel...
- I have to get back to Nicole.
"Doc, the nurse says we got a green light."
He's all yours.
- Thanks.
- And Officer?
I've taken a strict inventory of Mr. Pike's injuries.
"There are detailed notes on every bruise, scratch, and cut."
OK...
"So if he ends up back here with a new injury, I'll know where it came from."
Get him out of here.
I don't see her.
You see?
Okay bring the pry bars in.
Push!
Get them in there!
Get them under.
"Good, good."
That's it.
Watch your clothes.
"Carefully, carefully!"
Weahh!
Sorry Indy.
"Indy, why does the floor move?"
Give me your torch.
Snakes.
Why did it have to be snakes?
Asps.
Very dangerous.
You go first.
"If you're trying to escape on foot, the desert is three weeks in every direction."
So please eat something.
I must apologize for the treatment of you.
Yeah?
Who's idea was it?
"No food, no water."
What kind of people are these friends of yours?
This particular time and place and for my work they are necessary evils.
Not my friends.
"However, with the right connections, even in this part of the world we are not entirely uncivilized."
Beautiful.
I would very much like to see you in it.
Ha!
I bet you would.
At least I got the one.
Right?
Yeah.
"Get out, get out, get out."
We got a lot of work to do.
"Good, good."
- Ah!
- Mm-hmm.
What are we doing?
"Charlie, you're, like, the toughest guy we know."
- Yeah?
"- So nobody can kick your ass, right?"
- Practically invincible.
- Yeah.
"Yeah, what's your point though?"
Well...
"So here's what's gonna happen, pal."
Dennis and I are gonna train you... to be an underground street fighter.
What?
That is brilliant.
"- Yeah, it is."
"- Okay, what's the first step?"
- First step is getting that shirt off.
"- Yeah, let's get that shirt off."
- Why would I do that?
- That shirt's just gonna weigh you down.
"Yeah, and Rocky never wears a shirt when he trains... so let's just go ahead and rip that bad boy off."
I think I'm gonna wear it.
That's ridiculous.
"You can't train and wear a shirt, dude."
Now it's becoming this whole big thing.
It feels a little gay.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I got your message the other day.
"I meant to call you back, but I forgot."
Don't you remember leaving me that message?
"Chief, this is John Klein."
I didn't call him.
"No, it's not me."
I analyzed both tapes with the voice print.
I don't care.
It may be my voice.
It's not me.
- It is not me.
- Listen to me.
I would swear in a court of law that that's your voice.
"Yeah, great."
Thanks.
Shit!
"Regular coffee to go, please."
Seventy-five cents.
Have a great day.
Do you know that woman?
- What woman?
- She just left.
You didn't see her?
- No.
- That's strange.
"She had long red hair, green eyes, real pretty, and she was asking about you."
- Did you see which way she went?
- No.
- What did she say?
- She asked a lot of strange questions.
What are you doing here?
"Stop, I say!"
"Oh, my God!"
"Cancel those shipments of wine, grain, straw!"
Cancel everything!
"- Dennis, here she is."
Griselda!
- Here I am.
It's me!
"Dennis, it was always you!"
You's the one we was pushing for.
We'll have the wedding tomorrow.
This afternoon.
We'll get the bishop.
"Dennis, you're wonderful."
"Griselda, at last we can have the life we always wanted."
"My boy, congratulations."
We offer you our heartfelt thanks.
You have cleared the kingdom of a great menace.
I am happy to fulfill my promise and to bestow upon you...
- What's his name?
- It's Dennis.
"Dennis Cooper, Your Royalshipness."
"That's his fiancée, my daughter."
"You, Dennis one half of my entire kingdom."
"And the hand in marriage of my daughter, the princess."
"Come, my boy."
To the palace!
Griselda!
I pronounce you man and wife.
Prince and princess!
Dennis!
Griselda!
Hey!
How did you get up there?
From further up.
Is this the country road between Kamenice and Bournak?
- It will be when it's finished.
- And when would that be?
A year from now.
- More exactly?
- In May.
"Hold on, for Heaven's sake!"
"All right, all right!"
I'm all right!
But I don't really know the exact time.
Is it '84 now?
"It's half past four, if you please!"
"Just stay there, I'll fetch help."
1984.
"Floods in Italy, the Security Council is having a meeting..."
Everything fits.
Call the Central World Brain!
We have to wait for that.
Only Katya knows the password.
Let's try it like this:
Adam 84 calling CWB.
There isn't the slightest hope without the password.
Do something!
Can't you hear it's picking up interference?
Just search under the letter P. Quickly!
"Not that, that's Periodicals!"
Maybe the next one.
We said unobtrusively!
- Am I needed?
That's not the information I have.
I swayed them once.
I could do it again.
[phone chimes]
I doubt it.
You're no longer that guy.
[whirs] [scooter horn beeps]
"- Hey, man."
You're out of line.
"- That's all right, I know the boss."
"""Proletariat""?"
"Oh, I get it, ""Coffee for the people."""
Eight bucks.
"Rich people, I guess."
"- Who do we have to thank for that, Chip?"
- Karl Marx?
"You, man."
They jacked up the rent on all the stores down here because of that hotel you made us think we wanted.
"Look, man, I lost my store too."
"Look, what do you want, Chip?"
- Just a coffee.
- No.
Your money's no good here.
"- Thanks, man."
I appreciate it.
"- No, man."
I don't want your business.
"All right, man."
I'll...
I'll think about it.
You want change?
"I just wanna say a big thank you to those of you who came out to the funeral last Wednesday of my dog, Pinot."
"You know babies go waa, waa, waa."
Look at me.
I think I'm so cool even though I'm just a big jerk.
Yeah.
And you know what that big jerk is.
Such a jerk
He went over and he slapped Justin in the face.
You know what Justin did?
Justin spit on him.
"And Danny, he was so mean, he was like ""Hey Justin."
"You give me your sweater"""
"You, you give me your sweater and... and I'm gonna do a high kick."
I'm gonna do another high kick.
"High kick, high kick, high kick"
And that was it.
Yeah.
Maybe I embellished a little bit but I feel like you guys got the gist.
Unbelievable.
Move Unbelievable.
Why is Danny being so mean?
Why can't you see what's going on?
Don't you remember the first time you met?
Of course I do.
It was right there in that office.
"Oh, I remember it like it was yesterday."
- ♪ That's all I really want ♪ - _
♪ some fun uh-uh-un ♪ ♪ don't you love me baby ♪
"♪ oh, girls ♪ ♪ they want to have fu-un ♪"
♪ Oh girls they wanna... ♪
- Justin?
- I didn't see you come in.
- Yes.
He really is a coward.
Fortunately I can run very fast.
Biggie!
Biggie!
"Mr. Chiu, what's the matter?"
Ask her to help me get dressed.
Biggie!
You only read the script in this moment.
Why are you still hesitating?
Hurry...
"You see me as nothing, hurry..."
How dare you.
Collect the laundry fee again?
Came back here.
"I'm not pushing you, you can paid me few days later."
Clean my wife's underwear too.
Well...
You clean it or not?
"Yes, but my sister will scold me."
I will bit you.
"Huang, you'll meet your match!"
"Master Tam, you've got a visitor."
A visitor?
Our school's famous in Canton.
You're a wanted man.
"True, we're partners in the past."
But I don't want to be investigated now.
I think you better lay low.
I still treasure our friendship.
I've got friends in the opera troupe.
Why don't you join them?
And we'll find a way for you.
Nothing!
Nothing!
"I tell you I saw them, as clear as I see you now."
The captain's gone completely crazy.
He should be locked up.
He's becoming dangerous.
Everyone seems to know about it.
News travels fast around here.
People are staying indoors.
- There's no way they can know.
- We've said too much.
There's that sailor who saw the girls in the ship cemetery.
"What about Louise, did she see anything?"
Louise?
"Yes, maybe."
She has second sight.
Tragedy is upon the village.
Tonight he will be free!
Who do you mean?
The one who hides in the ruins.
I can see him!
He is waiting
He is calling.
I can see you!
"Open this door, so the devil's fury may be unleashed on this cursed land."
Let the death of us all be the price of your life.
Unleash all the forces of evil upon us!
I will give you the power.
Go on.
That's it!
Now open the door.
Good.
"Whatever, Mama."
"Santana, I brought you something."
"You know, when Jesus was crucified on the cross, there was a thief named Dismas on the cross next to him."
He believed in Jesus and asked him not to forget him when he died.
"When Jesus died, he took Dismas to heaven and Dismas became a saint."
I want you to wear it.
"Let me see it, Mama."
"Mi hijo, let's put it on your brother."
Okay.
Santana.
"Excuse me, ma'am."
You're not supposed to pass items to convicts.
But you see what it is.
Sorry.
That's policy.
He can pick this up with the rest of his property you brought for him.
"You'll wear it, huh?"
SANTANA:
I'll wear it.
Don't worry.
They'll give it to me later.
(SANTANA SPEAKS spanish) I'm okay.

"He had never deceived me, but for that night."
I always lost sleep and waited anxiously for his return.
"The time passed, one, two. three."
One gets preoccupied and concerned with... the thought that something might have happened.
"Telemessage, the person you called is unavailable."
FiIippo?
Is it you?
Also drunk again.
You are unable to even vomit.
Come back to say you lost all your money?
I lost everything.
Who won now?
The dull.
The blonde.
"I said to you, no more games."
"So I played once again, so what?"
Alright.
It is not the most important thing in the world.
And how much did you lose?
All of it.
I've lost totally.
Totally!
All of it.
All.
I have nothing left.
You have your wife.
"She is a beautiful woman, your wife."
-Only for one night.
"-Or pay the ten million, which you owe."
-Your wife is a precious woman.
-And very lucky.
Yes.
Worth's half a million!
is she inlaid with diamonds?
Ridiculous!
Thank you...
"Hello Sam, how are you?"
I'm Joe!
Why so many foreigners in white suit here tonight?
A Yank's grandma get married the 8th time to an officer.
They are holding a party to celebrate!
You still remember this song?
"Of course I remember, you cruise chick with this song."
"Play it again, Sam!"
You want a woman?
What?
"You dirty pimp, leave my husband alone!"
"The soup's tasteless, add some soya sauce!"
What?
Add some soya sauce!
Did you say 'Get some sort of toys'?
Did you...?
"- Must be you, I'm damn sure!"
- American.
"Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Sandra!"
You want woman?
He wants to kill me!
Get some sort of toys!
Help yourself!
I'm American!
American!
He run away!
"Hi, Hitler!"
- Hotel Hong Kong!
Bitter!
I thought you'd break my arm again.
"Kolya, you are so nice."
And amusing.
You are like a brother.
I used to meet a boy.
His name was Volodya.
He was a pilot.
I must have loved him.
He perished in his plane.
Just a day after he was kissing my hands.
"Then another boy Andrei, used to court me."
He was a scout and died too.
Then Vanya.
I began feeling fear.
It is dangerous to love me.
Do you understand that?
-You'd rather come back.
"- l'll be back, Olya."
"And we'll kill your sniper, that's for sure."
Take myword on that.
"I, Kolya Malakhov, give you this word."
We'll kill him.
"Astra, Astra, Carnation on air."
I'm at the door readyto enter.
"- Got it, wait for an invitation."
- Got it.
We are waiting.
"Go to our positions, afteryourfirst salvo Malyutin will advance to the hill."
"Yes, sir."
"Comrade mayor, Colonel Egorov is on the line."
"Yes, comrade colonel."
He is not!
Henry would not date Dylan.
Why not?
You're not dating her anymore.
"Well, I mean, he can date her if he wants, but he knows I still like her."
I don't think he would ask her out on a date.
"But then again, I guess he did."
Huh.
"It's, uh..."
I can't believe that.
Fancy that.
I can't either.
"You're not maybe planning on going to the movies with Alice and then bumping into Henry and Dylan and doing a little do-si-do, are you?"
Go back upstairs.
You're not going anywhere.
And give me your phone.
What's the code?
D-Y-L-A-N.
(SIGHS) I figured.
"Look, come on, Dad, just let me go out with her."
Adrian's boyfriend is asking her to marry him and she's practically engaged and Amy's married and it's not fair!
See ya.
Can I at least call Alice and tell her not to come over?
"Her number's in your contacts, right?"
I'll call her.
"All right, that's just an invasion of privacy!"
Go.
I'm too old to be sent to my room!
I'm divorced!
I've lost a child!
I'm over 18.
I'm an adult!
Pardon me.
What are we going to do about this Chummy individual?
We can't allow her to sing.
"The minute she opens her mouth, the ushers will open the doors."
"That's where you're wrong, Chowsky she'll be the biggest laugh in the show."
- But she takes it seriously.
- The audience won't.
Tell her her number's in.
[sighs]
Go on.
"Alright, dearie, let's try it."
Start from the first.

* So completely awed I couldn't speak *
* Never knew a heart could beat this way *
* When we meet this way
* Can I help
* But say
* You're an angel
* You're so understanding
* Think of heaven handing me
* A dream like you
* You're an angel
* You're an inspiration
* What a combination

Come on!
"Back then, they had no electricity."
The only light was fire.
Everything was dangerous then.
"Dinosaurs, mammoths, other tribes, but when the fire went out, it got dark and more dangerous."
"Since then, we associate dark with danger."
"Since then, we're afraid of the dark."
"They're dark, so we're afraid of them."
We won't tell them that.
So we split it up.
Who...?
"I'II take their statements, OK?"
I'II look around the backyard.
There might be some clues.
"Who's first, next?"
Go ahead.
- No.
You go Ducky.
- You go.
Who got here first?
Him.
Me.
polo's in his room with his toys.
Change the batteries in his walkman.
You'II find some in the top of his dresser.
"Name, age and profession."
"Bertrand JoyaI, 48, divorced."
I've worked on the Van KIee farm for 10 years.
You knew Mrs Lajeunesse well?
I sure knew her well.
tell me about her.
"C,duIie had an income."
This highlight needle pen has the perfect mix of science and art.
"First, place the box in the center of the paper."
This activity is so 6th grade.
But it's actually kind of fun.
January.
Number 133.
Sawasdee Pee Mai (Happy New Year in Thai)
Happy New...
Sawasdee Pee Mai is better.
"Hello doc, Sawasdee Pee Mai."
"Umm doc, last month I'm..."
Number 134.
Sorry...
Damn your hands are freaking cold.
"Just like when you rode that roller coaster, right before it flipped upside down."
I'm Assanai.
Am I in the wrong room?
"No, you are not."
Doctor Chonnikarn is doing rounds in the ward.
Today let me check on your progress.
That's okay.
I can come back next month.
Why?
So I can be examined by Doctor Imm.
She's handling my case.
I'm following her treatment plan.
She wrote down all your history.
So your treatment plan is the same.
C'mon.
I studied the same specialty as Doctor Imm.
I won't kill you.
Let me see your arm.
- Yeah.
- Jacob.
I heard you were leaving.
- Can you give me one last blessing?
- Sure.
May the force be with you.
That... that's it?
"Yeah, I'm afraid so."
"For more details, see your local priest or rabbi."
Take care.
"- So, you all good?"
"- Yeah, I'm good."
"- Good, good..."
- More or less.
"Just, um..."
"I mean, you know, crazy as it sounds, I-I miss God."
"Well, if it's of any comfort,"
I'm sure God would be thrilled at your recovery.
Really?
How do you figure?
'Cause you serve God's neediest people by making tons of money and giving it away.
- God loves charity.
- All right.
"If you wandered the world with a begging bowl, who would that help?"
- Absolutely no one.
- Nobody.
"In fact, it'd be a sin."
"So go forth, continue to do God's work."
- All right.
Golf next week.
- Done.
"So, uh, is there anybody home?"
I want you to tell me that you know for a fact there's nothing wrong with my daughter except in her mind!
Tell me you know for a fact that an exorcism wouldn't do any good!
You tell me that!
Did Regan know a priest was coming over?
No.
Did you know my mother died recently?
"Yes, I did."
I'm very sorry.
Is Regan aware of it?
Not at all.
Why do you ask?
It's not important.
Good night.
"You know, I'm like in seclusion."
"No, I'm just exhausted from work."
-What should I say anyway?
-Just talk to your daddy.
Tell him what you've been doing and how you're feeling.
I hope you can hear me.
Can you hear me okay?
He's not going to answer you.
"Talk to your daddy, honey."
I don't know what to say.
"Well, let's see."
First we....
No....
Wait.
I don't know.
-Tell him about Washington.
-Okay.
"You see, we're in Washington now, Daddy, and...."
"""He broke the bread, and gave it to his disciples and said:"
It appeared to me he was dead.
So I went in pursuit of the suspect and called it in.
He got into a dark four-door sedan.
Late model.
Headed east on Malpassat Road.
"I got a partial on the plate, George-Robert-Victor."
George-Robert-Victor...
George-Robert-Victor- Zebra-9-0-3?
That's Officer Pritchard's car.
- Was it a black Chrysler 300?
- Uh...
Was it Pritchard you saw?
I only saw him for a second.
"It was dark, but... but who else could it be?"
Okay.
Have you photoed the body yet?
What topic?
Your sexual orientation.
My sexual orientation?
"Yes, your sexuality."
If you like men or women.
"When you came to see me, you said you were still a virgin."
Well...
"To answer your question in some way,"
I think I'm oriented more towards men.
Was that why you came to see me?
I can't remember now.
I guess so.
But I'm fine now.
Do you have a partner?
More or less.
I'm not alone anymore.
"Well, I'll get some kind of a job and start up the old road again."
"(male #2) 'What's the assessment, my good fellow?"
'
"(male #3) One forty, sir."
"Here you are, there's five dollars."
You keep the change.
"Thank you, sir."
And buy yourself a haircut with it.
"Ah, there you are, children."
"Father, where were you?"
I've been worried to death.
"Serving our noble cause, my dear."
"Here, just feast your eyes on that."
Fifteen thousand!
"Well, who's Magenta P. Schultz?"
"- Why, that..."
"- Father, how did you get it?"
When I told the Duchess the predicament we were in she insisted on helping us out.
- Insisted?
"- Yes, my dear."
Insisted.
"Ah, there's a woman for you."
Isn't it splendid?
"Come, come, my boy."
Reassemble the cast.
"Order the costumes, strike up the band."
The show will go on.
[laughing] [mumbling] Abracadabra.
Abra..
Abracadabra!
Abracadabra!
Here's your money.
"Oh, my God."
"Ted, did you..."
- Big time.
- Nice!
High five!
Wait.
No!
No!
Retraction five!
"Hey, hey, you're the one who begged for a proxy bang."
"And while we're on the subject of family, I'm pretty sure you banged my mom."
Mom beats sister.
I never banged your mom.
You...
You just did the winking thing again!
"No, I didn't."
Fine.
"Hey, Barney."
Let me ask you something.
"Were you, uh, feeling a little sore this morning?"
Especially...
Friendship over!
"Oh, yeah."
"Who's your ""guitar-player-biker who couldn't find mild salsa... that said 'Screw it' and went medium"" bad boy?"
Oh.
"Marshall, your hand!"
"Okay, I'm pretty sure it wasn't that bad... but this is how Uncle Marshall likes to tell the story."
"Oh, yeah, no."
That's the cuff.
"I'm woozy, and I can't flex my fingers."
And the rotten-fish smell is getting stronger.
But I'm learning to compensate with my left.
What's wrong?
Nothing uncle.
People live their lives...
I'm teaching my life to live that's all.
Long ago I gave you an advice.
Forgo rangefinder your enemy with a smile.
I think you didn't learn.
I did.
I learned.
I also learnt that if you want to move ahead... pull down your opponent's pants.
He'll bend over and I'll hop over him.
And I'll win.
That's it.
Come on let's talk work.
There's a contract.
Let's sit and talk.
- Yes.
- You won't learn.
Let's talk business.
The job is from Home Minister Pradhan... and he's an old customer.
And the contract's ACP Thakur.
This boy recently arrived in Delhi.
And he tried to disgrace Ayushman's sister.
They need outside help so I had to come to you.
Uncle.
Is your information right.
Why?
What's wrong?
The boy looks decent.
I can't believe.
Sometimes innocent looking people... are the most dangerous ones.
And the Big Boss has accepted the contract... and that's it.
The two of us basically have a date.
And then he calls and invites me to a party at his place.
JANINE:
He so likes you.
I'm so happy for you.
Let's look up places for your destination wedding.
How do you feel about Napa Valley?
I have really always wanted to go there.
"Oh, he's cute."
Yeah.
Smoldering but sensitive.
"Oh. ""All I have is my guitar, these chords, and the truth."""
BOTH:
Bon Jovi.
- That's hot.
- Yeah.
I like him.
"I mean, he probably hasn't called yet because we just had coffee last night."
- Really?
MARY:
"Yeah, you know."
"I mean, we actually video iChatted while holding coffee."
"But that's the same thing, right?"
"- Right, right."
- Just call your voicemail.
"Yeah, but he had a gig last night and he probably didn't get home till late."
- Did I tell you he's a singer?
- Mm-hm.
- Just call.
JOSHUA:
"Oh, honey, no, on speaker."
I don't think so.
"My friends out there, they drink"
Put it down.
- Why sir?
Are you trying to con me?
You aren't getting anything.
Put it down
You're getting worked up over nothing.
This is for your profit
Will you put it down?
- Not that umbrella
Here you are.
A pound extra?
No two.
"Keep it, okay?"
Shameless!
You call yourself a Hindustani?
You give India a bad name
You're a liar and insolent!
Get out of here
I'm off.
I'll keep this
Rev up!
Babuji
What is the matter?
You're late.
- Bloody shameless scoundrel
They call themselves Hindustani!
Blot on India!
Ought to drown themselves
Rascals!
"No shame, no decency."
How to respect their elders... they don't even know.
"Are you sure you're okay, dude?"
"No, I'm not."
"I start thinking, you know, and it makes..."
It makes me so angry.
What am I saying?
Okay.
Were gonna go...
We're gonna go sign you up for the fight.
- Yes!
- And you stay here and eat your eggs.
Have the...
Have...
Make sure you eat some of the sandwich.
"- Yeah, you can just meet us down there, all right?"
- Can you meet us later?
Meet you later?
Can I meet you later?
- Are you gonna meet us?
"- Yes, I'm gonna meet you there later!"
All right.
"All right, sign here, here and here."
And what is this?
These are waiver forms in case your fighter is seriously injured... or killed.
"Oh, we don't care about that."
Sign away.
"- What's the, uh, fighter's name?"
- Clown Baby.
- Clown Ba...
Clown Baby?
- Yeah.
- You mean like a baby clown?
- Not a baby clown.
And it's self conscious.
Conscious of self.
Right.
"I mean, yeah, yeah."
I'm self conscious.
"Which is a good thing, I think."
What do you think?
"Well, I mean, I think it's really good."
I'm all about my work.
And my body is my work.
"So... one might say that... yeah, I'm all about my body."
"But in some respects, that is true, but you're completely missing the point."
And the point is...
I completely missed my point.
"Ok, rewind, reset."
"Uh, look."
I've... got a great vibe between you and me.
Great energy there.
"So, yeah."
Ok.
I get it.
So let's lay the facts down.
"You want to be with me, and vice versa."
That much is clear.
But my work always comes first.
I need to lay that...
down right off the bat.
"Basically, my body comes before you."
He seems perfect.
"Good looking, somewhat single minded, somewhat vain... and not too bright."
No promise of a great romance.
No chance of falling...
I'm sorry.
I can't right now.
"Hey, Meredith."
Petty Officer Brian Smith?
Yeah.
There's a whole ship full of people looking for you.
May want to put a shirt on.
You're coming with us.
Stay with her.
Stop!
- Look out!
- Whoa!
I said stop!
Hey!
I know a dead guy with bruises just like yours.
Look at it.
"Oh, is that a little tough to look at?"
"Here, how about this one?"
Maybe a closer shot.
I didn't do that.
It wasn't me.
Says the guy who just ran two blocks to get away.
"I can explain everything, all right?"
"Oh, you can?"
!
"Well, thank goodness for that."
'Cause finding you in the dead guy's girlfriend's apartment with your pants around your ankles doesn't exactly scream innocent.
"In my business, it's called motive."
Think I killed him for Meredith?
People kill for a lot less.
"I woke up around 6:00, and Brian was pounding on my door."
Said he and Caleb got into a fight.
I see the light!
It's really attractive to me.
"Robin, are you alright?"
I'm perfectly alright...!
- ls that really you?
- Of course it's me!
Remember when you left me 3 years ago.
"No sleep at night, no waking up in the morning."
Couldn't eat at meals.
Why were you so cruel?
There are even crueler things!
"Your Excellency, may I present my fiancee!"
You son of a bitch...
Your Excellency!
You alright...!
"Stop it, I'm fine now!"
Do you know one another?
Know her?
Never!
There's little left of whom I knew!
The one I knew is dead.
My soul was betrayed 3 years ago.
"And 3 years later, her own soul is being betrayed!"
What's left is just a walking corpse.
For the world to laugh at!
What wonderful lines!
If Yeats could have heard you just now.
He would have saluted you indeed!
Fantastic...!
Thank you...!
Someone's fainted again!
Couldn't take your speech!
Because I told you to.
You get up so early.
I have to stop that.
I really shouldn't walk around here like this.
I can't find that red blouse that you bought me. I wanted to wear it.
- The one time I need tape.
- l put it in the wash.
There is tape.
It's in the drawer like always.
- l wanted to wear it.
"- We'll put it in the dryer, sweetie."
"- Oh, my God."
- [Lily] What?
They're pink.
Those were in the washer?
- Yeah. I put them in last night.
"- Oh, my God."
I don't think you're supposed to mix colors and khaki stuff.
Are you?
How do I make them not pink?
I don't think you can.
- Sorry.
"- l think they're cool, actually."
- You don't have to wear them.
- Why did you put them in?
I think Atlantor would appreciate seeing a different side of Rick.
The pinker side.
I don't have to take this abuse.
I'm out of here.
I hope not in those pants.
- Fade-away jump!
- Jess.
"- No, thank you."
I really don't eat meat.
I'll just go ahead with the penne.
- Spicy?
"- Yes, please."
Thanks.
"So, how are..."
Will and the boy?
"Let's forego the small talk today, Shelly."
- It'll make me feel cheap.
- Let the big talk begin.
Have you seen this?
That's my...
"That's my file on you, Senator."
- Mm-hmm.
- How did you get it?
Have you read it yet?
How did you get it?
Have you read it?
- What do you have to say for yourself?
"- With all due respect... um, Senator..."
- it doesn't matter what I have to say for myself.
"- Oh, it doesn't?"
"It seems to me, Mr. Chairman, all you can claim about me..."
"claim, is that I had sex..."
- Deviant sex.
- Who says it was deviant?
I do.
"And what I say, the people will believe."
And you know why?
Because I'll have a very big microphone in front of me.
"Wow, you must really hate me, Shelly."
I was trying to rescue a woman.
She's a doctor.
She got kidnapped by the Janjaweed.
Her name's Clare Somersby.
- The aid worker.
- Yeah.
She's going to die.
"Along with a lot of other people, if you don't help me."
Please?
There's no sign yet of Stonebridge on any of the satellite feeds.
Widen the grid reference.
What about Matak?
According to his office he's away on an official engagement.
"No, he's stalling."
He's just hoping nothing will stick to him.
See if she was arrested as well and get me on a flight to Khartoum.
I'm going to have to deal with this personally.
(SPEAKING IN SUDANESE ARABIC)
(DOOR CLOSING)
Thank you.
I need a phone.
I have done all that I can.
For you and the other one.
I'm sorry.
Hey.
What do you mean the other one?
Hendricks.
He came in last night.
He'd been in a car accident.
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)
I have to go.
(SINGING)
I gotta go.
Now...
Where were we?
Myka did name the ferret.
She's just not telling Pete the name.
- Why not?
- Because she named it Pete.
"Yeah, it's cute, but so annoying."
- That's good.
I like that.
"- You think that's funny, huh?"
"Because if she thinks we know, she'll kill him."
Name's Pete.
"Look, you're in trouble and I'm here to help."
"That chip that you have, the one that's changed your luck..."
- Let go or I'll scream.
"- Jillian, it's hurting you."
"Okay, that is a contact wound."
Wishing objects do that.
"This one seems to be a bit addictive and we both know that that's bad, right?"
"So you keep the money, but you give me the chip."
"Gary's sick too, isn't he?"
"You gotta stop while you're ahead, Jillian."
Trust me.
Don't make me use this.
"The Jubilee Grand, right?"
The fire?
What are you gonna do with it?
I am gonna put this on a shelf and ignore it forever.
I know.
Now watch.
Watch what?
"I mean, of course, it needs a lot of work, but wow!"
I think I'm having goose bumps.
Oh!
The minbar can go right there.
And my office can be in that room with the family
- Of angry racoons!
- Yes!
Wow!
Wow!
Wow!
Why is there a team
- With a wrecking ball out front?
"- Like I said, the place is scheduled for demolition."
- [Together]:
Today?
"- Yeah, in 15 minutes or so."
"But don't worry, guys!"
I can find you a place exactly like this...
probably.
- Can't we stop them?
- No.
Only the mayor can stop the demolition now.
- How do you even know that?
- She likes to brag.
"You guys really want this place, don't you?"
- More than anything!
- Huh.
- OK.
You go find Ann and I'll stay here and make sure
- They don't tear it down.
- Brilliant!
[ Rayyan sighs. ]
"You know, haiukon."
Just...
- How was your journey?
- Great.
Thanks.
- The car pick you up okay?
- Yeah.
Wow.
This way.
Are they... seeing?
It's cool.
Very cool.
Wow.
Come on.
Feel like I'm gonna go meet Dumbledore.
Hope I get Gryffindor.
I'm gonna need your phone and anything else you might use to send and receive.
"- A little paranoid, don't you think?"
- Can't be too careful.
"Okay, there you go."
"Wow, you really are paranoid."
Whoa!
It's white.
Um...
"Okay, so I'm guessing this says, like, I agree to have my kidneys harvested?"
"Actually, it's a pretty standard NDA-disclaimer thing."
Okay.
It's important that you realize there is a small medical procedure involved.
"Sorry, for a game?"
"Nothing permanent and we don't harvest your kidneys,"
- I promise.
- Okay.
They found the money.
Good work.
I'm watching it now.
What is the connection to the deaths of James Bone and Tino Zapatti?
"What was Santos doing with $40,000?"
The mayor understands the implications of the discovery in Ulster County but would like to stress that these are implications only.
Can you believe this shit?
We never set foot in that dump after Eddie's father died.
-lt's full of hornets' nests.
"-Yeah, busy hornets."
Never in our life did we see $4000 cash...
... muchless40 .
There's only two people know that's not Eddie 's money.
You and me.
Who is this?
Vinnie Zapatti.
I can get you out of this.
"I can get you the pension, the medals."
You want them?
"Sure, sure, I want them."
Good.
"Now, I liked Eddie  andI wannahelpyou , but you gotta help me."
What's that mean?
"An airplane ticket and $ 10,000."
"$1 0,000!"
"For God's sake, I can't--"
-A lot of money!
What've you got?
-Who are you?
Marybeth Cogan.
Detectives' Endowment Association.
I represent the Santos family.
You've got three children.
Ah.
"Oh, if this phone could only talk."
"Well, it can if you want it to."
Everything you want to know about will is right in there.
"His friends, his music, everything."
"No, no, I-I can't invade his privacy that way."
I can.
"No, put that down."
Someone's texting him.
It's from Stephanie.
"""Did you tell your mom yet?"
"Did she freak?""..."
Freak?
About what?
What does he need to tell me?
"Well, find out yourself."
Pretend you're will and text her back.
I shouldn't do that.
"But as a mother,"
"I need to know what's going on with my son... by any means possible, right?"
- Indeed you do.
- Absolutely.
Okay.
"""How should I tell her?""..."
"Oh, I shouldn't have done that."
I just totally violated his privacy.
I am done with this.
"Ooh, she texted back."
"""Why are you texting like an old lady?""..."
"Ah, you shouldn't have spelled everything correctly."
Oh.
"- Hey, what happened?"
"- Good driving, Yo-Yo."
"Yeah, that was neat."
This bus can really move.
"Tony, look through the window."
The rear window.
That minibus is following us.
I command you to place obstacles in its path.
City property.
I've damaged city property.
They said these glasses were shatterproof.
Was that a bus or a bridge?
They're still with us.
"Tony, you must stop her."
"Man, that man was really buzzing."
Am I still alive?
They're gaining on us.
She counteracts everything that Tony does.
"Tony, you've got to stop her."
We flew!
They must've flown.
Don't you dare try it.
Sickle...
"Sickle, stop..."
Stop over that hill.
"Tony, cause the reflection of the sun on the rear window to magnify and shine so brightly that our pursuers'll be blinded by it."
"Come on, open the doors."
I can't see.
- Yeah.
"- Come on, let me out."
- Everybody OK?
"- Yeah, sure."
Say the rest.
I need to hear it.
I love francis more.
What's this?
Open it.
It's blank.
it's nothing.
She let me decide.
"It's odd, isn't it?"
That your mother was the one
To show me what was truly in my heart.
You.
It's you.
It's always been you.
Does this mean you'll marry me?
Yes.
We must protect sebastian.
There are those who will punish him
For reaching for the throne.
Of course.
I'll make sure of it.
I am sorry for the way things have gone.
But the outcome is this.
You need to leave here
And never come back.
"You've reached for the crown,"
And you failed to get it.
You'll be seen by many as a threat.
"The crown was never in my grasp,"
"But I had mary, and it galls you."
I was going to disappear in exile.
"That's your goal now, if you want to survive."
Are you in his apartment?
Are you on the bed?
No.
I'm not on the bed.
- Is he there?
- No...
Not exactly.
Is he taking a shower?
He's getting take-out for dinner.
And this call's becoming very 1-900.
"To talk to a hot English teacher, press 3."
Call ending now.
- Tomorrow?
"- Yeah, tomorrow."
- Hey.
- Hey.
"- Sorry, it took so long."
- It's okay.
Looks like Rose of Sharon has been discovered.
Big crowd at the take-out counter.
I meet your dad tomorrow.
I know.
I was thinking this is gonna be a bit more complex than the usual parent-teacher discussion.
"I mean, I can see your mom as a colleague, she's safe."
But your dad is your dad.
Which is complex.
"You will like him, he'll like you."
Just be your normal incredible self.
What is he after?
He's probably just what he says he is.
A nephew cleaning up after a distant relative.
Probably?
"- Yea, I mind."
Actually...
Do what you like.
It doesn't matter anyway.
I'll take it out to the stairs.
"Oh Violet, you might wanna wipe your prints off those pieces."
Put them back on the fellas.
"Sounds good, Daze."
Come on sit down!
I wanna show you something.
You know you'd probably a millionaire if you clean your ears out more often.
No uh!
Here.
Now what were you going to tell me?
"Yea, the secret."
You were going to tell me.
Can I ask you somethin'?
Why is she so mad at you?
"- She's your friend, you tell me."
- I'm not talking about Violet!
- She blames me for something.
- For what?
- Her mother's death.
"- Why, did you kill her?"
"No, no."
She died after she left me.
- Why did she leave you?
- She didn't love me.
- Why didn't she love you?
"- I don't know, Daisy."
I don't think people have a lot of control over that sort of thing.
"As a husband, I wasn't much a prize anyway."
I'll bet Picnic is the first movie she saw when she came to the United States.
She looks like she's sleeping.
Sweet dreams.
"Al, she didn't commit suicide."
She was murdered.
Are you sure that's a bullet hole?
I saw more than a few of these in my last year in med school.
How could the chief of police miss this when he pulled her out of the water?
"Well, uh, maybe her hair was covering it or--"
I don't see an exit wound.
I guess the bullet's still in there.
"Sam, you're not gonna-- Al,"
"I'm a-- a doctor, right?"
"Oh, yeah."
Yeah.
"But, I mean, that-- that-- that does-- that doesn't mean-- Well, you know."
The only clue we've got... is the bullet.
[ Chuckling Nervously ]
I think I'm gonna go get a cup of coffee.
[ Metal Clinks ]
[ Sighs ]
"You can come out now, Al."
It's over.
- Is that the bullet?
- No.
Shrapnel.
I found it under an old scar behind her ear.
"Oh, from the war."
"Well, where's the bullet?"
There wasn't any.
There wasn't any?
Small entrance wound.
Lydia might.
What if she doesn't know anything?
"Well, he doesn't have a restraining order against me, so..."
I'll talk to him myself.
"Okay, what do I do?"
"You have a make-up exam, remember?"
Promise me.
"If he does anything, you run the other way."
I can take care of myself.
"Allison, if you get hurt while I'm busy with some stupid test, someone's going to need to take care of me."
If he does anything...
Like?
Anything...
Weird or bizarre... anything.
Anything evil!
Jackson?
Did you still want to discuss your paper?
"You have one hour, Mr. McCall."
Begin.
"Really, Scott?"
I can't.
Oh...
I can't do this.
Can I do this?
"No, I am gonna go to work."
I am gonna go to work.
I am just gonna straighten up.
Just a tad.
"Oh, you just scared the hell out of me."
"Sorry, I wa..."
"I was just, um, I was... nothing."
"Ah, that's a... nice heels."
Does it have anything to do with Detective Hallstrom?
"Look, I don't want to talk about it, OK?"
You don't like him because you...
What?
Wanted you for myself.
I'm sorry.
This is stupid of me.
You're ready for contacts... if you want them.
Or glasses.
They'll correct you to 20/50.
Do you think I saw the killer?
"Seeing isn't something that happens to you, Emma."
It's something you do.
I gave you the equipment.
It's up to you to control it.
"If you invent these visions, you can stop them."
Do you think I invented him?
Doesn't matter what I think.
What do you think?
I'll call you later.
I got to go.
"Oh, sergeant, hi."
It's Detective Hallstrom from Chicago.
I'm trying to find out if Margaret Tattersall... spent any time in a hospital recently?
A lot of time?
She got a new kidney.
"Hey, you just can't..."
That's OK.
It's OK.
It's all right.
Where's John?
What's the problem?
"- Of course, who else?"
- You must be making a lot of money.
But your dad could've paid for it.
"Come on, I fend for myself now."
"By the way, how did you two meet?"
"Well, I worked on a student film way back."
I built a set for them.
And she did the music.
"Oh, so that's how you met."
"Like me, she's an avid fan of yours."
Really?
Have you lost your mind?
Are you nuts?
"By the way, I'm Kim Moonsook."
Nice to meet you.
- So you do music?
"- Yes, it's nothing really."
Her music is great!
How do you like this music?
I brought this CD for you.
What?
Is this her music?
"Yes, isn't it nice?"
She's mainly a composer.
She made this to use as a demo for her singing debut.
Very nice.
This is a bit mainstream.
I also have some weird stuff.
Want to hear it?
"No, it's nice."
Let's listen to this first.
I really like this one.
"""Our love is just a mirage."""
"""Stay behind and don't go away!"""
"""Till death do us part!"""
"""But lt's only a fond dream for you have to leave."""
"""Our love is just a mirage."""
Bye-bye!
"Damn, Hiroshima escaped!"
Bye-bye!
I'll go to Japan to stop him!
"No need, it's only a small matter."
Small matter?
You traitor!
- What?
- l beat you.
Why did you hit me?
Why not!
The whole world's destroyed by you.
You're the sinner of all mankind.
- l'm sorry!
- Why hit her?
And me too?
Why did you give the Formula to the Japanese?
What are you laughing at?
"Don't worry, Hiroshima never got the real 'Beast'!"
Then where's the real one?
The real one's right here!
"Well done, Yoyo!"
I can see the money already.
We can go on a trip tomorrow!
Shush...someone's about!
Come out or I'll shoot!
Come out quickly!
"Believe me, Freddie, we're agreed on that."
"Shut up and listen, Harry!"
Your debt is useless to me.
I can't sell it on.
No one will touch you.
So I'm calling it in.
- What?
- You have three days.
You do realize that's a completely insane request?
"What's going on, Freddie?"
OK.
Take this as a down payment.
You must know some powerful people in your line of business.
You should ask for a favor.
"He's arrived then, eh?"
The new DSI?
Yeah.
I worked with him a long time ago.
Interesting guy.
Long night?
"No, no."
I turned in early.
I was whacked.
What's Orwell got?
Body dragged out of the Thames.
Young woman.
No ID yet.
"You didn't really have an early night at all, did you?"
"You don't have an off button, do you, Suri?"
I just believe in the redemptive power of sleep.
Clears out the molecular garbage in our brains.
Molecular garbage?
Yes.
I tracked you down.
I bumped into you in front of your apartment in Paris.
"Pretended it was just, uh, by chance."
We had a really good time in St. Tropez.
You stole my life.
"Look, if it's any consolation, it really wasn't much of a life."
You didn't seem very happy.
Oh.
Blame yourself.
"I mean, I tried to cut you in, but you wouldn't give me your pass code, so I mean, I had to use the drug."
How did I get away from you?
I guess I'm getting old.
Sloppy.
I forgot how physical you could be.
You ran off to tell Jacob.
(speaking German)
Please.
"Oh yeah, I'd be afraid too."
Why are you helping him?
Call it instinct.
You couldn't take that away from me.
"Uh, do you wanna see the girl or not?"
This way.
Stay.
What happened?
"It's under control, thank you."
"Julia, I'm Marta."
I'm a friend of your father's.
Where is he?
He's waiting for you.
Where?
My dad thinks we should get off the streets.
Why?
He hear something?
About aftershocks or looters--?
Zombies?
That was my first thought too.
"But, no, it's just a precaution."
-It's Ryan.
-ls everyone okay?
"Yeah, we just have to make a little change of plans."
-Your dad said to go home.
-I think we should all be together.
-This is a bad idea.
-We're almost there.
"-No, we're not."
-Just a few more minutes.
"What is it, honey?"
I can't get Barbie into her dress.
"Well, she can wait a minute, don't you think?"
"No, she needs you right now!"
(NlNA whining)
She can't bang on that xylophone thing when I'm working.
That is so true.
"Here, all yours."
"I'm making dinner, can you just manage with Nina for 20 minutes?"
"I've got a deadline, okay?"
connie:
Barbie's going to be late.
"What is she late for, angel?"
"Her party, she's going to be late, she's going to miss everything."
(singing) I see the moon and the moon sees me
And the moon sees somebody I'd want to see
"Speak, will you?"
"Tell me, asshole!"
"Tell me, you fucking shithead!"
Fuck you!
"Stop staring, motherfucker!"
Don't call your daddy that!
Don't you look at me!
Stop it!
Daddy said he was sorry.
I'm gonna kill all of you.
How could you?
I met the shaman today.
He thinks there's a spirit in the house.
Something's possessed Hyo-jin.
"And if we don't act, there'll be dead bodies."
He's supposed to be the best.
Why didn't you answer my calls?
"Come with me, and don't give me any crap."
Ask him where he stashed the stuff from in there.
The things in there... where are they now?
What things?
He asks what things.
The stuff we saw before.
Things we saw... before.
The photographs?
You mean the pictures?
"Yeah, the pictures."
And the other stuff.
Yes.
I burned them.
Sorry?
I burned them.
I'd rather make sure the kids are tucked in.
They might have a nightmare and throw the covers off they could get a sore throat.
Wait.
"Give them something, Bruno."
Here...
Is all I have.
"Your wallet, Bruno!"
You punk.
Dirty little bastard!
Whas with this chick?
Just spreads her legs and stares at the ceiling...
Son of a bitch!
What are you complaining about?
"You got off, didn't you?"
Like screwing a piece of meat.
Get up now.
He needs to rest.
Look at this dumb chick!
No panties!
Hurry up.
I'd like to go now...
Don't you like panties?
You going to answer me or not?
Look what your friend did to me.
You should take it easy.
What if I can't get it up again?
"Look, you bitch!"
You're going to be all right...
Is not my fault!
I didn't shoot you!
I don't give a shit about his car.
He your boyfriend?
I don't know why you let him move in.
He's me brother.
You never know when you'll need bone marrow.
"He's rude, he's ignorant, he's lazy."
Yeah.
How could two brothers be so different?
"Anyway, he's gone."
Moved back in with Donna.
"That's the last we'll see of ""The Troyminator""."
"I had to tell you, at that party the other night in the bathroom, I saw..."
- What?
- What?
You was in the bathroom at the party the other night and you saw...
Saw... that it needed a makeover.
So paint it magnolia.
Put some decking' down.
Sort your taps out.
- Eh?
- Just a fuckin' thought!
Gotta go.
See ya.
What's up with you?
Looks like death row in here.
"Er... yeah, well, better get back in the saddle."
That horse'll be on bricks by now.
I'd best bust a move.
I've got to meet Amanda.
- Who?
- Amanda.
"You know, with weird eyes."
See ya!
"Gonna pop out, get some fags."
I should go.
Hang on.
"You might as well stay for the beginning of ""Saved by the Bell"", if you want."
"Okay, how do I look?"
Good.
How do I look?
"- Just be as normal as you can, okay?"
"- Wait, how much did I weigh at birth?"
I don't know.
It was your birth.
"But you should know, shouldn't you?"
"I mean, if you're my dad."
"Listen, she doesn't suspect that we're not father and son."
She's not going to be trying to catch us out.
When's your birthday?
Quick.
- August 19.
- Okay.
Who's my mum?
Your mum's your mum.
"So you were married to my mum, but now you've split up?"
Yeah.
Whatever.
Does it bother you or me?
"No, I'm comfortable with it."
But I think you still have a few issues.
"It's not funny, okay."
- Only cause you're a...
"- You love her still, don't you?"
- Christ's sake.
- I know you do.
- You love Mummy.
"I mean, he's not anyone else's either."
It's just...
- We're not actually married.
I bought the ring myself in Woolworths.
- I see.
- In love enough to run away with him.
Just too proper not to care what other people thought.
"- Er, behind..."
- Better get moving.
Hilliard's looking for you.
Wants to discuss the stuff you wrote for Uncle Frank's death.
- What did you think?
"- Too long, obviously."
But apart from that...
"His final moments, believing Brannigan and Johnnie are the sons he lost in the last war..."
- Well...
- Hmm.
"""Such an age you've been gone."""
- Really.
- Hmm.
"I still think we need a little more in terms of... of, um, of back-seeding."
"Oh, I'm..."
"I'm awfully sorry, Mr. Hilliard, but Mrs. Cole has a train to catch."
- What?
- She must go.
- Wha--
- It's...
- It's a personal matter.
- Oh.
"Well, will she be back tonight?"
- Let's get you into makeup.
- Hmm.
Police!
A policeman has come!
Inspector Arivazhagan.
Can I come in?
He got in and started threatening us.
The car being involved in the accident...
Ashwini having driven it...
The windshield of the car having broken...
He seemed to know everything.
He threatened that he had evidence for it all.
Ashwini and I...
Ashwini immediately pleaded guilty.
"Ashwini is an NRI, right?"
"Yes, Sir."
- Hit-and-run case.
"If an FIR is filed, she can't go back."
You must help us!
"Please, Sir!"
I ensure that a case is not filed.
"But if any of his relative create a problem, we need to silence them."
That will cost you.
"No, Manoj."
"Sir, I killed him."
I accept my fault.
"Keep quiet, Ashwini!"
Sir...
What should we do?
Manoj.
Where is Ashwini now?
She didn't like me bribing the cop.
She felt guilty and left the same day.
I don't know where she went or what she is doing now.
Mush!
Mush!
"- What's up, Sergeant?"
- They just brought a fellow in.
- Picked him up on the Skagway Trail.
- What happened to him?
It seems like he left his sled to go hunting for food... then couldn't find his way back.
He was almost a corpse when they found him.
- What's his name?
"- Well, we found these on him."
Name seems to be Blake
"- John Blake, San Francisco."
Here it comes.
"Say, it even looks like a raft."
Thanks.
I always wanted to join the navy.
"- Will there be room for the dogs, sailor?"
"- I'm afraid not, matey."
- They'll have to run along the bank.
"- Very well, sir."
"Be careful of that varnish on the deck, you two gobs."
"Step right in, commodore."
All set?
"Shove off, cabin boy."
Ca-
"Toot, toot!"
Hard aport!
"Come on, Buck."
Come on.
"The way I figure it, we go 100 miles upstream... then we follow a creek that runs into it north."
Huh!
Never fails.
What?
"Award-winning footage, Kyle."
Think you might be thinning a bit at the back though.
Steve?
Steve!
Idiot!
"Oh, yeah, about the film..."
I've decided to go another way.
"OK, yeah..."
Two points to the kindergarten.
"You've slowed me down, that's all."
"I've got the bait, and I'll be back for your wolves."
He is right about the bait.
"Yeah, I mean wolves can't resist it."
Although...
"Since I've got it, it's probably no use to him."
Very stealthy.
Thank you very much.
I think I'm ready for my close-up now.
This is for all the wolves out there.
Howl it with me now.
I remember the scent.
Then it went dark.
- Then I saw that man...
- He smelled bad.
- And then Shannon.
"- Yeah, but then Tom."
Which means we must have been trapped.
- Then released.
- By Tom.
We probably owe Shannon and Tom our lives and we can't even thank them.
What are you going to tell your parents?
About everyone screwing everyone.
What you read in the tabloids.
It's even worse.
- l could tell you stories.
- Tell me.
There's one bigwig when he throws a party the neighbors secure their kids behind locks this big.
Kids six or seven years of age.
"Girls, but boys too."
What do you think of that little boys?
- Hello sir.
"Hi, Herman."
- Adrienne...
Madam told me to clean up.
Won't you join us?
Funny bunny.
"Tell me more, Gerard."
Later in the car.
- Coming?
- Good morning.
- What the hell are you doing?
- For later!
You with a famous writer!
Who cares...
Bye!
"Now tell me, do these TV people go at it all the time?"
They slow down in their 80's.
Can't we flnd a quiet place in the dunes?
I'm a nature lover.
"Ah, I like touring."
"And are those showgirls an easy lay, too?"
"- You revel in such things, don't you?"
- l love sex.
I just don't like the idea of somebody liking me because of this and not because of me.
And it's hard to detract and think:
""" If I didn't have all this, would this person like me or not?"""
"Come on, ladies and gentlemen, in we go."
Show starts at 8:30.
Get involved.
"Come on, inside."
Get your T-shirts and your drinks and stuff.
"Get in, come on."
We got a show to put on.
We're going to try and fool the fans.
So 'm gonna dress up as a security guard  who works at the O 2.
holy moly.
Are you meant to be sitting there?
"girls, you're looking for your seats?"
"B three, just up here, girls."
"This is row B, ladies."
-This is your row.
-Thank you very much.
"-Big fans, girls, yeah?"
-Yeah.
-Are you a big fan?
-Yeah.
Who's your favourite?
Darren?
"EarpIugs, ladies?"
There you go.
couple of sexy earpIugs for you.
"Because they're not great, these boys."
"They can't really sing, they can't really dance."
What's your favourite song?
"""What Makes You beautiful."""
What was wrong with the last one?
Nothing.
And the people who bought it quite liked it too.
Really?
Really.
"Oh, for God's sake."
"Yeah, it's down again."
I called Ike.
"You call, I come running!"
"Ooh, OK."
Up and running again.
"Let me guess, he turned it off and turned it back on again."
"(LAUGHS) No, he replaced the router."
Apparently it was shot.
He swears it wasn't an excuse to come and see you.
Uh-huh.
Although I do think it got him here a lot quicker.
Would it be alright if I use the space?
To paint?
Yeah.
Or to hide from Ike?
To paint.
Yeah.
You go for your life.
Maybe I'll put one of yours on the wall and see how you like that.
Maybe.
"You know that Ike is a really lovely guy, don't you?"
And he really has a thing for you which means he's not going away anytime soon.
That's his problem.
Yep.
"But you'll still have to deal with it, right?"
"It's great out here, eh?"
I've always been loyal to you.
What is this?
So...you're staying?
"Yes, I'm staying."
What do you want me to do?
"Hey, Anthony."
How would you like it if I taught you how to catch the really big fish?
-Would you like that?
-Okay.
"You know, when I was your age,"
I went out fishing with all my brothers and my father.
Everybody.
I was the only one that caught a fish.
Nobody else could catch one.
Do you know how I did it?
"Every time I put the line in the water I said a Hail Mary and every time I said a Hail Mary, I caught a fish."
Do you believe that?
It's true.
That's the secret.
-Do you want to try it out on the lake?
-Okay.
What else have you got?
Everything will be okay.
-Did my brother go back?
"-Yeah, don't worry."
"He's ten times tougher than me, my brother."
He's old-fashioned.
"He didn't want dinner, just wanted to go home."
That's my brother!
Nothing could get him away from that two-mule town.
He could have been big here.
He could have had his own family.
"Peter, tell us about yourself."
Do you have a girlfriend?
Well...
I don't really know.
"Well, shouldn't you know?"
"I mean, who would know?"
Leave him alone.
Maybe is a secret love.
Love should never be a secret.
If you keep something as complicated as love stored up inside... ...gonna make you sick.
I finally got lucky in love.
We both did.
But is hardly perfect.
You have to work at it.
"I met him on the college steps, and I knew it wasn't going to be easy."
"He was studying science, and I was studying English literature."
Thas right.
I was trying to explain the theory of relativity.
And Rosie was trying to explain T.S. Eliot.
I still don't understand what he was talking about.
"Yes, you do."
I'm serious.
T.S. Eliot is more complicated than advanced science.
"But if you want to get a woman to fall in love with you, feed her poetry."
Poetry.
Never fails.
A tall and slender maiden All alone upon a prairie...
Brightest green were all her garments...
And her hair was like the sunshine...
Day by day he gazed upon her...
Rent!
Where is my money?!
"I won""t marry!"
"I won""t marry!"
"Try to understand my helplessness, seema."
Love demands sacrifice.
"Love that doesn""t give sacrifice, that love is not true."
Even I am in anguish!
"But I am compelled to smile. seema, this is want destiny wants."
Forgive me.
"""ls this the reward of my love?"""
"""No, seema."
"Fate is testing me."""
"""Friend has asked for the sacrifice of love."""
"""But why are you making me the victim of this friendship, shekhar!"""
"""What""s my fault?"""
"""I am helpless, seema. l have given my promise."""
"""Now even if God told me, still I can""t break my promise."""
"""Who are you to take decision of my destiny?"""
"""lf you are helpless then I too am helpless!"""
"""But I can""t kill my love like this!"""
"""I won""t marry!"
"I won""t marry!"" cheater!"
Betrayer!
How dare you play this dirty prank!
Rajesh!
You were flirting with that girl and now you gave her to me!
"No, Rajesh!"
And you thought that I will marry her.. ..and shoulder your responsibility?
ls this called friendship?
Rajesh!
I can even lay down my life for your friendship!
This is what even I thought!
But now.. now I just want to ask you.. ..why did you thrust that girl on me!
Where would I go?
And what would I pack?
"Oh, it's going to take me forever to do all of that packing."
What are you supposed to pack when you go to exile?
Are you supposed to pack warm?
Opal?
"Opal, how did you get up there?"
"Hang on, you poor dear!"
Mama's coming!
Rainbow Dash?!
How dare you strand my poor Opal on the tree.
"Well, how else were we gonna get you out here to show you... ...this!"
What is it?
It's not...
You...
We all finished your dress for you.
Thanks to Fluttershy's freaky knowledge of sewing.
Do you like it?
Like it?
Like it?!
Uh-uh.
She doesn't like it.
"No, I don't like it."
I LOVE IT!
You ponies did an amazing job.
It's exactly the way I imagined it.
We just followed your brilliant design.
Like we should have let you do for our outfits.
Those first dressed you designed were perfect.
We're so super sorry.
You worked really hard to make our dresses exactly the way we wanted them.
We all saw how well that turned out.
I'm sorry that I cannot touch your feet as my arm is wounded.
It's not necessary.
- Why not?
I had left with your blessings so I returned alive.
"No, my son."
Even death fears men who sacrifice their life for their country.
What did aunty say?
I've got it.
Wonderful!
Your words have strengthened my determination.
Do you know what my mother would have said?
"What have you done, my son?"
I told you not to join the defence services.
You are my only son.
"You were saved this time but, what will happen the next time?"
And then she would start crying.
For the sake of her child a mother has to cry sometime.
Some shed tears and some swallow their tears.
"What is the matter, aunty?"
Nothing.
"Aunty, can I ask you something?"
Don't you have any children?
I had a son.
He wasjust like you.
I lost him.
Your mother has come to see you.
"Please send her in, doctor."
I'll leave now.
- Why?
You must meet my mother.
- I'll meet her some other time.
"Renu, you stay here."
- My childhood spent with it's tunes.
My father used to play these tunes.
You know what?
I'll miss you all a lot.
Really?
- Yes
And listen!
"Do come to my house once, okay?"
My father is a very nice man.
You know what?
"In my childhood, he used to make me cry a lot."
"He used to say, I'll get you married with a police officer."
I never like the police officers.
What will you say them now?
Now?
"Now, I'll say... fine..."
I like one police officer only if he stops smoking.
Smoking?
- Yes.
You...
Really?
Really?
What if I wasn't a police officer?
Still...
But before encountering them it's very important... ...to bring out Radha safe from their clutches.
"But the problem is that if police will arrest them... ...or attack them, they'll shoot Radha."
Or they'll point gun at Radha for their escape.
"I think so, sir."
"Sir, I've got one idea."
What if we go to them in the disguise of goons... ...and attack them?
- Yes.
In that case they'll escape safely with Radha.
Loooook!
These are our wedding pictures.
"You are the groom, I am the bride."
Whole Guzelyurt was there.
Everybody admired the gold jewellery given to me.
They said this land had not seen such a beautiful bride for years...
"Yes, take a good look at me."
Do you remember you hit me?
I wanted you to give me a present to see my unveiled face...
And you hit me in the face.
Mustafa Bulut...You are something...
You can't run away like this...
You will remember each one of them...
And then you will answer to me.
I won't forgive you unless you kiss ten times every part of my body you hit.
Welcome... and good bye.
Visiting time is over.
"Today, there were too many people coming and going."
"Mustafa brother, it is time for your medication."
You are loved by beautiful women.
One comes while the other leaves.
Mustafa...
"Where are you going, son?"
Mustafa...
Please look at me.
Son...
My child...
"Hug your father once, eh?"
Hug your father...
Mustafa held the sling and you should have seen it...
Everybody in the garden dispersed.
But he had already set his eyes on someone.
What sort of parents do you think we are?
- Do you really want me to answer that?
"- That's enough, missy."
- Why would we damage you?
- We made you.
"Honestly, Georgia, this attitude is..."
Welcome to the tragic universe that is my sad life.
Why?
I'll give you five major reasons why.
"Number one, my parents are from the Stone Age."
"- No us, no you."
- God knows what you'd do.
- You understand?
You wouldn't exist.
- Yeah.

How did you manage to pluck them all so quickly?
"You haven't, have you?"
"Oh, crikey."
"Bob, she shaved them."
"Number five, I'll never get a boyfriend."
What's the hurry with growing up so fast?

Go with the police and immediately get shekhar arrested.
"No, no!"

Then be prepared to go to the prison!

You can choose any one.

I want my share!
- I too want it!
I too want it!

"This afternoon, a fire broke out in a Seoul warehouse, 35-year old Lee who was working inside the warehouse was injured from smoke inhalation."
"While rescuing him, two firemen from Dobong Station received burns and are currently in intensive care."
The fire burned down the whole warehouse and $350 thousand worth of property was damaged.
The fire was out after an hour.
The police are investigating the cause based on the witness' depositions.
How did you get here?
I'm okay.
I'm not hurt.
I am the one who's hurt.
I can't take it anymore.
"Every time I hear a siren, my heart drops."
Soo-jeong.
"It's okay, so let's go."
There are other people here.
"No, it's not okay."
Who cares about other people?
"- I care about you, and about myself."
- Soo-jeong.
"These people say you're cool, encouraging that you are a great fireman."
"That's all, isn't it?"
"Su-jeong, that's not it."
"And so they just push you deeper and deeper into the fire, right?"
"Soo-jeong, no..."
You know... how we work here...
You know.
"No, I don't know."
I've forgotten it all.
"When you say 'we', I'm not included, so how can I know?"
"104 this is 10, roger."
"Oh, Gary McDonough."
His mother just died when he was in Florida.
He retired from GM and he was down there.
They're all pretty much retired.
"Caroline, she married a real nice guy"
He started off as a mechanic for the school district of the county just south of
Travers City.
He was running it years and years ago.
He was the head guy running the - he knew stuff.
He knew engines.
Nice guy.
So that worked out.
But now they spend their summers over there someplace.
They get back here once in a while.
They have something in Florida.
So the whole bunch is pretty good.
Sally's got this...
Nice girl.
She could ice skate.
She was a good ice skater.
Did the fancy stuff.
We skated out one time
I think it was [?] and Gary and myself.
February.
"And like one of them two week old ice, where it froze yay thick."
We went out after school and it was cold.
Where?
Out in the - just ice skating out towards Grey's Reef
The harbor?
Towards [?].
"And we got out there and - beautiful, just"
"like shotguns going off, when the ice cracks, when it's freezing, you know."
Kona Ranga Rao becomes crores Ranga Rao.
I am placing my daughter in your hands.. ..you should make her a star and change my fate.
Do you have a five star cigarette?
Dont say anything else.
My stomach is about to split.
"Yes, my difficulties have become a joke for you."
Tell as what they are.
There are two matches.
One girl is very beautiful.
She likes me too.
But she does not have any money.
The other girl is average in looks.
But she is very wealthy
What is there in money?
You are lucky to find a girl who likes you.
Marry that girl who is not rich and you will be happy.
You are what I call a friend.
Now tell me the address of that which girl.
Give me water!
Someone close to you is remembering you.
Why do they remember even when they are close?
"Because they are close, they will remember.. ..either when close by or when far away."
Is that so?
"Hey, these people are getting very close."
It is better that we go away.
"Hey, Mr.Ranga Rao!"
Oh!
My father!
Where is your father?
There.
Near that scooter.
- Is that man your father?
"""Pioneer's greetings to parents, mentors and elder friends!"""
"- Guys, come here!"
"- Mirror is gone, magazine is gone."
We're dead!
"- If Mitrofanova was back, then she saw everything!"
"- Enough moaning, let's go."
- Here will be parents and guests.
- Can they sit on the grass?
It's better in the shade.
- I'll think about it.
- Where do I put this?
- Not now.
- Crocodile.
- I can see that.
- Here we'll hold the games.
- Like sack racing?
- That's right.
From that spittoon to this lamp post.
You're in charge.
- How about we come up with something new?
"It's always the same: throwing balls, tossing rings, bobbing for apples..."
"Something new, you know."
I'm sure we can manage!
- I'll think about it.
- Where do I put this?
- Not now!
"- All right, so."
Here we throw the balls.
Here we toss the rings.
And here... we bob for apples.

Where are you running?
Father.
"Father, are you taking your medicine on time?"
Yes dear.
- How is your chest pain now?
I have only one pain.
My young daughter drives the rickshaw.
And I live off her.
- Why do you think like that?
"Nowadays, girls drive a car, even fly a plane."
I only drive the rickshaw.
"When I was born, hadn't you told mom it's not a girl, but a boy?"
Right?
Sister!
- My Munni is back!
"Leave that, come to your sister."
She is the daughter of the house.
"You are back from school, child?"
Yes.
"But tell me, why did you quit school?"
"When poverty pulled my leg, . . . helplessness took away books from my hand."
"I could not become a doctor, but I'll make you a very big doctor."
"When I become a doctor, I'll first cure father."
"Yes, father will recover."
"Then you, me and father will go on a holiday."
We'll go to a place where there are mountains covered with snow.
We'll climb those.

"'What, love marriage?'"
"'What, love marriage?'"
"'What, love marriage?'"
Result..
'We believe that a boy and girl.. ..can have only one relation willingly.'
'And that's Raksha Bandhan.'
"So what I, I wasn't successful the first time."
But I still desired for love-marriage.
'Here's my marriage card.'
She handed me the card to her arranged marriage.
The third time I went up to the temple for the love marriage.
But I was slightly late.
No..
When love marriage isn't possible.. ..then what's the point of falling in love?
"Here, keep the glass."
And don't forget to pay him.
Fool.
- Yes!
What are you doing?
"Father, I am frying fritters."
Here.
Keep 10 rupees.
For the household expenses.
-Yes.
And if anything happens to the rose plants in my absence.. ..then I will send you to hell.
"But, Father, how is that possible?"
"Quiet, fool."
How many times have I said keep the ignition running.

"I-I mean, the scars healed really well."
"- Hey, Stifler."
- Eat shit.
What was that all about ?
- He's still embarrassed because Finch kicked his ass.
- Who told you that ?
"What do you mean, ""no comment"" ?"
- Did you two hook up or something ?
"- What, are you kidding ?"
No.
Then how did all this get started ?
"Well, I guess it's all right for me to tell you now."
That reputation of his isn't going anywhere.
"Cheese, please."
"Finch comes up to me and says, ""Jessica,"
"I need your help with this, blah, blah, etcetera."""
"So I said, ""All right."
"Pay me 200 bucks, and I'll tell a couple of girls that you're dynamite in bed."""
"So he did, and I did."
- That actually works ?
"- Well, duh !"
Of course.
"Naturally, I embellished a little bit."
Did you hear that Finch had an affair with an older woman ?
[ Chuckling ]
"No, I didn't hear that one."
That one was my favorite.
[ Laughing ]
"Do that cheerleader. - - Thank you, baby - - She wants me."
She calls me up--
- How sweet it is to be loved by you --**
"Oh, my God, you're gay !"
Come and dance with us come on ... purge your demons!
How long are you going to stay drunk?
How would you prefer me?
Perhaps riding in the head of my four legions to meet him in battle?
For yet another victory celebration?
A true king is not a coward!
I am not a coward
I am merely a fool in exile with no place to hide except my wife's country
Enough!
Enough!
Everybody out!
Out
Be well
I trusted you
I believed in you
"I, l believed in your strength"
Could I have misjudged you?
You misjudged yourself
It may be your nature to see victory in defeat
"But it's not mine, I fear...l fear..."
I fear I can lead no more...
I should have died...l should have... where's my sword?
I had a sword...
I must die...
I must die with honor My men believed in me...
I must have it...
Stop it!
Give me my sword!
Give me my sword!
I must have my honor!
This is no honor!
ls this how you want them to remember you?
How long has he been here?
You won't believe this but 16 years...
You can find people like him in these kind of hospitals all around Turkey.
Nobody asks about them or visits them...
You can't find their family or relatives if you try to search for them.
"If somebody doesn't take him out of here, he will spend his whole life here."
They get along very well.
Mustafa...
How are you?
It is time for the medication...
Duriye Hanim!
Did you see him?
"Yes, I did Yasar."
Look...
I know that you can't bear your brother's situation.
"In my opinion, he is fighting his conscience and trying to come to terms with what he has done."
And you should let him do it.
"And Yasar, you know this, too."
My brother will not come back to us as long as Narin doesn't come.
That's all I know.
"Yes, Seher..."
What?
My Mom?
Duriye...
What happened Duriye?
"Father, she suddenly fell down."
Seher found her.
"When I heard Seher screaming, I immediately came here Aslan Bey."
It seems to me that her blood pressure went up...
"My Duriye, what will I do without you?"
"Look, don't you play a trick on me!"
Don't...
How could you have come to that conclusion?
I'm telling you that I don't dislike you.
Being with you isn't easy but I'm just saying I don't hate it.
Thank you.
I really thought that you hated me.
"Ever since high school, I have only liked you."
I don't know anything about Sartre or Nietzsche .
And I can't even cook.
"And I'm not glamorous,"
"But still, I'll try my best."
I'll know to always try my best .
Really?
I'm looking forward to it.
What?
You getting smarter for me...
I'm looking forward to it.
Okay.
"Since the midterms are not that far away,"
That confession...
I'll make sure of it with the test results.
Okay?
Midterms?
But I hate exams.
Is there anyone who likes exams?
"Then, can I get a C?"
C?!
What are you talking about getting a C.
Then C+?

Thank you.
You even walked me home.
It's like a perfect date.
It won't move.
"So, what was it you were saying?"

I will burn myself into ashes.
Will you keep it aside if I tell you?
Have you not told me to do so?
- Let us go out.
It seems son-in-law is going to do something.
Let us not disturb him.
Come on.
"O my dear, is it ok for you if I die?"
It is burning!
Where there is a will there is a way.
"Bhadra, Ranga Rao came to see you."
Let him in.
"- Hey you, come here."
"Sir, Bhadram sir!"
You are my God.
Please save my daughter and me.
She is my only daughter and I brought her up as a doll.
Even my master is also looking her as a doll.. ..but he wants to see her in his home.
He is ready to give 10 lakhs if you accept this marriage.
When crores are coming who needs lakhs.
"I will first use him to finish Venkat, then think this matter."
"My God, 10 lakhs?"
Where are they?
"Here, take them."
"Sir, God has given me an extra tooth but not extra intelligence."
I would have realized your heart if He gave me that.
But I am unfortunate.
This marriage will not happen.
Why is that?
"Every idiot wants to marry my daughter.. ..Sir, I am not talking about him."
"He is pure gold, I am talking about that fellow.. ..who trapped my daughter in the name of love."
"I won""t let this happen! seema.. leave with the child."
"No, shekhar!"
"I won""t leave you alone!"
I will die with you!
Move her from the way!
- No!
Leave me!
Take her away!
- Leave!
I say leave!
Bhuta singh! shekhar!
John and Pinto have joined hands with kaka sir!
They are supplying the gold to our enemies.
Run!
"Don""t worry about me!"
"Don""t worry about me!"
Bhuta singh! kaka sir!
Prepare the biggest tube.
You will have to go to deliver the gold with John and Pinto.
Gold from all over the world comes in lndia.
"And lndia""s gold goes abroad. kaka sir, syndicate has come to an end."
"Now for which party do we have to deliver this gold? kaka sir, he is dim-witted."
"Till the time he doesn""t.. ..understand everything he won""t work."
"You explain to him. sher khan, the enemy country is paying double for the gold."
Got it?
We will earn four times the profit through international means.
Meaning they will buy weapons with this gold.
"And use it against us in the war. - sher khan! sher khan won""t do this derogatory act!"
"And he won""t let anybody do this!"
I tell you to obey my orders!
- lmpossible!
"This gold is our country""s wealth! our country needs it desperately!"
Some good waltz.
People could waltz.
Back when the older people...
Square dances.
I even knew how to square dance.
Not good.
"By any means, but that was one of the things that you did."
There'd be somebody who could square dance.
Uncle
John did.
That'd be Kay's grandfather.
Uncle John - last name?
Uncle John Gallagher.
And the step dancing - Who would be playing for the step dance?
That'd be Jule and Pat and they'd just
"liven it up, you know..."
Remember any other songs that they'd play?
No.
But the whole family would be there.
Things like that went on in the family. ...
The families were involved in all that kind of stuff.
The Gillespies?
"No, I meant, say you had 3 kids."
"You went with your 3 kids, and one would fall asleep, 3 years old, and the other would run him home or something like that."
It wouldn't be just the - you have to be 18 to go in there.
"Okay, it would be the whole family?"
Sure.
"Yeah, that's great."
It was a good time.
A good time growing up here.
"Riding horses, skiing behind the horses, skiing behind the Model As, the cars."
Sliding down the hill.
Who are you?
Why are you standing there and blocking the entrance?
Please come in sir.
Please have this seat sir.
"This is the house of a poor man, built with a lot of effort."
"Come here, he is Badri, a very famous man."
He has a very big heart.
He is the king of Telangana.
He does not go to anyones home.
He visited only ours.
"She is Shailaja, my daughter."
"Will you get some coffee, my dear?"
She is learning dance.
He brought that rowdy with him.
One scoundrel joined another.
You leave quickly.
What about the coffee?
I will take care of all that.
You leave now.
Otherwise you may not meet that guy.
Why did the young girl become an old woman?
"Sir, coffee!"
Please take it.
She is my mother in law.
But she is more than my mother.
Then why do you make her serve the coffee?
You should have asked your child to do it.
She went to the temple for her prayer.
She should have gone after an hour.
After an hour the priests will close the temple and leave.
My child has a lot of devotion for God.
There is a temple on the side and that side too.
"You go on, call him."
Take this over.

There was a passage in this kind of place.
Pura and his mom must have entered through here.
Pura!
Don't do anything suspicious.
"If you do, the baby elephant won't survive."

"Atom, right?"
What's behind that waterfall?
Are you not going to tell me?
There is a passage leading to where wild animals are...
-What?
Real animals?
-Is that for sure?
"All right, guide us to there."
"Hey, surely they are not going to cut our heads off for real, right?"
"They will just pretend to do it, unless they have some kind of breakdowns."
Breakdowns?
"My, that's horrible."
It's Zora.
It's looking this way.
Hey!

Dae Hyun and I were both supposed to be wearing hats.
But I heard later there's a scene where we meet each other.
"And I said, why me?"
He said but you're future because it's so immaterial.

- It's okay.
- Cemre and Zeynep are also waiting downstairs.
They didn't let them inside either.
They're waiting at the door.
Cemre came here to make an appearance?
What business does she even have here?
Her husband is the one who  made them put you in here.
"Handan Hanım, let us not talk about things we don't know."
- They sent you letters.
- You brought them with you?
They will control them first.
Then you will have the letters.
Cemre also sent you some food and drinks.
"And Zeynep, some clothes."
We have only 15 minutes.
And we'll spend that talking about Cemre and Zeynep?
"Okay, don't start arguing again."
So?
"Is there any problems, anything bothering you here?"
"No, why would anything bother me?"

I said that she would be no longer where you look at  and you would see only me.

The way we can square on most calculators --
"let me demonstrate with this one -- is by taking the number, such as five, hitting ""times"" and then ""equals,"" and on most calculators that will give you the square."
"On some of these ancient RPN calculators, you've got an ""x squared"" button on it, will allow you to do the calculation even faster."
"What I'm going to try and do now is to square, in my head, four two-digit numbers faster than they can do on their calculators, even using the shortcut method."
"What I'll use is the second row this time, and I'll get four of you to each yell out a two-digit number, and if you would square the first number, and if you would square the second, the third and the fourth,"
I will try and race you to the answer.
OK?
"So quickly, a two-digit number please."

I don't like any!
How boorish coming to a motel and talking about painters.
I went get drinks and even condoms.
You're angry.
I understand.
But you know what?
It'll be better to do it when we really want to do it.
I really want to do it
Then let's do it when we really really want to do it.
It wouldn't be hard doing it with you.
But the fantasy will be broken.
What fantasy?
Of a good friend!
A friend I can really talk to.
We talked for six months.
I don't think I've ever been happier.
Do you know what the worst kind of woman is?
Who acts like she's going to put out but doesn't.
Do you really want to do it?
Yes
"Then, do it with your mouth."
Maybe later.
When we want to do it.
Then.. do it with your hand.
Let's do it later.
I'll do it later for sure.
You can't even do it with your hand?
Oh my god.
Weren't you going to buy some mackerel?
No.
We have a lot of fish.
Have some.
"Do you have any idea, how many people from this town he took under his wings and gave jobs to?"
And Selim...
His father-in-law is a parliament member.
Now why would a reputable and popular family like that want to ruin all their reputation?
Why would they get involved in an incident like this?
It makes no sense!
It's absurd.
"Besides, Selim got engaged the night of that incident."
"He spent the whole night with us until he joined his fiancée, and..."
Don't make me talk more...
"That's why, you better listen to me and accept that ""everything happens for a reason""."
Forget about what happened...
Forget about Fatmagül.
Hey dad.
"Okay, I am on my way."
"OK, I'll be there."
Mustafa...
Stay out of trouble son.
"Good day, Mr. Prosecutor."
It's Lawyer Munir Telci.
Sorry to bother you this time of day.
Are you in your office?
"Yes, I'll visit you to make a complaint."
"Yes, did you see the local newspaper?"
"Yeah, don't ask."
Yes.
I'll be there soon.
Just leaving home.
"OK, thank you."
See you soon.
"Mom, Ebe Nine is here."
Mithat Bey.
"I am ASlAN, Man."
Who cares?
"Dude, Asian guys are the bottom of the totem pole (Slap) Owwww.."
"""Bottom of the totem pole""?"
That is the most low self-esteem crap.
I have ever heard
This is a fact
The only people that say Asian guys are the bottom of the totem pole are Asian guys!
I have never heard a girl go
I don't date Asian guys cuz they are
The bottom of the totem pole
Oh my god.
You are so right!
Never heard that before... from a girl
Asian guys!
Why are we so pessimistic?
We are smart
We are clean
We don't sweat a lot.
We are exotic.
We are super exotic!
Asian guys are really at the bottom of the totem pole which we are not it's not cuz we are ugly or cuz we smell bad
It's cuz we have little.....
Confidence
Yeah.
Confidence.
You..
"You were thinking something dirty,"
Weren't you?
"Asian guys, we need to stand up."
We need to stand up and... and be brave.
We need to stand up and grow a pair
- Do you think you got rid of Burak?
Is this how you thought of getting rid of him?
Shame on you.
Where did these come from?
What are these?
You wanted to kill Burak.
"God damn you, Barış."
You lied to me all along.
Where did they come from?
"Who gave you these, mom?"
A courier left them at the door.
God damn it.
We're going home.
The murderer has been found.
Put an end to this tension.
I think the killer is still out there among us.
- What does this mean?
- Burak hired that man.
"This way, not only he cleared his name from the accusations... ... but also, he can still claim that he's the victim."
- Why would he do that?
- That man absolutely hates us.
He wants to have us on a string.
But I won't take that.
I won't let that happen.
Don't rise yourself to the bait then.
"Either way, Burak will be in your life."
I am not very sure about that.
- I need to hang up.
- Is Ebru Hanım in her room?
"- She won't be here today, sir."
- Why?
I wasn't told the reason.
Thank you sweetie.
"Happy birthday, sister.May your face always smile."
"Thank you, abiciğim."
I wish you a happy and healthy life.
Amin.
"- Fatmagülcüğüm, may your wishes come true, my child.- Thank you."
I am glad that you were born.
Thank you.
"Kerim Abi, everyone gave their presents.But we couldn't see yours."
He gave his present yesterday.
"Go on, cut your cake."
You see what happened to you because you didn't listen to me.
You'll do as I tell you from now on.What happened has happened.
It can't be helped.
Your blood will fade from the ground.
But you will be left alone.
It is already decided.Mustafa won't accept you anymore.
Don't cry.
Look.
Don't cry.
I was just outside for a minute.You know how everyone was staring at me?
Like this.
They're talking about you.
They say that it happened with your permission.
"You did it with your own will, they say."
- No...- Shh.
"- There were four people.- Shut up, someone will hear."
I know their faces.They were four.
Stop saying four.One was more than enough to ruin your life.
Mustafa can't help you.But I will.
"I will help you get up.And we'll go home, okay?"
You're not safe here.
"We're happy, free, confused,"
"And lonely in the best way,"
It's miserable and magical.
Oh yeah!
"Tonight's the night when, We forget about the heartbreaks,"
"It's time, uh-oh!"
"I don't know about you,"
But I'm feeling twenty-two!
"Everything will be alright if, (Ooh), you keep me next to you."
"You don't know about me,"
"But I'll bet you want to,"
"Everything will be alright if, (Alright), we just keep dancing,"
"Like we're twenty-two, (oh-uh-uh-uh-oh),"
Twenty-two!
(I don't know about you)!
"Twenty-two, twenty-two!"
It feels like one of those nights!
We ditch the whole scene.
It feels like one of those nights!
We won't be sleeping.
It feels like one of those nights!
"You look like bad news,"
"I gotta have you, I gotta have you!"
"Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, yeah, hey!"
"I don't know about you, (I don't know about you)!"
But I'm feeling twenty-two!
"Everything will be alright if, (Ooh), you keep me next to you."
"You don't know about me, (You don't know about me)!"
"But I'll bet you want to,"
"Everything will be alright if,"
"We just keep dancing, (dance like we're),"
"Like we're twenty-two, (oh-woah-oh),"
It's our first experience.
I couldn't do anything because I was frozen.
I'm sure Jong Up can do well though.
Jong Up is Americanized.
"lndeed, when this fancy background and"
Jong Up's slick dancing skills...
That was awesome.
I'm enjoying Las Vegas very much.
Filming is fun too.
But my bangs...
I'm gold from head to toe.
"Honestly, it was something I'd wanted to try some time."
I'm honored to have gotten my chance so early.
It's very very nice.
I wanted to visit because of the glamorous scenery.
I'm more excited than usual because we're shooting a MV here.
"More than tension, I'm having so much fun."
There's no time to be tense.
I'm your fan.
Please give me an autograph.
- There was no time to be nervous.
- Can I have an autograph please?
I think those sunglasses suit Bang Yong Guk more for sure.
I'll show you a real performance.
It's about 6 AM right now.
"More so than being very tired, no lies, it's so much fun."
I always feel I'm lacking.
lf I say I'd like to try again
We're good to go for a re-shoot but I still feel like it's lacking.
But that still feels lacking.
I'm not satisfied because it seems the same.
"Alright, all finished. okay"
"5 is a prime number, so we'll put 5 right there."
"And then, 12 is the same thing as 26, and 6 = 23."
"So, in our LCM, we have to have two 2's, but we already have two 2's, and we already have one 3."
"Another way to think about it, is that something that is divisible by both 9 and 4 is going to be divisible by 12."
"And then finally, we need it to be divisible by 15's prime factors."
15 is the same thing as 3*5.
"So once again, we already have 3 and 5."
"So, this is our least common multiple (LCM)."
"So, LCM is going to be equal to 33225 =180"
"So, our LCM is 180."
"So, we want to rewrite all of these fractions with 180 in the denominator."
"So, our first fraction, 4/9, is what over 180?"
"To go from 9 to 180, we have to multiple 9 by 20."
"So, to get the denominator to equal 180, we multiple by 20."
"Since we don't want to change the value of the fraction, we should also multiple by the 4 by 20."
4*20 = 80.
"So, 4/9 is the same thing as 80/180."
"Now, let's do 3/4."
What do we have to multiple the denominator by to equal 180?
You can divide 4 into 180 (180/4 = x) to figure that out.
4*45 = 180.
"Now, you also have to multiple the numerator by 45."
3*45 = 135.
"So, 3/4 equals 135/180."
Now let's do 4/5.
"To get 180 from 5, multiple 5 by 36."
"Have to multiple numerator by same number, 36."
"So, 144/180."
And then we have only two more to do.
180/12 = 15.
"Same for numerator, 15."
"So, 11/12 = 165/180."
You've stood strongly on your feet till today.
"You should keep the same stance from now on as well.Better, happier days are awaiting you."
"No one can take them away from you.Very soon, girl."
Your exam results will be announced soon as well.
We will get your good news.You will succeed even more than that Fatmagül.
"My dear, don't let anything pull you down."
Please.
Let's go now.
"And then, the baby rabbit... ... in tears, apologized to his mom."
- Are you asleep?- No.
"Okay, good."
"Then, his mom said to him, ""My son..."""
"""Lying is a very bad thing,"" she said."
"""Children shouldn't lie."""
"""No matter what, they shouldn't lie,"" she said."
"""They shouldn't lie, even if their mothers wants them to,"" she said."
"You are lying to me as well, now."
I know what you said isn't written here.
"- It is written here son.- The Baby Rabbit's story is different, I know it."
"Oh, this is the other *baby rabbit*'s story though."
Which is much better if you ask me.I think it is very good.
Children shouldn't lie.
They should never lie.
You don't lie to me either.Okay son?
Okay then.
Let us sleep now.I'm sleepy.
"Daddy, fireworks were so beautiful, aren't they?"
"They were beautiful, son.Very beautiful."
Close your eyes now.
Sleep well.
"Kerim, come on.It's late."
Good night.

Your boyfriend volunteered you.
I dont think so.
It is raining since this is the rainy season.
I remember from the rain.
I will show you a beautiful place.
Come
Where to?
To the temple of thousand pillars.
It will be wonderful experience to see it when it is raining.
With two temples on either side of nandi .. ..and a rainbow starting from one temple ends on the other.
You have to see it definitely.
Really?
Will it be so nice?
You should see yourself to believe.
Come on let us go.
- Now?
It can be seen only when it is raining.
Believe me.
Please come once.
It stopped to rain.
Bye.
Where are you going?
Should I tell you?
At least tell me when will we meet again.
Let us see when it again rains.
What is that?
Didnt you tell that the rain is uniting us?
If we meet when it again rains.. ..I will also believe that there is something between us.
Bye.
You will meet again when it rains?
I dont understand a bit.
Do you at least know his name?
"What is there in the name, Grandmother?"
Now Bhadram wants to take his revenge on us.
He wants me to repay all the debt I took from him long ago.
"If I cannot, then he wants me to marry my daughter to him."
It is better for me to hang myself than giving.. ..my daughter to him.
But I did not do it because of you.
What can we do now?
There is a way.
That producer is still waiting with money .. ..in his hands.
If my daughter agree to act in his film.. ..I can give that money to Bhadram.
How can I ask her to act in these circumstances?
"Dad, I will act in the movies."
Clear the debt with that money.
Let me wipe the blood off.
It will go in few days.
May be from that producer.
Hello producer sir!
Greetings!
"When will you give me the advance, sir?"
Do you want me to come to Warangal?
Warangal?
We are moving out from Warangal.
Good bye to you Warangal and good bye for Bhadranna.

Hey!

Venkat!
It has been a long time.

My Goodness!- I heard that uncle Hasan is afraid of Turunc Nadir.
I made Giray tell him as if Kenan said that he has to take his complaint back or...
Turunc Nadir will get to know about it..
You really don't know?
Did you wake up?
Come.
I didn't know you were home.
"We work at night girl, I wake up only now."
"While you sleep, probably nothing will be left to the bazaar."
I am waiting for you many hours already..
Wait I will wash my face and we will go.
I will leave as you will go to bazaar.
"I am sorry.- No dear, that takes the cake!"
I will come again.
Goodbye!
Say hello to your mom!
-Yes of course!
It means I was deceived but this**** girl and I didn't know.
The account for this will be asked.
"Here you are,- Thank you!"
Have a nice day! &amp;gt; Good day!
"I'm alright, I'm good, sweetie, don't worry."
"Okay , we'll talk later."
"Okay, my dearest, kisses for you too."
Bye - bye!
Are you done?
If yours (Orkun) is worried you can go if you want.Don't let him reproach later.
"I was talking with Eylul, she calls constantly to ask how I am."
Again.
"If you have things to do, I won't keep you."
If you are going to meet and so on...
You start to cop out right away?
Eh?
Three... five times...
They are giving you ECT (Electroconvulsive Therapy).
Very gently...
You should have seen the electric shocks that I was given...
You couldn't stand it even while watching.
This is nothing...
For seven years...
I was given electric shock.
They fried us with electricity in Diyarbakir prison.
I smelled the burning of my own flesh.
"They made us into human kabobs, Mustafa..."
And then what?
Don't you be afraid.
You don't die from electricity.
You die from loneliness.
You die if you are not loved...
"How did you get the rich Mustafa, eh?"
"Do you get a good tip, eh?"
Serve him well...
This is a whale family...
"Let's stay away from this piece of shit, Mustafa..."
"Yesterday, I was looking at old pictures..."
"Look what I found, Asil."
Look what Mustafa did.
"The world will never see another man like Musto, dude..."
I pushed him around the garden in his wheelchair for about an hour.
"Now, he is yours."
I'll go and check the tea house.
Sahan...
"Shame on you; put it back into your pocket, brother..."
You give it to the poor...
They made me scared.

You used to call me
Just to say I love you baby
You would always treat me like a lady
Everyone was jealous of the way

Always knew that I would occupy your mind
You could always find a little more time

Sitting there on my throne
Lately where's the feeling gone
When it was good
We were sitting on top of the world
When it was good
No I never wanted nobody else
When it was right not like tonight
We were sitting on top of the world
When it was good
No we didn't have a cent to our name
When it was good

Get lost you idiot.
- Talk politely.
Get lost you idiot sir.
These parents will never change and.. ..those lover will never unite.
Did you really love him?
Then why did you doubt him?
I did not doubt him.
It was he who told a lie.
"Ok, he told a lie."
But why?
Because he wanted you and could not leave you.
Everyone does not get true love.
You are fortunate to get that.

- Did you meet him?
So you do know him!
Don't you know who he is?
"He said he couldn't reveal his identity, so I didn't see his face."
Did you see it?
Do you know who he is?
He hid his identity from me.
It is not up to me to reveal it.
But I still want to see his face.
"I'm really good-looking, aren't I?"
You shouldn't look at me too often.
You'll only spoil yourself for other men.
I wasn't looking at you.
So you know how to be shy too?
What was that?
Why do you carry such a dirty thing with you?
It's a pouch.
That thing?
It's embroidered too!
Where is that thieves' mountain retreat?
"Young Miss always blindfolds me when we go, so I don't know."
"But if he's the one that took her, she should be safe."
"She was taken by force, I'm worried."
"If she went voluntarily, then I'm more worried!"
Is there no way to find her without causing too much commotion?
"- I will kill him! son.. son, go and inform the police immediately!"
"Don""t let the smugglers escape!"
"Don""t let Raman succeed in his plan."
You all risk your lives!
But.. but.. but the police..
Father! shekhar..
I will go and inform the police.
"You won""t be able to do this!"
Because you all know a lot! so as per our law.. you have no right to live!
You are right!
And you.. traitors have no right to live!
You all are not humans!
"You all are traitors! shut up! otherwise I won""t spare you!"
"Even God can""t stop a person from speaking the truth! shut up!"
No! scoundrels!
"Even if time and law spare you.. ..even if people forgive you.. but God will never spare you! kaka sir.. let""s kill all of them here only."
Why should we commit this sin?
"Why don""t we send all of them to Mr. shebiro""s boat? so that they all will drown."
"There can""t be any person more evil than you!"
Remember!
Your end too will be like this!
You too will drown. shut up!
Take them! come on! come on!
Leave me!
Leave me!
Leave me!
Leave me!
Leave her!
- Leave her!
You people killed my husband!
Now you want to rape my daughter!
"I can""t see all this!"
"Habibe Hanım, I've brought your ointments."
Habibe called me and said she wouldn't be home.
"But brought them anyway, as I'm on my way to Galip Usta."
I thought I'd find someone in the house.
You shouldn't have.
Because we don't want your medicines from now on.
No one wants your cures in this village anymore.
- Why not?
- You know what your son did.
And you let him get away with it.
Kerim didn't do anything.
So what they say is right...
You're shamelessly denying it.
Look...
You don't know what really is the case.
"- That corrupt family, the Yaşarans are behind it."
"- Get lost, stop slandering people."
I am telling the truth.
It's me who's telling you!
It's me!
I healed your wounds for years!
I swear on everything I know and I believe in.
They put those pisliks crime on my son!
You're still protecting that bastard?
"Leave, now!"
And never knock on any door in this town again.
"If you don't want to be as lowly as her, you should never talk to her again."
"If you were our Ebe Nine, you'd have let them put him into prison."
- You let him get away with it.
- That's not true.
- That's not true.
"- Either way, no body wants you here anymore."
Except for the stabbing pain in my side.
"So he was up all night with the high fever, cramping and crying"
Dude!
"My bad, punching the wall all manly and angry like, you know what I mean."
See you later buddy/
Poor Bambi.
Don't worry Carla will take care of.
Make sure he gets submitted right away.
"On the bright side, it will be interesting to see what it feels like to be a patient."
You know people die here.
You are a good friend.
I do what I can.
Can I have your stuff?
So did you talk to any girls last night?
"Babe, I'm a attractive man."
We both know this.
It's just a burden you'll have to live with
One of many
JD talked some girl up
"Really, are you gonna call here?"
Not right away.
"Alright, showtime."
Clear out I can check him out.
You're examining me.
I don't want you to see my unmentionables.
I've seen underwear before.
"Actually I use the word ""unmentionable"" for my genitals as well."
68 year-old man respiratory distress and tightness in-
Save your breath.
"Hello, dad."
Never thought you'd call me that again after I left.
Dr. Cox!
Exactly...
"Exactly, in this way I had dropped the cup... ...when I heard about it for the first time."
"Actually, Mr. Shreekant, Jimmy clearly told me... ...that if they couldn't marry, they'll commit suicide."
Yes.
Yes.
"So, I'm thinking over it and you too must think All of us must think over it."
After all it's a question of our prestige.
What if they elope and do register marriage?
Then?
Then?
And what if they'll really commit suicide?
Then?
Tell them to commit suicide and you too do the same.
God!
Nephew?
- What?
Who...
"What nonsense is this, Damodar?"
"It's not nonsense, uncle."
It's a fact.
"Look, uncle."
It's difficult for me to speak the truth... ...and for you to hear it.
That's why I had to do this drama.
But it's true that Radha and that boy are really in love.
"Damodar, have you seen the boy?"
"Yes, of course."
Instead I know him.
I know him very well.
"Aunt, if we won't accept Radha's proposal... ...we may repent in future."
Damodar!
- Why will Damodar lie to us?
Boy is studying medicine in America.
But it's a lie
Not to them
So tell them the truth
If it helps you lie.
Janelle are you getiing any of this?
Me too.
I'm just testing you
"Look, sir."
All you gotta do is go back out there tell them you actually slept with Janelle and it pops### their whole balloon. it's over.
"I can't do that, Mike."
I didn't sleep with Janelle.
I'm gonna sully### her good name just to save my political hide###.
Sully.
Janelle bagged the mayor of the city.
"Am I right, janelle?"
Give me some
We'll work on it
Why are we stopping here?
I thought we were going to lunch
Bennet.
We need to talk
"Yo, carter, I thought we agreed we wasn't gonna it's all right."
These are my friends.
So they know about us
"Oh, my god, it's a gay boxer"
Bennet. lightheavy
I had you pegged for cruiser.
"That's a good idea Stuart, taunt the professional ass kicker"
I'm not afraid of him.
I used to box in college
You're way out of your league
Does anybody else smell that?
We did all the work!
Older Brother...
"Thank you for protecting us, Older Brother."
Thank you for calling me like that.
Will you be... ... happy on behalf of my Hyun?
You're really weepy these days now that you're only half a man.
- Half a man?
"- He's missing half of his balls, isn't he?"
What's life anyway?
"Su Keon, you'll be fine with just half."
"Please take care of yourselves, Hwal Bin Dang."
- What Dang?
- We decided to call you that.
Because you helped us who were poor and powerless.
Hwal Bin Dang?
Is that our name now?
"That's so cool, isn't it?"
- It doesn't sound too bad.
- Let's make a flag with our new name!
Whatever...
Hwal Bin Dang?
How burdensome!
- But that's what people are calling us.
- Who cares what people say?
"- We're just thieves, that's all."
- But doesn't it feel good to have a name?
It does have a nice ring to it.
"Now that we have a name, let's go have a party!"
We have to get home safely first.
The police are still everywhere.
"When it gets dark, we'll scatter and leave the city."
We'll reconvene again in the mountain retreat.
Why do you wish to know?
No reason
"I fear for his safety, that is all"
"I'm sworn to protect him as well as yourself, Your Majesty"
"Thank you, Rufio"
For your loyalty
There were supposed to be only six legions!
"lmperator, we must withdraw"
"Have you lost your courage, General?"
It's not a question of courage
These are Roman soldiers
It's not right for them to have to fight their fellow countrymen
"We fight to win, Commander?"
We fight to win!
Charge!
Anthony!
Get Olympos!
We must get Caesarian out of the city now!
"Caesarian, Caesarian!"
You're going on a trip
"A beautiful ship is going to take you to lndia, a land of many wonders"
Aren't you coming with me?
"No, Mama has to stay here"
Are you going to die?
No
I don't want you to die!
I don't want to go!
What news?
We couldn't stop them...too many!
Octavius is coming!
You must go my son
You know why?
I'm a public official.
I feel it's my responsibility to be as frank as possible
"You know, if this truth thing catches on###, I'm gonna be out of a job. are you going to continue having sexual cooper, even while she's still working for you?"
We've never had sex
Yeah right
No really it's true
I want you to listen to me.
I'm gonna say this again.
I did not have sexual relations with that woman Ms. Cooper.
It's almost lunch time Paul
How are you feeling
Get out.
I'm over you
"You know, you want it"
"I've got a perfectly good egg salad sandwich, all right?"
It's got everything you want.
Except meatballs
"Okay, you're fine."
Don't even think about it
Put it out of your head###
Meat
Ball
Shut up
All of you shut up
"Look, sir, this is an easy fix."
All you gotta do is go back out there and tell them the truth
I told them the truth
"Yeah, but it wasn't the truth they wanted to hear, so to them it's a lie."
I lied? it's only a lie if you don't say it.
Say what the truth
Whose truth
Theirs
You first go home.
- Let us go home.
"Ok, come on let us go."
Is that you?
- You remember me?
"Yes, are you from Warnagal?"
"No madam, I am from Vijayawada."
I came to Warangal to purchase vegetables.
My name is Venkat.
I studied polytechnic.
Height 62.
"Please tell me your name, address and other details."
Is it so urgent?
I dont want to miss again.
I am very sorry.
That day my father was in toilet.
With out knowing that I.
Leave that matter.
You must be tired by now.
"You are dancing till now from the moment we met, in my dreams."
I have to take you to my friends immediately.
That Jagan argues that no one is beautiful than Aiswarya.
He will shut his mouth if he sees you once.
Are you trying to impress me?
No madam.
I have already impressed you.
I think you like the rain very much.
Rain is my friend.
Correct madam.
It rained when we first met.
It is raining today also.
That means you friend rain is trying to unite us.. ..which means there is something between us.
I have bad news.
Suraj's plane hasn't returned as yet.
There's still no news about him.
- No!
Please don't worry.
The search is on.
His companions did not see his plane crash.
We believe that he is still alive.
- Then why hasn't he returned?
He must have fallen in the hands of the enemy.
We cannot be sure at this stage.
- No!
What is the matter?
Was it news about Suraj?
His plane is lost.
"What will happen now, daddy?"
Suraj's plane is lost.
"I hope, nothing has happened to him."
"No, don't say that."
Suraj is alive.
My blessings will save him from every peril.
"Don't cry, my child."
I believe that he will return soon.
He has told me that he will return and eat what I have cooked.
You took away my husband.
I didn't say a word.
You took away my father and I didn't say a word.
You were unjust to me at every stage.
I never complained.
But...
If anything happens to my son I will believe that you are not God.
That you are not the protector of the universe.
The deal is done!
Wow!
Nice deal!
I will make the remaining arrangement!
Now you all can leave!
Greetings!
- Greetings!
"Let""s leave! so shekhar has sent you both here?"
To hell with shekhar!
"Now he is not capable, kaka sir!"
He has started killing his men!
"His intentions have turned bad, kaka sir! so why should we help him?"
"Right! lt""s futile to give milk to the snake. - correct!"
Where is the gold?
"Gold is safe wherever it is, kaka sir!"
You help us and take your share!
Fine!
"But let""s form a plan."
You sail your ship s.s verona in the direction of.. ..West 20 East 32 and station it there.
We will reach there.
We have to deliver the goods at Lakhaidi island.
Good!
Good!
Done!
Done!
"This is betrayal! kaka sir, we might be smugglers!"
"But that doesn""t mean that we put our country at stake!"
We ruin our country!
"And sell our motherland! kaka sir, can we sell our motherland?"
They will even sell garden and air.
They will even sell garden and air.
lf they had their way they will sell God.
There's a forest behind us
"On snowy days, it feels like a fairy will come out"
I wish you could come
"- I'm sorry, Sweetie - Don't start up again, Mom"
"I'm fine, Mom"
I'm really happy here
My co-workers love me
Men are lining up to have dinner with me
I met up with Min-jung again
I see her often
"Mom, I'm fine Don't worry"
Leaving you alone like that
Sure you're okay?
"I'm so sorry, Yu-ri"
"- So sorry - Stop crying, Mom"
"We'd better hang up, Sis"
Okay
Take good care of Mom
"Okay, talk to you soon"
SEEKlNG WlTNESS
I have information on a hit-and-run
"No, I didn't see it directly"
Someone told me
Yes
"Practice at home, will ya?"
"She's abnormal, that girl"
"She doesn't eat with us, but chows down alone"
What now?
Where are you going?
Home
No prior engagements today?
No
"We're gonna be late.- Be a good boy in there, okay?"
Are you really okay?
"You look very pale, my child.Come, take my arm."
"- Are you here, jerk?- Kerim what are you doing."
Collect yourself.
I will make you pay for everything you did.
"- Come on, Kerim."
What are you doing?- He can't stare at us from there.
"- Abi, it's okay."
"Not here.- Come on, walk inside Kerim."
- He lost it again.
"Take him inside.- Okay, leave it to me."
"- Fatmagül...- We're come, we're coming."
"It's your turn Fatmagül, okay?Don't let them scare you."
"Be brave, stand straight."
You will be victorious.We will be.
My knees are shaking.
My whole body feels stiff.
I've waited for this day for months.
I've waited patiently.
It's time for revenge.
It's time to stand against thosewho tried to take my life away.
Why are you looking at me with hatred?
Why?
Because I didn't yield to you?
Because I didn't loose against youand I didn't accept the life you forced upon me?
You expect me to hang my head in shame as I walk before you.
I'm not the one who should be ashamedand you know that well.
Hence the hate in your eyes.
You wanted to clean your dirty consciences by staining me.
Even giving up your honors for it.
"*""We won't hurt you."
Hi Victoria.
Did you work here at Western illinois University or somewhere else?
Victoria:
"I worked at Iowa State University, and I worked for the plant-introduction station at Iowa State University."
Beth Seaton:
"And this was on his US Department of Agriculture grant, correct?"
Victoria:
"Yes, it was."
Beth Seaton:
"So were you working with pennycress, too?"
Or were you working with a different crop?
[Text on screen:
"Victoria, student intern]:"
I was working with a bio-soil plant called camelina.
"And I was basically taking the diomorphic differences, which is the difference in the leaf shapes, and the morphologic measurements of camelina."
Beth Seaton:
Tell me about your internship.
What would you say was the most exciting part of it for you?
Victoria:
I got to work a little outside of my major.
I'm a biology major and chemistry.
And I'm focused more on the animal aspect.
"But I got to work more with the plant aspect of it, and I really enjoyed it."
Beth Seaton:
Hi Josh.
Josh:
Hello.
Beth Seaton:
Tell me a
little bit about your internship that you had with Dr. Phippen's
USDA grant this summer.
Josh:
Say something.
Please.
I shouldn't have kidnapped you.
"The car, the bridge, it was too far."
Thank you.
But you shouldn't have lied to me today.
"You can't go off and do things like that, Elena."
Not while Klaus is still alive.
I know.
I just...I wanted to give Bonnie a moment with her mother without everything else getting in the way.
Without me getting in the way.
I didn't plan on kissing him.
"You're better than him, Elena."
You're better than both of us.
Elena's on her way.
Jamie's safe.
"He's a little bruised, but he's safe."
Do you think the hybrid will come back?
You kept your end of the bargain.
Klaus usually keeps his.
You're willing to do all of this for him...
And he's not even your family.
"He is my family, Bonnie."
"I know that might be hard for you to hear, but he is."
But that doesn't mean that I don't care about you.
I want to help you.
You can't.
You have no magic and I don't trust you.
"When I put mikael down, my magic didn't just leave me."
It drifted away.
"The longer I stayed away from you, the weaker it got."
I think nature was punishing me for abandoning you.
I thought I'd die from hunger.
Ha-seok!
I've something to tell you.
What?
Slow down.
I've got tons to say too.
"Let's eat first, then talk."
You said you were hungry.
Sook-hyun!
"Try this, it's great."
Once a fireman rescued a girl from a blaze.
"Everyone else gave up on her, but he charged in like a madman."
"The fireman and the woman, they survived against crazy odds."
"So the fireman and the girl started dating, right?"
"No, he dated her sister."
She was the woman of his dream.
Aren't you glad to see me?
"I keep doing sign language, so I forget how to speak."
"I remember how to say it with my hands, but not with words."
It stays at the tip of my tongue.
"But there are words that even if I remember,"
I can't say.
Maybe I just wanted to hear it from you first.
"I have something to say too, but not here."
"This isn't a sky lounge, and there's no wine."
I can't treat you like a princess.
Hey hey!
What's going on here?
You shouldn't use public equipment for these purposes.
Can our model fireman act in this way?
Give us an explanation.
"OK, stick closer."
You still have four legions loyal to you
Four legions
Have you given up hope
Perhaps I have
Caesar once stopped a whole army with only two legions
I'm not Caesar!
"I am not a god, I am not a king"
I'm a man
I'm just a man who reached for too big a prize!
Where is he now?
Octavius has taken Pelusium
That quickly
Give these to Rufio
Have him deliver them to Octavius
But these are the emblems of your office!
Send them to him with this letter
I am offering my abdication if he'll spare Caesarian... and let him sit on the throne of Egypt
"But why, Your Majesty?"
Has it really come to this?
There is no other recourse
We must buy time
Go now!
Down
Out of my way!
Stop it!
What?
What?
Why did you stop...
"Welcome, welcome Aphrodite!"
Welcome to Bacchus's beach!
Octavius has reached Ashkelon
Ashkelon is weeks away from Alexandria
Your testimony and your blessings.
How did you know the deceased  when he was still healthy and among us?
[Crowd:]
He was a good man!
- Do you testify that he was a good muslim?
- We do!
"Earthly or unworldly, materially and spiritually make all your rights halal to him."
Helal olsun.
Helal ediniz.
"- One more time, for God's blessings."
- Helal olsun.
"May God accept your prayers, your testimony and blessings for the deceased."
May he rest in peace.
It's a very fine piece.
Hand made.
Great craftsmanship.
But this alone don't mean much.
It is valuable only with its pair.
Otherwise it's just like a button.
Wish you could find the other one as well.
Then I wouldn't want to sell it.
"Anyway, maybe we'll find it."
If we can't...
Then my husband will keep it as a heirloom.
- Thank you.
"- Have a nice day, miss."
We've come with great news.
Is that so?
How nice.
The forward buyings are going great.
We revitalized the market.
- Glad to hear that.
The social worker does that.
Not the doctor.
"Not the psychologist, not the nurse."
We do.
That's is what makes us agents of change.

Today we came to another airport.
We'll finish filming and enjoy our time in NYC.
NY fans are coming too.
NY style is supposed to be absolutely cool.
So we tried to be casual
Not to seem over-conscious.
This is NY.
It's unbelievable that I'm walking the streets of New York.
I can't believe it.
I received a business card.
He says he's a rapper in America.
He gave me a business card.
We finished off with a wonderful scene of America.
I was sitting over there and people started talking to me.
I couldn't understand them.
"We're in Manhattan, New York."
"The sun is shining, buildings are beautiful."
"I just really love this free, peaceful atmosphere."
"Most of all, the sunlight is the best here."
We wrapped my MV filming in NY well too. other members will film too.
I'm going to enjoy my free time.
I'm in NY.
"Wow, it's so great."
All the passersby's are awesome too.
The reason why filming is fun is not only because we show our new looks
But also because we come to new places.
It's awesome.
The sun just went down.
Boo hoo.
It really is America.
None
There are yellow taxies passing by.
"Evenin' sirs, welcome to SPACE hooters!"
The finest in tit related eatin' and drinkin' this side of the galaxy.
Can I start you boys off with somethin'?
Maybe a Tatooine Titty Twister or a Dagobah Dirt Bomb?
Just the bottle service.
Bottle service coming right up!
I have a bad feeling about this.
I think it's just early.
What?
The guests are Jedi?
I know trouble when I sees it.
Believe you me these boys is covered in it.
We're screwed!
You know the Jedi reputation.
"Listen, we have to get them out of here."
Peacefully.
How are we going to do that?
"I mean, we can't just kick them out."
"Whatever you do, do not piss these guys off."
Is it normal to make us wait this long?
Relax!
I'd like to try their hot wings.
I'm actually hungry.
"You boys expectin' ladies, or is this just a sausage festival?"
Not that there's anything wrong with a sausage festival.
Say sausage one more time.
Sausage.
Let me guess.
The Jedi were perfect gentlemen... ...paid their bill in full... ...and left with no fuss.
No!
They skip out on their bill!
They steal from the cash register!
No.
No.
No.
No.
No at last.
How old are you?
30.
Then you're not a little girl.
No.
Okay.
"So, you're a 30 year old girl, who's afraid of a guy like me."
"Well, I don't even know if -- well, I don't know if I'll be afraid of you."
You -- I get real defensive with you.
Now what can I do to you?
"You can't do anything, but I can sure feel dumb."
And I can feel stupid for not having the right answers.
Now what would it do to you to feel dumb and stupid?
I hate it when I'm stupid.
What would it do for you to be dumb and stupid?
"Let me put it like this, what would it do to me if you were to play dumb and stupid?"
It makes you all the smarter and all the higher above me and then
I really have to look up to you because you are so smart.
"Ah, yeah."
Butter me up.
"No, I think you can do that all by yourself."
"Ah, I think the other way around."
"If you play dumb and stupid, you force me to be more explicit."
"That's been said of me before, but I don't buy it."
I don't think --
Now what you are doing with your feet now?
Wiggling.
[giggles]
"I'm sorry, No Ri."
This is nothing.
I'm already used to it.
"After Eun Jo got admitted, everyday is fun."
I can learn from Seung Jo hyung.
And I have laughed a lot because of Ha Ni noona.
I wasn't intending to be funny though...
"Okay, let's just rest for today."
"When your fever goes down, I'll teach you again."
Yes.
What is his sickness?
It seems like he has a problem with his heart.
"Oh, I see."
"That little kid has to get shots, take tests, and eat bitter medicine everyday."
He can't even do everything he wants to do.
There's no use in your crying.
That's right.
"If it was you, you could have done something to help him."
What can I do?
You're a genius.
"So if you put your mind into being a doctor, you can easily do it."
"So, it would be great if you could be a doctor, so you could heal many people like No Ri."
Everyone would be grateful towards you.
How does it sound?
"If you tell me to become a doctor, does that mean I have to become a doctor?"
"Yeah, please do it."
It's a really good idea right?
Well...
Being a doctor is best for you.
Baek Seung Jo wearing an all white lab coat...
I want to see you like that.
You're incorrigible . . .
Are you all sure?
"I'll book it if you promise never to chant ""Bahamas"" again."
Okayt
"All right, thank you."
It's done
"Block of rooms, garden view."
"Wait a second, garden view?"
That's the opposite of ocean view
"Hey, foxy lady want to come back to my garden view room"
I asked for the garden
The nose from### the ocean keep me up at night
So what the noise from my foxy lady if I had an ocean view room
"Stacey, any chance the national's media picked up on this story with the media"
I gotta go.
"The mayor pulled an ""Uncle Louie"" last night."
Nothing national but did you see the headline in the post
His honor was on her.
Very clever
"Jason's### really killing us, sorry Mike"
Doesn't matter.
It's under control.

Jason is coming up here?

Great tie
"Listen, Jason, about this story in the morning paper"
"I thought it was great, by the way"
You didn't think it was too wordy?
Why are you so hard on yourself?
You're so talented...
Fellas
You go ahead.
I'll bring your baggage.
"It's okay, abi."
I got it.
"- Give me one of them, if you want."
"- It's okay, you go ahead."
The fridge is full of food.
And I had the house cleaned yesterday.
Have a nice time in there.
- Thank you.
- Thanks.
No one can bother you here.
Good bye.
"Call me, if you need anything."
And I bring it to you.
- Bye bye.
- All right.
So... ... guess this'll be our home for a while.
Just ours.

I miss her smile.
She had an amazing smile.
"One time, I remember she had just gotten her braces off, and she thought she was for sure that she was going to go work for a toothpaste company, and be one of those people that had their smile on the toothpaste box."
[Music]
The morning of November the 10th was just a regular day.
Alex didn't have to be at school till 9:30 because of her college classes that she was taking in high school.
"So, Katrina and I went on to school."
"When I left, I just called her name and said, ""I'm leaving!"""
"And she went, ""Wait a minute!"""
"And she came running out of her room, and she came up there, and gave me a hug, and pushed her hair back"
"like she did every day, and I kissed her on the forehead, and said ""Be good today."""
And I left.
There isn't one penny at the bank
We could find the money here
What if we don't find anything?
"I dunno, but I'm sure we'll find something"
Hopefully
"What's all this, grandpa?"
To know just how much I still remember you
It's all mine?
All of it is yours
"And when you get bored of it, I'll buy you more toys"
We'll play together
And they won't play with us?
"No, they have another game they're playing, nevermind them"
Let's just play together random stuttering
Grandpa
What?
They're all asleep
"Good, I needed to tell you a secret"
What secret?
A very big secret but you can never tell anyone
No-one?
Yes
Ok I won't
"No you'll tell them, but I'll tell you when to tell them"
Okay
What's wrong dad?
Are you gonna kill us?!
Hunting season has begun!
Hunting?
Yes!
Have you forgotten how great of a hunter I was?
"Come on, we're going to fayoum to go hunt ducks"
This is what I'm afraid of. woman:
That my husband will leave me for another wife because of a lack of you know what. child speaking native language:
Divorce.
Divorce.
How awful! woman:
I fear loneliness. man:
Not waking up one morning... and nobody finding you for a week.
That'd be interesting. woman:
Losing someone you love.
"That's why I find it very hard to really, really connect with someone."
"Because, what do you do when they're gone? girl:"
Because what if God isn't real?
"I believe in Him, but what if God isn't real?"
"And we're just going to lie in the ground, dead forever? woman:"
"And that's what I'm afraid of, being in this grave."
"Life is so freakin' short, you know?"
man:
"Dying, I guess."
[animal bells ringing]
[thunder rumbling]
[dog growling]
[man speaking native language] man:
The dogs are frightened of thunder. man speaking native language:
"Yeah, they're scared. man:"
"Vasya, we need to find some fireworks somewhere."
"Because in autumn, wolves will come. man:"
We need to hurry home.
It's going to rain!
all:
3...2...1... [cheering]
man:
Welcome to The Love Parade.
"Anyway, I don't want to focus too much on that."
You can play around with that if you like.
Minus this whole thing evaluated at 0.
So what's e to the minus 0?
"Well, e to the minus 0 is 1."
Right?
That's e to the 0.
"We have a minus 1, so it becomes plus 1 times-- now, sine of 0 is 0."
"Minus 1 over s squared, cosine of 0."
Let's see.
"Cosine of 0 is 1, so we have minus 1 over s squared, minus 1 over s squared, times 1."
So that is equal to minus 1 over s squared.
"And I think I made a mistake, because I shouldn't be having a negative number here."
So let's backtrack.
Maybe this isn't a negative number?
"Let's see, infinity, right?"
This whole thing is 0.
"When when you put 0 here, this becomes a minus 1."
Yeah.
So either this is a plus or this is a plus.
"Let's see where I made my mistake. e to the minus st-- oh, I see where my mistake is."
Right up here.
"Where I factored out a minus e to the minus st, right?"
Fair enough.
"So that makes this 1 over s, sine of at."
"But if I factor out a minus e to the minus st, this becomes a plus, right?"
"It was a minus here, but I'm factoring out of a minus e to the minus st."
So that's a plus.
This is a plus.
"Boy, I'm glad that was not too difficult to find."
So then this becomes a plus.
And then this becomes a plus.
"Wow, it is gone."
What is this?
I missed the opportunity.
Is she that beautiful?
Who may be the blessed person that gave birth to.. ..such a beauty?!
She is from the abode of the gods.
Give me 2 liters.
Wait for 5 minutes.
We are in important discussion.
You came without knowing the name or address of the girl?
I could not find.
- Why was that happened?
What will you do here without those details?
That is the issue I am unable to solve.
Nothing is there to solve.
Just forget about her.
Why do you discourage him like that?
Encourage him.
Look here my dear Salim - My name is Venkat.
No.
If you are searching for your Anarkali then you are Salim.
You look so dynamic.
Why are you.. ..listening to this burnt out fellow?
Thats it.
"Look here, dont be depressed that you missed her."
Search!
- There is nothing you cannot find if you search.
"Who are you sir, giving advice freely?"
"Ranga Rao, a big name in the states."
I came here now.
I am planning to settle down in Warangal.
Thinking to settle in Warangal?
I am coming....
Here.. drink...
I threw my beautiful daughter into the fire with my own hands.
She had so many opportunities!
I fell under the spell of this huge mansion.
"But, now, I am in pain inside."
My daughter has no more tears left from crying so much.
This fire is going to consume me and you..
"Look, Naciye... you look like this, but.. ... you are a mother, too."
How do I look?
Frizzy haired Naciye from Odakli Village..
"Look, idiot.."
"Pay for the soda, then leave... is this a charity house?"
Here.. if only your soda had some flavor!
"Rude, insolent!"
Idiot!
Thank you.
"Ya, Yasar..?"
Is he still not using anything?
"That is, Mustafa, in that condition?"
"Look, I am going to say something, but..."
"Maybe, Mustafa is faking?"
This is Mustafa Bulut we are talking about!
"Medicines, needles, mean nothing to this man!"
"Abi, I told you, I saw it with my own eyes!"
The man doesn't recognize any of us!
Don't you think I would know from his gaze?
Of course!
Why would he fake this?
"Well, maybe he is trying to guilt you all, because you put him in the nut house."
"It's possible, isn't it?"
"You can go tomorrow, and see for yourself, then!"
Bla bla bla
You see this?
It says 'Marital status':
'Never married' and the part I highlighted - I should have highlighted - the part next to it:
"'Surviving Spouse's Name, if wife give maiden name'"
'Surviving Spouse's Name' is blank
"Because in this country, gay couple's are not legally recognized."
Gay love is not recognized as love.
And we are therefore not treated as equal human beings to heterosexual human beings
Now look here.
I am on this though.
"Number, box 22a of the Florida Certificate of Death."
'Informant's Name':
Richard Bluestein.
That's me
And next to it in 22b:
'Relationship to decedent'.
'Friend'.
'Friend'.
'Friend'.
'Friend'.
'Friend'.
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone
"Baby it's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two?"
"Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember"
The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try?
He's sailing into a trap!
Pull back!
Octavius!
Boarders!
"Your Majesty, you must go below"
Drive them back!
Fight for your Queen!
Force them back!
Where is Antony?
We must find him!
"His flagship sank, Your Majesty"
He might still be alive..
"Forgive me, but he can't survive that"
"Octavius will be searching for you, my Queen"
I can't leave him here I must do something!
You must save yourself while you can!
For Egypt!
Antony!
"Take out the purple sails, have them ready to hoist before Alexandria"
Our victory sails?
"You heard me, now do it!"
"As you wish, Your Highness"
Exactly as I wish
Place the garlands on the bow
On the masts as well
And have the men ready to sing a victory chant... before we sail into Alexandria
I shall not allow my people to see their Queen in defeat
"lsis, my mother don't turn from me now"
Don't turn from Egypt
No!
No!
It's over now
Didn't I ever go out with you?
When did you?
When did you ever take me out?
Should I remind you?
On our honeymoon.
"And I thought we'll go to Kashmir, Kulu Manali."
But where did you take me?
- Hubli.
And only because you were getting someone's bungalow free of cost.
"Kishen, you never cared about my feelings."
"Taking me for a movie, dinner, picnic was a farfetched thing."
You never uttered a romantic word to me.
"It takes two to tango, Mala."
You hated me before the marriage and also after.
I don't try to keep myself busy with the restaurant business for no reason.
I didn't go shopping without any reason.
"Kishen, if I am a shopaholic today then you're the reason for it."
"Because I tried to find happiness.. ..in these jewellery, clothes and shoes."
But now I have realised.. ..that I will never be able to find that happiness in all this.
"You found that out after spending 9, 35, 33, 315?"
"No, after wasting 12, 054 days and 23 1/2 hours of my life."
Dad.
Mom.
Mom.
Dad.
Mom.
I will never let you two separate.
Never.
I know I am going to do a crazy thing.
But there's no other way to stop this divorce.
"To change their present, I will have to change their past."
Professor.
You have neither fighting skill nor wisdom.
You don't even have courage to fight.
Just go and hide yourself like you normally do.
Granny!
Show me how to make a pouch.
- I'll make one for you.
- No.
I want to make it myself.
I want to embroider something on it too.
What will be good?
A flower?
A bird would be better.
I should be able to make it in two weeks?
- Did you arrange to meet him then?
- Yes.
I think it'll be the last time.
"If I make a pouch for him, will he cherish it?"
I suppose this is crossing the boundary too.
It's really been a while!
"Here, have another drink."
I really respect you!
I will accept that opinion!
I should have recognized you when you called me Doe Eyes the first time!
But you tricked me by saying Goggle Eyes instead!
"So you were fooled by that, right?"
I was a bit surprised at my quick wit too.
"Farewell, Doe Eyes!"
"Farewell, Goggle Eyes!"
It's similar!
You're really smart!
"At least you understand me, Doe Eyes!"
I really respect you!
I paint the rhinoceros
"Si, you have sad eyes"
"And big lips, melting over the hot sand"
With one tear
"Yes and in your tear, another face"
"The Christ face, yes"
"For the zillionth time, Dad, I'm an adult."
You don't have to stalk me.
"Georgia, I said I'm dropping you off."
"Now, just take off that shell and get in the car."
"Dad, my costume is the business."
I don't want it to get crushed.
"You look fantastic, love."
I just don't want you walking around the streets on your own.
Do you have any idea how long it took to get this right?
I have to make an entrance.
What's that?
And what are you supposed to be?
An obese leprechaun?
Anyone can see I'm a stuffed olive.
Stuffed is right.
"What happened to you, Ellen?"
You were supposed to come as a cocktail sausage.
"Well, my mum said no, her being a vegetarian and all."
Jas?
Cheese and pineapple stick?
"Well, the cheese made me look fat and yellow washes me out."
I didn't know how to be a vol au vent.
But we said we'd all go as hors d'oeuvres to be original.
It was supposed to be a laugh.
But boys don't like girls for funniness.
"- Sorry, Georgia."
Come let us pray for our father soul.
You made him a permanent servant by calling him brother.
"Gun, How much?"
- One liter.
"Only single, why dont you take two liters."
I dont have money.
What is the need for money between us?
"Hey, prepare the bill for one liter."
If you give 2 liters I will prepare the bill for 2 liters.
Shall I give you two slaps?.
What we want is ladies.
Then fill the tank.
Anyway it is not your money.
If I fill the tank she will not come until next week.
If I fill 2 liters she will be back tomorrow morning.
What happened madam?
You are not coming so frequently.
Did you forget me?
I remembered you the day before yesterday.
What about yesterday?
I didnt go to zoo yesterday.
Personal.
"Hey venki, Venkat is here."
All of you come here.
Venkat arrived.
"Hey, move of the way."
Always blocking the way.
Why are you shouting at her?
This is a routine matter for us.
- First tell me why are you here?
What about your interview?
- Its gone.
"I called the coiffure, the girls said you weren't there all day."
I can tell something happened.
Nothing happened Cemre.
I just got a bit emotional.
I can see that.
"But I am asking ""why""."
Well...
I don't know.
It thought about how small... ... how short life is.
It is like a blink of an eye.
"I mean, one can be so determined and work too much for something... ... and then one day it all goes away."
"I mean, as if it never existed."
As if it was a big lie.
"Cemre, life is full of lies."
Every life ends the same way... ... which makes everything meaningless.
Wish I knew what makes you say all this.
I was just thinking about all these stuff... ... they got me emotional.
But really Cemre... ... we have just one life.
"One must live for herself, not for others."
One must only regret what they couldn't do.
That's how it is.
My dear...
Don't regret anything.
"Forget about others, you fight for the one you love."
Be happy with whom you love.
"Yes, sweetie..."
You love Kuzey?
Go grab his hand.
You two suffered so much.
Cemre...
You deserve to be together.
My dear...
Come on we have to study!
This is pampers for you to wear after you're done showering due to all the disasters you do at night when you're asleep
"What's happening, Sameh?"
They use this brush to clean the horses
Shut up
Let's get this over with
See your smart brother
Raise your arms!
What?
Your armpits!
Go head
Shut up
Ok
No this is clean
I swear it's clean
Shut up
Okay
No no!
Daaadd
"Guys, isn't this what you wanted?"
Wanted?
You didn't see what he did to us
"Like I told you before, we have to cope with it till the condition stabilises"
And when is that?
He sold everything and withdrew the money
That's Alzheimer's
The patient acts in confusion and then stabilises
Hopefully he'll stabilise and tell you where the money is
Did he even have Alzheimer's in the first place?
"What about the medication we use to give him, Mr.Karim?"
Did you forget?
Screw all this
If you eat too much ooh ooh
You'll awake with a tummy ache.
On the good ship lollipop
It's a night trip into bed you hop
And dream away
On the good ship lollipop.
On the good ship lollipop.
It's a sweet trip to a candy shop
Where bon-bons play
On the sunny beach of Peppermint Bay.
Lemonade stands everywhere.
Crackerjack bands fill the air.
And there you are
Happy landing on a chocolate bar.
See the sugar bowl do the tootsie roll
With the big bad devils food cake.
If you eat too much ooh ooh
You'll awake with a tummy ache.
On the good ship lollipop
It's a night trip into bed you hop
And dream away
On the good ship lollipop.
You'll awake with a tummy ache
On the good ship lollipop
It's a night trip into bed you hop
And dream away
On the good ship lollipop
[laughter]

Woman:
Nick?
Is it really you?
It is.
Oh... ( chuckling )
"Oh, my dear, lost love!"
I'm paralyzed with happiness.
"Jordan, this is my second cousin once removed, nick carraway."
"Does that mean we kiss when we greet, or no?"
I hope it means we do.
Tom says you've just come from chicago.
Tell me everything.
Do they miss me?
The whole town is desolate.
"Oh, how gorgeous."
All the cars have their left rear wheel
"Painted black as a mourning wreath,"
And there's a persistent wail all night.
"Let's go back tomorrow, tom."
I love a persistent wail.
"Well, I love a drink."
"Come on, let's all have a drink."
( sighs )
I've been lying on that sofa for as long as I can remember.
You live across the sound in west egg.
I know somebody there.
I don't know a single person.
You must know gatsby.
They said he only recognized Narin from a picture and pointed her by his hand.
"And they say ""Maybe, if Narin sees him, it will be good for him."""
I won't go.
Nobody can make me go there.
I will die..
Why do you bring this topic up when she is here.
You know better...
I had to say it Mom.
"Of course, it is up to her..."
They are cursed by many people.
"Now, these curses take their toll on their children."
I have never cursed.
This is not my curse...
Not my curse...
It is from my Lord...
"How is Duriye, Doctor Bey?"
Her blood pressure is normal now.
I gave her a medicine and she is sleeping.
"But, we have to be careful."
"It doesn't matter if we are careful, her son is always on her mind."
Have you talked to Narin?
I told her everything.
"But, You have to see it from her side."
Narin said she won't go.
She already did what she wanted to do to us.
She had Mustafa wrapped around her finger.
"She stole my husband, too."
She must be laughing at us right now.
You don't eat...
You don't drink...
"And then you don't have any strength for anything, of course..."
Does a wheelchair suit a handsome young man like you?
"Sir, everyday you buy dozens of goods."
And haggle for just paisa 50 a dozen.
It's a long story.
- How long?
Its 5ft 7 inches long.
"People normally get married to fortunate, lucky and virtuous girls."
But I got a spendthrift wife.
She has changed the entire meaning of expenditure.
She spends my money like water flows.
Sometimes she shops for so long.. ..that she takes a blanket and a pillow.. ..and sleeps in the Home Department of the mall.. ..so that she can get up again in the morning and start shopping.
I'm done with shopping for small things.
The real shopping..
I will do it tomorrow.
Not just that.
If the stereo of the car doesn't work.. - She buys a new stereo.
"No, she buys a new car."
And look.
Do you see this dress?
Its worth 2.5 lakhs.
She says that Mallika Sherawat wore this dress in 'Murder'.
What do you say?
- Mallika Sherawat wore a dress in 'Murder'.
When?
- That's exactly what I say.
That's why I come here from Lokhandwala... ...to buy cheap fruits and vegetables.
"Brother, I pray that even Osama Bin Laden.. ..doesn't get a wife like mine."
"Oh, God."
- You intentionally ruined the dress.
"Mala, why would I do anything like that?"
Because you don't want me to look pretty.
That isn't possible anyway.
"Whether I do something or not, it would make no difference."
Whatever will happen will happen.
I don't care anymore.
Then everyone will know that it's an arranged marriage and you took money for it.
This and everything will be revealed to public.
And then not even my uncle and Münir Abi can save us.
Then we'll all end up in prison.
Kerim...
Do you have any idea what it means to go to prison as a rapist?
Who do you think is responsible for the news?
"Hey, could it be your Ebe Nine?"
Who else could have gotten suspicions and spoke with that newsman?
- Maybe it's Galip Usta.
- Of course...
- Galip Usta is good friends with Newsman Ahmet.
- And he hates us.
I bet it's your Galip Usta told him everything.
I bet it's him.
"Oh, Kerim..."
Don't know...
Maybe it's someone else.
"I mean, it can be anyone."
There were mixed thoughts regarding the incident.
- So it can be anyone...
"- Anyway, it's okay."
It doesn't matter now.
We need to be careful from now on.
"If they reach you and try to make you talk... ... you shouldn't give them anything, no matter how hard they try, you understand?"
"Or else, we will all be toast."
It'll ruin us all.
- Who is it?
- Vural.
Don't answer it.
- Find her quickly!
"- Yes, Sir!"
Try and stand up.
You should act more like a lady.
You got hurt because you involved yourself with thieves.
But it's fun.
You must think this is fun because you've never been hurt before.
But it's not fun if you're really hurt.
"Yes, I've never been hurt before."
Because I never got involved in anything.
Now you know that you can get hurt if you get involved in things you don't know about.
Just live like you normally live.
I let you do all this because I thought you knew where your boundaries were.
But you crossed that boundary today.
But I was worried about you.
That's crossing the boundary.
You can't come any closer.
Go back behind your boundary.
You're smart so you should understand.
Yes.
I understand very well.
Then go home.
Hong Gil Dong!
"Because of you, I hurt myself for the first time."
But I don't mind being hurt for you.
That's because you've never been badly hurt before.
I'm scared of the pain.
"But if I'm that scared, then perhaps I should stop."
- Don't come to the mountain again.
- Then come here in two weeks.
I'll wait for you.
For the last time.
- Mukaddes!
"- It's OK abi, no need to hurry."
"Sorry, my wife is coming now."
Good morning.
"I can understand how you feel, really."
I've met all kinds of people and situations in this profession.
I found cure to many wounded men.
"I will help you, too."
Yes.
I will help you.
"For instance, I won't file a complaint about you."
You broke into my house in the morning.
You almost suffocated me.
These are big crimes.
But I won't report you.
Thank you very much.
"Look, you go now and pull your mind together."
- And quit messing with Reşat Yaşaran.
- I am still not convinced though.
It'd be stupid of you to have him against you.
"- He is a man, whose hand you want on your back."
"- I'm fine, thanks."
You know what he said when he first heard of that incident?
"He said ""poor guy""."
"""Watch over him, don't let him ruin his own life."""
- What is it to him?
- That man works for this town!
Don't tell me bull shit!
"Look son, this man is so powerful."
Not only in this town...
He has a great empire in Istanbul.
You know how many people are working for him?
"One must not die, but kill."
One must kill.
He is not an idiot.
But he made me an idiot before everyone.
"Hey, dont cry."
It does not matter whether this coward lives or dies.
"You, old woman!"
Put the marriage mark on my face.
Hello!
Bhadranna!
Tell me what the matter is.
I am coming to Hyderabad.
If you make a single phone call.. ..I will send the entire Hyderabad to you.
Why do you need to come? - Because I need to kill a person.
Why do you take the trouble?
Tell me who he is and I will have him killed in an encounter.
No.
I must hack him to death in the open street.
"Okay, if you wish let it happen that way."
Before I finish my work and return to Warangal.. ..they should be no report of any activity in Hyderabad.
There should be no law and order.
"Okay, as you wish."
See you later.
"Look here DCP, for 24 hours.. ..ignore any incident that happens in the city."
- Ok.
"Hey, leave us."
Is it true that someone kidnapped her?
"No, that is not correct."
She twisted her ankle and was in hospital.
She will not give any interview now.
Go away.
"My boy, have you come?!"
That's the equation -- this is the line that ... of
"solutions to 2x-y=0 my first row, first equation."
"So typically, maybe, x equal a half, y equal one will"
work.
And sure enough it does.
"Okay, that's the first one."
Now
the second one is not going to go through the origin.
It's
always important.
Do we go through the origin or not?
"In this case, yes, because there's a zero over there."
"In this case we don't go through the origin, because if x and y are"
"zero, we don't get three."
"So, let me again say suppose y is"
"zero, what x do we actually get?"
"If y is zero, then I get x is minus"
three.
"So if y is zero, I go along minus three."
So there's
one point on this second line.
"Now let me say, well, suppose x is"
minus one -- just to take another x.
"If x is minus one, then this is a"
"one and I think y should be a one, because if x is minus one,"
then I think y should be a one and we'll get that point.
Is that right?
"If x is minus one, that's a one."
"If y is a one, that's"
a two and the one and the two make three and that point's
on the equation.
Okay.
Just run away.
Just run.
Don't ask why you're going to get the eight pages; just go get them.
Don't play it at night.
You will... you'll die.
Don't play it alone at all.
Or in the dark... you two.
"(Finebros) And finally, will you ever play ""Slender"" again?"
- Probably not.
- Never.
"- God, no!"
- No!
Maybe to see if it has the same effect.
"Maybe if I'm, like with my friends in broad daylight, yeah."
Yes.
I am going to go play it.
Yes.
"Yes, I will."
"I know, for some reason, I'm gonna end up playing it again."
"Curiosity is gonna get the best of me, and I'ma play it again."

"Make sure you subscribe, or I'll send Slender Man after you and your children."
"If you're scared of Slender, just listen to this joke, okay?"
What do you call a shoe made from a banana?
A slipper.
Ha!
"I'll see you next time, unless Slender Man gets me."

"Okay, I did notice there's a few people with sore throats who've got coughing, so to make it nice and peaceful during the talk can we all cough in unison at the beginning"

This place is quite big for a robot safari park.
"Ah, there's the border."
Hello!
A real elephant has come here.
What are you talking about?
But look...
-Then go over to that side.
"-Yes, sir!"
There is an invisible beam fence around this place.
Then where did this elephant come from?
It can never enter this place!
It must be a robot.
"No, this is a real..."
Leave.
I'm busy.
This is a real one for sure.
But it is true that it did come from somewhere.
"Hey, where did you come from?"
Hold on.
"Atom, Atom."
He's late.
Where did he go?
Doctor Ochanomizu.
Welcome to our safari park.
"Hey, Doctor Hura."
How is it?
Isn't this a wonderful park?
I feel reluctant to use animals for hunting even if they were robots.
You are still too serious.
Real animals are decreasing in its number recently.
So I developed animal robots that's the same as real ones so tourists can observe them and enjoy hunting.
That's why I opened this safari park in this vast field of Africa.

"1051 01:28:55,025 --&amp;gt; 01:28:58,547 Everything is wonderful but how can these come here?"
"1052 01:28:58,576 --&amp;gt; 01:29:01,826 Ender is humiliating your party."
"1053 01:29:03,300 --&amp;gt; 01:29:08,200 A fair needs for street's colors you know..."
"1054 01:29:20,275 --&amp;gt; 01:29:23,021 Ok mom, I will take care of it."
- Are you in bad terms with Mira?
"1055 01:29:23,100 --&amp;gt; 01:29:26,100 No!"
- Why you're not with her then?
"1056 01:29:26,756 --&amp;gt; 01:29:28,967 Don't suffocate the kid!"
"1057 01:29:30,268 --&amp;gt; 01:29:33,457 I will find the boys."

"1059 01:29:46,029 --&amp;gt; 01:29:48,186 The night you left me and went because of this blighter 1060 01:29:48,238 --&amp;gt; 01:29:51,536 :"
I didn't go for anyone.
I left because you annoyed me.
"1061 01:29:51,600 --&amp;gt; 01:29:55,100 Don't blame the others for your mistake!"
"1062 01:29:56,264 --&amp;gt; 01:29:58,864 In fact, do you know which our problem is?"
"1063 01:29:59,727 --&amp;gt; 01:30:02,661 We encountered very early with you"
"1064 01:30:03,751 --&amp;gt; 01:30:05,910 So..."
"1065 01:30:07,312 --&amp;gt; 01:30:09,583 I mean.. 1066 01:30:10,500 --&amp;gt; 01:30:17,200 don't ever leave from my side tonight,don't allow anyone to come between us ."

"1069 01:30:49,000 --&amp;gt; 01:30:53,400 Wow..."
Bravo Eylul!
Bravo!
You were great You were great -Finally!
This is Brooklyn.
My last solo filming remains.
It's raining so much right now.
I'm filming a piano scene today.
I hope it comes out well.
"This piano has been with me since the days of ""I Remember""."
Do you remember?
This piano from the gun shot scene and raining scene.
"It's returned for ""Coffee Shop"" as well."
Wearing a white t-shirt and sneakers.
That's my ideal girl.
ls there any girl who looks good in a white t-shirt and sneakers?
The staff has a harder time for this shoot.
"I just need to rap, but everyone else... is out of breath."
The fountain suddenly burst.
All the sound equipment is in there but the fountain suddenly burst.
lsn't this the beauty of filming?
Hey that dog is taking a bath.
He seems happy.
Look at him drinking water.
We're done.
I'm done filming.
Him Chan and Jong Up were supposed to film here too.
But the NY weather is not good today.
It's cold and raining a lot.
"Unfortunately, we have to stop filming."
So everyone has to go to the studio for group filming.
There's more working than playing in NY.
But I'm still happy.
When else could I come here?
We just talked about our taste for music and dancing.
He says I have very good control.
"No, I don't."
I don't know.
What are you saying?
I...
I can't remember.
I drank and blacked out.
"That is why I told you to be careful, didn't I?"
There are always eyes everywhere.
Who the heck did something like this?
"President, who brought these photos?"
I will immediately just!
There is no need for that.
I already took care of it.
Indeed!
"Still, we can't be relieved."
We don't know when other photos will circulate.
That can't happen.
All my female fans will disappear.
These photos are completely embarrassing.
"So, go abroad for awhile and take a rest."
It is easier to take care of it when you aren't around.
What about the schedules?
"Do you know the saying, ""penny-wise and pound-foolish?"""
We can't incur a great loss by pursuing a small profit.
Go!
Go Dong will be waiting for you downstairs.
Hyungnim!
Over here!
What is this?
It's this car again?
The President said to be careful so that we aren't seen by others.
"Get in, Hyung."
How dare you stare at my brother?!
For this criminal?
Criminal?!
"Not he, you all are criminals... ...who are stopping him from being a good person."
You are forcing him to be evil.
Go and make him good as you want.
Go away... go... get lost.
You are dead for us. you are dead.
"Yes, go away with him."
No one will stop you.
"Yes, I'll go away."
Right now.
"Let's go, Kishna."
"No, Radha."
I'll not take you away in this way.
Mother!
"Mother, if I wanted to elope with Radha I'd have done that 2 years before."
But now I'll take her away with respect and self-esteem.
Self-esteem!
Cultured people are self-esteemed... ...not some dirty blood.
Because I recognize dirty blood as goons.
Father!
"I'm sorry, I respected you."
You are not even worth for this respect.
Because my parents were poor... ...but they were very rich by hearts.
They knew to respect their guest even if he's their enemy.
"Kishan, I beg of you."
"Please, go away."
Go away!
- I'm going.
But he has blamed my blood by accusing my parents.
I'll never step in this house again.
They all look like superstitious rubes.
They've got no credibility.
Thomas will rip them to pieces.
"You'll be worse off than you are now, if that's possible."
You're gonna replace me on this case.
You've screwed it up beyond all repair.
But the archdiocese feels that replacing you now... ...would only draw more unnecessary attention to the trial.
"But just so we're clear, Bruner... ...if you put that priest on the stand again, I will fire you."
You've been crying.
- Dr. Cartwright is dead.
- What?
He was killed.
There was an accident.
I'm sorry.
I know he was your friend.
We've lost.
"Without his testimony, it's over."
No.
"No, no, no, it isn't over."
We're telling Emily's story.
That's what matters.
- It can't be worth all this.
"- Yes, it is worth it."
Just let me go back on the stand and tell the rest of the story.
- I can't do that.
- You must!
You must.
"Erin, you once said that you felt you were on the right path."
Don't stray from that path.
"Here, take this."
- What is this?
- Just read it.
Nothing to detect these units.
-	Ghosts cloaking.
"They are going to try and EMP all of the Sentries, if he does, he can go in for an attack."
EMP on the entire army!
His entire army is EMP'd!
He Stims and goes in to finish them off.
If he destroys this army he will win the game and advance to the round of 16!
So many Marauders!
The Vikings taking out every single Colossus and BoxeR is on the verge of winning the game and the series.
"Here he goes in, stimming one more time, the Medivacs healing everything."
"Avenge on the run, falling back into his expansion, we might see a GG any moment now."
-	Ohh..
And a Nuke!
"-	Nuclear Missile, dropping onto Avenge's natural expansion where his army is right now."
The Nuke's gonna land on his army!
"-	Ohh, is he going to get his units away?"
-	Ooooohhhhh!!
-	Nuclear Missile killing everything.
"-	BoxeR, 100 supply ahead."
-	Winning the third game!
"- With those Vikings you shoot forward, trying to get rid of those Colossi."
Not overcommitting his ground units quite yet.
And uh..
Actually lost quite a few Vikings in all that.
Choya is giving him chase and going to chase him right into the main base.
"There is the defensive nuke, if he can hold this wall right here, he's got it."
The nuke could go down right in the middle of all these units.
- Oh no!
Oh no!
And it looks like..
"Oh no, Choya!"
- Ohhhhhhh!!!
(chuckles)
"Fred:Oh, and I almost forgot to say,"
"I'm gonna give Judy a basket, too."
"Um, I don't know why, exactly, but for some reason, my ""Fred"" channel on YouTube says that I joined two years ago."
"If I would've joined two years ago, I'd only be 4 years old."
Do you really think I'd know how to work a computer if I was 4?
"Seriously, I thought you were smarter than that."
"So, yeah, it wasn't actually my channel."
"I was just annoying YouTube, I kept banging on their, you know, door."
"And finally, they said, ""Okay!"
"We'll give you the channel."""
Time to go outside!
Here I go!
(laughs)
Fred:Let's run!
Happy May Day!
(gasps) (gasps in slow motion) (screams)
Fred:He threw the basket at my face!
(Fred crying)
"Fred:I spent so much time working on that basket, trying to make people happy, he threw the darn basket at me!"
"Oh my God, look at this."
"I just realised that right behind me in my neighbor's yard, there's a dog kennel."
"You know inhumane that is, locking your dogs in frickin' gates?"
"How would you feel if I locked you in between gates and watched you from above, laughing evilly?"
(Fred laughing evilly)
Fred:Dogs don't like it either.
"(Fred) Oh, my God, look at this kitty."
"She doesn't wanna be discovered be me, look at her run."
"Fred:Oh, it's a stray kitty with lice."
"Also, I bit one of the other kids in my neighborhood and gave him rabies."
"Oh, my God, she just bit me!"
She just bit me and I'm foamin' from the mouth!
The girl made this up because she was scared of you.
"She went away with Kerim, willingly."
And that's all there is to it.
This is a terrible ruse!
It's a disgusting frame set up by my rivals there.
Then do whatever necessary to clean up this mess.
- What's in the news?
It says Selim did it?
"- They're fabricated news, dear."
- Who's the girl?
- Will you calm down please?
Do whatever's needed to clean it up.
If my family's name gets involved in such a scandal... ...
"I will burn the bridges, just so you know."
"Meltem, calm down sweetie."
Let's first understand what it is.
Then do what needs to be done.
Don't waste time.
"I'll be on it right away, don't worry."
God...
My hands and legs are shaking.
God damn whoever is responsible for this slander.
- I'll be waiting for your call.
- I'll call you right away.
"We're toast now, Perihan."
We're toast.
God damn it!
"Girl, look..."
It's on the local news only.
It's most likely a slander.
That's what the man said.
For God's sake...
Let's do it again.
- All right.
Last and final tour of the lmperial Drama and Comedy Theatre soloist.
What markets there used to be in those rich lands!
And now?
Nothing but freedom.
Got to pull in your belts under the new chief.
Orders are to trade and be jolly.
No peaceful sleeping these days.
"I'm telling you, my dears:"
Empty your storehouses before you have them emptied for you.
"Come and see, Granny!"
It's our last performance.
I'm just passing through.
I'm leaving tonight by the last horse.
"Back home to Odessa, city of songs and chestnuts."
"I'm Buba Kastorsky, Maker of original songs."
"I sing my songs, I think, alright."
"I sing to the left, I sing to the right,"
The public always finds My songs a delight.
And why so?
Because...
"I'm Buba Kastorsky, Maker of original songs."
"There's rumours afloat, The old women say"
You can hear the cock At break of day:
Cockadoodledo!
"I'm Buba Kastorsky, Maker of original songs."
"I see my cow, Nyurka, and a piece of paper on her horn."
"It said: "" Here's your cow, Aunt Darya."
Don't fear.
"We'll get the bandits! """
Their sign is the cuckoo's call and the cock's answer.
"You're in love with him too, Doe Eyes!"
Just drink.
Please forgive me for not accompanying you today.
I ran away.
So you shouldn't have come with me anyway.
Can you guess where the tea leaves are?
Here.
I was watching the whole time.
- It's no fun playing with you.
- Let me do it again.
"I've become a bit strange, haven't I?"
But I feel really at ease.
"You're drinking too much, aren't you?"
You should only be drinking from crystal clear streams.
It's because I'm so happy to see you!
"Now that we've spent some time, we should take our leave."
Just stay a while longer.
It feels like olden days when I'm with you.
It feels like Gil Dong is with us like olden days!
"When I'm with you, I'm so happy because"
I can talk about Gil Dong with you.
"I thought you'd forgotten about him, but it seems you haven't."
I shouldn't think of Gil Dong.
I forgot again.
Stupid!
"Even though Gil Dong is dead, we should still remember him from time to time."
But I shouldn't think about him at all.
Because... then I can't go on.
I couldn't sleep.
I couldn't eat.
I couldn't stop crying.
I saw Gil Dong everywhere like it was a dream. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I kept calling him to go with him.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;But he would just vanish.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
"May it be easy, dot com.."
What's up?- you tell me..(the news comes from you).
What?
I am saying news come from you.
Anyhow you follow the two sides.
"What are you saying, man?"
"I'm saying anything... whatever, what can i tell you.."
"What kind of a girl are you, man?"
How do you play with everyone separately?
"Look here, you, what are you bullying around?"
"While your best friend was living a tragedy last night, you went to hang out with the others."
How was it?
Did you have fun at least?
"Whith who did i go, i don't understand?"
With Hale and others...Now you blackbirded to Mira for atonement....
Congratulations.
"I'm looking, even there is no Sun to have affected your head.But firstly, last night I was at home all the time ."
We talked with Mira by phone until this morning.
"So ,this night you were not with Orkun and others?"
First repair your head...
Unbalanced!
Well balanced!
(Stable) !
"Yaman, where?"
"I am going to the other side to my neighborhood,I have things to do on the reeve."
Jump in..
"No, thanks, the bus is coming.."
"Come on, get it."
I was going to piano lesson.
I could not stay at home.
"I wanted to get out as soon as possible. get in, i 'il drive you, and we can talk as well."
I will get out by the metro station.
"761 01:02:19,800 --&amp;gt; 01:02:23,700 Don't do this!"
"Don't, don't."
"762 01:02:23,755 --&amp;gt; 01:02:27,083 If you will cry like thisdon't play."

"764 01:02:37,800 --&amp;gt; 01:02:41,100 I couldn't leave him there."
"I paid his caution 765 01:02:41,200 --&amp;gt; 01:02:45,400 She will be staying with us until his mom is released."
"766 01:02:52,830 --&amp;gt; 01:02:55,106 Who's that women?"
"767 01:02:58,200 --&amp;gt; 01:02:59,900 MOM?!!"
"768 01:03:06,900 --&amp;gt; 01:03:11,900 MY SON! my sweetheart."
"769 01:03:12,024 --&amp;gt; 01:03:13,844 MOM..."
"770 01:03:23,500 --&amp;gt; 01:03:27,000 Mr. Nevin was released today."
"771 01:03:30,600 --&amp;gt; 01:03:33,300 Thank you..."
"772 01:03:49,832 --&amp;gt; 01:03:52,435 -You were awesome."
-Thank you.
"773 01:03:52,496 --&amp;gt; 01:03:58,155 I am afraid that this talent will fall away between these four walls"
"774 01:03:59,400 --&amp;gt; 01:04:02,000 But the music in my heart will never keep silent."
"775 01:04:02,100 --&amp;gt; 01:04:05,800 Because of I knowing that , I did something without asking you 776 01:04:05,942 --&amp;gt; 01:04:11,106 I wrote a reference letter for you to the New York Conservatoire."
"777 01:04:11,106 --&amp;gt; 01:04:15,395 I sent them one of your records too...- no.. 778 01:04:15,500 --&amp;gt; 01:04:21,400 Dear Mira, I want you to have an education which would make you happy."
You are very talented.
"779 01:04:21,600 --&amp;gt; 01:04:26,600 But I don't want to be a concert pianist 780 01:04:26,700 --&amp;gt; 01:04:32,100 I just want to sing."
I want to do my own music.
"781 01:04:32,200 --&amp;gt; 01:04:34,800 Do what you want!"
"782 01:04:34,900 --&amp;gt; 01:04:38,800 Please don't set up dreams which will never come true."
"783 01:04:38,900 --&amp;gt; 01:04:41,000 It will make me unhappier after."
"784 01:04:41,100 --&amp;gt; 01:04:46,500 Are you going to be happy studying in the financial department of Asim Sekip Kaya University ?"
"785 01:04:46,700 --&amp;gt; 01:04:51,700 My agenda was programmed, you know..."
"It's impossible to fight with my mom 786 01:04:51,900 --&amp;gt; 01:04:56,200 I will study for finances at Asim Sekip Kaya University, later masters in America."

"Orkun (5), dad (2), mom (5), Mert (3 790 01:05:18,251 --&amp;gt; 01:05:21,668 Ohh there is the fair!"
"791 01:05:26,500 --&amp;gt; 01:05:29,000 What happened that he took back his complaint?"
"792 01:05:29,024 --&amp;gt; 01:05:31,404 We don't know."
Awesome.
You'd do that for me?
"Yeah, I would."
"First you have to get your audition tape put together, and, uh, Mr. Collins has final say."
Don't worry about the camera.
"I normally only loan it out for a couple of days, but for you, you can keep it for as long as you want it."
Thanks.
Let me know if there's ever anything I can do for you.
Good luck on your audition tape.
I hope we'll be working together soon.
Count on it.
"What are you gonna do for your audition tape, Liz?"
I'm not sure yet.
Something with substance.
"Well, I don't know about you guys, but I want to be the director."
How hard can it be?
I choreographed all our best cheers this year.
I'm sure I can handle a little news show.
"Hello, future fans and news junkies."
Make room for Sweet Valley's new Barbara Walters.
Since when are you interested in journalism?
Journalism?
It's TV news.
"Easy, Babs."
You have to research and write your own stories.
"Details, details."
It's a small price to pay for having my face in every classroom.
"Hey, Winston!"
What's up...
Patman?
"Now, why so suspicious?"
"""Winston""?"
"That would work, as well."
Doctor?
How is Mustafa Bulut?
"He isn't very well, right now."
"But, it is still early."
- He will get better.
- How can he get better?
"Is the technology to make him well discovered in this world, yet?"
"For me, I think he has found the perfect place for himself!"
They should leave him alone.
"Really, it was because of you, Doctor!"
"Thanks, to you!"
"Really, thanks!"
You don't know what it is to live under those conditions.
We wanted him to go there for treatment.
"So, that he gets better and gets out."
We have no other agenda.
"Okay, my dear... drink this.."
Isn't it a hospital?
He is there to get well.
Your husband is going to get better and come home.
You can't carry on like this.
"But, Mom, what can I do?"
"How can I bear this, Mom?"
"Go to sleep, my daughter."
"Come, sleep."
Pray to God.. it will give you strength.
"Hey, Naciye... look for second.."
"Don't mess with me, Safiye..."
I will tear your hair out!
"You crazy idiot, aren't we from the same village?"
"I just called over to have you drink a soda, relax, tell me your trouble... come.."
Editorial staff.
"So those would, those would be my two concerns."

"He's saying, there are broken idols of God on that land.. ..so it's become inauspicious."
The place has become cursed.
"- Oh, God!"
No one will buy this land.. ..that's the rumour in the market.
Nimish.
"100 years later, when people find.. ..idols of God under that land, the prices will shoot up by 4 times."
Four times.
And people will construct a temple there as well.
lf anyone wants the buy the land he can.. ..otherwise I care a damn.
What now?
I've an idea.
"What are you doing, Kanji?"
Suicide!
"Sister-in-law, suicide.."
Papa. - kahan kahan?
Leave me.
What are you doing?
- Papa..
I am not a coward.
I will file a case.
Have you lost it?
He's gone crazy.
You will file a case against an insurance company.. ..worth 3000 crores!
I'm sure there are many others like you.. ..who have filed a case against the insurance company.
There must be others like me who might have filed a case.. ..but no ever filed a case against your Kishen.
I...will...file a case against your God.
"What are you doing? "" Who controls this world? """
""" Who's that sitting high up in the sky? """
""" Why are You hiding behind the clouds? """
""" Why are You afraid of being seen? """
"Duriye Teyze, I swear..."
You should have seen it..
"He aimed at the most vile, problematic person in the garden..."
Oh Gosh...
Unbelievable...
"Yasar dude, have you seen what your brother did?"
Good job...
"You are raising a child there, it seems.."
Why didn't you play long donkey and five stones?
The man has gone...
My husband has gone...And you don't even care...
My son has gone...
"It is only Narin who can do something about this, but... the Doctor is not going to say anything to her, either."
Give that to me...
You go and bring the cold meals from the downstairs.
Stuffed grape leaves and beans...
Asiye!
Go away!
Don't spill your poison here...
It is easy for you to say go...
You didn't see Mustafa in the nuthouse.
"But, I did."
I wish I were blind and didn't see him in that condition.
He is finished Hatun Abla.
They ruined my husband!
"Not just me, he doesn't even recognize his parents."
He looked at us as if he was a five year old kid.
They just don't diaper him; it is that terrible...
"We took old pictures there,  thinking that they may help him to remember..."
He only recognized Narin.
He pointed at her with his finger.
He has kept only... ...Narin in his mind.
That's fantastic.
"I'm gonna get a lovely frame on that,"
'cause Nina's got a frame like that.
[laughs]
"That's really cool, Jack."
Thank you.
"Now, you should be very proud of yourself, Jack, considering you almost got chucked out of school."
"You was lucky there, weren't you?"
"Yeah, you've matured, actually-- actually, in the last year or so quite good into a real proper lad, a real gentleman and a nice boy."
[engine turning]
"Thanks for that, Jack."
man speaking native language:
Who do you love a lot? boy speaking native language:
My dad... because he brings me fruit.
"He cooks my lunch, makes me breakfast."
"He prepares everything, all the food we eat."
He cares more about me than his work.
The thing I love the most is my laptop.
"In Wikipedia, there are stories, history, math, science, religion."
It has everything.
It is a giant library.

Coated chicken baked in the oven with seasonings. man:
"My story is, I can't work, because who else would look after my kids?"
"My wife passed away, my children's mother."
I've got a 20 year old son who is sick.
He's a retard.
We have to tie him up all day to stop him wandering off.
Fourteen people live in this place.
"We have no electricity, no water, no drains."
But we are still alive.
God will not forget us.
He created us.
That is what I believe.
God wouldn't have created this population just to forget us.

Why do you keep looking behind you?
- I look to see if anyone's following.
- Barış is right.
This has been an obsession in you.
You need to relax.
"Nothing as it look, Zeynep."
He still wants to kill me.
Who?
Barış.
He will not rest until he gets rid of me.
"Do you hear what you say, Burak?"
You don't know Barış.
He is so dangerous.
He killed Ferhat.
He's the one who put the gun in my car.
He also sabotaged my car.
Did you tell this to the police?
"No, because I need to find an evidence first."
"That is, if he doesn't kill me before."
"No, that will not happen."
My department also has the same opinion.
"You doubted him right, Damodar."
This is Jimmy's report.
I've brought it from intelligence department.
He's a smuggler.
He's connected with a smuggling gang from Singapore.
This is his file.
"The moment we get some evidence, we'll arrest him."
That's a lie.
Fine!
"I'm lying, Damodar is lying."
Even the ClD officers are lying.
Only my friend Shreekant is right.
But uncle.
How You better don't interrupt.
Just keep quiet.
If the son-in-law will be a smuggler... ...your house will be filled with smuggled goods.
We'll become a millionaire.
Our daughter will be happy.
Our family will get prestige.
- Mr. Bharat!
- Yes.
Did you understand?
My son-in-law can't be a criminal.
This marriage can't take place.
Never...
Jimmy!
A smuggler can never be my son-in-law.
"So, I'm canceling this marriage."
Had I not concerned about my prestige... ...I'd have punished you for this fraud.
Shreekant!
No!
"Don""t worry, sir."
Friendship is nothing compared to duty. very good!
This is what I expected from you.
Now you can declare him a criminal.
"And declare a reward of 50,000 rupees on his arrest. okay, sir."
- Thank you!
All the best!
How come you all are here today?
What has brought you here?
"What""s the matter, Mr. Diwan?"
- Where is shekhar?
I dismissed him a long time ago.
"But what""s the matter? shekhar has disappeared with gold worth 7 crores."
Gold worth 7 crores!
"Well done, shekhar!"
Great!
"You have served our country well! served? constable, our country needs gold desperately! our country could have got gold worth 7 crores! shekhar should receive a reward for this deed!"
"Bhuta singh, you too are misunderstanding!"
- How so?
You brought gold worth 100 rupees. okay.
But when did I bring it?
Just assume that you brought gold worth 100 rupees. okay.
- How will you make the payment?
By giving the goods.
- How much?
"For gold worth rupees 100, I will sell it at 200. so it""s a loss to the country."
Goods worth 100 came in.
"And goods worth 200 went out. constable, how can this be a loss to the country?"
The gold entered the country for free.
That is what I am asking.
Where is that gold?
"That is the problem, constable."
"Until then, that name did not exist."
"And so, the name ""christian"" was made to name Jesus's disciples."
"Christian, in its true form, it is the disciple of Jesus."
Jesus's follower.
But Jesus wants followers?
He wants disciples?
Of course!
The last word before going to the heavens was:
"""Therefore, go and make disciples."""
The last thing He said!
"Normally, the last words of a man is the most important thing, the legacy he will leave."
Jesus said:
"""I have been given all authority"""
"""in heaven and on earth."""
He begins with this.
Matthew 28.18.
"""I have been given all authority"""
"""in heaven and on earth."""
"""Therefore, go and make disciples"""
"Of where? ""of all the nations."""
From all places.
"""I want disciples, in all places,"""
"""of all nations."""
How to make disciples?
He answers:
"""Baptizing them in the name of the Father,"""
"""the Son and of the Holy Spirit,"""
"""and teaching them"" what?"
"""To obey everything I have commanded you."""
"""And surely I am with you always,"""
"""to the very end of the age."""
"So, in this job, I will help you."
If I kill him now.. ..he will become a hero in her eyes.
He must not become a hero.
"Hey Godess Laxmi, daughter of ocean God."
Take the Arathi baby.
Why are you looking me like that?
I have really changed.
I promise.
Come here I will explain you.
I accept that I am a bad man.
But I am not a bad father.
Sit down.
For the first time in my life I worshiped the God.
I took one decision after I prayed to all the Gods.
To perform your marriage with Venkat.
You are not understanding me.
I am not against your love.
I just want to know one thing.
"What is the difference.. ..between me, who is useless and him?"
I dont have any job and neither does he.
I am spending my time in clubs and he in the petrol bunk.
I dont have any shame so I am running this family.. ..by borrowing money from others.
But he is very hotblooded.
What will he do?
How will he earn money and look after you?
The house owner does not understand your love.
He demands his rent every month.
"The milk man, the provision store owner.. ..no one will understand your love."
Every one demand money.
How will you manage?
Did I say anything wrong?
He is also trying for a job.
What is his fault if he failed?
I don't see the point when I can just use an actual joystick.
"And what's really weird is that this thing, again, is just a piece of plastic."
"It doesn't have any wires connecting to it, you just plant it there."
And the buttons actually work!
"And it steers okay, too."
"To tell you the truth, I'm stunned."
Ass!
"So, that covers most of the dreaded NES accessories."
"But, I know that there's one in particular that I didn't mention, but, you know, can't do it all in one shot."
"So, we'll save it 'till later,"
"I'll see you next time,"
I think you know what's next.
Western illinois Women's Soccer returned home to face Grand View last week Sunday.

"I have to say it, it is a stupid, racist sentence, but it is also true:"
Somali people are always shouting.
It is always the real big drama.
This was a german Reunification-Shout.
This was a Bone-Breaking-Shout.
I can't bare certain pictures.
"When I see a cruel picture, a bloody picture,"
I loose consciousness a fall to the ground.
This happend for the last time in Berlin in the subway.
There are screens called Berliner Fenster.
"They showed an advertisment for a CD recorded by the German Opera, Semiramide by Rossini."
Then they showed a photo from Pulitzer Awards.
It was taken in the National Theatre in Mogadishu.
You see a man lying on the ground with summer clothing.
"The sun is shining, he smiles."
"There is a hole in his head, there's blood and parts of his brain everywhere."
When I saw this I fainted.
Oh God!
I worked with cruel pictures as well.
A serbian colleague asked me to participate in her performance.
She experienced the Kosovo-war when she was 15.
She described a footage that she saw.
That was broadcasted in the TV.
A prisoner was tied to a column.
His skull was cut open alive.
And the liquid from his brain was spooned out.
I shoul dance a derwish-dance.
That's a prayer of turkish monks.
You can fix my word here too.

"I will tell you guys, while Don's been talking, I've been up here occasionally and Chris, you tweeted to me, I responded."
I've been actually tweeting.
This answers your question Glen earlier.
"I'm using a wireless bluetooth keyboard connected to my phone and a bluetooth headset, which is why you guys haven't heard my phone babbling to tweet to various things that people have been answering."
[undecipherable comments]
[Other panelist]
Not my phone you can't.
[Coordinator in back of room]

'Kovan' Kovan?
'...
"Kovan, Shiva, Jesus...' and then in brackets it says,"
"I think, '[Matthew 6:21] all speak of the light, as does Ramana Maharshi."
They describe it as self-effulgent.
Can these be enlightenment...
"They break Rupert, the authentic redneck robot!"
No shit.
Doing business with a Jedi?
I'd sooner higher sand people to babysit my kids.
No!
That's terrible idea!
That was sarcasm you imbecile!
(sigh) I'm sending regional manager Darth Maul.
He will ensure that your Space Hooters functions at the highest level of operational efficiency... ...while maintaining a deep rooted commitment to customer satisfaction.
He'll take care of your Jedi problem.
And by the way. what kind of wood polish did you use on this table?
Murphy's Oil Soap?
That sheen is ridiculous.
Send a bottle of whatever it is back with Maul.
"I say screw that guy, mon!"
Jar Jar being annoying.
Look out!
Weesa gonna die!
Yousa too drunk to be driving!
Still annoying.
"Yousa called meesa to come pick yousa up from the club, right?"
Why don't yousa give meesa the keys meesa drive us home safely!
Why don't you try and take the keys and see what happens?
Violence happens.
Hello ladies.
"Master, let's throw these girls a Jedi surprise party."
Right.
Surprise bitches!
There's the blockade!
Uh oh!
Guys!
It's a DUI checkpoint!
What is this you are blowing out?
"Lado, have I turned epileptic?"
Why am I fizzing from the mouth?
Could it be that you made me take a bath with egg &amp;amp; gave me shampoo to eat?
"It is possible, I was in a hurry."
- What! !
"Not only my gun, even my brain hits right on target."
No one can cheat me.
"Because I, Zibago, if load people with money for loyalty. . ."
I even kill people for betrayal.
I've heard I will have to play with death again?
The fun lies only in this game.
You have to strike a deal of diamonds worth 100 million. . . in the swimming pool of Hotel Blue Diamond.
It will be done.
"But be careful, because this time, the police has information. . . that the diamonds have reached India."
"Mr. Zibago, I very well know how the police department functions."
You had to come at 1 1.
- Ask your daughter.
"She woke me up at 12, then how can I come at 1 1?"
Who asked you to run away with my daughter?
Where did I run?
I took her slowly by rickshaw.
I had to pay a fare of Rs.
7 0.
You still haven't paid me that money.
Why should I pay you?
Did you ask me and elope her?
Does any lover of the world . . . ask the girl's father when he is eloping his daughter?
It has become a routine with you.
You eat breakfast and come late to work.
Breakfast?
"Since I have married your daughter, I am eating grams."
of course if they go well as I hope.
"I need to take a breath too, this short holiday will be good for both of us."
"I also would like it very much , my baby but I have to be here on Monday."
"On Friday evening I'll pick you up at Dalaman, from the airport we will go straight to the ship."
"You have a guest, Sude Beylice."
"Yes, of course we'll talk again, see you, bye."
Welcome Sude.
Thank you.
"You know everything, so i get straight to the subject."
"Please , take a sit."
"I came to ask your advice, Mr.Asim."
"After last night's happenings in our life , i really don't know what to do."
Why are you thinking?
Leave it to Faruk to think .
"Yasemin, please bring us some coffee."
Let mine be quite strong please!-Of course.
Tell the captain to prepare the ship for the weekend.
Don't let anything be missing.
"I will invite my friends.- Good ,sir."
"Yes dear, now i'm listening you."
We must do this work before the switch sockets come.
Look!
Master!
I will change my clothes and will go.
"Okay, take your money..(pay)."
What money is that?- It's your pay for the week my boy.
Is that so?
- Were we going to make you work gratis?
May God make it plenty (way of thanking )- Use it with happiness &amp;gt;Thank you.
Hypocrite.
Be careful.
Faker.
It's good that you came.
Come over here.
"Ha Ni ah, the thing that you were talking about - the 'timing'"
The timing of the kiss
"I keep practicing this at home, but It seems there's a problem."
"""If you can forget me, try forgetting me."" this is 4.3 seconds..."
"During that time, what if Hae Ra leaves before then."
You'll have to do it before she leaves.
"Of course, I have to do it before she leaves."
"But you see, that timing doesn't really work out."
"Oh, well, what if you were... stand right here for me."
EH?!
"No, I don't want to"
"I did it for you that day, what's the need to do it again?"
"Please, do it for me."
I'll do it instead.
"Ok, then you do it."
Stand right here.
It worked well for Seung Jo.
"When I put my hand like this, the head that was facing down, tilt it up ."
If you can forget me...
"You saw that just now, right?"
The timing wasn't right
"Before the conversation is over, he already came it."
"It's too long, this 4.3 seconds."
"Sunbae, do you want to try it holding a racquet?"
"When you hold a racket, you turn into a completely different person."
"Confidence, and burning eyes."
Hae Ra!
Oh my god!
You startled me
"Oh, what do we do"
Then you will die
These men are loyal to Antony
"Yes, but they will follow your lead"
Antony!
Antony!
Stop him!
Move!
Get after him!
He's wonderful with the child
"I shouldn't wonder, he's a child himself"
You would do well not to disparage Antony is my presence
Are you that much in love with him?
ls your judgement that clouded?
"I am in love, Olympos, but my mind is clear"
Egypt needs him We need Antony's strength
You haven't really tested his strength Only his weaknesses
What do you mean?
"You are strong, my queen"
You have the metal to seize and heel the world
"But Antony, he wants only to seize you"
And that makes him weak
"You're wrong, Olympos"
Antony does share the vision
And he's not weak
Grattius!
What is it?
Why are you come to Alexandria?
Your Lordship
Octavius has stolen your legions in Gaul
General Cornelius?
Dead
He's deliberately flaunting me!
"Perhaps, is it because I came in?"
Are you leaving because of me?
"Anyways, it has nothing to do with you."
Don't relate everything to yourself.
What do you mean you're leaving this house?
"Until now, under your supervision..."
I have lived comfortably.
But I think it's now time to think about the path ahead of me.
"Just once, living by myself, getting a part time job..."
I want to throw myself into an absolutely unprotected world and watch over myself.
What kind of person am I?
What can I do?
Okay.
That's not a bad idea.
"Aigoo, but still..."
It hasn't been long since Ha Ni has come back.
"Hey, Seung Jo."
It has nothing to do with her.
It's my life.
Okay.
"Go try it out. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; What should I do? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; Seung Jo is going to move out of this house. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; I came back into this house. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; But this time, Seung Jo... &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; is going to leave. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net"
Where is Baek Seung Jo?
"If I don't try,"
We couldn't even meet like this.
"It's Seung Jo. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; Seung Jo, what are you doing by yourself? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; In what area are you living right now?"
"Hey, Baek Seung Jo."
"Since she doesn't have a chance, tell her to give up."
Tell her like a man.
Seung Jo!
All of a sudden...
It must be lonely living by yourself.
Well it doesn't seem all that bad since I'm with Yoon Hae Ra.
"Really, you made me so happy by coming here."
I was so touched that day...
"I couldn't stop the car, you couldn't talk with Yaman..."
"Enough to know that he is fine, I will come from time to time to see him even if it's from distance."
It's okay even if I don't talk.
It's enough for me to know that he is happy.
What's up?
Fine! &amp;gt; It's been a while we have met.
Do we use to meet in the past?
What's happening to you?
Let me know if we are on outs.
"No... far from it, why should be on outs.. for being on outs... there has to be a communication... right?"
What? &amp;gt; All the best with your studies!
See you!
Rudeness...
"He has grown in the mud but ,my kid didn't become dirty."
Don't let him become dirty!
Keep it if you want.
Really?
- Take !. there are more in the photo album.
Do you love Yaman?
"Yes...I mean like a friend,i love him.."
I have a boyfriend.
We are together for a long time.
Do you love him then?
"In fact if you look, it's very stupid to think of something like sitting here... but Orkun was always in my life, from my childhood."
We grew up in the same aquarium.
"I don't know if it's really love, habit or we got used to each other..."
We get on well.
"I mean Orkun is very nice, cheerful, ..."
Funny.. -Yaman is funny too...
"Yes, Yaman Is very different of course..."
O my God!
Hey!
Stop there.
Sorry sir.
Are you Venkat?
Yes sir.
Get into the jeep.
Why sir?
I will tell you in the station.
What is my crime sir?
Since you are supplying gunpowder.. ..to terrorists to prepare dynamite.
Dynamite!?
"Sir, I am working as supervisor .. ..in Shakti transport company."
Your owner has revealed your name.
Confess yourself kid.
I have surrendered myself.
Why do you want to have a dispute with police?
They will beat you.
Accept the truth.
I will kill you.
He is telling lies.
I dont know about any thing.
You tell the truth.
Do you remember what you said that day?
You said your lover insulted you.
You want to earn money in any way.
I took you into my company after I explained all the details.
"I had even promised to give you 10,000 rupees per month."
You are trying to drag me into this?
"Venkat, stop."
"Sir, please dont do it."
You are in uniform.
Think logically.
"Because logically.. - Grandpa, grandpa, grandpa."
What is this?
You were supposed to explain to Bunty about marriage and not logic.
"Don't change the topic, Tanya."
"Sir, you were saying something extremely important."
Please go ahead.
"We can.. - Yes, yes."
We can see the alpha Changeli.. ..which is four light years away from us.
We don't look at it the way we should.
But we look at it just as it looked four years ago.

- Correct.
The star called Turios that we see.
We see it like it was nine years ago.
We don't watch it..
By the way.. do you look at your face in the mirror?
Yes!
Every hour.
That isn't fresh either.
Its 10 nanoseconds old.
Tell me.. if you get an opportunity to go back into the past.. ..which mistake would you rectify?
My mom and dad's marriage.
"Yes, Grandpa, this is the topic."
Marriage.
Now ask him why refuses to marry me.
"Yes, why don't you want to get married?"
I am scared.
It's just an excuse.
If you have the courage to fall in love.. ..then you should be prepared for marriage as well.
Logically you should marry Tanya.
Stop saying that.
I'll bet we could really swing down there.
Just the three of us.
You and me... and all that money.

"Frank, is he hurt?"
It might be a broken arm.
He's probably sprained his ankle too.
"Oh, Glennie, I've told you a dozen times about that wall."
"Come on, partner, you get a free ride."
"I'll, uh..."
I'll call the doctor.
No wonder the world is left with on more virgins.
I've more class than the rest of them all.
Very high sounding!
"Your figure isn't too bad, though."
I can see that you have a hard on.
Have you made up your mind?
"If you want to do it, act fast before my mon returns."
What?
You're telling me to do it here?
You want to do it in the corridor?
Stop pulling my leg.
Who's calling the shots here?
You'd better find out.
I've never counted how many wet dreams I'm used to having.

"Hurry, get them out!"
"Let us go first,"

I don't trust you either.

* 5 years later *
"Your Majesty, Seong-won prince is here to see you."
I haven't seen you for a while.
"Where have you been, my brother?"
I've been wondering without staying in the same place.
"Your Majesty, I'm afraid you look so ill."
"I haven't been well for a few days,  but seeing you is making me feel much better."
How is the world outside of the palace?
The weather is cold enough to have fruits on the  trees and the colors of autumn are beautiful to see.
Your people are taking chrysanthemum flowers to make wine...
"This is happening often, recently."
The royal doctors don't know the reason either.
It's just very frustrating.
He will get better soon.
Your highness need not worry so much.
"You left so sudden, I was worried."
You worried about me?
My thoughtlessness made you both worry.
I'm just glad you come back healthy.
I came as soon as I heard of His Majesty's illness.
"Well, it's a key."

"Look, I'm just trying to change the world, okay?"
I don't have time for a grudge match with every poser in a parka'.
Besides there's kids in that park so...
Here's one from dead-not-sleeping.
"Long time watcher, first time writing."
Blah blah blah blah.
"""You always say in your blog that you will show her the way,"" show her you're a true villain."
Who is her?
And does she even know that you're...
Laundry day...
See you there.
Under things... tumbelling.
Wanna say...
"""Love your hair"""
Here I go... mumbling.
With my freeze ray I will stop...
The world.
With my freeze ray I will find the time to find the words to...
Tell you how...
How you make... make me feel.
What's the phrase?
Like a fool.
Kinda sick.
Special needs.
Anyways... with my freeze ray I will stop...
The pain.
"It's not a death ray or an ice beam, that's so Johnny Snow."
I just think you need time to know that I'm the guy to make it real.
The feelings you don't dare to feel.
I'll bend the world to our will.
And we'll make time stand still.
Oh -- oh my G-d.
What does that even mean?
She's in stage four.
"Legally, they quarantine you at stage five."
"The doctor said she shouldn't be using public restrooms, eating with others, or in the proximity of the disabled."
(TWEET!)
They have it wrong.
Maybe she has partial brain damage?
A unique strain of Tourettes?
There is no way Mom is an Obnoxious Bitch.
"Wake up, Jenna!"
We have to face this now.
There's gotta be something they can do.
What are the options?
Can -- Can she get surgery?
The doctor said there's not a surgeon in the country that would take that risk.
The procedure would kill her?
"No, the surgeon would."
Doctors say she's the most Obnoxious Bitch they've ever seen.
Is she going to die?
Not soon enough.
Those two are my daughters right there.
The one on the right I almost aborted.
"The one on the left has got G-d-knows-what swimmin"" in there."
I -- I need to call Steve.
"Oh, no!"
You cannot call Steve.
Why?
It runs in families.
They say it skips a generation.
You could be carrying an Obnoxious Bitch right now.
Oh!
Whoa!
"Sarcasm, that's original!"
"""Where are the gold bars you were supposed to pull out of that bank vault with your transmatter ray?"""
"""Obviously it failed or it would be in the papers."""
"Well, no, they're not gonna say anything in the press but..."
Behold!
Transported from there to here!
The molecules tend to shift during the...
Transmatter.... uh... events.
But they were transported in bar form.
And they clearly were...
"And by the way it's not about making money, it's about taking money."
Destroying the status quo because the status is not quo.
The world is a mess and I just...
Need to rule it.
I'm gonna...
Smells like cuman.
So transmatter is 75%.
And more importantly the freeze ray is almost up.
This is the one.
Stops time.
Freeze ray.
Tell your friends.
We have...
"Oh, here's one from our good friend Johnny Snow."
"""Dr. Horrible, I see you are once again afraid to do battle with your nemesis."
"I waited at Dully Park for 45 minutes."" Okay, dude."
You're not ... my nemesis.
My nemesis... is Captain Hammer

He dislocated my shoulder.
Again.
"Over here, continue there, continue there."
"So how many one, two, three, four, five."
Nine.
That's what it looks like.
So obvious. . No.
Okay.
"Now notice, what a pain this is."
Just so I can give you more headaches.
"By the way, you only have to build it once."
"We're going to have the code right here, right now."
So it's only you have to build it.
"It's just, we'll have the code right here, right now."
I ask you guys to put ones with an occasional zero down.
And then going to put zeros with an occasional ones down.
And then you're going to put some ones on the corners.
Okay.
"So, kinda problematic, cuz these guys and these guys are painful I got to figure out how to do that vector."
Okay.
"So, we'll do that."
But for right now let's do some easy things.
"Let's put down these ones, these ones, these ones, and these ones."
Notice where they go.
"This starts at n plus 1N,"
Right?
And this is a little N by N block.
"Or, in my notes, I think, that means it's a M by M block."
"It's N by N, these are M by Ns, M by Ms,"
Okay? you know what?
"If you say you said M I'd say no, you didn't hear me right."
You wouldn't know for sure if I said m or n.
They're so close.
I could lie.
Why do you ask?I guess there is a reason...
What are you doing here?
"Soon you'll wish to my fatherwelcome to freedom.My heart, my prayers are with you..."
Welcome.
My mother has not come yet?
She went to see Mahir he is coming tohis father trial?
Here Safija!
"Mother,will my brother come?"
"No daughter!He tried,but doctors forbade him to!"
"Come on, let us enter."
Bring in the defendant!
What happened to father?
"Do not worry, Mom ."
Do not worry
"Mr. Nazif,What happened to your leg?Are you hurt? a Small accident"
I askedwhat happened?
Mrs. Judge!...I knew that my son Mahirin critical condition in the hospital
The manager...imprisonment guards would not let me go and see my son...
"I thought,if I'm injuredthey will take me to the hospital and I'll see him but they did not want me to see Mahir..."
"Do not worry,dear grandpa!"
Uncle Black is very good!
He asked for youAs he opened his eyes!
"silence in the courtroom,otherwise I will send you out!"
"Son,do not be angryMrs.."
Judge!
SitMr.
Nazif.
Your Honor
This is important evidenceYou Need To Considerbefore the final decision.
I would like to clarify what mr.
Nazif said
"First, he was arrested yesterdaywhile trying to escape and then he hadthis little accident... he claims that it was all doneto see his sick son,but this is not true!"
"Kanji, people say you're doing this for publicity?"
Down with.. - Kanji!
Down with.. - Kanji!
Down with.. - Kanji!
- You?
- You will sit here.
"Sit, sit."
Hey insurance..
How's the Rolex?
Working fine.
Relax.

He's the one who spread the rumour about God eating butter.
All rise.
"Kanji, get up."
Mr. Kanji Lalji Mehta.
"- Yes, sir."
We've been informed that you'll defend your own case.
Yes..
"I don't have any other option, Your Honour."
The other lawyers are scared.
"So, I'll have to defend this case.."
"My lordship, this is a baseless appeal."
A publicity stunt.
There's no cause of action that can be proved in court.
"So I suggest, under order 7 rule no.11.. ..of the code of civil procedure."
This case be straightaway dismissed.. ..for out of cause action.
"Your Honour, my English isn't that good.. ..but I do understand that he's asking.. ..to shut down this case immediately."
Right?
You're right.
I don't want to get into this hassle in the first place.
"I'm a Gujarati, businessman."
What do you think she's makin'?
Looks like a dress.
"Well, that makes sense."
Since this is a dressmaker's shop and all.
Is there something I can help you with?
"Oh, so very sorry to trouble you, Rarity, but I need a quick favor."
Could you please fix the button for me?
It's my dress for the Grand Galloping Gala.
"Oh, no, no, no!"
You can't wear this... old thing.
You need a glamorous new outfit for the Gala.
And I'll make it for you.
No problem at all.
It will be my pleasure!
"Oh, that's really sweet of you to offer, Rarity, but I can't let you do that."
It would be so much work.
This dress is fine.
Twilight Sparkle.
I insist on making you a new dress.
-But...
"-No no, not a word!"
I won't take no for an answer.
"Well, in that case..."
"Thank you for your generosity, Rarity."
"Knowing your handiwork, I'm sure it will be absolutely beautiful."
"Let me guess, Applejack."
You don't want a new gown either.
Gown?
Shoot.
I was just gonna wear my old work duds.
"You can't possibly be serious, Applejack!"
You absolutely must wear formal attire.
Two months.
He says the kid hugged you.
So?
Nothing but a lousy gardener.
But he's alive.
Pryor might not want a dead man on his conscience.
"Yeah, what does he care?"
What he did to me.
He sits on his pennies.
"Yeah, what have we got to lose?"
Some money is better than no money.
All you gotta do is make another phone call.
"Well, if you won't do it, I will."
"All right, all right."
"You're in luck, Frank."
We're gonna trade you in.
"Ordinarily, I wouldn't have asked you to drop by, Lieutenant."
Probably just a crank call.
Something else happened this morning that disturbed us.
"Oh, thank you very much, Mr. Pryor."
What was it that disturbed you?
"Well, we found one of our cars down the road."
"It was abandoned, the key still in the ignition."
Stolen?
"No, nothing like that."
Our gardener was bringing it back from town.
"Look, it's probably just a false alarm."
I think he got bored with this job and took off.
Frank would have told us.
He's a responsible man.
"My wife has great faith in human nature, lieutenant."
She should have been a social worker.
Sorry.
I gotta tell it where to do this on the negative one.
Sorry.
There we go.
"So I put down a C2, look at that. . See that?"
"So, what Spy's powerful per-say boom, boom, boom."
Zero.
"Boom, boom, boom."
Zero.
"Boom, boom, zero."
Got it.
"Now, the other one is interesting, cuz it's up here, and it's Up this, it's this one here."
For the zero set.
"So, it's like P2, but just shifted up by one."
Okay?
So I could take this E2 vector and just shift it all.
Okay.
Which I'm going to do.
Alright.
"And then for the, but, but first let's build the occasional, the 0's with the occasional one."
So let's make a vector called P4.
Which will be just a bunch of zeroes.
"And now what I'm do on this one, is put an occasional one, so E4."
Just like this guy.
Equals one.
"So now, there's the occasional one, there's the occasional zero."
"And I put this E4, actually this one here, interestingly enough."
"And, we won't have time to talk about everything yet."
"But, I'll show you where it goes, it actually goes over there."
Occasional one.
Now the thing is when I put this one over here I have to shift it by one.
This one here is shifted down.
I have had enough of doctors and hospitals..
"I certainly hope God doesn't get rid of them, but... ..I don't have the strength to see them.."
I don't know what to do.
"Don't worry about me, I will be fine."
You take care of your son.
- Save my Mustafa from all this.
"- God, look at this!"
"You don't have any strength in your limbs or tongue, but you are still nagging at me!"
Seher...
Take your lady to her room so she can rest..
I know what I need to do.
"I know what I need to do, as well, Duriye!"
Go to your room and lie down!
Seher!
"God, give me patience!!!!"
"Are you happy, Ms. Narin?"
Asiye?
We went to see Mustafa a little bit ago...
"But, he didn't see us."
"Do you know, my husband, a mountain of a man, has become almost vegetative?"
"You will celebrate, now!"
"Our new work place is here, Pasa."
"Ah, Doctor?"
Isn't this the place where we had the situation with the picnic?
"Yes, it is."
"If we can provide not just for the farmers, but for the social needs of the community, then we will have won, Pasa."
Yes...
"Actually, a astro turf would be great here."
Really... no...
"No, that won't be enough for you!"
"For you, hopefully, we will build an Olympic stadium."
It will be the Ali Olympic Stadium.
"That'll be ten marks, about t---"
"This scoudrel took off without paying,"
He just upped and left.
Sacramentum what a redhead.
He didn't take off.
I was just trying if your powder is the real thing.
Here's your money.
"Thank you, thanks a lot!"
"Just like that, excellent!"
Would you like anything else.
"Nothing else, thanks, except that you stop calling me a redhead behind my back."
"Goodbye, I'm off."
Goodbye
Come back again.
"Hey, redhead!"
"Here, take this suitcase to the teacher's apartment."
Now I'm out of breath.
"Oh my god, where did this brat disappear to."
That must have been a stone from under a car tyre.
The doorbell is ringing.
The doorbell is ringing.
"Oh how long I was waiting for you, darling."
Dear teacher.
My master dear.
Why do we meet so rarely.
How nice it is that school has breaks.
We can spend the entire break together.
"When we'll be together all the time for all our lives, we'll bear the good and the bad things together."
Take a seat on the sofa.
What a lovely sofa.
And now we'll have a cup of hot coffee together.

"Right now, the sun is really high up."
I think I'll get to film when the sun's about to set.
I can tell you one thing.
My character's concept is to read a book while waiting for someone.
It doesn't really match my personality.
That's my concept for the shoot.
Let's go for it!
"Stand there, just stand there."
Stand!
Come this way a little bit.
That's not it.
I don't know how to use the camera.
This is just all picturesque.
I'm a celebrity but I don't like to get dressed up.
Usually...
I don't like wearing make-up I don't like putting on hairspray.
I don't like fancy clothing either...
I don't think I'm meant to be a celebrity.
None
I don't think dressing up is all that nice.
I'm not a foxy guy.
I'm more like a bear.
Nice.

Whale song.
"The male whale is known to sing for up to 22 hours at a time. Because whales do not have vocal cords, they make songs by forcing air through their nasal passages. Every male has a different song. We don't yet know why they sing, it might be to call a female or scare away other males. The songs are made up of a pattern of low notes repeated over a period of hours or days. The whales slowly change their songs over a period of years."

"John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough"
"John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough (26 May 1650 – 16 June 1722) was an important English soldier and statesman. He lived through the rules of five monarchs through the late 17th and early 18th centuries. Rising from a lowly page at the court of the House of Stuart, he faithfully served the Duke of York through the 1670s and early 1680s. This gave him military and political advancement through his brave, clever skill. Churchill helped secure James on the throne."
"However, just three years later he left his Catholic teacher for the Protestant Dutchman, William of Orange. For his help in the Glorious Revolution, William at his coronation made him Earl of Marlborough (pronounced /'mɔ:l b""ə""ɹə/). He served in the early years of the Nine Years' War and became famous. However, charges of Jacobitism made him fall from office. For some time, he was imprisoned in the Tower. When Queen Anne came to throne in 1702, however, Marlborough secured his fame and lots of money."
"His marriage to the quick-tempered Sarah Jennings – Anne's close friend – helped Marlborough's rise. He first became the Captain-Generalcy of British forces. Then he became a duke. Later, he became the richest of all Anne's subjects. Although in the end he could not completely crush his enemies, his victories allowed Britain to rise to very great power. Through him, the country grew more and more rich through the 18th century."

"Cutthroat Kitchen is a reality cooking television show that airs on Food Network. It began on August 11, 2013. It is hosted by Alton Brown."
Format.
"Four chefs are given three cooking challenges. Each challenge has a type of dish that the chefs have to make in 30 minutes. Before then, the chefs have one minute to get ingredients out of a pantry. After 30 minutes, a judge tastes each dish, and the chef with the worst dish is eliminated."
"At the start of the game, the chefs are each given $25,000. In the first two challenges, Brown shows items that are put up to auction for the chefs to buy using their money. The chefs can use these items on other chefs to change their ingredients, what cooking tools they can use, and other things. For example, an item may force a chef to cook using canned ingredients instead of fresh ones. The chef who is eliminated has to give back the money that they have. In the last challenge, no items are shown at first, but during the first minutes of the challenge, Brown will put items up for auction. This makes it so the person who gets the item has to change their dish based on what the item does. The chef that wins keeps the money that they have left."

"As Chingphulon Konthousu grew up, she was known for her beauty and gentleness. She used to go to woods, lakes and open meadows for fun. One day, while Tampha was out in an open field with her friends, a strong wind blew. Tampha was lifted up by a whirlwind towards the sky. Her friends could do nothing but watch. The wind took her to heaven, the abode of Salailen. He was waiting for her."
"Tampha was unhappy about being far away from her parents and friends. To please her, Salailen promised her that the people of her native place would attain immortality and be safe from all diseases. Still, her parents, family and friends cried for the loss of her. Salailen told them that Tampha was safe with him. He told them about the promises he kept to her. Many years had passed and Salailen and Tampha had a son. She and Salailen named their son Khoriphaba."
"Tampha's parents wanted to see her. So they planned to meet her. Men went on a hunting expedition with their hunting dogs across the Thangjing Hills. Unfortunately, they could not catch even one animal. The tired hunters rested under the shade of a tree. Meanwhile, one of their favorite hunting dogs wandered away. The dog saw a large python sitting in sun. It barked at the python. The python killed it. Later, the hunters found the dead dog and carried it home. They prepared a funeral for the dog. The smoke from the funeral rose up towards the sky."
"Up in Heaven, Tampha saw the smoke rising from her native place. She knew it was for a funeral. She worried about her people. Perhaps someone had died even though Salailen had promised to keep them safe from disease. She asked Salailen about his promises. Salailen told her that the funeral was only for a dog. She did not believe him and wanted to see her parents. Reluctantly, Salailen allowed her to meet people under some conditions. She should leave only after their son Khoriphaba had gone to sleep and should come back before he woke up. Also, she should not consume any earthly foods or drinks. Then, he placed a golden ladder (or ""golden stairs"" in another version) for her to climb down. She landed on the Thangjing Hill and then went to Konthoujam, her native land. She met her near and dear ones. Her mother offered Tampha delicious foods."
"Tampha did not accept her mother's offers. However, her mother caught hold of her and tried to force her to eat. Tampha told her mother of the conditions with which she was leaving heaven to meet them on earth. Then, her mother arranged a shade with seven layers of false ceiling, enclosed by seven layers of drapery. Her plan was to block the vision of Salailen from above. Inside the shades, she served out delicious food for Tampha. Poor Tampha was compelled to eat what her mother had so lovingly prepared for her. But the God Salailen saw it happen even through the drapes. As Tampha started eating, Salailen proclaimed from heaven that she could not come back to his abode. He spat a blob of spit on her hand (or ""on her food"" in another version). The golden ladder (or ""golden stairs"" in another version) was also lifted up. Poor Tampha was abandoned from heaven. Salailen also took back his promises of immortality and immunity to disease."
"Later, she lived in the outskirts of Konthoujam. Since then, she came to be known as Konthoujam Tampha Lairembi."

"In 1576, Katsutoyo Shibata tried to build Maruoka Castle, but it had collapsed many times. Therefore, he received a proposal to stabilize the castle by putting a human pillar in the castle tower. The person chosen as the human pillar was one-eyed Oshizu, who was a woman living a difficult life with two children. Oshizu offered Katsutoyo that one of her children would serve as a samurai in the future, and she decided to become the human pillar on that condition. Although the castle was completed, Oshizu’s children could not be a samurai because Katsutoyo was transferred elsewhere. Oshizu’s spirit resented this, so it rains a lot every April. People call this “Oshizu’s Tears”, and they built a grave of her to console her spirit. This story is fiction, but it is one of the most famous stories of Maruoka Castle."

Footrace on a Panathenaic Amphora
Footrace on a Panathenaic Amphora is a depiction of an ancient Greek footrace on a terracotta amphora dated about 530 BC. It is said to be by the Euphiletos Painter. The height of the amphora is tall.

"These prize amphores were made to a standardized shape, held about 42 quarts, and were decorated in the black-figure technique. An armed Athena was depicted on the front of the amphora and a picture of the sport on the back. This amphora depicts five men and a youth."
"The museum writes, ""Notice the wealth of incised lines depicting musculature, a preoccupation of Greek artists for centuries to come ... An inscription on the front of the amphora gives not only the official designation of the vase as a prize, but also the signature of the potter, Nikias, a rare occurrence on pots of this shape."""

Can't Be Tamed
Can't Be Tamed is the third album made by American singer Miley Cyrus. The album has twelve songs including three singles.
Development and singles.
"""Can't Be Tamed"" is Cyrus's first single. It was released May 18th, 2010. ""Can't Be Tamed"" had good reviews from critics. The song peaked at number eight on the Billboard Hot 100 and reached its highest peak at number five on both the Irish Singles Chart and New Zealand Singles Chart. The music video is Cyrus performing with backup dancers throughout a museum. Cyrus is first trapped in a giant cage, being watched by people in the audience as they were trying to see the rare creature 'Adias Cyrus' she then escapes and trashes the museum. She has promoted ""Can't Be Tamed"" by performing it at several places, including a performance on ""Britain's Got Talent"" and the critics had negative ratings and reviews. The song is also a part of Cyrus' second world tour, Gypsy Heart Tour."
"""Who Owns My Heart"" is Cyrus' second single. It was released on October 22, 2010. Cyrus described it as a ""total dance track"" with a cool idea. Cyrus' ""Who Owns My Heart"" is a club-oriented song that speaks of meeting a potential love on the dance floor. The song tries not to proceed to question, ""Who owns my heart? Is it love or is it art?"" Bill Lamb of About.com thought that, despite its beat, the overall sound of ""Who Owns My Heart"" is faceless and dull. The video starts with Cyrus asleep, blindfolded on a mattress in a bedroom. She wakes up and shakes on the mattress. Following, Cyrus goes to a bathroom, her outfit is a white tank top, white boy shorts, a fishnet hair wrap, rollers, and heavy metal jewelry. While in the bathroom scenes, Cyrus sings as she sits on the edge of a bathtub and prepares herself for a party. When the chorus comes on, Cyrus appears shaking in the backseat of a limousine, costumed in a low-cut gold halter top, black hot pants, a black jacket with shoulder pads, and big hair. Once arrived at the mansion party, she is first seen dancing on top of a big, wooden table. In continuing after, Cyrus dances with multiple people on the dance floor. Cut-scenes feature Cyrus in all prior scenes or dancing with others in the mansion's study. The video finishes with Cyrus back in her bedroom, once again waking up."
"""Every Rose Has Its Thorn"" is Cyrus' third single. It was a single on June 11th, 2011. It was made by Poison in 1988. Miley's version is one minute and 29 seconds shorter than Poison's official song. Hollywood Records released Cyrus' cover in June 2011, and a music video was created and released in 2010."

Graham's number
Graham's number is a very big natural number that was defined by a man named Ronald Graham. Graham was solving a problem in an area of mathematics called Ramsey theory. He proved that the answer to his problem was smaller than Graham's number.
"Graham's number is one of the biggest numbers ever used in a mathematical proof. Even if every digit in Graham's number were written in the tiniest writing possible, it would still be too big to fit in the observable universe."
Context.
Ramsey theory is an area of mathematics that asks questions like the following:
"It turns out that for this simple problem, the answer is ""yes"" when we have 6 or more points, no matter how the lines are colored. But when we have 5 points or fewer, we can color the lines so that the answer is ""no""."
"By asking that the 4 points lie on a plane, we have made the problem much harder. We would like to know: for what values of ""n"" is the answer ""no"" (for some way of coloring the lines), and for what values of ""n"" is it ""yes"" (for all ways of coloring the lines)? But this problem has not been completely solved yet."
"In 1971, Ronald Graham and B. L. Rothschild found a partial answer to this problem. They showed that for ""n""=6, the answer is ""no"". But when ""n"" is very large, as large as Graham's number or larger, the answer is ""yes""."
"One of the reasons this partial answer is important is that it means that the answer is eventually ""yes"" for at least some large ""n"". Before 1971, we didn't know even that much."
"There is a much smaller limit for the same problem called N. It is equal to formula_1, where formula_2. This weaker upper bound for the problem, attributed to an unpublished work of Graham, was eventually published and named by Martin Gardner in Scientific American in November 1977."
Definition.
"Graham's number is not only too big to write down all of its digits, it is too big even to write in scientific notation. In order to be able to write it down, we have to use Knuth's up-arrow notation."
"We will write down a sequence of numbers that we will call g1, g2, g3, and so on. Each one will be used in an equation to find the next. g64 is Graham's number."
"First, here are some examples of up-arrows:"
"After that, g2 is equal to formula_18; the number of arrows in this number is g1."
"g3 is equal to formula_19, where the number of arrows is g2."
"We keep going in this way. We stop when we define g64 to be formula_19, where the number of arrows is g63."
This is Graham's number.

"In 1993, the French government privatized Banque Nationale de Paris."
"In early 1999, Paribas agreed to a 15-billion (USD $17-billion) buyout offer from Société Générale. Not wanting to be left behind, however, rival Banque Nationale de Paris made a hostile USD $21-billion counter-offer for Paribas, and an unimaginable, separate USD 19.6-billion offer for Societe Generale (SocGen). BNP’s three-way merger proposal would have created the world's largest bank."
Share stock.
"Uncertainties surrounding BNP’s insane ambition resulted in a drop of its share price, reducing the combined value of the offers for Paribas and SocGen to USD $38.0-billion. For months, all three banks engaged in a public relations battle in an attempt to win support from the public, shareholders, and the French banking regulator. In the end, BNP succeeded in breaking SocGen and Paribas' merger plan, and acquired Paribas to form BNP Paribas. However, it could only secure 31.5% of SocGen's shares. The French banking regulator eventually vetoed BNP's merger plan to acquire Societe Generale."

Battle of Wilson's Creek
"The Battle of Wilson's Creek, also called the ""Bull Run of the West"", was a battle of the American Civil War. It was the first battle that took place west of the Mississippi River. Nathaniel Lyon, the Union general, was the first general killed in the Civil war."
Prelude to the battle.
"During the summer of 1861, the Union and Confederate Armies were both trying to control Missouri. By the second week of July 1861, the Union Army of the West commanded by Brigadier general Nathaniel Lyon, camped at Springfield, Missouri. In total, he had about 5,400 soldiers in his command."
"About 75 miles to the southwest of Springfield, the pro-Southern Missouri State Guard were camped. They were under the command of Major general Sterling Price. Price was joined by Confederate generals Benjamin McCulloch and Nicholas Bartlett Pearce. Combined their forces numbered about 12,000. In late July both forces started moving closer to together, each army trying to learn what they could about the other. There was a skirmish at Dug Springs, Missouri on August 2. This is near present-day Clever, Missouri. The Union forces won but this is when Lyon realized the Confederates had more than twice the forces he had. The Union forces retreated back to Springfield."
The battle.
"On August 9, 1861, Lyon marched his troops from Springfield to where the Confederates were now camped at Wilson Creek. His plan called for Colonel Franz Sigel to do a flanking maneuver on the Confederates and attack them from their rear. The rest of Lyon's forces would attack from the north."
"On August 10, Sigel's flanking maneuver surprised the Confederate army. It allowed the Union army an early advantage. The two armies fought fiercely in the fields and hills around Wilson's Creek. After six hours of fighting and numerous casualties on both sides, the Union forces withdrew. Siegel's attack had at first proved very successful, but fell apart when he mistook the Confederate 3rd Louisiana for federal troops and allowed them to get too close without being challenged."
"Three times the confederates attacked the Union line and failed to break through all three times. During the battle, Lyon was killed and Major Samuel D. Sturgis replaced him. Meanwhile, Sigel's mistake had cost him the advantage and his forces were routed. After the third attack at about 11:00 am, the Confederates withdrew. With his ammunition running low and his men exhausted he withdrew to Springfield. Too disorganized to follow, the Confederate army did not pursue. Technically, it was a victory for the Confederate Army since the Union Army left the field. However, it can be considered a victory for the Union since they still kept control of Missouri. The Confederate army called the battle of Wilson’s Creek, the Battle of “Oak Hill(s)”."

Highly abundant number
"Highly abundant numbers are a type of natural number. Any natural number ""n"" is called highly abundant when a certain equation is true."
formula_1
"In this equation, ""m"" is every integer less than ""n"". ""σ"" is the sum of every positive divisor of that number."
Example.
"An example would be to use the number 5. ""σ"" of 5 is 5 + 1 = 6. Every ""σ"" less than 5, however, is 4 + 2 + 1 = 7. 7 is greater than 6. This makes 5 not a highly abundant number."
History.
"Highly abundant numbers were first learned about by Subbayya Sivasankaranarayana Pillai in 1943. Work on the subject was done by Paul Erdős and Leonidas Alaoglu in 1944. Alaoglu and Erdős discovered every highly abundant number up to 104. They also showed that the number of highly abundant numbers less than ""N"" is proportional to log2 ""N""."
The first few highly abundant numbers are
There are only two odd highly abundant numbers. They are 1 and 3.
Similarities with other numbers.
"The first eight factorials are highly abundant. However, not all factorials are highly abundant. For example,"
"but there is a smaller number with larger sum of divisors,"
This makes 9! is not highly abundant.
"Alaoglu and Erdős discovered that all superabundant numbers are also highly abundant. There are, however, an infinite number of highly abundant numbers that are not superabundant numbers. This was proven by Jean-Louis Nicolas in 1969."
7200 is the largest powerful number that is also highly abundant. This is because every highly abundant number that is larger has a prime factor that divides them only once.

gee our old LaSalle ran great

And you knew who you were then
girls were girls and men were men
Mister we could use a man like Herbert Hoover again
People seemed to be content
fifty dollars paid the rent
freaks were in a circus tent
Those were the days
Take a little Sunday spin
go to watch the Dodgers win
Have yourself a dandy day
that cost you under a fin

"Luritja is the name of an Australian Aboriginal group of the Western Desert. They speak the Luritja dialect of Wati, the language of the Western Desert people. The dialect itself has several varieties. The Luritja lands include areas to the west and south of Alice Springs. The region is centred on Kings Canyon. Their neighbours are the Arrernte (east), the Warlpiri (north), the Pintupi (west), and the Pitjantjatjara (south)."
"In recent decades, many from this group have inter-married with Pintupi-speaking people. During the mid 20th-century, the Pintupi were forced to leave their lands and were settled into government-built stations. Papunya became a settlement for both Pintupi and Luritja. In the 1980s, many of these people moved back west to Kintore. Both communities now mainly speak a hybridised dialect known as Pintupi-Luritja."
"The name ""luritja"" is thought to come from the Arrernte word ""lurinya"", which means ""foreigner"". Over time younger generations have taken on the name as their ethnonym. The total population of Luritja people (including those at Papunya) is probably in the thousands. This makes them the third largest of the Central Australian Aboriginal populations, behind the Arrernte and Pitjantjatjara."

In this context, there also is a frame (or a command) that tells a device that it is no longer authenticated.

Just sit around
That that's true.
but
"See the lady I did it for,"

Yeah.
so
Yeah.
"I played uh, concertos and other stuff"
"but,"
"I got to the point where I wasn't really reading music, I was memorizing music,"

"but anyway,"
Yeah.
"but I enjoy it, though."
"I mean, those people, they'll call you any time of the day or night with, try to solicit"

"They call late,"
"now, I mean, now there's, I heard that they were going to start calling on Saturdays or"
"Oh, they do already."
"See, that's"
I would be so mad
"Well,"
"and I've even had the computer generated calls on Sundays, too."
Really.
Uh-huh.
Huh.
But I do know of a way to get around the computer generated calls.
How?
"Don't answer your phone, Hello."
"The computer's geared to, to start talking to you on the, on the word Hello."
Really?
Uh-huh.
Huh.

"I know,"

"Exactly,"
"magazine companies, uh, uh, from, from subscriptions do the same thing"
Uh-huh.
it's the way they make additional money.
That's right.
"But, it's, uh, you know, I guess, it, uh,"
"you have to be a certain income holder to, uh, have an American Express card,"

I know.
"or I may be working around in the room somehow,"
"but I don't, I don't ever just sit and,"
"I, that's something that comes from your old age, you know."
"No,"
I don't sit.
Idle hands are the devil's workshop
I know.
Who has time?
"I don't have time to sit, I know."
No.
"It's, it's, uh,"
That's why I don't get to watch that much.
"I mean, I, watch nine o'clock"
Right.
"uh, my son over in Shreveport, uh, sold Porsches, Audis, Mazdas and Volkswagons for ten years"
and that was one of the deciding factors in getting the Mazdas.
Oh.
"Uh, so, uh, the first foreign car that we had was a, a seventy-seven M G, M G B"
"Oh the,"
"Was British racing green, with real wire wheels and a hard top and a soft top."
"Ooh, boy."
"And, uh, I drove it mostly."
I'll bet it was hard to part with that.
"And,"
"Yeah,"
it really was.
My husband was in the Air Force
and we got transferred to Okinawa.
Oh.
"So, uh, we had to sell it."
which really tore me up
"Oh, yeah."
"Because, uh, it, it it was great fun."
"And then, uh, when we got to Okinawa, well, we bought a second hand,"
"we, uh, we decided that, uh,"
"we had this, uh, sixty-five Oldsmobile"
"and it, and it was just too big,"
"so we, we sold it to a fellow who was coming back to the States"
"and we got a little Fiat, uh, and a, and the little, uh, forty horse power Mazda, four door sedan."
Oh.
So what do you think about caring for older folks Dale?
"Well, I think, uh the elderly is a really neat population to care for."
Uh-huh.
They've got a lot of special needs
"and at the same time, uh, the majority of them don't want to give up the independence that they have."
"Right,"
"It's just,"
Yeah.
"like, you know, you go say okay, we can't bring up this point because then they're going to, you know,"
"the opposition will say this, this and this and"
Uh-huh.
"And it's like, boy, the stuff that they can twist around is,"
Yep
it's pretty amazing.
"And it's like the, the truth isn't really important anymore."
"It's,"
"Yeah,"
it's not.
"And then you get people who, who bring in cases just because they want to bring them up just because."
Yep.
"Like this, this friend of mine's pretty obnoxious"
and he really gets into suing people.
"And so he'll, he'll sue just about anybody just for the chance to get into court, and argue his case you know, It is. It's, it's wasting people's time and the taxpayers' money and everything else. *aa,sv"
"but,"
"But, uh,"
Yeah
"but it's for the more general,"
people don't want to take responsibility.
Yeah.
"You know, it's,"
"And, and most of the time they're looking to place blame. Uh  and stuff."
Yep
"See, you're from California,"
is that right?
"Uh, yeah."
Well originally from Chicago
"but,"
"Oh, okay."
Yeah.
All right.
Happy home repairing.
Okay.
You too
Bye-Bye.
Bye-Bye.
"Hi,"
what do you do with your credit cards?
Oh
"Well, my husband and I have gotten into some, some problems with credit cards."
We don't handle them very well
"We, we tend to run them up to the maximum and then ask for more."
"Oh, jeez."
"They, they're, they're really bad for us."
"Um, matter of fact, we've gotten rid of all of our credit cards except for a MasterCard and a Visa,"
and we pretty much keep those maxed out.
"Oh, I was going to say that, that sounds like, like pretty many."
"But I see what you meant,"
you had them for each of the individual stores.
"Yeah,"
"we had I had probably twenty credit cards for,"
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
"I had, I had an American Express, American Express Gold, an Optima, all the different department stores, um, two Visas, two MasterCards"
"Oh, gee."
"I mean, I had,"
"any time anybody would, you know, send me an application, you know, preapproved or whatever, I went, I took it,"
and it really ended up getting us in some real serious trouble.
"Oh, sure."
"Um, because, see, the more credit cards you have, the more people offer them to you."
"Uh-huh,"
It's not getting any better.
"Yeah,"
I can't even hear what you're
"Oh, okay."
"Oh jeez,"
it's gone.
"I don't see, I don't think my phone really does that,"
"but every time I have this phone is a little weird,"
I mean it's been dropped on the floor a hundred times.
"Well, I don't know,"
there was
"well, whatever it was, there was a second there"
"I couldn't even hear what you were saying,"
"but, um,"
"Yeah,"
"I was beating on the phone going,"
Can you hear me.
"Yeah,"
I guess I was having a hard time there too.
"I thought it sounded,"
"well, I guess we better stick to the subject for the benefit of the people uh, uh, doing this work."
Yeah.
"But, uh,"
"yeah,"
"I mean, that's a heck of a"
"you must have a lot of different stuff you get out of there,"
"especially up in Vermont there, you should have, uh, some really nice soil."
"Yeah,"
"we grow a lot of, uh, the basic, corn, potatoes."
Uh-huh.
She likes to really get into her pumpkins
"and see how many she can grow. corn, potatoes,"
so I'm in the process of telling my wife we got to go shopping for clothes again.
"<Laughter> That's neat,"
that's neat
"And, uh, I, I don't know,"
"now I, I know eastern,"
"now the other thing we do here, of course, is a single, not quite a single climate."
"We have, uh, we do have some snow in the wintertime"
and it can be quite warm in the summertime.
Uh-huh.
"Not hot like, uh,"
I lived in the midwest for a while.
Oh.
"And I know that, uh, you know, it can be freezing cold in the wintertime, and hot and, uh, sticky in the summertime."
Uh-huh.
We don't have that much.
"It's, uh, it's a very mild climate."
"Oh, well that's nice."
"That's good for the clothes budget, I would imagine."
"Yes,"
it is.
"Because here, gosh, we had, uh,"
the winter hasn't been bad this winter.
"It's, it it's only snowed maybe once or twice"
but it's been cold.
"Low twenties, let's say,"
"and then the summer gets up to eighties, nineties"
"so,"
You interested in woodworking?
Yeah.
"Actually, I, uh, I guess I am"
"Um, it just seems kind of funny that this is a topic of discussion."
"Uh, I do, uh, some, uh, woodworking myself"
"But, you also manage to make them."
"uh, actually, we, we have only made one of them since we got married about four years ago. One of the family reunions."
Yeah.
But we are both in school
so that makes it kind of tough.
Yeah.
"They usually, uh, they have been happening, uh, just after the summer semester starts."
You can't really get away.
Usually not.
We managed to get to one.
That was before I started school
and she took that summer off.
"But, uh,"
"Well, now that we have been talking about it, I, uh, I am kind of getting home sick now."
Because it has been over three years since I have been home  to see my grandparents.
Oh goodness.
"Well, my, my grandfather is the only one that is still around."
Yeah.
"And see, my grandmother is the one that use to plan this stuff basically."
Yeah.
"So, unless the aunts and uncles really get on the ball and put stuff together, it is kind of like."
"She was like the glue,"
so.
"Yeah,"
I understand.
Where is home for you?
"Originally, uh, I, uh, was born in Missouri."
Yeah.
"But, uh, you know, we have relatives scattered out all over Louisiana, Mississippi, uh, here in Texas"
Yeah.
"but it is harder for everyone to get in, get home."
Yeah.
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
"I, uh,"
"but, you know, I, I wish I had, uh, more news on things like, that I consider long range. Things like science and medicine"
Uh-huh.
"uh, I'm more, I guess I'm more into science and science fiction"
"and, uh, there's, you know,"
"not that the news is science fiction,"
"but, uh, uh, I'm more interested in that."
"Things like, uh, is NASA ready for another space shot. Uh, you know, how hot are they on the trail of a cure for such and such cancer"
Uh-huh.
"and, uh, uh, you know, a lot of the news isn't that interesting to me."
Yeah.
"Well, you're right."
"There is a lot of it that's, that's just garbage, as far as I'm concerned, you know."
Uh-huh.
"But I just like the, more or less, the, the daily news, you know. Just, uh, especially the weather."
Yeah.
I like that
"Me, too."
Although they're usually wrong
"Yeah,"
"Georgia here, they're usually wrong too."
We have weird weather systems.
Uh-huh.
"But, uh, like I say, as far as, as actually listening to the news, it's mostly T V, five o'clock to six thirty."
"Uh, that seems like a long time for news"
but that's how long it is.
Yeah.
"And, uh, seems like they have the local news and they have the world news."
Uh-huh.
"And then, uh, my morning paper. I can hardly wait for it to come."
"and if they get too close to that perimeter, it it zaps them."
Oh.
Boy.
Yeah
I'd be afraid to walk around if I was that dog
"Yeah,"
"well, a friend of mine at work here said that he tried it with his dog"
and he wanted to see what he was subjecting his dog to
so he held on to the collar
and he walked out to the perimeter.
He said it was a good jolt.
"Oh, really?"
"Yeah,"
"and so, I, I don't take too well to, to those sorts of training techniques."
Um.
I don't think they're always necessary.
"If you put enough patience into,"
"Yeah,"
just be consistent and diligent with it
Uh-huh.
"and, um,"
"It's, uh, is your cat an indoor cat or an outdoor cat?"
Yeah
"he's indoor and all declawed because I know the, uh, average life span of an outdoor cat is eighteen months."
Somebody just told me that
Yeah.
because of the leukemia?
"Yeah,"
"that and also just, uh, getting hit, I guess, or getting beat up."
And the average life span of an indoor cat is eighteen years
Wow.
"So,"
"Oh, I think, I don't think so."
"I, I think that, uh, I think they've now just taken the attitude that, well, if it happens, if it,"
"because it, there a lot of things that, that, uh, um, like sports, you know."
It's a hundred meter.
"Oh, absolutely."
"And, uh, uh, but automobile races"
"if it,"
"I don't think they'd ever,"
it's still going to be the Indianapolis Five Hundred.
They're not going to ...
"Yeah,"
Yeah.
They're not going to change that to meters.
It will always be.
Yeah.
"And, and it, I, I don't think it, I don't, you know, I don't think, I don't think it's particularly bothersome because in reality, uh,"
"you, it's like troy ounces in ounces of gold."
"How many ounces of gold, you know."
Twelve.
"I was trying, I was trying to figure up gold content on something."
"It had, has, uh, gold plated, uh, header."
"And, and they're trying to think of what's a Troy ounce."
Yeah.
There's twelve troy ounces to the pound.
Yeah.
"Now that makes, you know."
Yeah.
"And, and is that going to change too?"
"Well, I mean, and, and then there's a metric ton"
and then there's a ton.
But what's a metric ton?
"Uh,"
same here.
"Uh, very seldom are they any different."
"And then, uh, like for groceries and everything, we try to put, like, two hundred and fifty dollars in a little can in the kitchen"
Uh-huh.
and then that's what we use to buy the groceries with.
"Oh, okay."
"And then we put our receipts in there, you know,"
and usually that's enough.
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, but I don't have any, you know, small children to have anything extra come up, you know, like, uh, running to the doctor or something like that with them."
Right.
Luckily I don't either.
"I mean, you know, maybe my cat would get sick"
"but, I mean, usually that's not so much that it would throw me off"
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
right.
"In fact, I did have to take my dog to the vet the other day"
"But you so you know what I'm saying,"
yeah.
Yeah.
"that, it's worse than having a kid, huh?"
"I,"
sometimes it can be.
Yeah.
Sometimes it can be.
I guess the worst thing I've ever had come out is like car maintenance kinds of things.
Uh-huh.
"But I do try to build in a little extra money each month to, to be able to do that type of thing"
so.
"Yeah,"
"uh, I'm not working right now."
Uh-huh.
and the school that I went to there was fantastic.
"It,"
"I, I really consider myself very, very lucky."
"Uh, we had a school that had classes probably about the same size you're talking, twenty-seven, thirty kids to to a class."
Yeah.
"But,"
But your teacher had control.
Yeah.
"We zipped right along, you know."
"I, I was, I was doing mathematics, fractions and division and multiplication by the third grade, easily."
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"I, I  believe I was too."
"Uh,"
Uh-huh.
"But, you're right, you know."
"With all this, don't hurt the kids and don't abuse their rights, you've also taken  something away from the discipline, I think."
Uh-huh
"Uh, well, it, it really is a concern of mine because if we could afford it, my son would be in private school."
Yeah.
We just cannot afford it.
Right.
"I was going to ask you if there, if that was an option."
"Uh, if,"
"Uh, I'm of the age that could have gone, although I didn't"
"and, uh, I guess, uh, looking back on it, I tend to think it was pretty, uh, mostly a mistake."
Uh-huh.
"On the other hand, uh, the more I learn about the history, the more I see it was incremental, uh, decisions. Any one of which was sort of understandable at the time."
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, but on the whole I think it, uh, probably was the wrong thing to do."
How about you?
"Well, we've just, uh,"
"it seems like, we've always been at a place where we'd have to go away for the summer or something"
"and, uh, it was,  never convenient to have anything."
Yeah.
we were thinking about getting a dog if we get into a house.
Yeah.
"Uh, someplace where there, you know,"
we can take care of it and everything.
"We've got,  some children who would just really, uh, enjoy having an animal, you know, a dog, I think"
Yeah.
"and, What about you all?"
Yeah.
"Well, right now I'm a student,"
and campus housing does not even allow thinking about that
"Oh, no."
"No,"
we almost got chased out of here for feeding a stray cat.
Is that right?
Yeah.
They're very strict about it.
"But you like, uh, you like pets and things?"
"Oh, I love animals."
"Oh, yeah ."
"I was raised,"
"our house when I, when I was growing up there was almost never, uh, at least one cat in the house."
Uh-huh.
"It was almost always at least one cat, sometimes, you know, like fifteen or twenty. But, uh, always cats in the house."
"Oh, yeah."
"We, we,  enjoyed them."
Oh.
"We like, we like pets,"
"but, uh, you know, you've got to deal with, uh, taking care of them and, and feeding them and everything like that."

This polyhedron is the truncation of the great icosahedron:
"The truncated ""great stellated dodecahedron"" is a degenerate polyhedron, with 20 triangular faces from the truncated vertices, and 12 (hidden) pentagonal faces as truncations of the original pentagram faces, the latter forming a great dodecahedron inscribed within and sharing the edges of the icosahedron."

"In 1948, platforms on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line from 103rd Street to 238th Street were lengthened to 514 feet to allow full ten-car express trains to platform. Previously the stations could only platform six-car local trains. The platform extensions were opened in stages. On April 6, 1948, the platform extension opened for stations from 103rd Street to Dyckman Street, with the exception of 125th Street."

"This station has two side platforms and three tracks, the center one being an unused express track. The southbound local track is technically known as BB1 and the northbound one is BB4; the BB designation is used for chaining purposes along the Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line from 96th Street to 242nd Street. Although it cannot be accessed at Cathedral Parkway–110th Street, the center track is designated as M. These designations are rarely, if ever, used in ordinary conversation."
"This is the closest station to the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, located one block east."

OB 293 was a North Atlantic convoy which ran during the battle of the Atlantic in World War II.
"It was notable for seeing the loss to the Kriegsmarine (KM) of , with her commander KL Günther Prien, the person responsible for the sinking of two years previously."
"OB 293 was a west-bound convoy of 37 ships, either in ballast or carrying trade goods, and sailed from Liverpool on 2 March 1941 bound for ports in North America."
"It was escorted by an escort group of two destroyers, and , and two corvettes, and . They were led by LtCdr Rowlands of ""Wolverine"", which would stay with them till they left the Western Approaches. (At this stage of the campaign escort groups were too scarce to provide ""end-to-end"" cover)."
On 6 March 1941 the convoy was sighted by commanded by Prien.
"After sending a sighting report he set to shadowing the convoy, being joined throughout the day by three other boats. They were (Kretschmer), (Matz) and (Eckermann)."
On the night of the 6/7 March the pack launched its attack.
"In the early hours of 7 March ""U-99"" slipped into the convoy from ahead, to attack on the surface; she torpedoed the tanker ""Athelbeach"", sinking her, and the whale factory ship ""Terje Viken"", which was damaged."
"""U-70"" hit a freighter ""Dunaff Head"", which sank, and a Dutch tanker, ""Mijdrecht""."
"She was only damaged, however, rounding on"" U-70"" and attempting to ram; ""U-70"" was forced to crash-dive to escape."
"""UA"" hit a freighter but did not sink her."
The response of the escorts was swift and effective. The U-boats were subjected to a fierce bombardment as the warships chased down contacts; over 100 depth charges were expended over a 5-hour period.
"""UA"" was damaged but was able to escape;"
"""U-99"" only escaped by diving deep and waiting out the attack."
"""U-70"" was damaged in the onslaught and forced to the surface, where she was fired on and sunk by the corvettes ""Camellia"" and ""Arbutus""."
"""U-47"" avoided damage and was able to stay in contact with the convoy, sending further reports and requesting re-inforcements. He had also been able to torpedo ""Terje Viken"", which was straggling after being damaged, though she still remained afloat. The escorts attempted to bring her to port, but she finally sank on the 14th; her loss was credited to both ""U-99"" and ""U-47""."
"Meanwhile, on the night of 7th/8th, at about 1am on the 8th, ""Wolverine"" sighted a U-boat on the surface which she identified as ""U-47"". She and "" Verity"" attacked, and after 4 hours, which had shown evidence of damage, the U-boat was driven to the surface within yards of ""Wolverine"", before diving again. The destroyer sent down a pattern of depth charges and was rewarded with an underwater explosion, marked by an orange glow, and flames that broke the surface."
"""Wolverine"" was credited with destroying ""U-47"", and this featured in the official record until the late 1990s. However, after reviewing the available records modern historians regard this attack as being directed against ""UA"", which was badly damaged, but survived to reach port."
"No conclusion can be reached about the fate of ""U-47"", and it is thought likely to be the result of a diving accident."
"The success of the defence of OB 293, with the loss of the U-boat ace Prien, coupled with the successful defence of Convoy HX-112, and the loss of two more aces, Kretschmer and Schepke, one week later, marks a minor turning point in the Atlantic campaign."

"Ustad Abdul Karim Khan (Devanagari: अब्दुल करीम ख़ान, Persian: <bdi> </bdi>) (11 November 1872 – 27 October 1937), was an Indian classical singer and, along with his cousin Abdul Wahid Khan, the founder of the Kirana gharana."
"Abdul Karim Khan was born on 11 November 1872 in Kairana town in Saharanpur, Uttar Pradesh into a family with music tradition which traced its roots to musician brothers Ghulam Ali and Ghulam Maula. His father, Kale Khan, was the grandson of Ghulam Ali. Abdul Karim Khan received training from his uncle Abdullah Khan and father Kale Khan. He also received guidance from another uncle, Nanhe Khan. Abdul Karim Khan was musically influenced by Ustad Rahmat Khan of Gwalior gharana. Apart from vocals and sarangi, he also learned Veena (Been), Sitar and Tabla."
"According to a story, he was initially a sarangi player, but decided to switch to vocals because of low status of sarangi players. In his early years, he used to sing with his brother Abdul Haq. They appeared before Murtaza Khan of the ""Maula Bakhsh Khandan"" to appear before the Maharaja (king) and were influenced by Murtaza's style. The king of Baroda State was impressed by this singing duo and made them the court musicians. This is where he met Tarabai Mane, who was the daughter of Sardar Maruti Rao Mane, a member of the royal family. When they decided to get married, they were ousted from Baroda. The couple settled down in Bombay. In 1922, Tarabai Mane left Abdul Karim Khan, which apparently had a major impact on his music – making it pensive and meditative. Karim Khan's first wife, Gafooran, was the sister of another Kirana master Abdul Wahid Khan, who was also his cousin."
"""One of the most melodious classical musicians we have had, Abdul Karim Khan's music always created a sublime atmosphere. The soothing quality of his specially cultivated voice, and his repose style of singing were such that the singer as well as his listeners forgot themselves in a sort of 'trance'."""
"Abdul Karim Khan was invited to the Mysore court where he met famous Carnatic music masters who also influenced his music. In particular the singing of his sargam was a direct influence of Carnatic practice. He became a frequent visitor to Mysore Palace which conferred on him the title ""Sangeet Ratna"". On the way to Mysore he used to stay with his brother in Dharwad where he taught his most famous disciple Sawai Gandharva. In 1900, for eight months he taught Kesarbai Kerkar, who would go on to be one of the 20th century's most renowned vocalists. In 1913, he founded the Arya Sangeet Vidyalaya in Poona to teach music students. He finally settled down in Miraj till his death in 1937 when returning from a concert tour of the South. Every year in August commemorative music concerts are held in Miraj in his honour."
The innovations he brought to his vocal style distinguishes Kirana style from others. The slow melodic development of the raga in Vilambit laya (slow tempo) was the most characteristic aspect of his music. He worked hard to maintain his voice to be sweet and melodious which shaped his music. The thumri style he developed is also quite different from the 'Poorab ang' or 'Punjabi ang'. His thumri progresses in a leisurely slow pace with ample abandonment. He was also the first Hindustani musician to seriously study the Carnatic system and probably the first to be invited to sing all over the South. He has even recorded a Thyagaraja Krithi. He was also influenced by Rehmat Khan of the Gwalior gharana and adopted the direct style of presentation.

Coming from a musical family, Melvoin is the twin sister of musician Wendy Melvoin, sister of Jonathan Melvoin (former touring keyboardist with The Smashing Pumpkins), and daughter of jazz pianist (and former NARAS president) Michael Melvoin."
"Susannah got her start working with Prince in the mid-1980s during sister Wendy's stint with The Revolution. During this period, she was tapped to be a joint lead vocalist of one of Prince's side projects, The Family. Prince wrote The Family's 1985 song, ""Nothing Compares 2 U"", about Melvoin. The song charted when Sinéad O'Connor covered it in 1990."
"Later, she joined the expanded line-up of The Revolution, adding backing vocals to ""Parade"", including the 1986 single ""Anotherloverholenyohead"". She designed the ""Dream Factory"" jacket, and, in addition to Wendy & Lisa of The Revolution, received a credit on ""Sign o' the Times"" (she co-wrote the song ""Starfish and Coffee"")."

"All Saints' Church, Narborough is a parish church in the Church of England in Narborough, Leicestershire."
"The current church in Narborough dates from the 13th century, although it is highly probable an even earlier church dating back to the 10th century or before stood on or near the site. A Saxon hogback tombstone was found near the church and is on display at the Jewry Wall Museum in Leicester."
"The church was largely rebuilt in 1856-1883. There are two aisles, nave, chancel and north vestry with a west tower containing a ring of six bells. The large nave of six bays has fine piers and strong shafts. The chancel was rebuilt in 1883 by F. Bacon. There is also an Ascension window by Theodora Salusbury from 1929 (Carlton church has another fine window by the artist) in the north aisle. The stained window has two fish hidden in the folds of the robes. The ornate reredos behind the altar is very fine as is the whole of the chancel area."
The church includes a number of memorials/windows to the Everard family.
"The original Norman south porch was rebuilt in 1860 at a cost of £60. The font which has moved three times dates from the 13th century, and has tracery panels of various kinds including one with two parallel tree trunks. There are also sedilia in the southern aisle and a piscina. The graveyard is closed to burials now as these have transferred to the cemetery next door. In the actual churchyard there is a gravestone to a Harry Baker who died aged 49 in 1901 after being ""thrown from a trap""."
"The parish is part of the benefice of Narborough and Huncote, within the Diocese of Leicester. The church has weekly Sunday services and other events, including a yearly Christmas Tree Festival. The church is normally locked, but regular events and open days are held."
All Saints' Church itself is a Grade II* listed building.

"All Saints' Church is the parish church in Normanton, West Yorkshire, England."
"The current church is believed to have existed since at least 1256, and thought to have been commissioned by Roger Le Peytevin of Altofts Hall. However, a prior church is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086. It is likely that the current church stands on the lines of the original."
"In 1256, Le Peytevin, a Norman Baron, granted the church to the Hospital of St. John, of the Knights Hospitallers, at Newland."
"The building is in the perpendicular style, being built mainly of coursed dressed sandstone blocks under a stone slate roof and consists of a three-bay chancel with a south chapel adjacent, a four-bay nave with north and south aisles and a clerestory. A tower was added to the western end in the 15th century. In the 19th century, clergy and choir vestries were added as well as an organ chamber. The building was granted Grade II* listing in 1965. The church was internally re-ordered in 1991 and again in 2019. The latest re-ordering has returned the church to an east-facing orientation."
"The church houses the Freeston Tomb, the burial place of Sir John Freeston of Altofts (d 1594), who by his will provided for an almshouse at Kirkthorpe and a grammar school for Normanton and Warmfield. His benefice still provides funding for the current secondary school in Normanton, the Freeston Business and Enterprise College."
"In 1906, a medieval altar slab bearing five incised crosses was found under the sanctuary floor, where it had probably lain since the reformation. It now stands in the Lady Chapel and is used for weekly Eucharist."
"There is low octagonal stone Font, now standing at the west end of the nave."
"The window at the east end of the Lady Chapel depicting the fall of the Walls of Jericho, is a war memorial to the fallen of the Great War."
"The window to the left of the porch was an addition in the late 1970s as a memorial to the explorer, Martin Frobisher of nearby Altofts."
"All Saints' possesses two ancient silver cups, now housed in a collection at York Minster. The oldest was made in London in 1655 and is inscribed ""Normanton cupp 1674"". The second is two-handled porringer inscribed ""The Gift of Mrs Henry Favell of Pontefract to the Church of Normanton for ever 1699"""
"In ""Normanton, Past and Present,"" author Walter Hampson (1928) noted the monuments within the church: ""The chapel is the burial place of the Bunnys of Newland, Torres of Snydale, Favells of Normanton, Smiths (now Bosworths) late of Newland and the Mallets and Levetts of Normanton. The Favells were an important Normanton family and were resident here in the early part of the 17th century. On the south chancel floor are memorial slabs of the Favells bearing the dates 1698, 1714, 1777 and others in the 18th century. Here also is a large altar tomb of the Malletts and Levetts. The Mallets it would seem were a very ancient family, as we are told their ancestors flourished here in the middle of the 13th century. The tomb on the top bears the arms of the Levetts together with the arms of the Mallets. On the wall above the tomb is an undated tablet recording that 'Mrs. Elizabeth Levett made benefaction for the poor of Normanton and Snydale, and for teaching poor children.' There also are tombs of the Torres mentioned under Snydale."""
"The Mallets and the Levetts had lived in Normanton for centuries. (The first High Sheriff of Yorkshire in 1069 was William Malet; Speaker of the House of Commons, and High Sheriff of Yorkshire Sir Thomas Gargrave had married Elizabeth, daughter of William Levett of Normanton)."
"There are several monuments in All Saints' Church to the Yorkshire antiquarian James Torre, who having graduated from the Inner Temple in London gave up the law, sold his properties and retired to do historical research at York, later purchasing the manor of Snydale. Torre died in 1699."

= = = Barony of Nikli = = =
"The Barony of Nikli was a medieval Frankish fiefdom of the Principality of Achaea, located in the southern Arcadia region of the Peloponnese peninsula in Greece, and centred on the town of Nikli (; ; ), also known as Amyklai or Amyklion (Ἀμύκλαι, Αμύκλιον)."
"The Barony of Nikli was established ca. 1209, after the conquest of the Peloponnese by the Crusaders, and was one of the original twelve secular baronies within the Principality of Achaea. The barony, with six knight's fiefs attached to it, was given to a lord known in the Greek and Italian versions of the ""Chronicle of the Morea"" only as William, but whose family name is given by Angevin records as Morlay. William was succeeded by his son Hugh—although Karl Hopf suggested the interposition of a second William after the original founder for chronological reasons—and then, around 1280, by Androuin de Villiers or de Villa, who had married Hugh's sister Sachette."
"Nikli, known in Antiquity as Tegea, is located on the southern Arcadian plain and was conquered by the Franks after a siege sometime before 1209; at the time it was a town of some importance and the seat of a bishopric, which was taken over by a Latin bishop until 1222, when it was abolished and joined to that of Lacedaemon. Nikli's location made it an excellent assembly point for armies, as well as for parliaments like the famous ""Ladies' Parliament"" in 1261, but after 1262, when the Byzantines recovered parts of the southeastern Peloponnese, the barony became a battleground, and by the early 1270s, Nikli was permanently garrisoned to prevent the Byzantines from breaking out of their territory in Laconia into the central Arcadian plateau. Nikli was still in Frankish hands in 1280, but was lost to the resurgent Byzantines sometime after. The Aragonese version of the ""Chronicle"" states that the Byzantines occupied the town in 1296, but, it being indefensible on account of its location on the plain, they preferred to destroy and abandon it. The region seems to have remained under Frankish control for a few years after that, but by 1302, it was definitely in Byzantine hands."

"Raniero Capocci, also known as Ranieri, Rainerio da Viterbo ( 1180-1190 – 27 May 1250) was an Italian cardinal and military leader, a fierce adversary of emperor Frederick II."
"Capocci was born at Viterbo in 1180–1190. Few details exist about his early life, and his alleged adherence to the Cistercian Order, including the role of abbot in the Tre Fontane Abbey in Rome, is unconfirmed. He entered the Roman curia before 1215, the year in which Pope Innocent III sent him to the Abbey of Montecassino to investigate about abbot Adenulf's tenure. In 1216 Capocci was created cardinal deacon of Santa Maria in Cosmedin, and later became papal legate to Lombardy."
"Innocent's successor, Honorius III, appointed Capocci as ""rector"" of the Duchy of Spoleto, and later of the areas of Assisi, Nocera Umbra and Gubbio. In 1231 he became cardinal protodeacon."
"In 1234 the new pope Gregory IX named Capocci ""rector"" of Tuscia (Tuscany), as well as ""capitano"" (commander) of the Papal troops. In the same year Luca Savelli, grandson of Honorius III, forced the pope to flee from Rome to Umbria. Emperor (and King of Naples and Sicily) Frederick II moved from southern Italy with an army to help Gregory, joining Capocci's troops at Montefiascone. Savelli's army was besieged in a fortress a few kilometers south of Viterbo and, although Frederick left the siege in advance, Capocci was able to defeat them. Frederick's ambiguous behaviour led to his excommunication by Gregory four years later, and Capocci defended the pope's move with a series of letters and treatises disseminated throughout Europe, including the manifesto ""Ascendit de mare""."
"When Gregory died in 1241, Capocci was jailed by the Roman senator Matteo Rosso Orsini in the Septizodium. After the short reign of Celestine IV (17 days), Ranieri supported the election of a pope who would not show any compromise with Frederick II. The new pope was the Genoese Innocent IV, who would continue Gregory's anti-imperial policy. This is manifest in the events leading to the siege of Viterbo, in which Capocci was instrumental in the expulsion of the imperial garrison from the city, and in the following defeat of the rescue army led by Frederick in person. Capocci was left in the city as papal legate with full powers (he was also bishop of Viterbo for one year)."
"In 1244 a peace treaty was signed between Innocent and Frederick. However, the latter soon began military and diplomatic moves to overthrow the pope, who decided to take refuge in Lyon, leaving Capocci as his plenipotentiary in Italy. When the news arrived that a compromise with the emperor was likely, he had a series of pamphlets, full of insults and accusations of heresy against Frederick, published in the French city: their success among the prelates in the First Council of Lyon led to the deposition of the Sicilian leader (1245). Frederick replied by re-conquering Viterbo, although Capocci was able to gain back most of Umbria and the March of Ancona, including Iesi, the emperor's birthplace. In 1246 Innocent appointed him as papal legate also in the Kingdom of Sicily."
"In October 1249, however, Innocent started to consider Capocci's power as excessive, and called him back to the Roman curia. Ranieri never accepted the decision and, now ill, moved to Lyon, where he died in 1250. He was initially buried in the Abbey of Citeaux, but later his remains were transferred to the church of Santa Maria in Gradi at Viterbo, which he had built in 1217–1221 as a gift to his personal friend, Saint Dominic."

"Crickhowell Castle () is a Grade I listed building in Crickhowell, Wales, now largely ruined. An alternative name, ""Alisby's Castle"", is sometimes used; this is thought to be after a former governor of the castle, Gerald Alisby."
"The remaining sections of the castle walls and motte stand on a spur where a tributary stream meets the River Usk, in a more elevated position than the rest of the town, which was planned around it. It has been suggested that the castle replaced an earlier motte-and-bailey structure at nearby Maescelyn, where St Mary's Chapel, which has existed since around 1300, has also been linked with the castle by some historians. The motte is oval in shape and is still clearly visible, whilst the foundations of the shell keep are largely buried. Traces of the castle bailey have been identified in the nearby playing field."
"The castle was initially a motte and bailey castle built from around 1121, probably by Robert Turberville, a member of the notable Norman family, who at the time was a tenant of the Marcher lord Bernard de Neufmarché. In 1172 it was attacked by Welsh rebels, led by one Seisyllt ap Rhirid. Henry de Turberville (died 1239), the son of another Robert, was Seneschal of Gascony in the years 1226–1231 and again in 1237–1238, and Crickhowell Castle was held at the time by a Richard Turberville. Edmund de Turberville is recorded as lord of Crickhowell later in the century. Hugh Turberville, who held Crickhowell Castle from 1273, not as tenant-in-chief but as mesne lord, also held the position of Seneschal of Gascony. Hugh's services were called upon by King Edward I of England to train Welsh men-at-arms and transform the royal levy into a disciplined medieval army capable of conquering Wales; he led both cavalry and 6,000 infantry recruited in the Welsh Marches for King Edward's forces. He was later Constable of Castell y Bere in Merionethshire. He fought against Rhys ap Maredudd during his rising from 1287 to 1291, and died in 1293, the last of the family in the direct line."
"The castle was refortified in stone from 1242 when Sybil Turberville, Hugh's daughter, married Sir Grimbold Pauncefote (or ""Paunceforte""), who thus gained possession. It was walled with substantial stone towers and a large bailey, a home castle befitting an important Royal ally in Wales. The castle was in the hands of the powerful Mortimer family dynasty of Marcher Lords and in the 14th century and declined as a smaller holding within a large portfolio of lands, titles and larger castles."
"On the Royal command of new King King Henry IV in 1400, it was again refortified, this time by Sir John Pauncefote, great-grandson of Sir Grimbold, in advance of the uprising led by Owain Glyndŵr. The castle was largely destroyed in about 1403 by Glyndŵr's forces. who also attacked and burned Abergavenny town and other settlements in the area. It was at this time that the castle is thought to have been abandoned, subsequent stone-robbing leaving only the ruined stone double tower on Castle Green. However, 19th century illustrations suggest that its condition has deteriorated noticeably in the past century. It was listed in 1963."
"The so-called ""Ivy Tower"", a small tower once thought to have dated from the 14th century and to be part of the castle, was found by an archaeological survey to be much later in date and nothing to do with the castle at all."

"Bunge Church () is a medieval church in Bunge on the Swedish island of Gotland. The church seen today was largely built during the 14th century and is in a High Gothic style typical for churches on Gotland. Inside, the church is richly decorated with medieval frescos, including depictions of medieval knights whose significance remain contested. Bunge Church belongs to the Church of Sweden and lies in the Diocese of Visby (Sweden)."
"Archaeological excavations carried out in 1916 and 1971 have shown that the present, mainly Gothic church was pre-dated by a Romanesque church, dating from the 12th century. The massive, fortress-like tower of the church is somewhat later but belonged to this first edifice. The nave and choir were built in the 14th century in a form of High Gothic typical for Gotland: the nave is high and spacious, divided into two by slender columns; the choir lacks an apse; and the east end of the church instead finishes in a straight wall adorned with three slender windows."
"The church and churchyard are surrounded by a wall which originally reached much higher and had a defensive purpose. Four medieval gates still survive in the wall. The church complex evidently has fulfilled a defensive role, as there are marks from pikes and crossbow bolts in the sturdy tower-door, still preserved in its original place. In addition, the inside of the church is profusely decorated with frescos depicting, among other things, fighting knights. The frescos and the church wall may date from the short period in history when Gotland belonged to the Teutonic Order. This has led some scholars to speculate whether the church for a time might have been owned by the crusading Order, and turned into an ""Ordensburg"" (albeit on a small scale)."
The church today belongs to the Church of Sweden and lies within the Diocese of Visby.
"The church is one of the largest on northern Gotland. As mentioned, it displays a mix between Romanesque (the tower) and Gothic (the nave and choir). The church has a southern portal, rich in sculpture, and a northern portal with Romanesque details, possibly partially incorporated from the earlier church building."
"The most distinguishing feature of the interior is no doubt the richly painted walls, with frescos executed by a master painter probably from Prussia or Bohemia. These are from the late 14th century or early 15th and depict different Christian themes, like the Last Judgement, the crucifixion, a few of the apostles but also the Mass of Saint Gregory and legends of saints. As for the previously mentioned depicted knights, scholars have different views of what they may depict or represent. One theory is that they are Teutonic knights. Another claims that they represent a depiction of the Battle of Visby, while others believe they are, in line with the other paintings, representing the Christian theme of the martyrdom of the Theban Legion.

"Neapolitan Way (Foaled January 27, 1971) was an American Thoroughbred racehorse. A son of Barbizon and a grandson to Polynesian, he was out of a Bold Ruler mare named Bold Majesty. Neapolitan Way is best remembered for placing second in the second jewel of the American Triple Crown, the $250,000 grade 1 Preakness Stakes, to Little Current."
"Neapolitan Way's race history is very sketchy and vague, but he won 14 races during his career. It is also known that he placed in the top three finishers in 43% of his starts, a total of 36 out 84 in-the-money races. At age two, he finished third in the Miami Beach Handicap at Calder Race Course. At age three, he won the grade three Woodlawn Stakes (now renamed the James W. Murphy Stakes) at a mile on the turf at Pimlico Race Course and placed third in the Japan Racing Association Stakes at Laurel Park Racecourse. At age four, he placed third in the grade two Dixie Stakes at Pimlico."
"In mid May 1971, Neapolitan Way's trainer Lawrence W. Jennings decided to take a step up in class and run him in the second jewel of the Triple Crown. The Preakness Stakes is run at a mile and three sixteenths on dirt at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Maryland. Neapolitan Way was listed as one of the longest shots on the board at 24-1 on the morning line in a field of thirteen colts. The prohibitive favorite was the Kentucky Derby winner, Cannonade, at 2-1. Neapolitan Way broke slowly in tenth place out of thirteen and was outrun early under jockey Herb Hinojosa. Going into Pimlico's famous ""Clubhouse Turn,"" he fell further back into dead last. The fractions were moderate on the front end, with the first quarter in :231/5 and the half in :47 seconds. Going into the final turn, Neapolitan Way lugged in and collided with Hudson County, causing a severe cut high on his left rear leg. After the move inward, Hinojosa applied steady left handed whipping, straightening Neapolitan Way out at the top of the stretch. In the lane, he moved up quickly from 13th to 11th to 7th and then hit another gear. He started picking off horses, including Cannonade. In deep stretch, he moved into second place but was no threat to the winner, Little Current, who finished between seven and 21 lengths in front of the rest of the field. Cannonade finished one length behind Neapolitan Way in third with Jolly Johu three quarters of a length back in fourth. Neapolitan Way took home the 20% runner-up's share of the purse, equalling $30,000."

= = = Mount (heraldry) = = =
"In heraldry, a mount (also mountain, hill, hillock) is a representation of a hill or mountain as a curved terrace in base. When the mount is included in the lower part of the shield, it may be considered an ordinary rather than a charge."
"A trimount, also described as ""a mount mounted"", or ""shapournet shapourned"", is a representation of a mount with three tops. For mounts with more than three tops, the number of tops is blazoned as ""coupeaux"" (e.g. ""a mount with six coupeaux"")."
"The trimount (in German, ""Dreiberg"") can be found in all heraldic traditions (Gallo-British, German-Nordic and Latin), but it is especially common in Switzerland."
"A design of six hills (""Sechsberg"") can also be found in Swiss and Italian heraldry. In medieval German heraldry, mounts could have ten or more tops. Mounts with more than three tops are blazoned as a ""mount of N coupeaux"", e.g. German ""Sechsberg"" would be a ""mount of six coupeaux"", German ""Zehnberg"" as a ""mount of ten coupeaux"". A mount with more than six tops can also be blazoned as ""Schroffen"" in German heraldry."
"A ""terrace in base curved"" is blazoned ""mount"", ""hill"" or ""hillock"" when represented in vert; sometimes as ""a mount vert"" for clarity. Sometines, a ""terrace in base curved"" may be blazoned as ""mount"" even when not tinctured vert. This is mostly found in cases where the base represents a hill for one or several of the charges in the coat of arms. Classification either as an ordinary or, in many cases, as a charge, is a matter of interpretation."
"The coats of arms of Hungary and Slovakia depict a trimount, first used in the seal of Stephen V of Hungary (r. 1270–1272)."

Essay Topic:
"“Zi Mo (子莫) holds on to the middle… Holding on to the middle is closer to being right, but to do this without the proper measure is not different from holding to one extreme.”"
1. Pòtí:
"Mencius’ contemporary Zi Mo wanted to rectify the deviation of heterodox teachings, but did not realize that he himself fell into deviation."
2. Chéngtí:
"The fact is, the middle is defined as “not deviant,” and the correct application of the middle is the proper measure. Zi Mo wanted to rectify the deviant ways of Yang Zi (楊子) and Mo Zi (墨子), but did not know the proper measure, so this was but another deviation. This was the standard Mencius used to repudiate his error and to establish our way."
3. Qǐjiǎng:
"To elaborate, for our Way is the principal one, but the manifestations are many; egoism and indiscriminate love certainly deviate from the Way. And our way uses the one principle to join together the many, but those who hold on to egoism or indiscriminate love are certainly holding on to an extreme which leads nowhere. Thus there was Zi Mo who understood the errors of Yang Zi and Mo Zi, and thereupon mediated between the two in order to grasp the middle course."
4. Qǐgǔ:
"Zi Mo would probably say, I cannot bear to be like Yang Zi, who cut off all ties with others in a niggardly fashion; I simply stop short of loving indiscriminately."
I have not time to be like Mo Zi who joyfully sacrifices himself for others: I simply stop short of being an egoist.
"Because one rejects egoism, one may be thought to be escaping from the error of Yang Zi and heading towards benevolence."
"Because one rejects indiscriminate love, one may be thought to be escaping for the error of Mo Zi and heading towards righteousness."

"During World War II, the plant was fully occupied building 0-4-0 and 0-6-0 saddle tanks for industrial use, although they did manufacture four PC class 4-6-2s for the Iraqi State Railways in 1940 (one of which was lost at sea ""en route""). In 1943, ninety Austerity 0-6-0ST locomotives were built for the War Department."
"In 1944, the Vulcan Foundry, which had been formed by Robert Stephenson and Charles Tayleur in 1830, acquired a substantial stock holding, and they became part of the English Electric Company. The bulk of the output was for export or industrial use, including fifty South African Class 19D 4-8-2s, Indian YB, YL and WM classes, and ten M class 4-6-2s for the Tasmanian Government Railways. Domestic mainline locomotives included thirty five Class L1 2-6-4T for the Eastern Region of British Railways and 100 9400 class 0-6-0 pannier tanks for the Western Region."
"The last steam locomotives to be built were a conventional 0-6-0T in 1958 and a six-coupled fireless locomotive in 1959. The Forth Street works were closed in 1960 and the Darlington Works, continuing with diesel and electric locomotives became ""English Electric Company Darlington Works"" in 1962."
"The office block and one workshop of Stephenson's Forth Street Works in South St Newcastle upon Tyne have been restored by The Robert Stephenson Trust. The Trust lost its lease to these buildings in February 2009 following purchase of the whole Robert Stephenson & Co and Hawthorn Leslie locomotive works sites for redevelopment as the ""Stephenson Quarter"". The restored block and several other buildings are protected by Listed Building status but future public access is uncertain."
"Commencing in 2013 the site of both the Robert Stephenson and the Hawthorn works started to be redeveloped as the Stephenson Quarter. The landlord fronting this operation was initially Silverlink Developers. As part of their commitment to the area's heritage they have been hosting a once monthly opening of the South Street buildings housing a music, food and drink festival branded as the Boiler Shop Steamer."
"Councillor Nick Forbes, leader of Newcastle City Council, visited the development on 8 April 2014 to give the city's seal of approval to the project. In the same month the developers Silverlink morphed into the Clouston Group."
= = = Alimuddin (cricketer) = = =
"Alim-ud-Din (Urdu: علیم الدین‎; 15 December 1930 – 12 July 2012) was a Pakistani cricketer who played 25 Tests for Pakistan between 1954 and 1962. His name is sometimes rendered Alimuddin. A fast-scoring, right-handed opening batsman and occasional right-arm leg break bowler, he was the youngest player ever to appear in first-class cricket, aged 12 years and 73 days. In international cricket, he scored 1,091 runs at the average of 25.37, including two centuries and seven fifties. In 1954, he was a member of the Pakistani squad which toured England and recorded Pakistan's first Test match win. Former Pakistani captain Mushtaq Mohammad said about him that he was ""a thorough gentleman as well as a great cricketer for Pakistan""."
"During his career Alim-ud-Din played 140 first-class matches and scored 7,275 runs, with the average of 32.77, including 14 centuries and 38 fifties; he also took 40 wickets. Critics considered him to be an excellent fielder. He made his debut for Rajasthan aged only 12 years 73 days, becoming the youngest player to have played first-class cricket. In 1942–43, he played his maiden match in the Ranji Trophy, scoring 13 and 27 runs in his two innings. His highest score in first-class cricket was 142, against Worcestershire in 1954. Domestically, Alim-ud-Din represented Sindh, Rajasthan, Karachi, Bahawalpur and Gujarat, and became the first Pakistani batsman to face a ball bowled by an international bowler on Pakistani soil, in a match between the Sindh and West Indians in 1948. During Pakistan's 1954 tour of England, Alim-ud-Din scored more than 700 runs, including two centuries in the first two matches. He was most successful during 1961–62, scoring 1,020 runs in 12 matches at an average of 51.00. In the same season he captained Karachi, leading the team to victories in the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy and Ayub Zonal Trophy. His final season in first-class cricket was 1967–68."
"Alim-ud-Din played 25 Test matches for Pakistan during his career and scored 1,091 runs in international cricket at the average of 25.37. He made two centuries and seven fifties. Cricket critics believed that he possessed a sound technique. In Test matches, Alim-ud-Din established an effective opening partnership with Hanif Mohammad."
"Alim-ud-Din started his international career against England in June 1954, at the Lord's Cricket Ground, in a match in which he scored 19 runs. In the fourth Test of the same series Pakistan beat England by 24 runs, recording their first Test win over them to become the first team to defeat England during their maiden tour. Alim-ud-Din managed to score 10 runs in the match. In 1954–55, he played, against India, in Pakistan's first home Tests, finishing the series as the leading run scorer with 332; he made three fifties and in the fifth match scored 103 not out at the National Stadium, Karachi, his first international century. He was the first batsman ever to make an international century on the Ground."
"Alim-ud-Din also toured West Indies as a part of Pakistan cricket team in 1957–58. He was not successful in the series and his highest score remained 41 runs which he made in the fourth Test at the Bourda, Georgetown, Guyana. In 1962, under the captaincy of Javed Burki, Pakistan visited England where they played a five Test match series. In the fifth Test at Headingley, a low scoring match for Pakistan, Alim-ud-Din's scores of 50 and 60 made him the team's highest scorer of the match. In the fifth Test of the home series against England in 1962, he scored his career best 109 runs at the National Stadium. He played his last match against England in Trent Bridge, Nottingham in 1962."
Former West Indian all-rounder Collie Smith was his only wicket in international cricket.
"He is variously known as ""Alim-ud-Din"" and ""Alimuddin"", with ""Wisden"" using the former in earlier editions and the latter in his obituary."
"Alim-ud-Din was born in Ajmer, a city in British India, on 15 December 1930. After the independence of Pakistan in 1947, he moved to Karachi along with his family. He lived in London and never married, instead providing for his family. Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) had given him an opportunity to work at London Heathrow Airport. Two of his brothers, Salimuddin and Azimuddin, both also played first-class cricket. His nephew, James Uddin, the son of Salimuddin, is also a cricketer and currently plays semi-professional cricket in England."
"In later life, his pension was suspended after doubts over his actual birth date. The pension was restored after intervention from the Pakistani President."
"On 12 July 2012, Alim-ud-Din died in Northwick Park Hospital, Harrow, London. He suffered from heart and lung diseases. He also had kidney failure and was on dialysis. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) released a press statement expressing sorrow and conveying condolences to Alim-ud-Din's family."

"In geometry, the cubohemioctahedron is a nonconvex uniform polyhedron, indexed as U. Its vertex figure is a crossed quadrilateral."
"It is given Wythoff symbol 4/3 4 | 3, although that is a double-covering of this figure."
"A nonconvex polyhedron has intersecting faces which do not represent new edges or faces. In the picture vertices are marked by golden spheres, and edges by silver cylinders."
It is a hemipolyhedron with 4 hexagonal faces passing through the model center. The hexagons intersect each other and so only triangle portions of each are visible.
"It shares the vertex arrangement and edge arrangement with the cuboctahedron (having the square faces in common), and with the octahemioctahedron (having the hexagonal faces in common)."
"The ""cubohemioctahedron"" can be seen as a net on the hyperbolic tetrahexagonal tiling with vertex figure 4.6.4.6."
<HR>
"The hexahemioctacron is the dual of the cubohemioctahedron, and is one of nine dual hemipolyhedra. It appears visually indistinct from the octahemioctacron."
"Since the cubohemioctahedron has four hexagonal faces passing through the model center, thus it is degenerate, and can be seen as having four vertices at infinity."
"In Magnus Wenninger's ""Dual Models"", they are represented with intersecting infinite prisms passing through the model center, cut off at a certain point that is convenient for the maker."

Darbandokeh is a former Assyrian village located in the sub-district of Harir and in the district of Shaqlawa. It is populated by Kurds today.
"The Assyrians of Darbandokeh came right after the Assyrian genocide that took place within the Ottoman Empire. They came from the Shamezdin region, located within Hakkari, Turkey and are of the Nochiya tribe. In 1938, fifteen families totaling 108 people lived in the village. As a result of forced migration in the late 20th century, today no Assyrians remain in the village of Darbandokeh. The Assyrian quarter of the village was resettled by pro-government Kurds after the entire village's population fled in 1963 due to fighting."
"Darbandokeh is the birthplace of many renowned Assyrians. It is where the Patriarch of the Holy Apostolic Catholic Assyrian Church of the East, Mar Dinkha IV, was born. It is also the birthplace of the former Secretary General of the Assyrian Universal Alliance, Emanuel Kamber."

Currently, it offers a five-year MBBS Program, along with a one-year compulsory post-graduation internship program. In 2009, Dinajpur city began an English version of education. Some notable English Version schools are: Bethel Int'l School, Dinajpur Ridge School, Dinajpur Labrotary School, Dinajpur Public School, South Point School and Green International School and Dinajpur Polytechnic Institute."
"At first, after its formation in 1856, the Dinajpur Municipality used to be run by a town committee presided over by the Deputy Magistrate. This was among the first 40 municipalities in Bengal at that time. Later in 1868, the 'District Town Act' commissioned a chairman of the municipality who replaced the Deputy Magistrate and given a similar rank as a District Magistrate.

"Liberator is an arcade game released by Atari, Inc. in 1982. It is based on the ""Atari Force"" comic book series published by DC Comics from 1982 to 1986. ""Liberator"" has been described as the opposite of ""Missile Command"", in that the player destroys cities from space instead of defending them from the ground. Only 762 arcade machines were ever made."
"The story ""Code Name: Liberator"" describes the premise of the arcade game in detail and was included as a special insert in two comic books cover dated January 1983. Characters and concepts from the comic exist throughout the game. In the opening screen of the arcade game, Commander Champion of the ""Atari Force"" asks the player to help free the galaxy from the evil Malaglon Army."
"The ""Liberator"" controls consist of a trackball, fire button, and shield button. The player controls a coordinated attack from four star ships at the corners of the screen. The primary target of the attack are enemy bases on a rotating planet in the center of the screen. The trackball is used to move a cross-shaped cursor. The fire button fires a missile at the cursor's location from the closest ship. The shield button is used to activate force fields around the ships. The shield can only take four hits each round, and the count is shared between all ships."
"At the beginning of each level, the player is flying through outer space and spaceships fly on screen from the left and right and leave in an arc. They try to ram into the player's ships. Shields do not work during this stage."
"After this stage, the player is taken to a view of a rotating planet. The most prominent enemies are red flashing missile bases. They shoot missiles, fireballs, and star balls at the player's ships. The enemy bases can also detach from the planet, turn into satellites, and orbit the planet while shooting missiles. Once all missile bases are destroyed, the player moves on to the next level. At higher levels, there is the white master base. It is very intelligent, and it can change the direction or speed of the planet rotation to avoid getting hit. At the end of each stage, the player is awarded a bonus ship for every 20,000 points."
"Missiles can be destroyed, although some split into four smaller particles when destroyed. Fireballs take four hits to destroy, but they slow down on each hit. Star balls also take four hits to destroy, but return to normal speed soon after being hit."
"Flying saucers sometimes appear from the planet. Flying saucers shoot a large, deadly laser which cannot be stopped."
"A level select menu allows the player to start at any third level (1, 4, 7... up to 22)."
"""Liberator"" was released for Microsoft Windows, Xbox, and PlayStation 2 in 2003 as part of ""Atari Anthology"", a collection of Atari arcade and 2600 games."
"Asset backed debt has a commodity value equal to the price of the collateral; a loan backed by a house has a commodity value equal to the free market price of the house. Non-collateralized debt, on the other hand, does not have a commodity value; it is valuable only insofar as it is repaid."
"Commodity value is an important consideration in hedging against inflation. Whereas fiat currencies can devalue, often catastrophically, currencies with considerable commodity value are known to better maintain their value; a government can print as many fiat bills as it wants with relative ease, the same is not true of mining precious metals. This leads some investors to purchase goods and debts with high commodity value, which are inherently safer than those with low, or no commodity value, minimizing risk by sacrificing potential return."

"The Maryland and Delaware Railroad Company is a Class III short-line railroad, formed in 1977 to operate several branch lines of the former Penn Central Railroad in both Maryland and Delaware, United States. These branches were omitted from the system plan for Conrail in 1976 and would have been discontinued without state subsidies. As an alternative to the higher cost of subsidizing Conrail as operator of the branch lines, the Maryland and Delaware governments selected the Maryland and Delaware Railroad Company (MDDE) to serve as the designated operator."
"The railroad did not own any of the track it uses until 2000 when it acquired a line between Frankford, Delaware and Snow Hill, Maryland, from the Snow Hill Shippers Association. Today, the railroad operates on 120 miles of track and runs out of a restored station in Federalsburg, Maryland. The new engine house in Massey, MD, was opened in the fall of 2019."
"MDDE incorporated in the State of Maryland on June 20, 1977 as a closely held, small railroad company. At that time, the states of Maryland and Delaware were paying subsidies to Conrail for branch lines, still owned by Penn Central, serving rural communities."
"The Maryland Department of Transportation selected MDDE to operate three of the rural branch lines in August 1977. These included the current Northern and Seaford Lines, and the discontinued branch between Clayton, Delaware and Easton, Maryland. Maryland purchased the two branches served by the MDDE Northern and Seaford Lines."
Snow Hill Shippers Association purchased the branch currently known as the Snow Hill Line in 1982 and hired MDDE to serve as operator. MDDE became owner of the branch in 2000.
"MDDE was awarded a five-year contract by Delaware in 1994 to operate a branch between Ellendale, Delaware and Milton, Delaware, and another branch between Georgetown, Delaware and Lewes, Delaware. These branches were part of the former Queen Anne's Railroad, which began providing rail service between Queenstown, Maryland and Lewes, Delaware in 1894, and extended its track to Love Point, Maryland in 1902. MDDE did not seek renewal of the Delaware contract and operation of the two lines was returned to the previous contractor, Delaware Coast Line Railroad, in 1999."
The 5-year operating contract with the Maryland Department of Transportation for the North Line and Seaford Line became effective in 2008. Two 5-year renewal options allow the contract to be extended until 2023.

"Baldwin 60000 is an experimental steam locomotive built by the Baldwin Locomotive Works in Eddystone, Pennsylvania, in 1926, during the height of the railroading industry. It received its number for being the 60,000th locomotive built by Baldwin."
"It was designed to be the best locomotive that Baldwin ever made. It boasts three cylinders, weighs about , including tender, and can pull a load of up to . Its top speed is ."
"60000 was very innovative, carrying unusual technology, including a water-tube firebox. This was intended to improve efficiency but the tubes were prone to burst inside the firebox. It is also a compound, expanding the steam once in the inside cylinder and then again in the two outside cylinders. Although compounding increases efficiency, it was an extra complication that the US railroads had mostly rejected by the middle twenties. The weight and length of the engine were too much for all but the heaviest and straightest tracks."
"This locomotive was experimental and was meant to be the model for future development. However, its demonstration runs never persuaded railroads to purchase more. In 1933, it was purchased by the Franklin Institute Science Museum for $1 and remains there today."
"After a series brief test runs following construction, the 60000 was sent to the Pennsylvania Railroad's Altoona Test Plant in Altoona, Pennsylvania. Placed on rollers without its tender, it was tested on the traction dynamometer to measure its performance, which included maximum drawbar horsepower. Following tests at the Altoona Test Plant, the Pennsylvania Railroad placed the engine in freight service between Enola Yard near Harrisburg and Morrisville Yard via the Trenton Cutoff. During testing on the PRR, 60000 pulled a maximum of 7,700 tons."
"Following testing on the PRR, the 60000 was sent for additional testing on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. Between November and December 1926, the 60000 was tested on the Cumberland Division between Brunswick and Keyser, Maryland, the Connellsville Division between Cumberland, Maryland, and Connellsville, Pennsylvania, and the Pittsburgh Division, which included the Sand Patch and Seventeen-Mile grades."
"In February 1927, the 60000 was sent to the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad's Beardstown Division of Illinois. The 60000 was run in tandem with the CB&Q's own M2-A Class 2-10-2 number 6157, in order to compare coal and water consumption. Overall, the 60000 was superior in its coal and water consumption."
"On 24 February 1927, the 60000 was sent to the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad. Testing was performed on the Pecos division between Clovis and Belen, New Mexico. As with the CB&Q, the AT&SF compared the performance of the 60000 with that of its own power in the form of two 3800-Class 2-10-2s. Once more the 60000 demonstrated superior fuel consumption than the locomotives of the host railroad."
"In the summer and fall of 1927, the 60000 was sent to the Southern Pacific Railroad, which overhauled the locomotive and converted it to an oil burner at its Sacramento Shops. Following its conversion, the 60000 was tested in both freight and passenger service on the Sacramento Division, during which the engine carried a Southern Pacific tender. Following tests on the SP, the 60000 was sent to the Great Northern Railway between Everett, Washington and Minot, North Dakota. Overall, the 60000 did not perform as well on oil as it did on coal."
"Converted back to coal, the 60000 was then returned to the Baldwin Locomotive Works and used as a stationary boiler before being sold to the Franklin Institute."

"1990 also saw the first international tournament—""RugbyFest"" held in Christchurch, New Zealand. As well as a variety of club sides, including teams from Japan (but not the Japanese national team), were four ""national"" teams—USA, New Zealand, USSR, and the Netherlands—who played a round-robin tournament. The winner was New Zealand, who then played—and beat—a combined ""World XV""."
"""Rugbyfest 1990"" pointed the way to the next big leap forward—the first women's rugby world cup, which took place in Wales the following year. Timed to coincide with the second men's world cup being held in England it did not meet with official approval from World Rugby (then known as the International Rugby Football Board), a decision which threatened the competition and was a factor in the New Zealand RFU not supporting their entry. However, this did not stop the New Zealanders from taking part—nor Wales, the United States, England, France, Canada, Sweden, USSR, Japan, Spain, Italy, and the Netherlands."
"The competition was run on a shoestring. Russian players sold souvenirs before and during matches to raise funds to cover their expenses, while four England administrators re-mortgaged their houses to cover the expenses of attending the competition. But after fifteen matches the first world champions were crowned—the United States, who beat England in the final. Despite the lack of support from the men's game, and very little media coverage, the competition had been a success, and the women's game continued to grow."
"In 1994 a second world cup was awarded to the Netherlands, but constant prevarication by the IRFB about whether they would (or would not) give the tournament official status caused huge problems for the hosts. Without IRFB support there was a fear that many unions would not send teams which would threaten the tournament (and even the Dutch union's) viability. In fact the IRFB went so far as to threaten sanctions against any unions did take part—thus ensuring that New Zealand, Sweden and Germany withdrew. Faced with this the risk of major losses was as too great and the Dutch withdrew both as hosts and participants with barely weeks to go."
"It was Scotland who stepped in to save the event with only 90 days to organise it. The second world cup was in the end a purely northern hemisphere affair with 11 remaining teams (consisting of the four home nations, France, the United States, Japan, Sweden, Russia, Canada and Kazakhstan) joined by a Scottish Students XV. The final was a repeat of 1991, but with this time England overcoming the United States 38–23, the final being played at Raeburn Place, Edinburgh. Despite everything, the tournament had been a success, and the game continued to grow."
In 1996 the IRFB established a Women's Advisory Committee which produced a five-year development plan for the game. One of its main targets was a 100% increase in player numbers by 2001. Elsewhere in the world...
"Widespread acceptance of the game led to women's versions of other major rugby union tournaments (the women's Five Nations begins in 1999), and growing numbers of headlines. In 2000 the Irish WRFU affiliated fully with the IRFU—but there were still set-backs. In 2002 the Australian RFU dropped support for the women's team's entry to the World Cup. The decision was seen as a factor in IOC rejection of rugby as an Olympic sport, and was reversed two years later."
But this was unusual. Women's teams were now being accepted on the main stage. In 2002 Scotland played their first women's match at Murrayfield and in 2003 England staged the first women's international at Twickenham.
"In 2006 the RFU devoted the rugby museum's main annual exhibition to the history of women's rugby—""Women's Rugby—A Work in Progress"", and the same year saw the Women's Rugby World Cup broadcast live on the internet."
"The growth in popularity among women attracted women in both developed and emerging nations, being the fastest growing sport in the world. The participation rates in both rugby sevens and rugby unions (with 15 players) has close to 500,000 new players joining every year globally. According to World Rugby, women's rugby is growing faster (if not as fast) as men's rugby and it is estimated that by 2026 40% of the total number of rugby players will be female. The game remains an amateur, minority sport—but a fast-growing one played in over 80 countries worldwide. Cost and player numbers mean that, in many of these nations, sevens tends to dominate, but 15-a-side championships have now been established in all regions."
"The highest profile women's rugby tournament is the Rugby World Cup, historically known as the Women's Rugby World Cup. The women's World Cup began in 1991, and has generally been played every four years. The most recent World Cup was held in Ireland in 2017, where New Zealand were the winners. In 2019, World Rugby announced that sex/gender designations would officially be removed from the title of the World Cup; the first tournament affected by this policy will be the next women's World Cup in 2021, to be hosted by New Zealand."
"The most successful nations in the World Cup have been New Zealand, which has won it five times, and England, which has reached the final seven times."
The primary annual global competition for women's rugby sevens is the World Rugby Women's World Series. The Women's Series was launched in the 2012-13 season. It features 4-6 tournaments each year.
"Women's rugby sevens at the Hong Kong Sevens has been dominated by New Zealand, with either the New Zealand team (1999–2001) or the Aotearoa Maori team (playing as New Zealand) winning the annual tournament from 1997 until 2007. The United States won the Hong Kong Sevens in 2008 by defeating Canada in the final (New Zealand failed to send a team)."
The inaugural Women's Rugby World Cup Sevens tournament took place in Dubai together with the men's tournament in 2009. Australia defeated New Zealand 15–10 in extra-time to become the first to win the Women's Rugby World Cup.
"Women's rugby sevens was included in World Rugby's successful bid to reintroduce rugby to the Olympics in 2016. At the 2016 Olympics, Australia defeated New Zealand in the final to win the gold medal."

= = = Samuel Richardson (Baptist) = = =
"Samuel Richardson (fl. 1646) was an English layman and religious controversialist of the 1640s and 1650s, of Baptist views."
"From Northamptonshire, Richardson was probably an army preacher in the early part of the First English Civil War. He became a leading member of one of the seven Baptist churches of London: in the three confessions of faith put forth by these churches in 1643, 1644, and 1646, Richardson's signature stands beside that of John Spilsbury, minister of the congregation at Wapping."
"Richardson supported the action of the parliamentary army and the government of Oliver Cromwell, to whom he had fee access. For a time he had scruples as to the title of ""Lord Protector"", and told Cromwell so to his face; then, becoming convinced, he tried to reconcile Vavasor Powell and others to the protectorate."
"Richardson defended Baptist practices and held strongly monergistic beliefs about justification similar to those of Tobias Crisp before him, and later John Gill. Salvation is exclusively by the grace of God and never depends on human faith or works, as justification is fully achieved on the cross as a result of the eternal decree of God to save the elect."
"Richardson, as Tobias Crisp, held that the law is not necessary to bring persons to saving faith, and that the Puritan emphasis on the individual believer's consciousness of sin makes subjective sentiments the object of faith, rather than Christ: ""We have made a Christ of our works, tears, and crying long enough"", Richardson notes."
"Human works as well as faith can only be considered results of God’s work in Christ as the Holy Spirit works in those who are justified. When Paul talks of justification by faith, he by “faith” simply means Christ. We are justified by Christ alone and not by our believing, Richardson claimed. Faith is an evidence of “interest in Christ but not a joint-partner with Christ”."
"Richardson, in his Justification by Christ Alone from 1647, argued that the work of Christ alone is the means of justification:"
"“[W]e grant God has decreed the end and the means, and whatsoever God has decreed shall unavoidably come to pass. But we deny that faith is any means of our Redemption, Justification, or Salvation. Nothing but the Lord Jesus Christ is the means of our salvation. There are means that are necessary to the revealing and enjoying the comfort of it, as the Holy Spirit and ministers to reveal it and faith to receive it; also, there be fruits and effects of the love of God, as faith, love, and obedience to Christ…yet these are no means of our salvation.”"
"Though holding a position in most of his works that can be described as clearly Particular Baptist and thus Calvinistic, Richardson in his last work expressed a form of eschatological universalism."
Richardson wrote:
"To Richardson have also been ascribed tentatively ""An exact and full Relation of all the Proceedings between the Cavaliers and the Northamptonshire Forces at Banbury"", January 1643–4, signed R. S.; ""The King's March with the Scots, and a List of the 3 Lords, … that submit to the Parliament upon the surrender of Newark"", London, May 1646; and ""Oxford agreed to be surrendered to Sir Thomas Fairfax"", London, June 1646."

"The Siege of Ctesiphon took place on 27 April 629 between the forces of Shahrbaraz and Ardashir III. Shahrbaraz managed to capture Ctesiphon with a small force, revealing to all the weakness of the Sasanian Empire."
"In 602, the last Byzantine-Sasanian war began; it was the most devastating of the series of wars fought between the two empires. In 618, Khosrau II sent Shahrbaraz to conquer Egypt; one year later the Sasanians managed to capture Alexandria, the capital of Byzantine Egypt. After the fall of Alexandria, the Sasanians gradually extended their rule southwards along the Nile. By 621, the province was securely in Sasanian hands."
"Egypt would remain in Sasanian hands for 10 years, run by general Shahrbaraz from Alexandria. As the new Roman emperor, Heraclius, reversed the tide and defeated Khosrau II, Shahrbaraz was ordered to evacuate the province, but refused. In the end, Heraclius, trying both to recover Egypt and to sow disunion amongst the Iranians, offered to help Shahrbaraz seize the Sasanian throne for himself. An agreement was reached, and in the spring of 629, the Sasanian troops began leaving Egypt."
"Luckily for Shahrbaraz, a civil war began in 628 that divided the resources of the Sasanian Empire, and a devastating plague in the western provinces killed half of the population along with Kavadh II, weakening the empire. Shahrbaraz marched towards Ctesiphon with 6,000 men, besieged it and then captured it, betraying the Sasanian nobles and killing many of them, including two notable ones named Ardabīl and Mah-Adhur Gushnasp."
"After capturing Ctesiphon, Shahrbaraz killed Ardashir III and took the throne for himself. However, his reign did not last long, because he was killed by Sasanian nobles after forty days, and two daughters of Khosrau II reigned in succession."

"The Thought and Daniel meet in Belshazzar's palace gardens. The Thought informs Daniel that Belshazzar has married Idolatry, even though he is already married to Vanity. Daniel cries woe for God's people."
"Belshazzar enters with Vanity and his new bride, Idolatry. He wants them to embrace each other. They do so and ask him what is on his mind. He relates the story of the Great Flood and also the Tower of Babel. After he tells his stories, his two wives decree that he is their king and god. Belshazzar asks what can break their bond, and Daniel informs him that “The Hand of God,” can break up Belshazzar, Vanity, and Idolatry. Belshazzar gets upset with Daniel and threatens his life. Daniel says that God will save him. Vanity and Idolatry tell Belshazzar that Daniel is annoying them and they want to leave. As they leave, Belshazzar tells Daniel he owes his life to the two queens, not to God. The Thought tells Daniel that he has learned a valuable lesson – by invoking the hand of God, his life can be spared in future situations."
"Death and Daniel enter and discuss Belshazzar and his sins of vanity and idolatry. Death offers to kill Belshazzar for Daniel, as an agent of an angry God. Daniel gives Death permission to visit Belshazzar and scare him, but not kill him. Daniel wants to save his soul. Death is upset about only being allowed to show himself to and warn Belshazzar and not take his soul. He calls for Thought. Thought joins Death and is scared of him. Death asks Thought where Belshazzar is. Thought tells Death that Belshazzar is with his two wives in the garden. Death asks Thought to take him there. Thought does because he doesn't have the courage to say no."
"Belshazzar, Idolatry, and Vanity enter. The ask Belshazzar why he looks so sad and stops talking so suddenly. Belshazzar says he doesn't know the source of the intense pain he feels. It is Death approaching that none of the trio can see. Death shows himself to Belshazzar who is shocked and terrified. He asks Death who he is; Death tells Belshazzar that he is a creditor here to collect a debt that Belshazzar owes. Thought rethinks his decision to lead Death to Belshazzar. Belshazzar asks what he owes. Death shows him a book that has the debt listed, but Belshazzar states that the book is one he lost. Death says the debt was written down by Belshazzar himself. He reads back what Belshazzar wrote about owing his life to Death. Death tells Belshazzar that today is not the day that he has come to collect the debt, but that the day is coming. Death exits."
"Belshazzar, Idolatry, Vanity, and Thought are still together. The two queens want to know what is troubling Belshazzar. He says he is not sure – some phantom visited him. To please Belshazzar, the queens take turns complimenting each other. They all sit down and Idolatry fans Belshazzar with the feather from her hat while Vanity sings to him about his greatness to continue to soothe him."
"Death is angry because the queens have soothed Belshazzar into a sleep. Death says he will haunt Belshazzar in his dream. The queens leave the garden and Thought also falls asleep. Death sees Belshazzar asleep and decides to kill him. He draws his sword, but Daniel enters and says, “No,” while holding back the arms of Death. Death inquires why he cannot kill the king. Daniel says Belshazzar has not lived his whole life and it is not time yet for him to die. Death argues that Belshazzar's life is a mockery to both God and Death."
"While Belshazzar is asleep, in his dream the queens enter with a Statue – it is Belshazzar as a god. The queens praise Belshazzar and build him up. The Statue warns Belshazzar in his sleep that he needs to leave Idolatry and Vanity behind or else he will suffer because of them. The Statue tells the dream queens that the great God decrees them gone. Belshazzar wakes up and is troubled by what he saw and felt in his sleep. He starts to question keeping so much stock in Idolatry and Vanity. However, Idolatry seduces him again and he returns to his former self. Thought suggests Belshazzar throw a feast to shake off all of the melancholy. Belshazzar calls for the gold wine glasses and wine reserved for presenting the Eucharist to be used, because he deserves the best. Idolatry and Vanity set the table for the feast while Thought sings."
"Death comes to the feast in a disguise and makes a plea to God to loose his hand in order to kill Belshazzar due to his sacrilegious behavior against the Eucharist on top of his sins of Idolatry and Vanity. Belshazzar demands wine, and Death, being mistaken for a servant, brings him a golden cup of poisoned wine declaring that in the cup is both Life and Death. Belshazzar toasts himself, drinks the wine, and then there are several increasingly loud thunder claps. A hand appears in the clouds and writes nonsense words that neither Idolatry, Vanity, Belshazzar, nor Thought can decipher. Idolatry says Daniel can read them and calls him to do it."
"Daniel comes and interrupts the words that translate to mean that: One, God has numbered Belshazzar's days on earth. Two, Belshazzar has been weighed in the balance and been found wanting. Three, Belshazzar's kingdom will be a wasteland ravaged by his enemies when Belshazzar dies. All this because Belshazzar has profaned the sacred golden sacramental cups meant only to be used for the Eucharist. Death tells Belshazzar know that there was “death,” or poison, in the cups. Belshazzar cries out for Idolatry to save him, but she cannot. He calls out to Vanity to help him, but she cannot. Belshazzar asks Thought to help him, but Thought reminds him that he did not take heed of the warnings he received. Belshazzar finally calls on Daniel. Daniels says he is God's agent and Belshazzar must take his punishment. Belshazzar wonders who could save him – Death says no one. Death says “Die, thou sinner,” draws his sword, and stabs Belshazzar in the heart. As Death and Belshazzar wrestle, Belshazzar calls out a warning to all men. Idolatry lays down her worship of all other gods for God Himself, asks for forgiveness for Calderón's faults, and says that his intentions as the playwright was to point back to God."

"Lev Zacharovitch Aronson (Lew Aronson, Lev Aronoff, Lev Aronov, Lev Arnoff, Lew Arnow, Lew Arnoff-Aramon, Lew Arnoff-Aronson) (February 7, 1912 – November 12, 1988) was an Eastern European-American cellist and cello teacher."
"Lev Aronson was born February 7, 1912, in Mönchengladbach, Germany. Aronson's parents, Zorach and Pessa, along with their first infant son, had moved to Germany in 1911 so Zorach could study tailoring at the Fachhoschule (School of Fashion) in Berlin. Zorach and Pessa's infant son died in 1911. Lev was born a few weeks before his father graduated from the Fachhoschule. About three weeks after Lev's birth, the family returned to their home in Mitava in the Courland region of the Russian Empire (presently Jelgava, Latvia)."
"Aronson's sister, Gerda, was born in 1914, the same year Archduke Franz Ferdinand was assassinated and World War I began. The Russian government, fearing that German and Yiddish-speaking Jews might be or become German spies, took action quickly. On April 18, 1915, the Decree of Expulsion was issued by Czarist Russia, and many Jews were forcibly moved to the interior of Russia. The Aronsons and many other Jews were deported on cattle cars to Voronezh, southeast of Moscow."
"Aronson first heard the cello played by a child of a non-Jewish neighbor in Voronezh. Soon after this, a relative on his mother's side, Nikolai Arnoff, who was a professional cellist, came to Voronezh to give a concert and stayed with the Aronson family. He taught Lev how to hold the instrument and the bow. Lev's father bought him a small cello and arranged with a fellow immigrant, Aron Rafaelovitsch Rubinstein, to teach the child his first cello lessons. Lev was seven."
"In 1920, the family was allowed to leave Voronezh, and they chose to move to Riga, Latvia. Lev attended school in Riga and continued to study cello. As a youth, he performed occasionally with the orchestra at silent movies. Aronson studied cello with Paul Berkowitz, a well-known physician and cellist in Riga."
"Upon his graduation from high school at 16, Aronson moved to Berlin to study law. During his first semester he met a doctor who was an amateur cellist. The doctor, after hearing Aronson play, introduced him to Julius Klengel in Leipzig. Aronson began studying cello with Klengel and soon gave up law to focus on music. After a year with Klengel, Lev began his studies with Alfred von Glehn at the Klindworth-Scharwenka Conservatory in Berlin. When von Glehn died, Gregor Piatigorsky took over his class. Piatigorsky was to become Aronson's life-long mentor and friend. Aronson began performing locally with three German friends in the Peters String Quartet in 1931."
"In 1933, Adolf Hitler became chancellor of Germany. Anti-Jewish violence in Germany and throughout Europe was on the rise. Aronson decided to change his name to Lev Arnoff, which sounded more Russian than Jewish in an attempt to escape attention and continue performing. Aronson found a patroness, Mrs. Daliba Jones, whom he met in Florence through American conductor Vladimir Shavitch, and began to build a successful performing career throughout Europe as a soloist. He won a competition in Russia. He made several recordings for the Bellacord Electro label. In 1937, he became principal cellist for the Philharmonic Orchestra of Libau. During the late 1930s, Aronson also began teaching cello in Riga, awakening a passion for education that would stay with him for the rest of his life."
"German forces invaded and occupied Riga in June 1941. Aronson's cellos were confiscated. Aronson began work as a slave laborer for the Gestapo. The Jews were moved to a ghetto in the so-called Moscow suburb of Riga. Between November 29 and December 8, 1941, thousands of Jews living in the Riga Ghetto were taken to the Rumbula forest, shot, and buried in mass graves. Among them were Aronson's parents."
"Aronson worked at the clothing depot, Ausekla, for much of the period between the German invasion and 1943. In 1943, the Riga-Kaiserwald concentration camp system was formally established. Many Jews already lived and worked at satellite work camps in the region, which were now considered to be part of the Kaiserwald system. The Riga Ghetto was liquidated, moving the Jews from one horrible situation to another. Most Jews from the ghetto or satellite camps passed through Kaiserwald briefly on their way to work assignments within the system. Aronson worked at the Lenta subcamp, and outgrowth of Ausekla."
"In the fall of 1944, the Germans fled Latvia ahead of the Russian advance. Aronson and a number of other Jews from Kaiserwald and its subcamps, including his sister, were deported to the Stutthof concentration camp. Aronson's sister died at Stutthof."
"From Stutthof, Aronson was transferred to Burggraben and worked in the Danzig shipyards. In 1945, the Germans again moved their Jewish prisoners ahead of the Ally advance. Aronson was among one of the many groups of Jews sent on death marches in the early months of 1945. His group made it to Gotentov (near Lauenberg), where they were liberated on March 10, 1945, by the Russians."
"Aronson, along with many other survivors, was sent to a Soviet repatriation camp in Torun, Poland. Aronson managed to escape and made his way with the help of the Jewish underground through Poland and Germany to the American militarized zone, where he spent nearly two years waiting to be allowed to immigrate to the United States. During his flight, Aronson met dancer Nina Bukowska, and the two fell in love and were married in 1947."
"Some of the musicians from the Riga ghetto survived the war in the same camps as Aronson; the tenor Gregor Shelkan was one of them. After the war, Aronson and Shelkan, memorializing those who died in the war, composed several original pieces. A few of these compositions were published in the Displaced Persons camp Schlachtensee in the American zone of Berlin."
"Aronson and Bukowska immigrated to the United States in 1948. He accepted a contract with the Dallas Symphony Orchestra and moved to Texas. Aronson served as assistant principal cellist in the Dallas Symphony for the 1948-1949 season and then as principal until 1967. Aronson taught cello at Baylor University in Waco, Texas, from 1967 until 1980. In 1980, Aronson began teaching at Southern Methodist University. In the 1970s, Aronson collaborated with Croatian cellist and composer, Rudolf Matz, producing the two volume work, The Complete Cellist."
"Bukowska and Aronson moved to Dallas together but later divorced. Aronson married Deane Wright in 1959 and was subsequently divorced. He married Harriet Snodgrass, a fellow cellist and former pupil, in 1979."
"Lev Aronson died in Dallas on November 12, 1988. In 1990, he was posthumously awarded the ""Chevalier du violoncello"" by the Janzer Foundation."
"Though a talented performer, Lev Aronson is perhaps best-known as an influential teacher of the cello. During his tenure in the Dallas Symphony, he taught several private cello students. After his retirement from the orchestra, he dedicated more time to teaching, privately and at his university appointments. He founded and conducted the Dal-Hi Chamber Players, a group of young musicians who performed in the United States and abroad in the 1970s. He taught and judged at numerous music festivals, workshops, and competitions. He even taught a course for the Southern Methodist University Continuing Education program, which introduced adults to western art music."
"Aronson's students include Lynn Harrell, Ralph Kirshbaum, Kristi Curb, Brian Thornton, John Sharp, Adron Ming, Brook Pearce, James R. Denton, Christopher Adkins, Laurie Arnold, Alicia Randisi-Hooker, Karen Terbeek, Carol Haski, Philip Taggart, Kevin Dvorak, Richard Pope, Jonathan Reimer, Rebecca Young, and Mitch Maxwell."

"Biscotasing, often referred to as simply Bisco, is a community in the Unorganized North Part of Sudbury District in northeastern, Ontario, Canada. It was founded on the shores of Lake Biscotasi on the Spanish River in 1884 by Canadian Pacific Railway as a railway construction town, and the first divisional point west of Sudbury. The rails of westward track laying gangs reached this area in October 1884."
"Biscotasing is an access point for canoeists, fishermen, and back-country campers to the area including Biscotasi Lake Provincial Park. It has one general store that functions as the post office, tackle shop, grocery store and Liquor Control Board of Ontario (LCBO) outlet; a community centre; a church; and the one-room Biscotasing railway station served by Via Rail. The town also is accessible by floatplane and by a long drive on the Sultan Industrial Road. Although the year-round population is only 22, during the summer season, the population swells to around 300, mostly tourists."
"The early development of Biscotasing was dictated solely by the needs of the railway. The CPR acquired a parcel of land at Biscotasing in 1884 and by November had cleared . A frame station the size of 30 × , was constructed, with offices upstairs, a large freight shed 40 × , a telegraph office, several residences for company officials and a number of boarding houses were completed before the end of that year. A wye track had also been installed to allow work trains to turn around prior to returning to the east. Later a roundhouse was built to service the locomotives."

"Due to the high traffic volumes passing through on their way to and from North Shore City, and because the viaduct is only four lanes wide in total (while adjacent motorway stretches are at least six lanes), the bridge over the park is considered ""one of the country's worst traffic bottlenecks"", with around 200,000 vehicles a day."
"After improvements to the Central Motorway Junction directly to the south in the early 2000s, Transit New Zealand, the highways authority, initially proposed a widening of the viaduct, which met with opposition from locals as well as from the Auckland City Council and the Auckland Regional Council, because it would further burden the Victoria Park area with more traffic and a larger overpass structure. In 2004 the authority agreed that instead of a second viaduct, the 'Vic Park Tunnel' should be built, carrying northbound traffic only west of the existing structure, freeing it for southbound traffic."

The IceCube Neutrino Observatory (or simply IceCube) is a neutrino observatory constructed at the Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station in Antarctica.The project is a recognized CERN experiment (RE10).
"Its thousands of sensors are located under the Antarctic ice, distributed over a cubic kilometre."
"Similar to its predecessor, the Antarctic Muon And Neutrino Detector Array (AMANDA), IceCube consists of spherical optical sensors called Digital Optical Modules (DOMs), each with a photomultiplier tube (PMT) and a single-board data acquisition computer which sends digital data to the counting house on the surface above the array. IceCube was completed on 18 December 2010."
"DOMs are deployed on strings of 60 modules each at depths between 1,450 and 2,450 meters into holes melted in the ice using a hot water drill. IceCube is designed to look for point sources of neutrinos in the TeV range to explore the highest-energy astrophysical processes."
In November 2013 it was announced that IceCube had detected 28 neutrinos that likely originated outside the Solar System.
"IceCube is part of a series of projects developed and supervised by the University of Wisconsin–Madison. Collaboration and funding are provided by numerous other universities and research institutions worldwide. Construction of IceCube was only possible during the Antarctic austral summer from November to February, when permanent sunlight allows for 24-hour drilling. Construction began in 2005, when the first IceCube string was deployed and sufficient data was collected to verify that the optical sensors functioned correctly. In the 2005–2006 season, an additional eight strings were deployed, making IceCube the largest neutrino telescope in the world."
Construction was completed on 17 December 2010. The total cost of the project was $279 million.
"Barco is not mentioned in the ""Inquirições"" (Inquiries) of 1288, although it is known to have existed at that time."
"The parish of Barco was established by the 15th century, when it was split off from the priory of St. Silvestre da Covilhã and given its own priest. Even before this, there was a small chapel dedicated to Saint Simon the Zealot."
"Until the 19th century the parish was called St. Simon, after which it assumed the common name of Barco."
"Saint Simon was said to have been martyred by being sawed in half, and the emblem of the parish is a saw."
Between 1860 and 1950 the parish saw rapid population growth.
"The census of 1878 gave Barco a population of 923, of whom 429 were male and 494 female, in 234 dwellings."
"By 1950 there were 1,800 people."
Since then the population has declined steadily.
In 2011 Barco had a population of just 473.
Until recently wolfram and tin were mined in the parish.
"The Mina da Argemela, a tin mine that was abandoned around 1960, is located near Barco."
"Economic activities include trade, industry, agriculture and construction."
"Most people work in agriculture, growing maize, beans, olives and rye."
"Local gastronomical specialties include ""Borelhões"", sausages, river fish and wild boar."
"Religion plays an important role in local culture, as shown by the many small shrines one sees in the countryside."
"Festivals include St. Simon (28 October), San Sebastian (4th Sunday of August), St John (June 23) and Our Lady of Fatima (May 30)."
"Barco has always been part of Covilhã. There was some uncertainty about the extent of its territory, now ."
The boundary between Barco and the neighboring parish of Peso was only defined on 4 October 1894.
From 1872 to 1984 the parish of Coutada was attached to Barco. It was then made a separate parish.
In 2013 Barco was again merged with the parish of Coutada to form the parish of União das Freguesias de Barco e Coutada.
