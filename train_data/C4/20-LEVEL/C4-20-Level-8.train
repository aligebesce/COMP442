"So if I wrote a letter  and wouldn't let you see it, how would you feel?"
I wouldn't feel anything cos I'm not really bothered!
What if it's about you as well?
Well if you write something about me  you write something about me!
"And if I don't let you see it, I'm dead?"

And she wasn't very well yesterday.
Every time she got a bump  or knock off one of the others she was crying  instead of clouting them back.
"It must have been Richard, I do I don't think  Richard's very, he"
"Sorry, what d'ya say Richard was?"
I said I don't  well stop running the tap.
"I say, I don't think Richard's  very well either."
Cos he cried more than usual.
"I wonder what time, the other night, Trevor had with them on his own?"
What do you think of granny Jean offering it  offering again to get Martin  from school to save Trevor walking him home?

"No,i it's flipping rubbish!"
People are getting ripped off!
"Even black and white T V's, how much is that?"
Half a .

I'd buy Deane  and swap Bright in exchange for Deane.
No matter how bad he doesn't like it  he's well and truly gutted.

Yeah but Deane won't be available till the end of the season.
There's no way Sheffield United

"Oh yeah, Deane."
Deane.
But Deane didn't score today.
It was Beazley apparently.
Beazley.
Beazley.
Er I might see if I could pick up that  Sheffield United guy Jamie Hoyland.
He's quite good.
"As you say the main problem is, as you say is are you going to change your whole  team, game"
Yeah.

I think they'll do it slowly but  not this slowly.
I mean I th I think we should have bought someone along with er Gabbiadini to play with him.

"I mean everyone knows she fancies him, but like, she's been getting really flirty!"
"So, like, we've got this thing about her, anyway, she was com and she was talking to Fiona today and she was stood next to me, and like  in a way, I was laughing at her  but I felt so sorry for her cos she really, really stunk!"
"And like  I wouldn't sa , she's not the sort of person who you'd think  oh you know  I mean like"
Oh you smell!
"yeah like, not being nasty but Hannah   to look at her you think  you'd think, oh you know she might sort of bit  bit pongy!"
Mm.
"And like, Lisa  's like, you know  so"
"Yeah she's like, really clean cut isn't she?"
She's like anyone isn't she?
"She's like us  sort of thing, you know?"
"I mean, here's me saying  smelly bum, you know !"
"Even, even, even no, but even more"
Radiation!

She says you'll have the bill for this!
Yeah.
A man just stated it!
That we're taking responsibility  we'll be moving out!
We won't get paid for it!
We wanted to charge them!
I don't know anything them see.
It might be that they're in under  promotions team.
Their only parking!

And only letting it to friends and I suggest
Mm.

But er  somebody was in and left it all filthy and mouldy and  what for!
Oh!
Yes?
Had the cleaner gone in  it?
I don't know .
"I don't think so, no."
How?
"Because er, I've seen it and dirty and that."
And they're bloody cooker's filthy!
It's true!
I have seen it.
"I don't think it's really clean, and they charge you for it!"
Of course they do!
They're out to get all they can out of them!
"In the pool of Corri-Bui swims a salmon with a skin that shines like silver , and whose gills are red -- bring them all to me , and then you shall know where dwell your brothers and your sister ! '"
` To-morrow at cock-crow I will begone ! '
answered Covan .
"The way to the mountain lay straight before him , and when he had climbed high he caught sight of the roe with the white feet and the spotted sides , on the peak in front ."
"Full of hope he set out in pursuit of her , but by the time he had reached that peak she had left it and was to be seen on another ."
"And so it always happened , and Covan 's courage had well-nigh failed him , when the thought of the Dog of Maol-mor darted into his mind ."
"` Oh , that he was here ! '"
he cried .
And looking up he saw him .
` Why did you summon me ? '
asked the Dog of Maol-mor .
"And when Covan had told him of his trouble , and how the roe always led him further and further , the Dog only answered : ` Fear nothing ; I will soon catch her for you . '"
And in a short while he laid the roe unhurt at Covan 's feet .
` What will you wish me to do with her ? '
said the Dog .
"And Covan answered : ` The old man bade me bring her , and the duck with the golden neck , and the salmon with the silver sides , to his cottage ; if I shall catch them , I know not ."
"But carry you the roe to the back of the cottage , and tether her so that she can not escape . '"
"` It shall be done , ' said the Dog of Maol-mor ."
"Then Covan sped to the lake which led to the land of the Sun , where the duck with the green body and the golden neck was swimming among the water-lilies ."
"` Surely I can catch him , good swimmer as I am , ' to himself ."
"But , if he could swim well , the duck could swim better , and at length his strength failed him , and he was forced to seek the land ."
` Oh that the black raven were here to help me ! '
he thought to himself .
And in a moment the black raven was perched on his shoulder .
` How can I help you ? '
asked the raven .
And Covan answered : ` Catch me the green duck that floats on the water . '
"And the raven flew with his strong wings and picked him up in his strong beak , and in another moment the bird was laid at the feet of Covan ."
"This time it was easy for the young man to carry his prize , and after giving thanks to the raven for his aid , he went on to the river ."
In the deep dark pool of which the old man had spoken the silver-sided salmon was lying under a rock .
"` Surely I , good fisher as I am , can catch him , ' said Covan son of Gorla ."
"And cutting a slender pole from a bush , he fastened a line to the end of it ."
"My voice stuck in my throat , for I ever hated to take part in lies ; but my very embarrassment helped on the plot , for the lass no doubt set down my husky voice to sickness and fatigue ."
`` Has he nae friends ? ''
"said she , in a tearful voice ."
`` That has he so ! ''
"cried Alan , `` if we could but win to them !"
"-- friends and rich friends , beds to lie in , food to eat , doctors to see to him -- and here he must tramp in the dubs and sleep in the heather like a beggarman . ''"
`` And why that ? ''
says the lass .
"`` My dear , '' said Alan , `` I cannae very safely say ; but I 'll tell ye what I 'll do instead , '' says he , `` I 'll whistle ye a bit tune . ''"
"And with that he leaned pretty far over the table , and in a mere breath of a whistle , but with a wonderful pretty sentiment , gave her a few bars of `` Charlie is my darling . ''"
"`` Wheesht , '' says she , and looked over her shoulder to the door ."
"`` That 's it , '' said Alan ."
`` And him so young ! ''
cries the lass .
"`` He 's old enough to -- '' and Alan struck his forefinger on the back part of his neck , meaning that I was old enough to lose my head ."
"`` It would be a black shame , '' she cried , flushing high ."
"`` It 's what will be , though , '' said Alan , `` unless we manage the better . ''"
"At this the lass turned and ran out of that part of the house , leaving us alone together ."
"Alan in high good humour at the furthering of his schemes , and I in bitter dudgeon at being called a Jacobite and treated like a child ."
"`` Alan , '' I cried , `` I can stand no more of this . ''"
"`` Ye 'll have to sit it then , Davie , '' said he ."
"`` For if ye upset the pot now , ye may scrape your own life out of the fire , but Alan Breck is a dead man . ''"
"This was so true that I could only groan ; and even my groan served Alan 's purpose , for it was overheard by the lass as she came flying in again with a dish of white puddings and a bottle of strong ale ."
`` Poor lamb ! ''
"says she , and had no sooner set the meat before us , than she touched me on the shoulder with a little friendly touch , as much as to bid me cheer up ."
"Then she told us to fall to , and there would be no more to pay ; for the inn was her own , or at least her father 's , and he was gone for the day to Pittencrieff ."
"We waited for no second bidding , for bread and cheese is but cold comfort and the puddings smelt excellently well ; and while we sat and ate , she took up that same place by the next table , looking on , and thinking , and frowning to herself , and drawing the string of her apron through her hand ."
"`` I 'm thinking ye have rather a long tongue , '' she said at last to Alan ."
`` Ay '' said Alan ; `` but ye see I ken the folk I speak to . ''
"`` I would never betray ye , '' said she , `` if ye mean that . ''"
"`` No , '' said he , `` ye 're not that kind ."
"But I 'll tell ye what ye would do , ye would help . ''"
Before Miss Marshall had finished reading that letter she had cried three times and laughed times past counting .
"More tears came at the end -- happy , tender tears such as Miss Marshall had not shed for years ."
Something warm and sweet and gentle seemed to thrill to life within her heart .
"So those girls were not such selfish , heedless young creatures as she had supposed !"
How kind it had been in Cyrilla Blair to think of her and write so to her .
She no longer felt lonely and neglected .
Her whole sombre world had been brightened to sunshine by that merry friendly letter .
Mrs. Plunkett 's table was surrounded by a ring of smiling faces that night .
Everybody seemed in good spirits in spite of the weather .
"The pale little dressmaker , who had hardly uttered a word since her arrival a week before , talked and laughed quite merrily and girlishly , thanking Cyrilla unreservedly for her `` jolly letter . ''"
"Old Mr. Grant did not grumble once about the rain or the food or his rheumatism and he told Carol that she might be a good letter writer in time if she looked after her grammar more carefully -- which , from Mr. Grant , was high praise ."
All the others declared that they were delighted with their letters -- all except Miss Marshall .
"She said nothing but later on , when Cyrilla was going upstairs , she met Miss Marshall in the shadows of the second landing ."
"`` My dear , '' said Miss Marshall gently , `` I want to thank you for your letter , I do n't think you can realize just what it has meant to me ."
I was so -- so lonely and tired and discouraged .
It heartened me right up .
I -- I know you have thought me a cross and disagreeable person .
"I 'm afraid I have been , too ."
But -- but -- I shall try to be less so in future .
"If I ca n't succeed all at once do n't mind me because , under it all , I shall always be your friend ."
And I mean to keep your letter and read it over every time I feel myself getting bitter and hard again . ''
"`` Dear Miss Marshall , I 'm so glad you liked it , '' said Cyrilla frankly ."
`` We 're all your friends and would be glad to be chummy with you .
Only we thought perhaps we bothered you with our nonsense . ''
"`` Come and see me sometimes , '' said Miss Marshall with a smile ."
`` I 'll try to be ` chummy ' -- perhaps I 'm not yet too old to learn the secret of friendliness .
Your letter has made me think that I have missed much in shutting all young life out from mine as I have done .
I want to reform in this respect if I can . ''
When Cyrilla reached the front room she found Mrs. Plunkett there .
"`` I 've just dropped in , Miss Blair , '' said that worthy woman , `` to say that I dunno as I mind your making candy once in a while if you want to ."
Only do be careful not to set the place on fire .
Please be particularly careful not to set it on fire . ''
"An ye were the devil , ye might go where ye will for me ."
Seek God 's forgiveness ; mine ye have freely .
But to go on to Holywood is different .
"I carry arms for York , and I will suffer no spy within their lines ."
"Hold it , then , for certain , if ye set one foot before another , I will uplift my voice and call the nearest post to seize you . ''"
"`` Ye mock me , '' said Sir Daniel ."
`` I have no safety out of Holywood . ''
"`` I care no more , '' returned Richard ."
"`` I let you go east , west , or south ; north I will not ."
Holywood is shut against you .
"Go , and seek not to return ."
"For , once ye are gone , I will warn every post about this army , and there will be so shrewd a watch upon all pilgrims that , once again , were ye the very devil , ye would find it ruin to make the essay . ''"
"`` Ye doom me , '' said Sir Daniel , gloomily ."
"`` I doom you not , '' returned Richard ."
"`` If it so please you to set your valour against mine , come on ; and though I fear it be disloyal to my party , I will take the challenge openly and fully , fight you with mine own single strength , and call for none to help me ."
"So shall I avenge my father , with a perfect conscience . ''"
"`` Ay , '' said Sir Daniel , `` y ' have a long sword against my dagger . ''"
"`` I rely upon Heaven only , '' answered Dick , casting his sword some way behind him on the snow ."
"`` Now , if your ill-fate bids you , come ; and , under the pleasure of the Almighty , I make myself bold to feed your bones to foxes . ''"
"`` I did but try you , Dickon , '' returned the knight , with an uneasy semblance of a laugh ."
`` I would not spill your blood . ''
"`` Go , then , ere it be too late , '' replied Shelton ."
`` In five minutes I will call the post .
I do perceive that I am too long-suffering .
"Had but our places been reversed , I should have been bound hand and foot some minutes past . ''"
"`` Well , Dickon , I will go , '' replied Sir Daniel ."
"`` When we next meet , it shall repent you that ye were so harsh . ''"
"And with these words , the knight turned and began to move off under the trees ."
"Dick watched him with strangely-mingled feelings , as he went , swiftly and warily , and ever and again turning a wicked eye upon the lad who had spared him , and whom he still suspected ."
"There was upon one side of where he went a thicket , strongly matted with green ivy , and , even in its winter state , impervious to the eye ."
"Herein , all of a sudden , a bow sounded like a note of music ."
"An arrow flew , and with a great , choked cry of agony and anger , the Knight of Tunstall threw up his hands and fell forward in the snow ."
`` I 'm going straight to Lorenzo White 's . ''
"`` But he lives on the White Sands road and it 's quite a distance out of our way , '' protested Diana ."
`` Gilbert and Fred will canvass him . ''
"`` They are not going around until next Saturday and it will be too late by then , '' said Anne firmly ."
`` The novelty will be worn off .
Lorenzo White is dreadfully mean but he will subscribe to ANYTHING just now .
"We must n't let such a golden opportunity slip , Diana . ''"
The result justified Anne 's foresight .
"Mr. White met them in the yard , beaming like the sun upon an Easter day ."
When Anne asked for a subscription he agreed enthusiastically .
"`` Certain , certain ."
Just put me down for a dollar more than the highest subscription you 've got . ''
"`` That will be five dollars ... Mr. Daniel Blair put down four , '' said Anne , half afraid ."
But Lorenzo did not flinch .
`` Five it is ... and here 's the money on the spot .
"Now , I want you to come into the house ."
There 's something in there worth seeing ... something very few people have seen as yet .
Just come in and pass YOUR opinion . ''
`` What will we say if the baby is n't pretty ? ''
whispered Diana in trepidation as they followed the excited Lorenzo into the house .
"`` Oh , there will certainly be something else nice to say about it , '' said Anne easily ."
`` There always is about a baby . ''
"The baby WAS pretty , however , and Mr. White felt that he got his five dollars ' worth of the girls ' honest delight over the plump little newcomer ."
"But that was the first , last , and only time that Lorenzo White ever subscribed to anything ."
"Anne , tired as she was , made one more effort for the public weal that night , slipping over the fields to interview Mr. Harrison , who was as usual smoking his pipe on the veranda with Ginger beside him ."
"Strickly speaking he was on the Carmody road ; but Jane and Gertie , who were not acquainted with him save by doubtful report , had nervously begged Anne to canvass him ."
"Mr. Harrison , however , flatly refused to subscribe a cent , and all Anne 's wiles were in vain ."
"`` But I thought you approved of our society , Mr. Harrison , '' she mourned ."
"`` So I do ... so I do ... but my approval does n't go as deep as my pocket , Anne . ''"
"`` A few more experiences such as I have had today would make me as much of a pessimist as Miss Eliza Andrews , '' Anne told her reflection in the east gable mirror at bedtime ."
VII The Pointing of Duty Anne leaned back in her chair one mild October evening and sighed .
"She was sitting at a table covered with text books and exercises , but the closely written sheets of paper before her had no apparent connection with studies or school work ."
And two years ago this morning I woke wondering what delightful gift the new day would give me .
These are the two years I thought would be filled with fun . ''
`` Would you exchange them -- now -- for two years filled with fun ? ''
"`` No , '' said Rilla slowly ."
`` I would n't .
It 's strange -- is n't it ?
"-- They have been two terrible years -- and yet I have a queer feeling of thankfulness for them -- as if they had brought me something very precious , with all their pain ."
"I would n't want to go back and be the girl I was two years ago , not even if I could ."
"Not that I think I 've made any wonderful progress -- but I 'm not quite the selfish , frivolous little doll I was then ."
"I suppose I had a soul then , Miss Oliver -- but I did n't know it ."
I know it now -- and that is worth a great deal -- worth all the suffering of the past two years .
"And still '' -- Rilla gave a little apologetic laugh , `` I do n't want to suffer any more -- not even for the sake of more soul growth ."
"At the end of two more years I might look back and be thankful for the development they had brought me , too ; but I do n't want it now . ''"
"`` We never do , '' said Miss Oliver ."
"`` That is why we are not left to choose our own means and measure of development , I suppose ."
No matter how much we value what our lessons have brought us we do n't want to go on with the bitter schooling .
"Well , let us hope for the best , as Susan says ; things are really going well now and if Rumania lines up , the end may come with a suddenness that will surprise us all . ''"
Rumania did come in -- and Susan remarked approvingly that its king and queen were the finest looking royal couple she had seen pictures of .
So the summer passed away .
Early in September word came that the Canadians had been shifted to the Somme front and anxiety grew tenser and deeper .
"For the first time Mrs. Blythe 's spirit failed her a little , and as the days of suspense wore on the doctor began to look gravely at her , and veto this or that special effort in Red Cross work ."
"`` Oh , let me work -- let me work , Gilbert , '' she entreated feverishly ."
`` While I 'm working I do n't think so much .
If I 'm idle I imagine everything -- rest is only torture for me .
My two boys are on the frightful Somme front -- and Shirley pores day and night over aviation literature and says nothing .
But I see the purpose growing in his eyes .
"No , I can not rest -- do n't ask it of me , Gilbert . ''"
But the doctor was inexorable .
"`` I ca n't let you kill yourself , Anne-girl , '' he said ."
`` When the boys come back I want a mother here to welcome them .
"Why , you 're getting transparent ."
It wo n't do -- ask Susan there if it will do . ''
"Well , the youngest Twin Sailor sailed along the moonglade till he came right up to the moon , and there was a little golden door in the moon and he opened it and sailed right through ."
He had some wonderful adventures in the moon but it would make this letter too long to tell them . ' ''
` Then there is the Golden Lady of the cave .
One day I found a big cave down on the shore and I went away in and after a while I found the Golden Lady .
She has golden hair right down to her feet and her dress is all glittering and glistening like gold that is alive .
And she has a golden harp and plays on it all day long ... you can hear the music any time along shore if you listen carefully but most people would think it was only the wind among the rocks .
I 've never told Nora about the Golden Lady .
I was afraid it might hurt her feelings .
It even hurt her feelings if I talked too long with the Twin Sailors . ' '' '
I always met the Twin Sailors at the Striped Rocks .
The youngest Twin Sailor is very good-tempered but the oldest Twin Sailor can look dreadfully fierce at times .
I have my suspicions about that oldest Twin .
I believe he 'd be a pirate if he dared .
There 's really something very mysterious about him .
He swore once and I told him if he ever did it again he need n't come ashore to talk to me because I 'd promised grandmother I 'd never associate with anybody that swore .
"He was pretty well scared , I can tell you , and he said if I would forgive him he would take me to the sunset ."
So the next evening when I was sitting on the Striped Rocks the oldest Twin came sailing over the sea in an enchanted boat and I got in her .
"The boat was all pearly and rainbowy , like the inside of the mussel shells , and her sail was like moonshine ."
"Well , we sailed right across to the sunset ."
"Think of that , teacher , I 've been in the sunset ."
And what do you suppose it is ?
The sunset is a land all flowers .
"We sailed into a great garden , and the clouds are beds of flowers ."
"We sailed into a great harbor , all the color of gold , and I stepped right out of the boat on a big meadow all covered with buttercups as big as roses ."
I stayed there for ever so long .
It seemed nearly a year but the Oldest Twin says it was only a few minutes .
"You see , in the sunset land the time is ever so much longer than it is here . ' ''"
` Your loving pupil Paul Irving . ' ''
"` P. S. of course , this letter is n't really true , teacher ."
"P.I. ' '' XII A Jonah Day It really began the night before with a restless , wakeful vigil of grumbling toothache ."
"When Anne arose in the dull , bitter winter morning she felt that life was flat , stale , and unprofitable ."
She went to school in no angelic mood .
I 'll tell you what I think of this : I think it handsome .
"And if you think as I do , you 'll give a good sea-cheer for the gentleman that does it . ''"
The cheer followed -- that was a matter of course ; but it rang out so full and hearty that I confess I could hardly believe these same men were plotting for our blood .
"`` One more cheer for Cap'n Smollett , '' cried Long John when the first had subsided ."
And this also was given with a will .
"On the top of that the three gentlemen went below , and not long after , word was sent forward that Jim Hawkins was wanted in the cabin ."
"I found them all three seated round the table , a bottle of Spanish wine and some raisins before them , and the doctor smoking away , with his wig on his lap , and that , I knew , was a sign that he was agitated ."
"The stern window was open , for it was a warm night , and you could see the moon shining behind on the ship 's wake ."
"`` Now , Hawkins , '' said the squire , `` you have something to say ."
Speak up . ''
"I did as I was bid , and as short as I could make it , told the whole details of Silver 's conversation ."
"Nobody interrupted me till I was done , nor did any one of the three of them make so much as a movement , but they kept their eyes upon my face from first to last ."
"`` Jim , '' said Dr. Livesey , `` take a seat . ''"
"And they made me sit down at table beside them , poured me out a glass of wine , filled my hands with raisins , and all three , one after the other , and each with a bow , drank my good health , and their service to me , for my luck and courage ."
"`` Now , captain , '' said the squire , `` you were right , and I was wrong ."
"I own myself an ass , and I await your orders . ''"
"`` No more an ass than I , sir , '' returned the captain ."
"`` I never heard of a crew that meant to mutiny but what showed signs before , for any man that had an eye in his head to see the mischief and take steps according ."
"But this crew , '' he added , `` beats me . ''"
"`` Captain , '' said the doctor , `` with your permission , that 's Silver ."
A very remarkable man . ''
"`` He 'd look remarkably well from a yard-arm , sir , '' returned the captain ."
`` But this is talk ; this do n't lead to anything .
"I see three or four points , and with Mr. Trelawney 's permission , I 'll name them . ''"
"`` You , sir , are the captain ."
"It is for you to speak , '' says Mr. Trelawney grandly ."
"`` First point , '' began Mr. Smollett ."
"`` We must go on , because we ca n't turn back ."
"If I gave the word to go about , they would rise at once ."
"Second point , we have time before us -- at least until this treasure 's found ."
"Third point , there are faithful hands ."
"Now , sir , it 's got to come to blows sooner or later , and what I propose is to take time by the forelock , as the saying is , and come to blows some fine day when they least expect it ."
"When she reached the yard at Green Gables Mrs. Lynde 's loud , decided tones floated out through the open kitchen window ."
"`` Mrs. Lynde has come up to give me good advice about tomorrow , '' thought Anne with a grimace , `` but I do n't believe I 'll go in ."
"Her advice is much like pepper , I think ... excellent in small quantities but rather scorching in her doses ."
I 'll run over and have a chat with Mr. Harrison instead . ''
This was not the first time Anne had run over and chatted with Mr. Harrison since the notable affair of the Jersey cow .
"She had been there several evenings and Mr. Harrison and she were very good friends , although there were times and seasons when Anne found the outspokenness on which he prided himself rather trying ."
"Ginger still continued to regard her with suspicion , and never failed to greet her sarcastically as `` redheaded snippet . ''"
"Mr. Harrison had tried vainly to break him of the habit by jumping excitedly up whenever he saw Anne coming and exclaiming , `` Bless my soul , here 's that pretty little girl again , '' or something equally flattering ."
But Ginger saw through the scheme and scorned it .
Anne was never to know how many compliments Mr. Harrison paid her behind her back .
He certainly never paid her any to her face .
"`` Well , I suppose you 've been back in the woods laying in a supply of switches for tomorrow ? ''"
was his greeting as Anne came up the veranda steps .
"`` No , indeed , '' said Anne indignantly ."
She was an excellent target for teasing because she always took things so seriously .
"`` I shall never have a switch in my school , Mr. Harrison ."
"Of course , I shall have to have a pointer , but I shall use it for pointing ONLY . ''"
`` So you mean to strap them instead ?
"Well , I do n't know but you 're right ."
"A switch stings more at the time but the strap smarts longer , that 's a fact . ''"
`` I shall not use anything of the sort .
I 'm not going to whip my pupils . ''
"`` Bless my soul , '' exclaimed Mr. Harrison in genuine astonishment , `` how do you lay out to keep order then ? ''"
"`` I shall govern by affection , Mr. Harrison . ''"
"`` It wo n't do , '' said Mr. Harrison , `` wo n't do at all , Anne ."
` Spare the rod and spoil the child . '
When I went to school the master whipped me regular every day because he said if I was n't in mischief just then I was plotting it . ''
"`` Methods have changed since your schooldays , Mr. Harrison . ''"
`` But human nature has n't .
"Mark my words , you 'll never manage the young fry unless you keep a rod in pickle for them ."
The thing is impossible . ''
"`` Well , I 'm going to try my way first , '' said Anne , who had a fairly strong will of her own and was apt to cling very tenaciously to her theories ."
We were swept down ; the shot fell thick among us ; I have not seen one man in my own colours since I saw three fall .
"For myself , I came sound to Shoreby , and being mindful of the Black Arrow , got me this gown and bell , and came softly by the path for the Moat House ."
There is no disguise to be compared with it ; the jingle of this bell would scare me the stoutest outlaw in the forest ; they would all turn pale to hear it .
At length I came by you and Matcham .
"I could see but evilly through this same hood , and was not sure of you , being chiefly , and for many a good cause , astonished at the finding you together ."
"Moreover , in the open , where I had to go slowly and tap with my staff , I feared to disclose myself ."
"But see , '' he added , `` this poor shrew begins a little to revive ."
A little good canary will comfort me the heart of it . ''
"The knight , from under his long dress , produced a stout bottle , and began to rub the temples and wet the lips of the patient , who returned gradually to consciousness , and began to roll dim eyes from one to another ."
"`` What cheer , Jack ! ''"
said Dick .
"`` It was no leper , after all ; it was Sir Daniel !"
See ! ''
"`` Swallow me a good draught of this , '' said the knight ."
`` This will give you manhood .
"Thereafter , I will give you both a meal , and we shall all three on to Tunstall ."
"For , Dick , '' he continued , laying forth bread and meat upon the grass , `` I will avow to you , in all good conscience , it irks me sorely to be safe between four walls ."
"Not since I backed a horse have I been pressed so hard ; peril of life , jeopardy of land and livelihood , and to sum up , all these losels in the wood to hunt me down ."
But I be not yet shent .
Some of my lads will pick me their way home .
"Hatch hath ten fellows ; Selden , he had six ."
"Nay , we shall soon be strong again ; and if I can but buy my peace with my right fortunate and undeserving Lord of York , why , Dick , we 'll be a man again and go a-horseback ! ''"
"And so saying , the knight filled himself a horn of canary , and pledged his ward in dumb show ."
"`` Selden , '' Dick faltered -- `` Selden '' -- And he paused again ."
Sir Daniel put down the wine untasted .
`` How ! ''
"he cried , in a changed voice ."
`` Selden ?
Speak !
What of Selden ? ''
Dick stammered forth the tale of the ambush and the massacre .
"The knight heard in silence ; but as he listened , his countenance became convulsed with rage and grief ."
That pie was a strong argument for Isaac .
I thought a man who had to live on such cookery did indeed need a wife and might be pardoned for taking desperate measures to get one .
I was dreadfully tired of broiling on the roof anyhow .
But it was the thunderstorm that decided me .
"When I saw it coming up , black and quick , from the northwest , I gave in at once ."
I had endured a good deal and was prepared to endure more ; but I had paid ten dollars for my hat and I was not going to have it ruined by a thunderstorm .
I called to Isaac and out he came .
"`` If you will let us down and promise to dispose of that dog before I come here I will marry you , Isaac , '' I said , `` but I 'll make you sorry for it afterwards , though . ''"
"`` I 'll take the risk of that , Anne , '' he said ; `` and , of course , I 'll sell the dog ."
I wo n't need him when I have you . ''
"Isaac meant to be complimentary , though you might n't have thought so if you had seen the face of that dog ."
"Isaac ordered Julius Caesar away and put up the ladder , and turned his back , real considerately , while we climbed down ."
We had to go in his house and stay till the shower was over .
I did n't forget the object of our call and I produced our subscription list at once .
`` How much have you got ? ''
asked Isaac .
"`` Seventy dollars and we want a hundred and fifty , '' I said ."
"`` You may put me down for the remaining eighty , then , '' said Isaac calmly ."
"The Applebys are never mean where money is concerned , I must say ."
"Isaac offered to drive us home when it cleared up , but I said `` No . ''"
I wanted to settle Melissa before she got a chance to talk .
"On the way home I said to her : `` I hope you wo n't mention this to anyone , Melissa ."
"I do n't mind marrying Isaac , but I do n't want people to know how it came about . ''"
"`` Oh , I wo n't say anything about it , '' said Melissa , laughing a little disagreeably ."
"`` Because , '' I said , to clinch the matter , looking significantly at her front hair as I said it , `` I have something to tell , too . ''"
Melissa will hold her tongue .
"By the Rule of Contrary `` Look here , Burton , '' said old John Ellis in an ominous tone of voice , `` I want to know if what that old busybody of a Mary Keane came here today gossiping about is true ."
"If it is -- well , I 've something to say about the matter !"
Have you been courting that niece of Susan Oliver 's all summer on the sly ? ''
"Burton Ellis 's handsome , boyish face flushed darkly crimson to the roots of his curly black hair ."
Something in the father 's tone roused anger and rebellion in the son .
"He straightened himself up from the turnip row he was hoeing , looked his father squarely in the face , and said quietly , `` Not on the sly , sir , I never do things that way ."
It did not occur to him to wonder why it should please him .
If he had hunted that feeling down he might have been surprised to discover that it had its origin in a curious gratification over the thought that the woman who lived with Lynde had a certain refinement about her .
He preferred her unsmiling dourness to vulgar garrulity .
`` Are you the young minister up at Rexton ? ''
she asked bluntly .
`` Yes . ''
`` I thought so .
Lynde said she had seen you on the shore once .
Well '' -- she cast an uncertain glance over her shoulder at the house -- `` I 'm much obliged to you . ''
"Alan had an idea that that was not what she had thought of saying , but as she had turned aside and was busying herself with the pails , there seemed nothing for him to do but to go ."
`` Wait a moment . ''
"She faced him again , and if Alan had been a vain man he might have thought that admiration looked from her piercing eyes ."
`` What do you think of us ?
I suppose they 've told you tales of us up there ? ''
-- with a scornful gesture of her hand in the direction of Rexton .
`` Do you believe them ? ''
"`` I believe no ill of anyone until I have absolute proof of it , '' said Alan , smiling -- he was quite unconscious what a winning smile he had , which was the best of it -- `` and I never put faith in gossip ."
Of course you are gossipped about -- you know that . ''
"`` Yes , I know it '' -- grimly -- `` and I do n't care what they say about the Captain and me ."
We are a queer pair -- just as queer as they make us out .
"You can believe what you like about us , but do n't you believe a word they say against Lynde ."
She 's sweet and good and beautiful .
It 's not her fault that she never went to church -- it 's her father 's .
Do n't you hold that against her . ''
The fierce yet repressed energy of her tone prevented Alan from feeling any amusement over her simple defence of Lynde .
"Moreover , it sounded unreasonably sweet in his ears ."
"`` I wo n't , '' he promised , `` but I do n't suppose it would matter much to Miss Oliver if I did ."
She did not strike me as a young lady who would worry very much about other people 's opinions . ''
"If his object were to prolong the conversation about Lynde , he was disappointed , for the old woman had turned abruptly to her work again and , though Alan lingered for a few moments longer , she took no further notice of him ."
But when he had gone she peered stealthily after him from the door until he was lost to sight among the pines .
"`` A well-looking man , '' she muttered ."
`` I wish Lynde had been home .
I do n't believe in whipping children MUCH .
"I think , as you say , Anne , that there are better ways of managing as a rule , and that corporal punishment should be a last resort ."
"But on the other hand , as Jane says , I believe there is an occasional child who ca n't be influenced in any other way and who , in short , needs a whipping and would be improved by it ."
Corporal punishment as a last resort is to be my rule . ''
"Gilbert , having tried to please both sides , succeeded , as is usual and eminently right , in pleasing neither ."
Jane tossed her head .
`` I 'll whip my pupils when they 're naughty .
It 's the shortest and easiest way of convincing them . ''
Anne gave Gilbert a disappointed glance .
"`` I shall never whip a child , '' she repeated firmly ."
`` I feel sure it is n't either right or necessary . ''
`` Suppose a boy sauced you back when you told him to do something ? ''
said Jane .
"`` I 'd keep him in after school and talk kindly and firmly to him , '' said Anne ."
`` There is some good in every person if you can find it .
It is a teacher 's duty to find and develop it .
"That is what our School Management professor at Queen 's told us , you know ."
Do you suppose you could find any good in a child by whipping him ?
"It 's far more important to influence the children aright than it is even to teach them the three R 's , Professor Rennie says . ''"
"`` But the Inspector examines them in the three R 's , mind you , and he wo n't give you a good report if they do n't come up to his standard , '' protested Jane ."
"`` I 'd rather have my pupils love me and look back to me in after years as a real helper than be on the roll of honor , '' asserted Anne decidedly ."
"`` Would n't you punish children at all , when they misbehaved ? ''"
asked Gilbert .
"`` Oh , yes , I suppose I shall have to , although I know I 'll hate to do it ."
But you can keep them in at recess or stand them on the floor or give them lines to write . ''
`` I suppose you wo n't punish the girls by making them sit with the boys ? ''
said Jane slyly .
Gilbert and Anne looked at each other and smiled rather foolishly .
"Once upon a time , Anne had been made to sit with Gilbert for punishment and sad and bitter had been the consequences thereof ."
"`` Well , time will tell which is the best way , '' said Jane philosophically as they parted ."
"Anne went back to Green Gables by way of Birch Path , shadowy , rustling , fern-scented , through Violet Vale and past Willowmere , where dark and light kissed each other under the firs , and down through Lover 's Lane ... spots she and Diana had so named long ago ."
"She walked slowly , enjoying the sweetness of wood and field and the starry summer twilight , and thinking soberly about the new duties she was to take up on the morrow ."
I do n't see the good of being so awful clean .
It 's lots more comfable being dirty . ''
"`` Paul Irving washes his face every day of his own accord , '' said Anne astutely ."
"Davy had been an inmate of Green Gables for little over forty-eight hours ; but he already worshipped Anne and hated Paul Irving , whom he had heard Anne praising enthusiastically the day after his arrival ."
"If Paul Irving washed his face every day , that settled it ."
"He , Davy Keith , would do it too , if it killed him ."
"The same consideration induced him to submit meekly to the other details of his toilet , and he was really a handsome little lad when all was done ."
Anne felt an almost maternal pride in him as she led him into the old Cuthbert pew .
"Davy behaved quite well at first , being occupied in casting covert glances at all the small boys within view and wondering which was Paul Irving ."
The first two hymns and the Scripture reading passed off uneventfully .
Mr. Allan was praying when the sensation came .
"Lauretta White was sitting in front of Davy , her head slightly bent and her fair hair hanging in two long braids , between which a tempting expanse of white neck showed , encased in a loose lace frill ."
"Lauretta was a fat , placid-looking child of eight , who had conducted herself irreproachably in church from the very first day her mother carried her there , an infant of six months ."
"Davy thrust his hand into his pocket and produced ... a caterpillar , a furry , squirming caterpillar ."
Marilla saw and clutched at him but she was too late .
Davy dropped the caterpillar down Lauretta 's neck .
Right into the middle of Mr. Allan 's prayer burst a series of piercing shrieks .
The minister stopped appalled and opened his eyes .
Every head in the congregation flew up .
"Lauretta White was dancing up and down in her pew , clutching frantically at the back of her dress ."
"`` Ow ... mommer ... mommer ... ow ... take it off ... ow ... get it out ... ow ... that bad boy put it down my neck ... ow ... mommer ... it 's going further down ... ow ... ow ... ow ... '' Mrs. White rose and with a set face carried the hysterical , writhing Lauretta out of church ."
Her shrieks died away in the distance and Mr. Allan proceeded with the service .
But everybody felt that it was a failure that day .
For the first time in her life Marilla took no notice of the text and Anne sat with scarlet cheeks of mortification .
When they got home Marilla put Davy to bed and made him stay there for the rest of the day .
She would not give him any dinner but allowed him a plain tea of bread and milk .
Anne carried it to him and sat sorrowfully by him while he ate it with an unrepentant relish .
But Anne 's mournful eyes troubled him .
"`` I s ` pose , '' he said reflectively , `` that Paul Irving would n't have dropped a caterpillar down a girl 's neck in church , would he ? ''"
"`` Indeed he would n't , '' said Anne sadly ."
"`` Well , I 'm kind of sorry I did it , then , '' conceded Davy ."
`` But it was such a jolly big caterpillar ... I picked him up on the church steps just as we went in .
But Ginger 's feelings had been grievously hurt and he rejected all overtures of friendship .
He sat moodily on his perch and ruffled his feathers up until he looked like a mere ball of green and gold .
`` Why do you call him Ginger ? ''
"asked Anne , who liked appropriate names and thought Ginger accorded not at all with such gorgeous plumage ."
`` My brother the sailor named him .
Maybe it had some reference to his temper .
I think a lot of that bird though ... you 'd be surprised if you knew how much .
He has his faults of course .
That bird has cost me a good deal one way and another .
Some people object to his swearing habits but he ca n't be broken of them .
I 've tried ... other people have tried .
Some folks have prejudices against parrots .
"Silly , ai n't it ?"
I like them myself .
Ginger 's a lot of company to me .
"Nothing would induce me to give that bird up ... nothing in the world , miss . ''"
Mr. Harrison flung the last sentence at Anne as explosively as if he suspected her of some latent design of persuading him to give Ginger up .
"Anne , however , was beginning to like the queer , fussy , fidgety little man , and before the meal was over they were quite good friends ."
Mr. Harrison found out about the Improvement Society and was disposed to approve of it .
`` That 's right .
Go ahead .
There 's lots of room for improvement in this settlement ... and in the people too . ''
"`` Oh , I do n't know , '' flashed Anne ."
"To herself , or to her particular cronies , she might admit that there were some small imperfections , easily removable , in Avonlea and its inhabitants ."
But to hear a practical outsider like Mr. Harrison saying it was an entirely different thing .
"`` I think Avonlea is a lovely place ; and the people in it are very nice , too . ''"
"`` I guess you 've got a spice of temper , '' commented Mr. Harrison , surveying the flushed cheeks and indignant eyes opposite him ."
"`` It goes with hair like yours , I reckon ."
Avonlea is a pretty decent place or I would n't have located here ; but I suppose even you will admit that it has SOME faults ? ''
"`` I like it all the better for them , '' said loyal Anne ."
`` I do n't like places or people either that have n't any faults .
I think a truly perfect person would be very uninteresting .
"`` Silver , '' said the other man -- and I observed he was not only red in the face , but spoke as hoarse as a crow , and his voice shook too , like a taut rope -- `` Silver , '' says he , `` you 're old , and you 're honest , or has the name for it ; and you 've money too , which lots of poor sailors has n't ; and you 're brave , or I 'm mistook ."
And will you tell me you 'll let yourself be led away with that kind of a mess of swabs ?
Not you !
"As sure as God sees me , I 'd sooner lose my hand ."
If I turn agin my dooty -- '' And then all of a sudden he was interrupted by a noise .
"I had found one of the honest hands -- well , here , at that same moment , came news of another ."
"Far away out in the marsh there arose , all of a sudden , a sound like the cry of anger , then another on the back of it ; and then one horrid , long-drawn scream ."
"The rocks of the Spy-glass re-echoed it a score of times ; the whole troop of marsh-birds rose again , darkening heaven , with a simultaneous whirr ; and long after that death yell was still ringing in my brain , silence had re-established its empire , and only the rustle of the redescending birds and the boom of the distant surges disturbed the languor of the afternoon ."
"Tom had leaped at the sound , like a horse at the spur , but Silver had not winked an eye ."
"He stood where he was , resting lightly on his crutch , watching his companion like a snake about to spring ."
`` John ! ''
"said the sailor , stretching out his hand ."
`` Hands off ! ''
"cried Silver , leaping back a yard , as it seemed to me , with the speed and security of a trained gymnast ."
"`` Hands off , if you like , John Silver , '' said the other ."
`` It 's a black conscience that can make you feared of me .
"But in heaven 's name , tell me , what was that ? ''"
`` That ? ''
"returned Silver , smiling away , but warier than ever , his eye a mere pin-point in his big face , but gleaming like a crumb of glass ."
`` That ?
"Oh , I reckon that 'll be Alan . ''"
And at this point Tom flashed out like a hero .
`` Alan ! ''
he cried .
`` Then rest his soul for a true seaman !
"And as for you , John Silver , long you 've been a mate of mine , but you 're mate of mine no more ."
"If I die like a dog , I 'll die in my dooty ."
"You 've killed Alan , have you ?"
"Kill me too , if you can ."
But I defies you . ''
"And with that , this brave fellow turned his back directly on the cook and set off walking for the beach ."
But he was not destined to go far .
He felt an instinctive reluctance to discuss Lynde Oliver with Isabel King .
"`` I saw her only for a moment , '' he said coldly , `` but she impressed me as being a beautiful woman . ''"
"`` They tell queer stories about her -- but maybe they 're not all true , '' said Isabel , unable to keep the sneer of malice out of her voice ."
At that moment Alan 's secret contempt for her crystallized into pronounced aversion .
He made no reply and they went the rest of the way in silence .
"At her gate Isabel said , `` You have n't been over to see us very lately , Mr. Douglas . ''"
"`` My congregation is a large one and I can not visit all my people as often as I might wish , '' Alan answered , all the more coldly for the personal note in her tone ."
"`` A minister 's time is not his own , you know . ''"
`` Shall you be going to see the Olivers ? ''
asked Isabel bluntly .
`` I have not considered that question .
"Good-night , Miss King . ''"
On his way back to the manse Alan did consider the question .
Should he make any attempt to establish friendly relations with the residents of Four Winds ?
"It surprised him to find how much he wanted to , but he finally concluded that he would not ."
They were not adherents of his church and he did not believe that even a minister had any right to force himself upon people who plainly wished to be let alone .
"When he got home , although it was late , he went to his study and began work on a new text -- for Elder Trewin 's seemed utterly out of the question ."
Even with the new one he did not get on very well .
At last in exasperation he leaned back in his chair .
Why ca n't I stop thinking of those Four Winds people ?
"Here , let me put these haunting thoughts into words and see if that will lay them ."
That girl had a beautiful face but a cold one .
Would I like to see it lighted up with the warmth of her soul set free ?
"Yes , frankly , I would ."
She looked upon me with indifference .
Would I like to see her welcome me as a friend ?
"I have a conviction that I would , although no doubt everybody in my congregation would look upon her as a most unsuitable friend for me ."
"Do I believe that she is wild , unwomanly , heathenish , as Mrs. Danby says ?"
"No , I do not , most emphatically ."
"I believe she is a lady in the truest sense of that much abused word , though she is doubtless unconventional ."
"Having said all this , I do not see what more there is to be said ."
And -- I -- am -- going -- to -- write -- this -- sermon .
Look to it : he that is last at the lych-gate Sir Daniel shall reward .
Look to it right well !
I know you for a man of naught .
"Nance , '' he added , to one of the women , `` is old Appleyard up town ? ''"
"`` I 'll warrant you , '' replied the woman ."
"`` In his field , for sure . ''"
"So the group dispersed , and while Clipsby walked leisurely over the bridge , Bennet and young Shelton rode up the road together , through the village and past the church ."
"`` Ye will see the old shrew , '' said Bennet ."
`` He will waste more time grumbling and prating of Harry the Fift than would serve a man to shoe a horse .
And all because he has been to the French wars ! ''
"The house to which they were bound was the last in the village , standing alone among lilacs ; and beyond it , on three sides , there was open meadow rising towards the borders of the wood ."
"Hatch dismounted , threw his rein over the fence , and walked down the field , Dick keeping close at his elbow , to where the old soldier was digging , knee-deep in his cabbages , and now and again , in a cracked voice , singing a snatch of song ."
"He was all dressed in leather , only his hood and tippet were of black frieze , and tied with scarlet ; his face was like a walnut-shell , both for colour and wrinkles ; but his old grey eye was still clear enough , and his sight unabated ."
"Perhaps he was deaf ; perhaps he thought it unworthy of an old archer of Agincourt to pay any heed to such disturbances ; but neither the surly notes of the alarm bell , nor the near approach of Bennet and the lad , appeared at all to move him ; and he continued obstinately digging , and piped up , very thin and shaky : `` Now , dear lady , if thy will be , I pray you that you will rue on me . ''"
"`` Nick Appleyard , '' said Hatch , `` Sir Oliver commends him to you , and bids that ye shall come within this hour to the Moat House , there to take command . ''"
The old fellow looked up .
"`` Save you , my masters ! ''"
"he said , grinning ."
`` And where goeth Master Hatch ? ''
"`` Master Hatch is off to Kettley , with every man that we can horse , '' returned Bennet ."
"`` There is a fight toward , it seems , and my lord stays a reinforcement . ''"
"`` Ay , verily , '' returned Appleyard ."
`` And what will ye leave me to garrison withal ? ''
"`` I leave you six good men , and Sir Oliver to boot , '' answered Hatch ."
"`` It 'll not hold the place , '' said Appleyard ; `` the number sufficeth not ."
It would take two score to make it good . ''
"`` Why , it 's for that we came to you , old shrew ! ''"
replied the other .
`` Who else is there but you that could do aught in such a house with such a garrison ? ''
`` Ay !
"when the pinch comes , ye remember the old shoe , '' returned Nick ."
`` There is not a man of you can back a horse or hold a bill ; and as for archery -- St. Michael !
He was so bright and nice-mannered everybody liked him .
"Him and Anne were a fine-looking couple , Nora May ."
Not but what they had their shortcomings .
Anne 's nose was a mite too long and Gil had a crooked mouth .
"Besides , they was both pretty proud and sperrited and high-strung ."
But they thought an awful lot of each other .
It made me feel young again to see 'em .
"Anne was n't a mossel vain , but nights she expected Gil she 'd prink for hours afore her glass , fixing her hair this way and that , and trying on all her good clothes to see which become her most ."
I used to love her for it .
And I used to love to see the way Gil 's face would light up when she came into a room or place where he was .
"Amanda Perkins , she says to me once , `` Anne Douglas and Gil Martin are most terrible struck on each other . ''"
And she said it in a tone that indicated that it was a dreadful disgraceful and unbecoming state of affairs .
Amanda had a disappointment once and it soured her .
"I immediately responded , `` Yes , they are most terrible struck on each other , '' and I said it in a tone that indicated I thought it a most beautiful and lovely thing that they should be so ."
And so it was .
"You 're rather too young to be thinking of such things , Nora May , but you 'll remember my words when the time comes ."
"Another nephew of mine , James Ebenezer Lawson -- he calls himself James E. back there in town , and I do n't blame him , for I never could stand Ebenezer for a name myself ; but that 's neither here nor there ."
"Well , he said their love was idyllic , I ai n't very sure what that means ."
I looked it up in the dictionary after James Ebenezer left -- I would n't display my ignorance afore him -- but I ca n't say that I was much the wiser for it .
"Anyway , it meant something real nice ; I was sure of that by the way James Ebenezer spoke and the wistful look in his eyes ."
"James Ebenezer is n't married ; he was to have been , and she died a month afore the wedding day ."
He was never the same man again .
"Well , to get back to Gilbert and Anne ."
When Anne 's school year ended in June she resigned and went home to get ready to be married .
"The wedding was to be in September , and I promised Anne faithful I 'd go over to Montrose in August for two weeks and help her to get her quilts ready ."
Anne thought that nobody could quilt like me .
"I was as tickled as a girl at the thought of visiting with Anne for two weeks , but I never went ; things happened before August ."
I do n't know rightly how the trouble began .
Other folks -- jealous folks -- made mischief .
Anne was thirty miles away and Gilbert could n't see her every day to keep matters clear and fair .
"Besides , as I 've said , they were both proud and high-sperrited ."
The upshot of it was they had a terrible quarrel and the engagement was broken .
The next Saturday Anne and Diana started out .
"They drove to the end of the road and canvassed homeward , calling first on the `` Andrew girls . ''"
"`` If Catherine is alone we may get something , '' said Diana , `` but if Eliza is there we wo n't . ''"
Eliza was there ... very much so ... and looked even grimmer than usual .
"Miss Eliza was one of those people who give you the impression that life is indeed a vale of tears , and that a smile , never to speak of a laugh , is a waste of nervous energy truly reprehensible ."
The Andrew girls had been `` girls '' for fifty odd years and seemed likely to remain girls to the end of their earthly pilgrimage .
"Catherine , it was said , had not entirely given up hope , but Eliza , who was born a pessimist , had never had any ."
They lived in a little brown house built in a sunny corner scooped out of Mark Andrew 's beech woods .
"Eliza complained that it was terrible hot in summer , but Catherine was wont to say it was lovely and warm in winter ."
"Eliza was sewing patchwork , not because it was needed but simply as a protest against the frivolous lace Catherine was crocheting ."
"Eliza listened with a frown and Catherine with a smile , as the girls explained their errand ."
"To be sure , whenever Catherine caught Eliza 's eye she discarded the smile in guilty confusion ; but it crept back the next moment ."
"`` If I had money to waste , '' said Eliza grimly , `` I 'd burn it up and have the fun of seeing a blaze maybe ; but I would n't give it to that hall , not a cent ."
It 's no benefit to the settlement ... just a place for young folks to meet and carry on when they 's better be home in their beds . ''
"`` Oh , Eliza , young folks must have some amusement , '' protested Catherine ."
`` I do n't see the necessity .
"We did n't gad about to halls and places when we were young , Catherine Andrews ."
This world is getting worse every day . ''
"`` I think it 's getting better , '' said Catherine firmly ."
`` YOU think ! ''
Miss Eliza 's voice expressed the utmost contempt .
"`` It does n't signify what you THINK , Catherine Andrews ."
Facts is facts . ''
"`` Well , I always like to look on the bright side , Eliza . ''"
`` There is n't any bright side . ''
"`` Oh , indeed there is , '' cried Anne , who could n't endure such heresy in silence ."
"`` Why , there are ever so many bright sides , Miss Andrews ."
It 's really a beautiful world . ''
"`` You wo n't have such a high opinion of it when you 've lived as long in it as I have , '' retorted Miss Eliza sourly , `` and you wo n't be so enthusiastic about improving it either ."
"How is your mother , Diana ?"
"Dear me , but she has failed of late ."
She looks terrible run down .
said the grocer ' I gave an old woman some coffee for the book .
If you like to give me twopence you can have the rest . '
"` Yes , ' said the student , ` give me the book instead of the cheese ."
I can eat my bread without cheese .
It would be a shame to leave the book to be torn up .
"You are a clever and practical man , but about poetry you understand as much as that old tub over there ! '"
"And that sounded rude as far as the tub was concerned , but the grocer laughed , and so did the student ."
It was only said in fun .
But the Goblin was angry that anyone should dare to say such a thing to a grocer who owned the house and sold the best butter .
"When it was night and the shop was shut , and everyone was in bed except the student , the Goblin went upstairs and took the grocer 's wife 's tongue ."
"She did not use it when she was asleep , and on whatever object in the room he put it that thing began to speak , and spoke out its thoughts and feelings just as well as the lady to whom it belonged ."
"But only one thing at a time could use it , and that was a good thing , or they would have all spoken together ."
The Goblin laid the tongue on the tub in which were the old newspapers .
"` Is it true , ' he asked , ' that you know nothing about poetry ? '"
` Certainly not ! '
answered the tub .
"` Poetry is something that is in the papers , and that is frequently cut out ."
"I have a great deal more in me than the student has , and yet I am only a small tub in the grocer 's shop . '"
"And the Goblin put the tongue on the coffee-mill , and how it began to grind !"
"He put it on the butter-cask , and on the till , and all were of the same opinion as the waste-paper tub ."
and one must believe the majority .
` Now I will tell the student ! '
and with these words he crept softly up the stairs to the attic where the student lived .
"There was a light burning , and the Goblin peeped through the key-hole and saw that he was reading the torn book that he had bought in the shop ."
But how bright it was !
Out of the book shot a streak of light which grew into a large tree and spread its branches far above the student .
"Every leaf was alive , and every flower was a beautiful girl 's head , some with dark and shining eyes , others with wonderful blue ones ."
"Every fruit was a glittering star , and there was a marvellous music in the student 's room ."
"The little Goblin had never even dreamt of such a splendid sight , much less seen it ."
"He stood on tiptoe gazing and gazing , till the candle in the attic was put out ; the student had blown it out and had gone to bed , but the Goblin remained standing outside listening to the music , which very softly and sweetly was now singing the student a lullaby . '"
I have never seen anything like this ! '
said the Goblin . '
"`` Wake me up when she comes , '' said rob , and was fast asleep in five minutes with his head in Nan 's lap under the pinafore ."
"The little girl sat for some fifteen minutes , staring about her with anxious eyes , and feeling as if each second was an hour ."
"Then a pale light began to glimmer over the hill-top and she said to herself , `` I guess the night is over and morning is coming ."
"I 'd like to see the sun rise , so I 'll watch , and when it comes up we can find our way right home . ''"
"But before the moon 's round face peeped above the hill to destroy her hope , Nan had fallen asleep , leaning back in a little bower of tall ferns , and was deep in a mid-summer night 's dream of fire-flies and blue aprons , mountains of huckleberries , and Robby wiping away the tears of a black cow , who sobbed , `` I want to go home !"
I want to go home ! ''
"While the children were sleeping , peacefully lulled by the drowsy hum of many neighborly mosquitoes , the family at home were in a great state of agitation ."
"The hay-cart came at five , and all but Jack , Emil , Nan , and Rob were at the bars ready for it ."
"Franz drove instead of Silas , and when the boys told him that the others were going home through the wood , he said , looking ill-pleased , `` They ought to have left Rob to ride , he will be tired out by the long walk . ''"
"`` It 's shorter that way , and they will carry him , '' said Stuffy , who was in a hurry for his supper ."
`` You are sure Nan and Rob went with them ? ''
"`` Of course they did ; I saw them getting over the wall , and sung out that it was most five , and Jack called back that they were going the other way , '' explained Tommy ."
"`` Very well , pile in then , '' and away rattled the hay-cart with the tired children and the full pails ."
"Mrs. Jo looked sober when she heard of the division of the party , and sent Franz back with Toby to find and bring the little ones home ."
"Supper was over , and the family sitting about in the cool hall as usual , when Franz came trotting back , hot , dusty , and anxious ."
`` Have they come ? ''
he called out when half-way up the avenue .
`` No ! ''
and Mrs. Jo flew out of her chair looking so alarmed that every one jumped up and gathered round Franz .
"`` I ca n't find them anywhere , '' he began ; but the words were hardly spoken when a loud `` Hullo ! ''"
"startled them all , and the next minute Jack and Emil came round the house ."
`` Where are Nan and Rob ? ''
"cried Mrs. Jo , clutching Emil in a way that caused him to think his aunt had suddenly lost her wits ."
`` I do n't know .
"They came home with the others , did n't they ? ''"
"he answered , quickly ."
`` No ; George and Tommy said they went with you . ''
"`` Well , they did n't ."
Have n't seen them .
"We took a swim in the pond , and came by the wood , '' said Jack , looking alarmed , as well he might ."
"`` Call Mr. Bhaer , get the lanterns , and tell Silas I want him . ''"
"That was all Mrs. Jo said , but they knew what she meant , and flew to obey her orders ."
I must not even come here any more .
You understand that ? ''
`` Yes . ''
There was an unconscious revelation in the girl 's mournful eyes as she turned them on Alan .
It thrilled him to the core of his being .
She loved him .
"If it were not for that empty marriage form , he could win her , but the knowledge was only an added mocking torment ."
Alan had not known a man could endure such misery and live .
A score of wild questions rushed to his lips but he crushed them back for Lynde 's sake and held out his hand .
"`` Good-bye , dear , '' he said almost steadily , daring to say no more lest he should say too much ."
"`` Good-bye , '' Lynde answered faintly ."
When he had gone she flung herself down on the moss by the spring and lay there in an utter abandonment of misery and desolation .
Pain and indignation struggled for mastery in Alan 's stormy soul as he walked homeward .
So this was Captain Anthony 's doings !
He had sacrificed his daughter to some crime of his dubious past .
Alan never dreamed of blaming Lynde for having kept her marriage a secret ; he put the blame where it belonged -- on the Captain 's shoulders .
Captain Anthony had never warned him by so much as a hint that Lynde was not free to be won .
It had all probably seemed a good joke to him .
Alan thought the furtive amusement he had so often detected in the Captain 's eyes was explained now .
He found Elder Trewin in his study when he got home .
The good Elder 's face was stern and anxious ; he had called on a distasteful errand -- to tell the young minister of the scandal his intimacy with the Four Winds people was making in the congregation and remonstrate with him concerning it .
"Alan listened absently , with none of the resentment he would have felt at the interference a day previously ."
A man does not mind a pin-prick when a limb is being wrenched away .
"`` I can promise you that my objectionable calls at Four Winds will cease , '' he said sarcastically , when the Elder had finished ."
"Elder Trewin got himself away , feeling snubbed but relieved ."
"`` Took it purty quiet , '' he reflected ."
`` Do n't believe there was much in the yarns after all .
Isabel King started them and probably she exaggerated a lot .
I suppose he 's had some notion like as not of bringing the Captain over to the church .
"But that 's foolish , for he 'd never manage it , and meanwhile was giving occasion for gossip ."
It 's just as well to stop it .
"He 's a good pastor and he works hard -- too hard , mebbe ."
"The Queen ordered him to kneel , and then said that for playing so beautifully she would give him the wish of his heart ."
"Then they all gathered round Peter to hear what was the wish of his heart , but for a long time he hesitated , not being certain what it was himself ."
"`` If I chose to go back to mother , '' he asked at last , `` could you give me that wish ? ''"
"Now this question vexed them , for were he to return to his mother they should lose his music , so the Queen tilted her nose contemptuously and said , `` Pooh , ask for a much bigger wish than that . ''"
`` Is that quite a little wish ? ''
he inquired .
"`` As little as this , '' the Queen answered , putting her hands near each other ."
`` What size is a big wish ? ''
he asked .
She measured it off on her skirt and it was a very handsome length .
"Then Peter reflected and said , `` Well , then , I think I shall have two little wishes instead of one big one . ''"
"Of course , the fairies had to agree , though his cleverness rather shocked them , and he said that his first wish was to go to his mother , but with the right to return to the Gardens if he found her disappointing ."
His second wish he would hold in reserve .
"They tried to dissuade him , and even put obstacles in the way ."
"`` I can give you the power to fly to her house , '' the Queen said , `` but I ca n't open the door for you . ''"
"`` The window I flew out at will be open , '' Peter said confidently ."
`` Mother always keeps it open in the hope that I may fly back .
`` How do you know ? ''
"they asked , quite surprised , and , really , Peter could not explain how he knew ."
"`` I just do know , '' he said ."
"So as he persisted in his wish , they had to grant it ."
"The way they gave him power to fly was this : They all tickled him on the shoulder , and soon he felt a funny itching in that part and then up he rose higher and higher and flew away out of the Gardens and over the house-tops ."
"It was so delicious that instead of flying straight to his old home he skimmed away over St. Paul 's to the Crystal Palace and back by the river and Regent 's Park , and by the time he reached his mother 's window he had quite made up his mind that his second wish should be to become a bird ."
"The window was wide open , just as he knew it would be , and in he fluttered , and there was his mother lying asleep ."
Peter alighted softly on the wooden rail at the foot of the bed and had a good look at her .
"She lay with her head on her hand , and the hollow in the pillow was like a nest lined with her brown wavy hair ."
"He remembered , though he had long forgotten it , that she always gave her hair a holiday at night ."
How sweet the frills of her night-gown were .
He was very glad she was such a pretty mother .
"But she looked sad , and he knew why she looked sad ."
"One of her arms moved as if it wanted to go round something , and he knew what it wanted to go round ."
"`` Oh , mother , '' said Peter to himself , `` if you just knew who is sitting on the rail at the foot of the bed . ''"
`` My name is Maxwell Seeley .
"My father died when I was seven years old , and my mother a year later ."
"My little sister , Bertha , then three years old , and I were left quite alone and very poor ."
We had no relatives .
"I was adopted by a well-to-do old bachelor , who had known my father ."
My sister was taken to an orphan asylum in a city some distance away .
I was very much attached to her and grieved bitterly over our parting .
My adopted father was very kind to me and gave me a good education .
"I did not forget my sister , and as soon as I could I went to the asylum ."
"I found that she had been taken away long before , and I could not even discover who had adopted her , for the original building , with all its records , had been destroyed by fire two years previous to my visit ."
"I never could find any clue to her whereabouts , and long since gave up all hope of finding her ."
But I have found her at last .
"You are Bertha Seeley , my little sister ! ''"
`` Oh -- can it be possible ! ''
`` More than possible -- it is certain .
"You are the image of my mother , as I remember her , and as an old daguerreotype I have pictures her ."
"And this is her watch -- see , I scratched my own initials on the case one day ."
There is no doubt in the world .
"Oh , Bertha , are you half as glad as I am ? ''"
`` Glad ! ''
Bertha 's eyes were shining like stars .
"She tried to smile , but burst into tears instead and her head went down on her brother 's shoulder ."
"By this time everybody in the room was staring at the extraordinary tableau , and Ernest , coming through the hall , gave a whistle of astonishment that brought the two in the corner back to a sense of their surroundings ."
"`` I have n't suddenly gone crazy , Ernest , old fellow , '' smiled Max ."
"`` Ladies and gentlemen all , this little school-ma ` am was introduced to you as Miss Price , but that was a mistake ."
"Let me introduce her again as Miss Bertha Seeley , my long-lost and newly-found sister . ''"
"Well they had an amazing time then , of course ."
They laughed and questioned and explained until the dinner was in imminent danger of getting stone-cold on the dining-room table .
"Luckily , Alma and Frances remembered it just in the nick of time , and they all got out , somehow , and into their places ."
"It was a splendid dinner , but I believe that Maxwell and Bertha Seeley did n't know what they were eating , any more than if it had been sawdust ."
"However , the rest of the guests made up for that , and did full justice to the girls ' cookery ."
"In the afternoon they all went to church , and at least two hearts were truly and devoutly thankful that day ."
"When he reached the scene of the accident he dreaded to look over the broken edge , but she was lying there safely and she smiled when she saw him -- a brave smile that softened her tense white face into the likeness of a frightened child 's ."
"`` If I drop the rope down to you , are you strong enough to hold to it while the earth goes and then draw yourself up the slope hand over hand ? ''"
asked Alan anxiously .
"`` Yes , '' she answered fearlessly ."
"Alan passed down one end of the rope and then braced himself firmly to hold it , for there was no tree near enough to be of any assistance ."
"The next moment the full weight of her body swung from it , for at her first movement the soil beneath her slipped away ."
Alan 's heart sickened ; what if she went with it ?
Could she cling to the rope while he drew her up ?
Then he saw she was still safe on the sloping shelf .
"Carefully and painfully she drew herself to her knees and , dinging to the rope , crept up the rock hand over hand ."
When she came within his reach he grasped her arms and lifted her up into safety beside him .
"`` Thank God , '' he said , with whiter lips than her own ."
"For a few moments Lynde sat silent on the sod , exhausted with fright and exertion , while her dog fawned on her in an ecstasy of joy ."
Finally she looked up into Alan 's anxious face and their eyes met .
It was something more than the physical reaction that suddenly flushed the girl 's cheeks .
She sprang lithely to her feet .
`` Can you walk back home ? ''
Alan asked .
"`` Oh , yes , I am all right now ."
It was very foolish of me to get into such a predicament .
Father and Emily went down the lake in the yacht this afternoon and I started out for a ramble .
When I came here I saw some junebells growing right out on the ledge and I crept out to gather them .
I should have known better .
"It broke away under me and the more I tried to scramble back the faster it slid down , carrying me with it ."
I thought it would go right over the brink '' -- she gave a little involuntary shudder -- `` but just at the very edge it stopped .
I knew I must lie very still or it would go right over .
It seemed like days .
"Pat was with me and I told him to go for help , but I knew there was no one at home -- and I was horribly afraid , '' she concluded with another shiver ."
`` I never was afraid in my life before -- at least not with that kind of fear . ''
"`` You have had a terrible experience and a narrow escape , '' said Alan lamely ."
He could think of nothing more to say ; his usual readiness of utterance seemed to have failed him .
"`` You saved my life , '' she said , `` you and Pat -- for doggie must have his share of credit . ''"
"You remember the Pied Piper -- but no , of course you would n't -- you were too young ."
One evening long ago when Nan and Di and Jem and the Merediths and I were together in Rainbow Valley I had a queer vision or presentiment -- whatever you like to call it .
"Rilla , I saw the Piper coming down the Valley with a shadowy host behind him ."
The others thought I was only pretending -- but I saw him for just one moment .
"And Rilla , last night I saw him again ."
"I was doing sentry-go and I saw him marching across No-man 's - land from our trenches to the German trenches -- the same tall shadowy form , piping weirdly -- and behind him followed boys in khaki ."
"Rilla , I tell you I saw him -- it was no fancy -- no illusion ."
"I heard his music , and then -- he was gone ."
But I had seen him -- and I knew what it meant -- I knew that I was among those who followed him .
"`` Rilla , the Piper will pipe me ` west ' tomorrow ."
I feel sure of this .
"And Rilla , I 'm not afraid ."
"When you hear the news , remember that ."
I 've won my own freedom here -- freedom from all fear .
"I shall never be afraid of anything again -- not of death -- nor of life , if after all , I am to go on living ."
"And life , I think , would be the harder of the two to face -- for it could never be beautiful for me again ."
There would always be such horrible things to remember -- things that would make life ugly and painful always for me .
I could never forget them .
"But whether it 's life or death , I 'm not afraid , Rilla-my-Rilla , and I am not sorry that I came ."
I 'm satisfied .
"I 'll never write the poems I once dreamed of writing -- but I 've helped to make Canada safe for the poets of the future -- for the workers of the future -- ay , and the dreamers , too -- for if no man dreams , there will be nothing for the workers to fulfil -- the future , not of Canada only but of the world -- when the ` red rain ' of Langemarck and Verdun shall have brought forth a golden harvest -- not in a year or two , as some foolishly think , but a generation later , when the seed sown now shall have had time to germinate and grow ."
"Yes , I 'm glad I came , Rilla ."
It is n't only the fate of the little sea-born island I love that is in the balance -- nor of Canada nor of England .
It 's the fate of mankind .
That is what we 're fighting for .
"And we shall win -- never for a moment doubt that , Rilla ."
For it is n't only the living who are fighting -- the dead are fighting too .
Such an army can not be defeated .
"`` Is there laughter in your face yet , Rilla ?"
I hope so .
The world will need laughter and courage more than ever in the years that will come next .
I do n't want to preach -- this is n't any time for it .
"But I have been going to see Madge Oliver for some time , and we are engaged ."
"We are thinking of being married this fall , and we hope you will not object . ''"
Burton 's frankness nearly took away his father 's breath .
Old John fairly choked with rage .
"`` You young fool , '' he spluttered , bringing down his hoe with such energy that he sliced off half a dozen of his finest young turnip plants , `` have you gone clean crazy ?"
"No , sir , I 'll never consent to your marrying an Oliver , and you need n't have any idea that I will . ''"
"`` Then I 'll marry her without your consent , '' retorted Burton angrily , losing the temper he had been trying to keep ."
"`` Oh , will you indeed !"
"Well , if you do , out you go , and not a cent of my money or a rod of my land do you ever get . ''"
`` What have you got against Madge ? ''
"asked Burton , forcing himself to speak calmly , for he knew his father too well to doubt for a minute that he meant and would do just what he said ."
"`` She 's an Oliver , '' said old John crustily , `` and that 's enough . ''"
"And considering that he had settled the matter , John Ellis threw down his hoe and left the field in a towering rage ."
Burton hoed away savagely until his anger had spent itself on the weeds .
"Give up Madge -- dear , sweet little Madge ?"
Not he !
"Yet if his father remained of the same mind , their marriage was out of the question at present ."
And Burton knew quite well that his father would remain of the same mind .
Old John Ellis had the reputation of being the most contrary man in Greenwood .
When Burton had finished his row he left the turnip field and went straight across lots to see Madge and tell her his dismal story .
"An hour later Miss Susan Oliver went up the stairs of her little brown house to Madge 's room and found her niece lying on the bed , her pretty curls tumbled , her soft cheeks flushed crimson , crying as if her heart would break ."
"Miss Susan was a tall , grim , angular spinster who looked like the last person in the world to whom a love affair might be confided ."
But never were appearances more deceptive than in this case .
"Behind her unprepossessing exterior Miss Susan had a warm , sympathetic heart filled to the brim with kindly affection for her pretty niece ."
She had seen Burton Ellis going moodily across the fields homeward and guessed that something had gone wrong .
"`` Now , dearie , what is the matter ? ''"
"she said , tenderly patting the brown head ."
Madge sobbed out the whole story disconsolately .
Burton 's father would not let him marry her because she was an Oliver .
"And , oh , what would she do ?"
"`` Do n't worry , Madge , '' said Miss Susan comfortingly ."
`` I 'll soon settle old John Ellis . ''
Of course this was rather unsatisfactory .
"However , to make amends he showed them how to lie out flat on a strong wind that was going their way , and this was such a pleasant change that they tried it several times and found they could sleep thus with security ."
"Indeed they would have slept longer , but Peter tired quickly of sleeping , and soon he would cry in his captain voice , ` We get off here . '"
"So with occasional tiffs , but on the whole rollicking , they drew near the Neverland ; for after many moons they did reach it , and , what is more , they had been going pretty straight all the time , not perhaps so much owing to the guidance of Peter or Tink as because the island was out looking for them ."
It is only thus that any one may sight those magic shores .
"` There it is , ' said Peter calmly ."
"` Where , where ? '"
` Where all the arrows are pointing . '
"Indeed a million golden arrows were pointing out the island to the children , all directed by their friend the sun , who wanted them to be sure of their way before leaving them for the night ."
-LSB- Illustration : `` LET HIM KEEP WHO CAN '' -RSB- Wendy and John and Michael stood on tiptoe in the air to get their first sight of the island .
"Strange to say , they all recognised it at once , and until fear fell upon them they hailed it , not as something long dreamt of and seen at last , but as a familiar friend to whom they were returning home for the holidays ."
"` John , there 's the lagoon . '"
"` Wendy , look at the turtles burying their eggs in the sand . ' '"
"I say , John , I see your flamingo with the broken leg . '"
"` Look , Michael , there 's your cave . '"
"` John , what 's that in the brushwood ? '"
` It 's a wolf with her whelps .
"Wendy , I do believe that 's your little whelp . '"
"` There 's my boat , John , with her sides stove in . '"
"` No , it is n't ."
"Why , we burned your boat . '"
"` That 's her , at any rate ."
"I say , John , I see the smoke of the redskin camp . '"
` Where ?
"Show me , and I 'll tell you by the way the smoke curls whether they are on the war-path . '"
"` There , just across the Mysterious River . ' '"
I see now .
"Yes , they are on the war-path right enough . '"
"Peter was a little annoyed with them for knowing so much ; but if he wanted to lord it over them his triumph was at hand , for have I not told you that anon fear fell upon them ?"
"It came as the arrows went , leaving the island in gloom ."
In the old days at home the Neverland had always begun to look a little dark and threatening by bedtime .
"Then unexplored patches arose in it and spread ; black shadows moved about in them ; the roar of the beasts of prey was quite different now , and above all , you lost the certainty that you would win ."
They then quarrelled ; the cause of the quarrel was insignificant ; with anyone else than Eugene a reconciliation would soon have been effected .
But Eugene never was friendly with your father from that time .
I think he was jealous of old Grandfather 's affection ; thought the old man loved your father best .
"And then , as I have said , he was very eccentric and stubborn ."
"Well , your father went away to college and graduated , and then -- we were married ."
Grandfather Page was very angry with him for marrying me .
He wanted him to marry somebody else .
He told him he would disinherit him if he married me .
I did not know this until we were married .
But Grandfather Page kept his word .
"He sent for a lawyer and had a new will made , leaving everything to Eugene ."
"I think , nay , I am sure , that he would have relented in time , but he died the very next week ; they found him dead in his bed one morning , so Eugene got everything ; and that is all there is of the story , Dorinda . ''"
`` And Uncle Eugene has been our enemy ever since ? ''
"`` Yes , ever since ."
"So you see , Dorinda dear , that I can not ask any favours of Uncle Eugene . ''"
"`` Yes , I see , '' said Dorinda understandingly ."
"We kept thinking of poor Laura and Magsie at home , dining off potatoes on Thanksgiving !"
But at least Aunt Susanna was satisfied .
When Kate and I were washing the dishes she came out quite beamingly .
"`` Well , my dears , I must admit that you made a very good job of the dinner , indeed ."
The turkey was done to perfection .
"As for the mince pies -- well , of course Miranda Mary made them , but she must have had extra good luck with them , for they were excellent and heated to just the right degree ."
"You did n't give anything to the McGinnis dog , I hope ? ''"
"`` No , we did n't give him anything , '' said Kate ."
Aunt Susanna did not notice the emphasis .
When we had finished the dishes we smuggled our platter and tureen out of the house and went home .
Laura and Margaret were busy painting and studying and were just as sweet-tempered as if we had n't robbed them of their dinner .
But we had to tell them the whole story before we even took off our hats .
"`` There is a special Providence for children and idiots , '' said Laura gently ."
We did n't ask her whether she meant us or Tony McGinnis or both .
There are some things better left in obscurity .
I 'd have probably said something much sharper than that if anybody had made off with my Thanksgiving turkey so unceremoniously .
By the most curious coincidence he had opened his heart to me too .
"Being a man , he was n't so discursive as Anne ; he said his say in four pages , but I could read the heartache between the lines ."
He wrote that he was going to Klondike and would start in a month 's time .
He was sick of living now that he 'd lost Anne .
"He said he loved her better than his life and always would , and could never forget her , but he knew she did n't care anything about him now after the way she 'd acted , and he wanted to get as far away from her and the torturing thought of her as he could ."
"So he was going to Klondike -- going to Klondike , Nora May , when his mother was writing to him to come home every week and Anne was breaking her heart for him at St. Mary 's ."
"Well , I folded up them letters and , says I , `` Grandpa Holland , I guess my birthday celebration is here ready to hand . ''"
I thought real hard .
I could n't write myself to explain to those two people that they each thought the world of each other still -- my hands are too stiff ; and I could n't get anyone else to write because I could n't let out what they 'd told me in confidence .
"So I did a mean , dishonourable thing , Nora May ."
I sent Anne 's letter to Gilbert and Gilbert 's to Anne .
"I asked Emma Matilda to address them , and Emma Matilda did it and asked no questions ."
I brought her up that way .
Then I settled down to wait .
In less than a month Gilbert 's mother had a letter from him saying that he was coming home to settle down and marry Anne .
He arrived home yesterday and last night Anne came to Springdale on her way home from St. Mary 's .
They came to see me this morning and said things to me I ai n't going to repeat because they would sound fearful vain .
They were so happy that they made me feel as if it was a good thing to have lived eighty years in a world where folks could be so happy .
They said their new joy was my birthday gift to them .
The wedding is to be in September and I 'm going to Montrose in August to help Anne with her quilts .
"I do n't think anything will happen to prevent this time -- no quarrelling , anyhow ."
Those two young creatures have learned their lesson .
"You 'd better take it to heart too , Nora May ."
It 's less trouble to learn it at second hand .
"Do n't you ever quarrel with your real beau -- it do n't matter about the sham ones , of course ."
"Do n't take offence at trifles or listen to what other people tell you about him -- outsiders , that is , that want to make mischief ."
What you think about him is of more importance than what they do .
"To be sure , you 're too young yet to be thinking of such things at all ."
But just mind what old Aunt Susanna told you when your time comes .
Bertie 's New Year He stood on the sagging doorstep and looked out on the snowy world .
"His hands were clasped behind him , and his thin face wore a thoughtful , puzzled look ."
"The door behind him opened jerkingly , and a scowling woman came out with a pan of dishwater in her hand ."
`` What my mother hopes .
"John , what are -- '' But Hook had found his voice again ."
`` Tie her up ! ''
he shouted .
It was Smee who tied her to the mast .
"`` See here , honey , '' he whispered , `` I 'll save you if you promise to be my mother . ''"
But not even for Smee would she make such a promise .
"`` I would almost rather have no children at all , '' she said disdainfully -LSB- scornfully -RSB- ."
It is sad to know that not a boy was looking at her as Smee tied her to the mast ; the eyes of all were on the plank : that last little walk they were about to take .
"They were no longer able to hope that they would walk it manfully , for the capacity to think had gone from them ; they could stare and shiver only ."
"Hook smiled on them with his teeth closed , and took a step toward Wendy ."
His intention was to turn her face so that she should see the boys walking the plank one by one .
"But he never reached her , he never heard the cry of anguish he hoped to wring from her ."
He heard something else instead .
It was the terrible tick-tick of the crocodile .
"They all heard it -- pirates , boys , Wendy ; and immediately every head was blown in one direction ; not to the water whence the sound proceeded , but toward Hook ."
"All knew that what was about to happen concerned him alone , and that from being actors they were suddenly become spectators ."
Very frightful was it to see the change that came over him .
It was as if he had been clipped at every joint .
He fell in a little heap .
"The sound came steadily nearer ; and in advance of it came this ghastly thought , `` The crocodile is about to board the ship ! ''"
Even the iron claw hung inactive ; as if knowing that it was no intrinsic part of what the attacking force wanted .
"Left so fearfully alone , any other man would have lain with his eyes shut where he fell : but the gigantic brain of Hook was still working , and under its guidance he crawled on the knees along the deck as far from the sound as he could go ."
"The pirates respectfully cleared a passage for him , and it was only when he brought up against the bulwarks that he spoke ."
`` Hide me ! ''
he cried hoarsely .
"They gathered round him , all eyes averted from the thing that was coming aboard ."
They had no thought of fighting it .
It was Fate .
Only when Hook was hidden from them did curiosity loosen the limbs of the boys so that they could rush to the ship 's side to see the crocodile climbing it .
Then they got the strangest surprise of the Night of Nights ; for it was no crocodile that was coming to their aid .
It was Peter .
"As for the fourth , who brought up the tail , I had seen his like before , and knew him at once to be a sheriff 's officer ."
"I had no sooner seen these people coming than I made up my mind -LRB- for no reason that I can tell -RRB- to go through with my adventure ; and when the first came alongside of me , I rose up from the bracken and asked him the way to Aucharn ."
"He stopped and looked at me , as I thought , a little oddly ; and then , turning to the lawyer , `` Mungo , '' said he , `` there 's many a man would think this more of a warning than two pyats ."
"Here am I on my road to Duror on the job ye ken ; and here is a young lad starts up out of the bracken , and speers if I am on the way to Aucharn . ''"
"`` Glenure , '' said the other , `` this is an ill subject for jesting . ''"
"These two had now drawn close up and were gazing at me , while the two followers had halted about a stone-cast in the rear ."
`` And what seek ye in Aucharn ? ''
"said Colin Roy Campbell of Glenure , him they called the Red Fox ; for he it was that I had stopped ."
"`` The man that lives there , '' said I. `` James of the Glens , '' says Glenure , musingly ; and then to the lawyer : `` Is he gathering his people , think ye ? ''"
"`` Anyway , '' says the lawyer , `` we shall do better to bide where we are , and let the soldiers rally us . ''"
"`` If you are concerned for me , '' said I , `` I am neither of his people nor yours , but an honest subject of King George , owing no man and fearing no man . ''"
"`` Why , very well said , '' replies the Factor ."
"`` But if I may make so bold as ask , what does this honest man so far from his country ?"
and why does he come seeking the brother of Ardshiel ?
"I have power here , I must tell you ."
"I am King 's Factor upon several of these estates , and have twelve files of soldiers at my back . ''"
"`` I have heard a waif word in the country , '' said I , a little nettled , `` that you were a hard man to drive . ''"
"He still kept looking at me , as if in doubt ."
"`` Well , '' said he , at last , `` your tongue is bold ; but I am no unfriend to plainness ."
"If ye had asked me the way to the door of James Stewart on any other day but this , I would have set ye right and bidden ye God speed ."
"But to-day -- eh , Mungo ? ''"
And he turned again to look at the lawyer .
But just as he turned there came the shot of a firelock from higher up the hill ; and with the very sound of it Glenure fell upon the road .
"`` O , I am dead ! ''"
"he cried , several times over ."
"The lawyer had caught him up and held him in his arms , the servant standing over and clasping his hands ."
"And now the wounded man looked from one to another with scared eyes , and there was a change in his voice , that went to the heart ."
"`` Take care of yourselves , '' says he ."
`` I am dead . ''
"He tried to open his clothes as if to look for the wound , but his fingers slipped on the buttons ."
"With that he gave a great sigh , his head rolled on his shoulder , and he passed away ."
"The lawyer said never a word , but his face was as sharp as a pen and as white as the dead man 's ; the servant broke out into a great noise of crying and weeping , like a child ; and I , on my side , stood staring at them in a kind of horror ."
"I do n't mind ; I ai n't a little girl , I 'm older than you and Daisy ; so now , '' cried Nan , ungratefully ."
"`` Do n't preach , Deacon , you bully Posy every day of your life , '' called out the Commodore , who just then hove in sight ."
"`` I do n't hurt her ; do I , Daisy ? ''"
"and Demi turned to his sister , who was `` pooring '' Nan 's tingling hands , and recommending water for the purple lump rapidly developing itself on her forehead ."
"`` You are the best boy in the world , '' promptly answered Daisy ; adding , as truth compelled her to do , `` You hurt me sometimes , but you do n't mean to . ''"
"`` Put away the bats and things , and mind what you are about , my hearties ."
"No fighting allowed aboard this ship , '' said Emil , who rather lorded it over the others ."
"`` How do you do , Madge Wildfire ? ''"
"said Mr. Bhaer , as Nan came in with the rest to supper ."
"`` Give the right hand , little daughter , and mind thy manners , '' he added , as Nan offered him her left ."
`` The other hurts me . ''
`` The poor little hand !
what has it been doing to get those blisters ? ''
"he asked , drawing it from behind her back , where she had put it with a look which made him think she had been in mischief ."
"Before Nan could think of any excuse , Daisy burst out with the whole story , during which Stuffy tried to hide his face in a bowl of bread and milk ."
"When the tale was finished , Mr. Bhaer looked down the long table towards his wife , and said with a laugh in his eyes , `` This rather belongs to your side of the house , so I wo n't meddle with it , my dear . ''"
"Mrs. Jo knew what he meant , but she liked her little black sheep all the better for her pluck , though she only said in her soberest way , `` Do you know why I asked Nan to come here ? ''"
"`` To plague me , '' muttered Stuffy , with his mouth full ."
"`` To help make little gentlemen of you , and I think you have shown that some of you need it . ''"
"Here Stuffy retired into his bowl again , and did not emerge till Demi made them all laugh by saying , in his slow wondering way , `` How can she , when she 's such a tomboy ? ''"
"`` That 's just it , she needs help as much as you , and I expect you set her an example of good manners . ''"
`` Is she going to be a little gentleman too ? ''
asked Rob .
"`` She 'd like it ; would n't you , Nan ? ''"
added Tommy .
"`` No , I should n't ; I hate boys ! ''"
"said Nan fiercely , for her hand still smarted , and she began to think that she might have shown her courage in some wiser way ."
"`` I am sorry you hate my boys , because they can be well-mannered , and most agreeable when they choose ."
"Kindness in looks and words and ways is true politeness , and any one can have it if they only try to treat other people as they like to be treated themselves . ''"
"Mrs. Bhaer had addressed herself to Nan , but the boys nudged one another , and appeared to take the hint , for that time at least , and passed the butter ; said `` please , '' and `` thank you , '' `` yes , sir , '' and `` no , ma'am , '' with unusual elegance and respect ."
"Nan said nothing , but kept herself quiet and refrained from tickling Demi , though strongly tempted to do so , because of the dignified airs he put on ."
"She also appeared to have forgotten her hatred of boys , and played `` I spy '' with them till dark ."
"The window was wide open , just as he knew it would be , and in he fluttered , and there was his mother lying asleep ."
Peter alighted softly on the wooden rail at the foot of the bed and had a good look at her .
"She lay with her head on her hand , and the hollow in the pillow was like a nest lined with her brown wavy hair ."
"He remembered , though he had long forgotten it , that she always gave her hair a holiday at night ."
How sweet the frills of her nightgown were !
He was very glad she was such a pretty mother .
"But she looked sad , and he knew why she looked sad ."
"One of her arms moved as if it wanted to go round something , and he knew what it wanted to go round . '"
O mother ! '
"said Peter to himself , ` if you just knew who is sitting on the rail at the foot of the bed . '"
"Very gently he patted the little mound that her feet made , and he could see by her face that she liked it ."
"He knew he had but to say ` Mother ' ever so softly , and she would wake up ."
They always wake up at once if it is you that says their name .
Then she would give such a joyous cry and squeeze him tight .
"How nice that would be to him , but oh !"
how exquisitely delicious it would be to her .
"That , I am afraid , is how Peter regarded it ."
In returning to his mother he never doubted that he was giving her the greatest treat a woman can have .
"Nothing can be more splendid , he thought , than to have a little boy of your own ."
How proud of him they are !
"and very right and proper , too ."
"-LSB- Illustration : The fairies sit round on mushrooms , and at first they are well behaved -RSB- But why does Peter sit so long on the rail ; why does he not tell his mother that he has come back ?"
"I quite shrink from the truth , which is that he sat there in two minds ."
"Sometimes he looked longingly at his mother , and sometimes he looked longingly at the window ."
"Certainly it would be pleasant to be her boy again , but on the other hand , what times those had been in the Gardens !"
Was he so sure that he should enjoy wearing clothes again ?
He popped off the bed and opened some drawers to have a look at his old garments .
"They were still there , but he could not remember how you put them on ."
"The socks , for instance , were they worn on the hands or on the feet ?"
"He was about to try one of them on his hand , when he had a great adventure ."
"Perhaps the drawer had creaked ; at any rate , his mother woke up , for he heard her say ` Peter , ' as if it was the most lovely word in the language ."
"He remained sitting on the floor and held his breath , wondering how she knew that he had come back ."
"Laddie was a handsome and intelligent black-and-white Newfoundland , with a magnificent coat ."
He and Ernest were great chums .
I felt sorry for the boy who was to lose his pet .
"`` Do n't take it so hard , Ern , '' I said , trying to comfort him ."
`` Uncle will likely get another pup . ''
`` I do n't want any other pup ! ''
Ernest blurted out .
"`` Oh , Ned , wo n't you try and coax your uncle not to sell him ?"
Perhaps he 'd listen to you . ''
I shook my head .
I knew Uncle Richard too well to hope that .
"`` Not in this case , Ern , '' I said ."
"`` He would say it did not concern me , and you know nothing moves him when he determines on a thing ."
"You 'll have to reconcile yourself to losing Laddie , I 'm afraid . ''"
"Ernest 's tow-coloured head went down on Laddie 's neck again , and I , deciding that there was no use in saying anything more , proceeded towards the shore , which was about a mile from Uncle Richard 's house ."
"The beach along his farm and for several farms along shore was a lonely , untenanted one , for the fisher-folk all lived two miles further down , at Rowley 's Cove ."
About three hundred yards from the shore was the peculiar formation known as Island Rock .
This was a large rock that stood abruptly up out of the water .
"Below , about the usual water-line , it was seamed and fissured , but its summit rose up in a narrow , flat-topped peak ."
"At low tide twenty feet of it was above water , but at high tide it was six feet and often more under water ."
I pushed Uncle Richard 's small flat down the rough path and rowed out to Island Rock .
"Arriving there , I thrust the painter deep into a narrow cleft ."
"This was the usual way of mooring it , and no doubt of its safety occurred to me ."
"I scrambled up the rock and around to the eastern end , where there was a broader space for standing and from which some capital views could be obtained ."
"The sea about the rock was calm , but there was quite a swell on and an off-shore breeze was blowing ."
There were no boats visible .
"The tide was low , leaving bare the curious caves and headlands along shore , and I secured a number of excellent snapshots ."
It was now three o'clock .
"I must wait another hour yet before I could get the best view of the `` Hole in the Wall '' -- a huge , arch-like opening through a jutting headland to the west of me ."
"I went around to look at it , when I saw a sight that made me stop short in dismay ."
"This was nothing less than the flat , drifting outward around the point ."
The swell and suction of the water around the rock must have pulled her loose -- and I was a prisoner !
"`` No , it was Laddie , '' said Ernest , refusing to take any credit at all ."
"We hurried home and arrived at Uncle Richard 's about ten , just as they were going to bed ."
"When Uncle Richard heard what had happened , he turned very pale , and murmured , `` Thank God ! ''"
"Aunt Kate got me out of my wet clothes as quickly as possible , put me away to bed in hot blankets and dosed me with ginger tea ."
I slept like a top and felt none the worse for my experience the next morning .
At the breakfast table Uncle Richard scarcely spoke .
"But , just as we finished , he said abruptly to Ernest , `` I 'm not going to sell Laddie ."
"You and the dog saved Ned 's life between you , and no dog who helped do that is ever going to be sold by me ."
Henceforth he belongs to you .
I give him to you for your very own . ''
"`` Oh , Mr. Lawson ! ''"
"said Ernest , with shining eyes ."
I never saw a boy look so happy .
"As for Laddie , who was sitting beside him with his shaggy head on Ernest 's knee , I really believe the dog understood , too ."
The look in his eyes was almost human .
Uncle Richard leaned over and patted him .
`` Good dog ! ''
he said .
`` Good dog ! ''
"At Five O'Clock in the Morning Fate , in the guise of Mrs. Emory dropping a milk-can on the platform under his open window , awakened Murray that morning ."
"Had not Mrs. Emory dropped that can , he would have slumbered peacefully until his usual hour for rising -- a late one , be it admitted , for of all the boarders at Sweetbriar Cottage Murray was the most irregular in his habits ."
"`` When a young man , '' Mrs. Emory was wont to remark sagely and a trifle severely , `` prowls about that pond half of the night , a-chasing of things what he calls ` moonlight effecks , ' it ai n't to be wondered at that he 's sleepy in the morning ."
"And it ai n't the convenientest thing , nuther and noways , to keep the breakfast table set till the farm folks are thinking of dinner ."
"But them artist men are not like other people , say what you will , and allowance has to be made for them ."
And I must say that I likes him real well and approves of him every other way . ''
"If Murray had slept late that morning -- well , he shudders yet over that `` if . ''"
"But aforesaid Fate saw to it that he woke when the hour of destiny and the milk-can struck , and having awakened he found he could not go to sleep again ."
It suddenly occurred to him that he had never seen a sunrise on the pond .
Doubtless it would be very lovely down there in those dewy meadows at such a primitive hour ; he decided to get up and see what the world looked like in the young daylight .
He scowled at a letter lying on his dressing table and thrust it into his pocket that it might be out of sight .
He had written it the night before and the writing of it was going to cost him several things -- a prospective million among others .
So it is hardly to be wondered at if the sight of it did not reconcile him to the joys of early rising .
"said I , waving my cap ."
`` And there 's an end to Captain Silver ! ''
"He watched me keenly and slyly , his chin all the while on his breast ."
"`` I reckon , '' he said at last , `` I reckon , Cap'n Hawkins , you 'll kind of want to get ashore now ."
S'pose we talks . ''
"`` Why , yes , '' says I , `` with all my heart , Mr. Hands ."
Say on . ''
And I went back to my meal with a good appetite .
"`` This man , '' he began , nodding feebly at the corpse '' -- O'Brien were his name , a rank Irelander -- this man and me got the canvas on her , meaning for to sail her back ."
"Well , HE 'S dead now , he is -- as dead as bilge ; and who 's to sail this ship , I do n't see ."
"Without I gives you a hint , you ai n't that man , as far 's I can tell ."
"Now , look here , you gives me food and drink and a old scarf or ankecher to tie my wound up , you do , and I 'll tell you how to sail her , and that 's about square all round , I take it . ''"
"`` I 'll tell you one thing , '' says I : `` I 'm not going back to Captain Kidd 's anchorage ."
I mean to get into North Inlet and beach her quietly there . ''
"`` To be sure you did , '' he cried ."
"`` Why , I ai n't sich an infernal lubber after all ."
"I can see , ca n't I ?"
"I 've tried my fling , I have , and I 've lost , and it 's you has the wind of me ."
North Inlet ?
"Why , I have n't no ch ` ice , not I !"
"I 'd help you sail her up to Execution Dock , by thunder !"
So I would . ''
"Well , as it seemed to me , there was some sense in this ."
We struck our bargain on the spot .
"In three minutes I had the HISPANIOLA sailing easily before the wind along the coast of Treasure Island , with good hopes of turning the northern point ere noon and beating down again as far as North Inlet before high water , when we might beach her safely and wait till the subsiding tide permitted us to land ."
"Then I lashed the tiller and went below to my own chest , where I got a soft silk handkerchief of my mother 's ."
"With this , and with my aid , Hands bound up the great bleeding stab he had received in the thigh , and after he had eaten a little and had a swallow or two more of the brandy , he began to pick up visibly , sat straighter up , spoke louder and clearer , and looked in every way another man ."
The breeze served us admirably .
"We skimmed before it like a bird , the coast of the island flashing by and the view changing every minute ."
"Soon we were past the high lands and bowling beside low , sandy country , sparsely dotted with dwarf pines , and soon we were beyond that again and had turned the corner of the rocky hill that ends the island on the north ."
"I was greatly elated with my new command , and pleased with the bright , sunshiny weather and these different prospects of the coast ."
"I had now plenty of water and good things to eat , and my conscience , which had smitten me hard for my desertion , was quieted by the great conquest I had made ."
"For all that , if ye have any affection for my neck -LRB- to say nothing of your own -RRB- ye will perhaps be kind enough to take this matter responsibly ."
"I am going to do a bit of play-acting , the bottom ground of which is just exactly as serious as the gallows for the pair of us ."
"So bear it , if ye please , in mind , and conduct yourself according . ''"
"`` Well , well , '' said I , `` have it as you will . ''"
"As we got near the clachan , he made me take his arm and hang upon it like one almost helpless with weariness ; and by the time he pushed open the change-house door , he seemed to be half carrying me ."
"The maid appeared surprised -LRB- as well she might be -RRB- at our speedy return ; but Alan had no words to spare for her in explanation , helped me to a chair , called for a tass of brandy with which he fed me in little sips , and then breaking up the bread and cheese helped me to eat it like a nursery-lass ; the whole with that grave , concerned , affectionate countenance , that might have imposed upon a judge ."
"It was small wonder if the maid were taken with the picture we presented , of a poor , sick , overwrought lad and his most tender comrade ."
"She drew quite near , and stood leaning with her back on the next table ."
`` What 's like wrong with him ? ''
said she at last .
"Alan turned upon her , to my great wonder , with a kind of fury ."
`` Wrong ? ''
cries he .
"`` He 's walked more hundreds of miles than he has hairs upon his chin , and slept oftener in wet heather than dry sheets ."
"Wrong , quo ' she !"
"Wrong enough , I would think !"
"Wrong , indeed ! ''"
"and he kept grumbling to himself as he fed me , like a man ill-pleased ."
"`` He 's young for the like of that , '' said the maid ."
"`` Ower young , '' said Alan , with his back to her ."
"`` He would be better riding , '' says she ."
`` And where could I get a horse to him ? ''
"cried Alan , turning on her with the same appearance of fury ."
`` Would ye have me steal ? ''
"I thought this roughness would have sent her off in dudgeon , as indeed it closed her mouth for the time ."
"But my companion knew very well what he was doing ; and for as simple as he was in some things of life , had a great fund of roguishness in such affairs as these ."
"`` Ye neednae tell me , '' she said at last -- `` ye 're gentry . ''"
"`` Well , '' said Alan , softened a little -LRB- I believe against his will -RRB- by this artless comment , `` and suppose we were ?"
Did ever you hear that gentrice put money in folk 's pockets ? ''
"She sighed at this , as if she were herself some disinherited great lady ."
"`` No , '' says she , `` that 's true indeed . ''"
"I was all this while chafing at the part I played , and sitting tongue-tied between shame and merriment ; but somehow at this I could hold in no longer , and bade Alan let me be , for I was better already ."
Her sunbonnet had fallen back and some loose tendrils of her auburn hair were curling around her forehead .
Her cheeks were so pink and her eyes so bright from running that she looked almost girlish .
"`` Oh , Mr. Harrington , '' she said breathlessly , `` that pet pig of Bobbles ' is in your garden again ."
He only got in this minute .
I saw him coming and I ran right after him . ''
"`` He 's there , all right , '' said Harrington cheerfully , `` but I 'll get him out in a jiffy ."
Do n't tire yourself .
Wo n't you go into the house and rest while I drive him around ? ''
"Mrs. Hayden , however , was determined to help and they both went around to the garden , set the gate open , and tried to drive the pig out ."
"But Harrington was not thinking about pigs , and Mrs. Hayden did not know quite so much about driving them as Mordecai did ; as a consequence they did not make much headway ."
"In her excitement Mrs. Hayden ran over beds and whatever came in her way , and Harrington , in order to keep near her , ran after her ."
Between them they spoiled things about as much as a whole drove of pigs would have done .
"But at last the pig grew tired of the fun , bolted out of the gate , and ran across the yard to his own place ."
Mrs. Hayden followed slowly and Harrington walked beside her .
"`` Those pigs are all to be shut up tomorrow , '' she said ."
`` Hiram has been fixing up a place for them in his spare moments and it is ready at last . ''
"`` Oh , I would n't , '' said Harrington hastily ."
`` It is n't good for pigs to be shut up so young .
You 'd better let them run a while yet . ''
"`` No , '' said Mrs. Hayden decidedly ."
`` They have almost worried me to death already .
In they go tomorrow . ''
"They were at the lane gate now , and Harrington had to open it and let her pass through ."
"He felt quite desperate as he watched her trip up through the rows of apple trees , her blue gingham skirt brushing the lush grasses where a lacy tangle of sunbeams and shadows lay ."
"Bobbles and Ted came running to meet her and the three , hand in hand , disappeared from sight ."
"Harrington went back to the house , feeling that life was flat , stale , and unprofitable ."
"That evening at the tea table he caught himself wondering what it would be like to see Mary Hayden sitting at his table in place of Sarah King , with Bobbles and Ted on either hand ."
Then he found out what was the matter with him .
"He was in love , fathoms deep , with the blue-eyed widow !"
"Presumably the pigs were shut up the next day , for Harrington 's garden was invaded no more ."
He stood it for a week and then surrendered at discretion .
"He filled a basket with early strawberries and went across to the Hayden place , boldly enough to all appearance , but with his heart thumping like any schoolboy 's ."
And though he was very terrible he was very beautiful too.
"Jane said so, but George said, ""Oh, don't bother; I'm thinking how to get onto the Pole and try the compass without waking the brute."""
"The dragon certainly was beautiful, with his deep, clear Prussian blueness, and his rainbow-colored glitter. And rising from within the cold coil of the frozen dragon the North Pole shot up like a pillar made of one great diamond, and every now and then it cracked a little, from sheer cold. The sound of the cracking was the only thing that broke the great white silence in the midst of which the dragon lay like an enormous jewel, and the straight flames went up all around him like the stalks of tall lilies."
"And as the children stood there looking at the most wonderful sight their eyes had ever seen, there was a soft padding of feet and a hurry-scurry behind them, and from the outside darkness beyond the flame-stalks came a crowd of little brown creatures running, jumping, scrambling, tumbling head over heels and on all fours, and some even walking on their heads. They joined hands as they came near the fires and danced around in a ring."
"""It's bears,"" said Jane. ""I know it is. Oh, how I wish we hadn't come; and my boots are so wet."""
"The dancing-ring broke up suddenly, and the next moment hundreds of furry arms clutched at George and Jane, and they found themselves in the middle of a great, soft, heaving crowd of little fat people in brown fur dresses, and the white silence was quite gone."
"""Bears, indeed,"" cried a shrill voice. ""You'll wish we were bears before you've done with us."""
"This sounded so dreadful that Jane began to cry. Up to now the children had only seen the most beautiful and wondrous things, but now they began to be sorry they had done what they were told not to, and the difference between ""lawn"" and ""grass"" did not seem so great as it had at Forest Hill."
"Directly Jane began to cry, all the brown people started back. No one cries in the Arctic regions for fear of being struck by the frost. So that these people had never seen anyone cry before."
"""Don't cry for real,"" whispered George, ""or you'll get chilblains in your eyes. But pretend to howl it frightens them."""
"So Jane went on pretending to howl, and the real crying stopped: It always does when you begin to pretend. You try it."
"Then, speaking very loud so as to be heard over the howls of Jane, George said: ""Yah who's afraid? We are George and Jane who are you?"""
"""We are the sealskin dwarfs,"" said the brown people, twisting their furry bodies in and out of the crowd like the changing glass in kaleidoscopes. ""We are very precious and expensive, for we are made, throughout, of the very best sealskin."""
"""And what are those fires for?"" bellowed George for Jane was crying louder and louder."
"""Those,"" shouted the dwarfs, coming a step nearer, ""are the fires we make to thaw the dragon. He is frozen now so he sleeps curled up around the Pole but when we have thawed him with our fires he will wake up and go and eat everybody in the world except us."""
"""WHATEVER DO YOU WANT HIM TO DO THAT FOR?"" yelled George."
"""Oh just for spite,"" bawled the dwarfs carelessly as if they were saying, ""Just for fun."""
"Jane stopped crying to say: ""You are heartless."""
"""No, we aren't,"" they said. ""Our hearts are made of the finest sealskin, just like little fat sealskin purses """
"And they all came a step nearer. They were very fat and round. Their bodies were like sealskin jackets on a very stout person; their heads were like sealskin muffs; their legs were like sealskin boas; and their hands and feet were like sealskin tobacco pouches. And their faces were like seals' faces, inasmuch as they, too, were covered with sealskin."
"""Thank you so much for telling us,"" said George. ""Good evening. (Keep on howling, Jane!)"""
"But the dwarfs came a step nearer, muttering and whispering. Then the muttering stopped and there was a silence so deep that Jane was afraid to howl in it. But it was a brown silence, and she had liked the white silence better."
"Then the chief dwarf came quite close and said: ""What's that on your head?"""
And George felt it was all up for he knew it was his father's sealskin cap.
"The dwarf did not wait for an answer. ""It's made of one of us,"" he screamed, ""or else one of the seals, our poor relations. Boy, now your fate is sealed!"""
"Looking at the wicked seal-faces all around them, George and Jane felt that their fate was sealed indeed."
"The dwarfs seized the children in their furry arms. George kicked, but it is no use kicking sealskin, and Jane howled, but the dwarfs were getting used to that. They climbed up the dragon's side and dumped the children down on his icy spine, with their backs against the North Pole."
"You have no idea how cold it was the kind of cold that makes you feel small and prickly inside your clothes, and makes you wish you had twenty times as many clothes to feel small and prickly inside of."
"The sealskin dwarfs tied George and Jane to the North Pole, and, as they had no ropes, they bound them with snow-wreaths, which are very strong when they are made in the proper way, and they heaped up the fires very close and said: ""Now the dragon will get warm, and when he gets warm he will wake, and when he wakes he will be hungry, and when he is hungry he will begin to eat, and the first thing he will eat will be you."""
"The little, sharp, many-colored flames sprang up like the stalks of dream lilies, but no heat came to the children, and they grew colder and colder."
"""We shan't be very nice when the dragon does eat us, that's one comfort,"" said George. ""We shall be turned into ice long before that."""
Every animal and bird he met asked him the same question:
"""Drumikin! Drumikin!"
"Have you seen Lambikin?"""
And to each of them the little slyboots replied:
"""Fallen into the fire, and so will you     On little Drumikin. Tum-pa, tum too;     Tum-pa, tum-too; Tum-pa, tum-too!"""
Then they all sighed to think of the tender little morsel they had let slip.
"At last the Jackal came limping along, for all his sorry looks as sharp as a needle, and he too called out"
"""Drumikin! Drumikin!"
"Have you seen Lambikin?"""
"And Lambikin, curled up in his snug little nest, replied gaily:"
"""Fallen into the fire, and so will you     On little Drumikin! Tum-pa  """
"But he never got any further, for the Jackal recognised his voice at once, and cried: ""Hullo! you've turned yourself inside out, have you?"
"Just you come out of that!"""
Whereupon he tore open Drumikin and gobbled up Lambikin.
Punchkin
Once upon a time there was a Raja who had seven beautiful daughters.
"They were all good girls; but the youngest, named Balna, was more clever than the rest. The Raja's wife died when they were quite little children, so these seven poor Princesses were left with no mother to take care of them."
"The Raja's daughters took it by turns to cook their father's dinner every day, whilst he was absent deliberating with his Ministers on the affairs of the nation."
"About this time the Prudhan died, leaving a widow and one daughter; and every day, every day, when the seven Princesses were preparing their father's dinner, the Prudhan's widow and daughter would come and beg for a little fire from the hearth. Then Balna used to say to her sisters, ""Send that woman away; send her away. Let her get the fire at her own house. What does she want with ours? If we allow her to come here, we shall suffer for it some day."""
"But the other sisters would answer, ""Be quiet, Balna; why must you always be quarrelling with this poor woman? Let her take some fire if she likes."" Then the Prudhan's widow used to go to the hearth and take a few sticks from it; and whilst no one was looking, she would quickly throw some mud into the midst of the dishes which were being prepared for the Raja's dinner."
"Now the Raja was very fond of his daughters. Ever since their mother's death they had cooked his dinner with their own hands, in order to avoid the danger of his being poisoned by his enemies. So, when he found the mud mixed up with his dinner, he thought it must arise from their carelessness, as it did not seem likely that any one should have put mud there on purpose; but being very kind he did not like to reprove them for it, although this spoiling of the curry was repeated many successive days."
"At last, one day, he determined to hide, and watch his daughters cooking, and see how it all happened; so he went into the next room, and watched them through a hole in the wall."
"There he saw his seven daughters carefully washing the rice and preparing the curry, and as each dish was completed, they put it by the fire ready to be cooked. Next he noticed the Prudhan's widow come to the door, and beg for a few sticks from the fire to cook her dinner with. Balna turned to her, angrily, and said, ""Why don't you keep fuel in your own house, and not come here every day and take ours? Sisters, don't give this woman any more wood; let her buy it for herself."""
"Then the eldest sister answered, ""Balna, let the poor woman take the wood and the fire; she does us no harm."" But Balna replied, ""If you let her come here so often, maybe she will do us some harm, and make us sorry for it, some day."""
"The Raja then saw the Prudhan's widow go to the place where all his dinner was nicely prepared, and, as she took the wood, she threw a little mud into each of the dishes."
"At this he was very angry, and sent to have the woman seized and brought before him. But when the widow came, she told him that she had played this trick because she wanted to gain an audience with him; and she spoke so cleverly, and pleased him so well with her cunning words, that instead of punishing her, the Raja married her, and made her his Ranee, and she and her daughter came to live in the palace."
"Now the new Ranee hated the seven poor Princesses, and wanted to get them, if possible, out of the way, in order that her daughter might have all their riches, and live in the palace as Princess in their place; and instead of being grateful to them for their kindness to her, she did all she could to make them miserable. She gave them nothing but bread to eat, and very little of that, and very little water to drink; so these seven poor little Princesses, who had been accustomed to have everything comfortable about them, and good food and good clothes all their lives long, were very miserable and unhappy; and they used to go out every day and sit by their dead mother's tomb and cry and say:"
"""Oh mother, mother, cannot you see your poor children, how unhappy we are, and how we are starved by our cruel step-mother?"""
"One day, whilst they were thus sobbing and crying, lo and behold! a beautiful pomelo tree grew up out of the grave, covered with fresh ripe pomeloes, and the children satisfied their hunger by eating some of the fruit, and every day after this, instead of trying to eat the bad dinner their step-mother provided for them, they used to go out to their mother's grave and eat the pomeloes which grew there on the beautiful tree."
"Then the Ranee said to her daughter, ""I cannot tell how it is, every day those seven girls say they don't want any dinner, and won't eat any; and yet they never grow thin nor look ill; they look better than you do. I cannot tell how it is."" And she bade her watch the seven Princesses, and see if any one gave them anything to eat."
"So next day, when the Princesses went to their mother's grave, and were eating the beautiful pomeloes, the Prudhan's daughter followed them, and saw them gathering the fruit."
"Since the above was written, the account of the death of Governor      Andros is flashed across the wires to us. Verbum sap. Also In      hoc signo vinces."
"The author wishes to express by this means his grateful      acknowledgments to his friends and the public generally for the      great turn-out and general sympathy bestowed upon his relative, the      late Peter B. Stuyvesant, on the sad occasion of his funeral, which      was said to be one of the best attended and most successful      funerals before the war. Should any of his friends be caught in the      same fix, the author will not only cheerfully turn out himself, but      send all hands from his place that can be spared, also a six-seated      wagon and a side-bar buggy."
CHAPTER IX.
SETTLEMENT OF THE MIDDLE STATES.
"The present State of New Jersey was a part of New Netherland, and the Dutch had a trading-post at Bergen as early as 1618. After New Netherland passed into the hands of the Dutch, the Duke of York gave the land lying between the Hudson and the Delaware to Lord Berkeley and Sir George Carteret for Christmas."
"The first permanent English settlement made in the State was at Elizabethtown, named so in honor of Sir George's first wife."
"Berkeley sold his part to some English Quakers. This part was called West Jersey. He claimed that it was too far from town. It was very hard for a lord to clear up land, and Berkeley missed his evenings at the Savage Club, and his nose yearned for a good whiff of real old Rotten Row fog."
"So many disputes arose regarding the title to Jersey that the whole thing finally reverted to the crown in 1702. When there was any trouble over titles in those days it was always settled by letting it revert to the crown. It has been some years now, however, since that has happened in this country."
"Thirty-six years later New Jersey was set apart as a separate royal province, and became a railroad terminus and bathing-place."
"Delaware was settled by the Swedes at Wilmington first, and called New Sweden. I am surprised that the Norsemen, who it is claimed made the first and least expensive summer at Newport, R. I., should not have clung to it."
"They could have made a good investment, and in a few years would have been strong enough to wipe out the Brooklyn police."
"The Swedes, too, had a good foothold in New York, Jersey, and Delaware, also a start in Pennsylvania. But the two nations seemed to yearn for home, and as soon as boats began to run regularly to Stockholm and Christiania, they returned. In later years they discovered Minneapolis and Stillwater."
"William Penn now loomed up on the horizon. He was an English Quaker who had been expelled from Oxford and jugged in Cork also for his religious belief. He was the son of Admiral Sir William Penn, and had a good record. He believed that elocutionary prayer was unnecessary, and that the acoustics of heaven were such that the vilest sinner with no voice-culture could be heard in the remotest portion of the gallery."
"The only thing that has been said against Penn with any sort of semblance of truth was that he had some influence with James II. The Duke of York also stood in with Penn, and used to go about in England bailing William out whenever he was jailed on account of his religious belief."
"Penn was quite a writer (see Appendix). He was the author of ""No Cross, No Crown,"" ""Innocency with her Open Face,"" and ""The Great Cause of Liberty of Conscience."""
"From his father he had inherited a claim against the government for sixteen thousand pounds, probably arrears of pension. He finally received the State of Pennsylvania as payment of the claim. The western boundary took in the Cliff House and Seal Rocks of San Francisco."
"Penn came to America in 1682 and bought his land over again from the Indians. It is not strange that he got the best terms he could out of the Indians, but still it is claimed that they were satisfied, therefore he did not cheat them."
"The Indian, as will be noticed by reading these pages thoughtfully, was never a Napoleon of finance. He is that way down to the present day. If you watch him carefully and notice his ways, you can dicker with him to better advantage than you can with Russell Sage."
"Take the Indian just before breakfast after two or three nights of debauchery, and offer him a jug of absinthe with a horned toad in it for his pony and saddle, and you will get them. Even in his more sober and thoughtful moments you can swap a suit of red medicated flannels with him for a farm."
"Penn gathered about him many different kinds of people, with various sorts and shades of belief. Some were Free-Will and some were Hard-Shell, some were High-Church and reminded one of a Masonic Lodge working at 32°, while others were Low-Church and omitted crossing themselves frequently while putting down a new carpet in the chancel."
"But he was too well known at court, and suspected of knowledge of and participation in some of the questionable acts of King James, so that after the latter's dethronement, and an intimation that Penn had communicated with the exiled monarch, Penn was deprived of his title to Pennsylvania, for which he had twice paid."
"Penn was a constant sufferer at the hands of his associates, who sought to injure him in every way. He rounded out a life of suffering by marrying the second time in 1695."
"In 1708 he was on the verge of bankruptcy, owing to the villany and mismanagement of his agent, and was thrown into Fleet Street Prison, a jail in which he had never before been confined. His health gave way afterwards, and this remarkable man died July 30, 1718."
"Philadelphia was founded in 1683 and work begun on a beautiful building known as the City Hall. Work has steadily progressed on this building from time to time since then, and at this writing it is so near completion as to give promise of being one of the most perfect architectural jobs ever done by the hand of man."
"In two years Philadelphia had sprung from a wilderness, where the rank thistle nodded in the wind, to a town of over two thousand people, exclusive of Indians not taxed. In three years it had gained more than New York had in fifty years. This was due to the fact that the people who came to Philadelphia had nothing to fear but the Indians, while settlers in New York had not only the Indians to defend themselves against, but the police also."
Penn and his followers established the great law that no one who believed in Almighty God should be molested in his religious belief.
"Even the Indians liked Penn, and when the nights were cold they would come and crawl into his bed and sleep with him all night and not kill him at all. The Great Chief of the Tribes, even, did not feel above this, and the two used frequently to lie and talk for hours, Penn doing the talking and the chief doing the lying."
"It is said that, with all the Indian massacres and long wars between the red men and the white, no drop of Quaker blood was ever shed. I quote this from an historian who is much older than I, and with whom I do not wish to have any controversy."
So the man gave him a pair of snow-shoes.
"""When you get on these,"" he said, ""you'll come to my brother, who lives hundreds of miles off; he is lord over all the birds of the air."
"Ask him. When you reach his house, just turn the shoes so that the toes point this way, and they'll come home of themselves."" So when the King reached the house, he turned the shoes as the lord of the beasts had said, and away they went home of themselves."
"So he asked again after Whiteland, and the man called all the birds with a blast of his horn, and asked if any of them knew where Whiteland lay; but none of the birds knew. Now, long, long after the rest of the birds came an old eagle, which had been away ten round years, but he couldn't tell any more than the rest."
"""Well, well,"" said the man, ""I'll lend you a pair of snow-shoes, and, when you get them on, they'll carry you to my brother, who lives hundreds of miles off; he's lord of all the fish in the sea; you'd better ask him. But don't forget to turn the toes of the shoes this way."""
"The King was full of thanks, got on the shoes, and when he came to the man who was lord over the fish of the sea, he turned the toes round, and so off they went home like the other pair. After that, he asked again after Whiteland."
"So the man called the fish with a blast, but no fish could tell where it lay. At last came an old pike, which they had great work to call home, he was such a way off. So when they asked him he said:"
"""Know it? I should think I did! I've been cook there ten years, and to-morrow I'm going there again; for now the queen of Whiteland, whose king is away, is going to wed another husband."""
"""Well!"" said the man, ""as this is so, I'll give you a bit of advice."
"Hereabouts, on a moor, stand three brothers, and here they have stood these hundred years, fighting about a hat, a cloak, and a pair of boots. If any one has these three things he can make himself invisible, and wish himself anywhere he pleases. You can tell them you wish to try the things, and, after that, you'll pass judgment between them, whose they shall be."""
"Yes! the King thanked the man, and went and did as he told him."
"""What's all this?"" he said to the brothers. ""Why do you stand here fighting for ever and a day? Just let me try these things, and I'll give judgment whose they shall be."""
"They were very willing to do this; but, as soon as he had got the hat, cloak, and boots, he said:"
"""When we meet next time, I'll tell you my judgment,"" and with these words he wished himself away."
"So as he went along up in the air, he came up with the North wind."
"""Whither away?"" roared the North Wind."
"""To Whiteland,"" said the King; and then he told him all that had befallen him."
"""Ah,"" said the North Wind, ""you go faster than I you do; for you can go straight, while I have to puff and blow round every turn and corner. But when you get there, just place yourself on the stairs by the side of the door, and then I'll come storming in, as though I were going to blow down the whole castle. And then when the prince, who is to have your Queen, comes out to see what's the matter, just you take him by the collar and pitch him out of doors; then I'll look after him, and see if I can't carry him off."""
"Well, the King did as the North Wind said. He took his stand on the stairs, and when the North Wind came, storming and roaring, and took hold of the castle wall, so that it shook again, the prince came out to see what was the matter. But as soon as ever he came, the King caught him by the collar and pitched him out of doors, and then the North Wind caught him up and carried him off. So when there was an end of him, the King went into the castle, and at first his Queen didn't know him, he was so wan and thin, through wandering so far and being so woeful; but when he shewed her the ring, she was as glad as glad could be; and so the rightful wedding was held, and the fame of it spread far and wide."
SORIA MORIA CASTLE
"Once on a time there was a poor couple who had a son whose name was Halvor. Ever since he was a little boy he would turn his hand to nothing, but just sat there and groped about in the ashes. His father and mother often put him out to learn this trade or that, but Halvor could stay nowhere; for, when he had been there a day or two, he ran away from his master, and never stopped till he was sitting again in the ingle, poking about in the cinders."
"Well, one day a skipper came, and asked Halvor if he hadn't a mind to be with him, and go to sea, and see strange lands. Yes, Halvor would like that very much; so he wasn't long in getting himself ready."
"How long they sailed I'm sure I can't tell; but the end of it was, they fell into a great storm, and when it was blown over, and it got still again, they couldn't tell where they were; for they had been driven away to a strange coast, which none of them knew anything about."
"Well, as there was just no wind at all, they stayed lying wind-bound there, and Halvor asked the skipper's leave to go on shore and look about him; he would sooner go, he said, than lie there and sleep."
"""Do you think now you're fit to show yourself before folk,"" said the skipper, ""why, you've no clothes but those rags you stand in?"""
"But Halvor stuck to his own, and so at last he got leave, but he was to be sure and come back as soon as ever it began to blow. So off he went and found a lovely land; wherever he came there were fine large flat cornfields and rich meads, but he couldn't catch a glimpse of a living soul. Well, it began to blow, but Halvor thought he hadn't seen enough yet, and he wanted to walk a little farther just to see if he couldn't meet any folk. So after a while he came to a broad high road, so smooth and even, you might easily roll an egg along it."
"Halvor followed this, and when evening drew on he saw a great castle ever so far off, from which the sunbeams shone. So as he had now walked the whole day and hadn't taken a bit to eat with him, he was as hungry as a hunter, but still the nearer he came to the castle, the more afraid he got."
"In the castle kitchen a great fire was blazing, and Halvor went into it, but such a kitchen he had never seen in all his born days. It was so grand and fine; there were vessels of silver and vessels of gold, but still never a living soul. So when Halvor had stood there a while and no one came out, he went and opened a door, and there inside sat a Princess who span upon a spinning-wheel."
"""Nay, nay, now!"" she called out, ""dare Christian folk come hither? But now you'd best be off about your business, if you don't want the Troll to gobble you up; for here lives a Troll with three heads."""
"The reason for shooting him stopped yesterday I heard Father say so so it wouldn't be fair, anyhow. I'm very sorry; but I can't so there!"""
"The sportsman said nothing, only he shook his fist at Jane, and then he got on the slide and tried to go toward the Crystal Palace which was not easy, because that way is uphill. So they left him trying, and went on."
"Before they started, the white grouse thanked them in a few pleasant, well-chosen words, and then they took a sideways slanting run and started off again on the great slide, and so away toward the North Pole and the twinkling, beautiful lights."
"The great slide went on and on, and the lights did not seem to come much nearer, and the white silence wrapped around them as they slid along the wide, icy path. Then once again the silence was broken to bits by someone calling: ""Hey! You there! Stop!"""
"""Tumble for your life!"" cried George, and tumbled as before, stopping in the only possible way, and Jane stopped on top of him, and they crawled to the edge and came suddenly on a butterfly collector, who was looking for specimens with a pair of blue glasses and a blue net and a blue book with colored plates."
"""Excuse me,"" said the collector, ""but have you such a thing as a needle about you a very long needle?"""
"""I have a needle book,"" replied Jane, politely, ""but there aren't any needles in it now. George took them all to do the things with pieces of cork in the 'Boy's Own Scientific Experimenter' and 'The Young Mechanic.' He did not do the things, but he did for the needles."""
"""Curiously enough,"" said the collector, ""I too wish to use the needle in connection with cork."""
"""I have a hatpin in my hood,"" said Jane. ""I fastened the fur with it when it caught in the nail on the greenhouse door. It is very long and sharp would that do?"""
"""One could but try,"" said the collector, and Jane began to feel for the pin. But George pinched her arm and whispered, ""Ask what he wants it for."" Then the collector had to own that he wanted the pin to stick through the great Arctic moth, ""a magnificent specimen,"" he added, ""which I am most anxious to preserve."""
"And there, sure enough, in the collector's butterfly net sat the great Arctic moth, listening attentively to the conversation."
"""Oh, I couldn't!"" cried Jane. And while George was explaining to the collector that they would really rather not, Jane opened the blue folds of the butterfly net, and asked the moth quietly if it would please step outside for a moment. And it did."
"When the collector saw that the moth was free, he seemed less angry than grieved."
"""Well, well,"" said he, ""here's a whole Arctic expedition thrown away! I shall have to go home and fit out another. And that means a lot of writing to the papers and things. You seem to be a singularly thoughtless little girl."""
"So they went on, leaving him too, trying to go uphill towards the Crystal Palace."
"When the great white Arctic moth had returned thanks in a suitable speech, George and Jane took a sideways slanting run and started sliding again, between the star-lamps along the great slide toward the North Pole. They went faster and faster, and the lights ahead grew brighter and brighter so that they could not keep their eyes open, but had to blink and wink as they went and then suddenly the great slide ended in an immense heap of snow, and George and Jane shot right into it because they could not stop themselves, and the snow was soft, so that they went in up to their very ears."
"When they had picked themselves out and thumped each other on the back to get rid of the snow, they shaded their eyes and looked, and there, right in front of them, was the wonder of wonders the North Pole towering high and white and glistening, like an ice-lighthouse, and it was quite, quite close, so that you had to put your head as far back as it would go, and farther, before you could see the high top of it. It was made entirely of ice. You will hear grown-up people talk a great deal of nonsense about the North Pole, and when you are grown up, it is even possible that you may talk nonsense about it yourself (the most unlikely things do happen) but deep down in your heart you must always remember that the North Pole is made of clear ice, and could not possibly, if you come to think of it, be made of anything else."
"All around the Pole, making a bright ring about it, were hundreds of little fires, and the flames of them did not flicker and twist, but went up blue and green and rosy and straight like the stalks of dream lilies."
"Jane said so, but George said they were as straight as ramrods."
"And these flames were the Aurora Borealis, which the children had seen as far away as Forest Hill."
"The ground was quite flat, and covered with smooth, hard snow, which shone and sparkled like the top of a birthday cake that has been iced at home. The ones done at the shops do not shine and sparkle, because they mix flour with the icing sugar."
"""It is like a dream,"" said Jane."
"And George said, ""It is the North Pole. Just think of the fuss people always make about getting here and it was no trouble at all, really."""
"""I daresay lots of people have gotten here,"" said Jane, dismally. ""It's not the getting here I see that it's the getting back again."
"Perhaps no one will ever know that we have been here, and the robins will cover us with leaves and """
"""Nonsense,"" said George. ""There aren't any robins, and there aren't any leaves. It's just the North Pole, that's all, and I've found it; and now I shall try to climb up and plant the British flag on the top my handkerchief will do; and if it really is the North Pole, my pocket compass Uncle James gave me will spin around and around, and then I shall know. Come on."""
"So Jane came on; and when they got close to the clear, tall, beautiful flames they saw that there was a great, queer-shaped lump of ice all around the bottom of the Pole clear, smooth, shining ice, that was deep, beautiful Prussian blue, like icebergs, in the thick parts, and all sorts of wonderful, glimmery, shimmery, changing colors in the thin parts, like the cut-glass chandelier in Grandmamma's house in London."
"""It is a very curious shape,"" said Jane. ""It's almost like"" she moved back a step to get a better view of it ""it's almost like a dragon."""
"""It's much more like the lampposts on the Thames Embankment,"" said George, who had noticed a curly thing like a tail that went twisting up the North Pole."
"""Oh, George,"" cried Jane, ""it is a dragon; I can see its wings."
"Whatever shall we do?"""
"And, sure enough, it was a dragon a great, shining, winged, scaly, clawy, big-mouthed dragon made of pure ice. It must have gone to sleep curled around the hole where the warm steam used to come up from the middle of the earth, and then when the earth got colder, and the column of steam froze and was turned into the North Pole, the dragon must have got frozen in his sleep frozen too hard to move and there he stayed."
"""Of corse he will,"" said the hairy boy to the right of Whomsoever J."
"Opper, who afterwards became the father of a lad who grew up to be editor of the Persiflage column of the Atlantic Monthly."
Thus the boys of America impressed General Gage with their courage and patriotism and grew up to be good men.
"An expedition to Canada was fitted out the same winter, and an attack made on Quebec, in which General Montgomery was killed and Benedict Arnold showed that he was a brave soldier, no matter how the historian may have hopped on him afterwards."
"The Americans should not have tried to take Canada. Canada was, as Henry Clay once said, a persimmon a trifle too high for the American pole, and it is the belief of the historian, whose tears have often wet the pages of this record, that in the future Canada will be what America is now, a free country with a national debt of her own, a flag of her own, an executive of her own, and a regular annual crisis of her own, like other nations."
"In 1776 Boston was evacuated. Washington, in order to ascertain whether Lord Howe had a call to fish, cut bait, or go ashore, began to fortify Dorchester Heights, March 17, and on the following morning he was not a little surprised to note the change. As the weather was raw, and he had been in-doors a good deal during the winter, Lord Howe felt the cold very keenly. He went to the window and looked at the Americans, but he would come back chilly and ill-tempered to the fire each time. Finally he hitched up and went away to Halifax, where he had acquaintances."
"On June 28 an attack was made by the English on Fort Moultrie. It was built of palmetto logs, which are said to be the best thing in the world to shoot into if one wishes to recover the balls and use them again."
"Palmetto logs accept and retain balls for many years, and are therefore good for forts."
"When the fleet got close enough to the fort so that the brave Charlestonians could see the expression on the admiral's face, they turned loose with everything they had, grape, canister, solid shot, chain-shot, bar-shot, stove-lids, muffin-irons, newspaper cuts, etc., etc., so that the decks were swept of every living thing except the admiral."
"General Clinton by land tried to draw the attention of the rear gunners of the fort, but he was a poor draughtsman, and so retired, and both the land and naval forces quit Charleston and went to New York, where board was not so high."
July 4 was deemed a good time to write a Declaration of Independence and have it read in the grove.
"Richard Henry Lee, of Virginia, moved that ""the United Colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and Independent states."" John Adams, of Massachusetts, seconded the resolution. This was passed July 2, and the report of the committee appointed to draw up a Declaration of Independence was adopted July 4."
"The Declaration was dictated by Thomas Jefferson, who wrote the most melodious English of any American of his time."
"Jefferson had a vocabulary next to Noah Webster, with all the dramatic power of Dan. He composed the piece one evening after his other work. We give a facsimile of the opening lines."
"Philadelphia was a scene of great excitement. The streets were thronged, and people sat down on the nice clean door-steps with perfect recklessness, although the steps had just been cleaned with ammonia and wiped off with a chamois-skin. It was a day long to be remembered, and one that made George III. wish that he had reconsidered his birth."
"In the steeple of the old State-House was a bell which had fortunately upon it the line ""Proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof."" It was rung by the old man in charge, though he had lacked faith up to that moment in Congress. He believed that Congress would not pass the resolution and adopt the Declaration till after election."
"Thus was the era of good feeling inaugurated both North and South. There was no North then, no South, no East, no West; just one common country, with Washington acting as father of same. Oh, how nice it must have been!"
Washington was one of the sweetest men in the United States. He gave his hand in marriage to a widow woman who had two children and a dark red farm in Virginia.
CHAPTER XVII.
THE BEGINNING OF THE END.
"The British army now numbered thirty thousand troops, while Washington's entire command was not over seven thousand strong. The Howes, one a general and the other an admiral, now turned their attention to New York. Washington, however, was on the ground beforehand."
"Howe's idea was to first capture Brooklyn, so that he could have a place in which to sleep at nights while engaged in taking New York."
"The battle was brief. Howe attacked the little army in front, while General Clinton got around by a circuitous route to the rear of the Colonial troops and cut them off. The Americans lost one thousand men by death or capture. The prisoners were confined in the old sugar-house on Liberty Street, where they suffered the most miserable and indescribable deaths."
"The army of the Americans fortunately escaped by Fulton Ferry in a fog, otherwise it would have been obliterated. Washington now fortified Harlem Heights, and later withdrew to White Plains. Afterwards he retired to a fortified camp called North Castle."
"Howe feared to attack him there, and so sent the Hessians, who captured Fort Washington, November 16."
"It looked scaly for the Americans, as Motley says, and Philadelphia bade fair to join New York and other cities held by the British. The English van could be seen from the Colonial rear column. The American troops were almost barefooted, and left their blood-stained tracks on the frozen road."
"It was at this time that Washington crossed the Delaware and thereby found himself on the other side; while Howe decided to remain, as the river was freezing, and when the ice got strong enough, cross over and kill the Americans at his leisure. Had he followed the Colonial army, it is quite sure now that the English would have conquered, and the author would have been the Duke of Sandy Bottom, instead of a plain American citizen, unknown, unhonored, and unsung."
"Presently the cab drew up near the pillar, and there was the dragon, his ugly purple head shining in the sun, and his ugly purple mouth half open."
"Uncle James said: ""Good morning, sir. We have brought you a small present for your birthday. We do not like to let such an anniversary go by without some suitable testimonial, especially to one who is a stranger in our midst. Our means are small, but our hearts are large. We have but one Princess, but we give her freely do we not, my child?"""
"The Princess said she supposed so, and the dragon came a little nearer."
"Suddenly a voice cried: ""Run!"" and there was Tom, and he had brought the Zoological guinea pig and a pair of Belgian hares with him. ""Just to see fair,"" said Tom."
"Uncle James was furious. ""What do you mean, sir,"" he cried, ""by intruding on a State function with your common rabbits and things? Go away, naughty little boy, and play with them somewhere else."""
"But while he was speaking the rabbits had come up one on each side of him, their great sides towering ever so high, and now they pressed him between them so that he was buried in their thick fur and almost choked."
"The Princess, meantime, had run to the other side of the pillar and was peeping around it to see what was going on. A crowd had followed the cab out of the town; now they reached the scene of the ""State Function"" and they all cried out: ""Fair play play fair! We can't go back on our word like this. Give a thing and take a thing? Why, it's never done. Let the poor exiled stranger dragon have his birthday present."" And they tried to get at Tom but the guinea pig stood in the way."
"""Yes,"" Tom cried. ""Fair play is a jewel. And your helpless exile shall have the Princess if he can catch her. Now then, Mary Ann."""
"Mary Ann looked around the big pillar and called to the dragon: ""Bo! you can't catch me,"" and began to run as fast as ever she could, and the dragon ran after her. When the Princess had run a half mile she stopped, dodged around a tree, and ran back to the pillar and around it, and the dragon after her. You see, he was so long he could not turn as quickly as she could. Around and around the pillar ran the Princess. The first time she ran around a long way from the pillar, and then nearer and nearer with the dragon after her all the time; and he was so busy trying to catch her that he never noticed that Tom had tied the very end of his long, tight, whipcordy tail to the rock, so that the more the dragon ran around, the more times he twisted his tail around the pillar."
"It was exactly like winding a top only the peg was the pillar, and the dragon's tail was the string. And the magician was safe between the Belgian hares, and couldn't see anything but darkness, or do anything but choke."
"When the dragon was wound onto the pillar as much as he possibly could be, and as tight like cotton on a reel the Princess stopped running, and though she had very little breath left, she managed to say, ""Yah who's won now?"""
"This annoyed the dragon so much that he put out all his strength spread his great purple wings, and tried to fly at her. Of course this pulled his tail, and pulled it very hard, so hard that as he pulled the tail had to come, and the pillar had to come around with the tail, and the island had to come around with the pillar, and in another minute the tail was loose, and the island was spinning around exactly like a top. It spun so fast that everyone fell flat on their faces and held on tight to themselves, because they felt something was going to happen."
"All but the magician, who was choking between the Belgian hares, and felt nothing but fur and fury."
"And something did happen. The dragon had sent the kingdom of Rotundia spinning the way it ought to have gone at the beginning of the world, and as it spun around, all the animals began to change sizes. The guinea pigs got small, and the elephants got big, and the men and women and children would have changed sizes too, if they had not had the sense to hold on to themselves, very tight indeed, with both hands; which, of course, the animals could not be expected to know how to do. And the best of it was that when the small beasts got big and the big beasts got small the dragon got small too, and fell at the Princess's feet a little, crawling, purple newt with wings."
"""Funny little thing,"" said the Princess, when she saw it. ""I will take it for a birthday present."""
"But while all the people were still on their faces, holding on tight to themselves, Uncle James, the magician, never thought of holding tight he only thought of how to punish Belgian hares and the sons of gardeners; so when the big beasts grew small, he grew small with the other beasts, and the little purple dragon, when he fell at the Princess's feet, saw there a very small magician named Uncle James. And the dragon took him because it wanted a birthday present."
"So now all the animals were new sizes and at first it seemed very strange to everyone to have great lumbering elephants and a tiny little dormouse, but they have gotten used to it now, and think no more of it than we do."
"All this happened several years ago, and the other day I saw in the Rotundia Times an account of the wedding of the Princess with Lord Thomas Gardener, K.C.D., and I knew she could not have married anyone but Tom, so I suppose they made him a Lord on purpose for the wedding and K.C.D., of course, means Clever Conqueror of the Dragon."
"If you think that is wrong it is only because you don't know how they spell in Rotundia. The paper said that among the beautiful presents of the bridegroom to the bride was an enormous elephant, on which the bridal pair made their wedding tour. This must have been Fido. You remember Tom promised to give him back to the Princess when they were married. The Rotundia Times called the married couple ""the happy pair."" It was clever of the paper to think of calling them that it is such a pretty and novel expression, and I think it is truer than many of the things you see in papers."
"Because, you see, the Princess and the gardener's son were so fond of each other they could not help being happy and besides, they had an elephant of their very own to ride on. If that is not enough to make people happy, I should like to know what is. Though, of course, I know there are some people who could not be happy unless they had a whale to sail on, and perhaps not even then. But they are greedy, grasping people, the kind who would take four helps of pudding, as likely as not, which neither Tom nor Mary Ann ever did."
III. The Deliverers of Their Country
"It all began with Effie's getting something in her eye. It hurt very much indeed, and it felt something like a red-hot spark only it seemed to have legs as well, and wings like a fly. Effie rubbed and cried not real crying, but the kind your eye does all by itself without your being miserable inside your mind and then she went to her father to have the thing in her eye taken out. Effie's father was a doctor, so of course he knew how to take things out of eyes he did it very cleverly with a soft paintbrush dipped in castor oil."
"When he had gotten the thing out, he said: ""This is very curious."" Effie had often got things in her eye before, and her father had always seemed to think it was natural rather tiresome and naughty perhaps, but still natural. He had never before thought it curious."
"Effie stood holding her handkerchief to her eye, and said: ""I don't believe it's out."" People always say this when they have had something in their eyes."
"""Oh, yes it's out,"" said the doctor. ""Here it is, on the brush. This is very interesting."""
"Effie had never heard her father say that about anything that she had any share in. She said: ""What?"""
"The doctor carried the brush very carefully across the room, and held the point of it under his microscope then he twisted the brass screws of the microscope, and looked through the top with one eye."
"""Dear me,"" he said. ""Dear, dear me! Four well-developed limbs; a long caudal appendage; five toes, unequal in lengths, almost like one of the Lacertidae, yet there are traces of wings."" The creature under his eye wriggled a little in the castor oil, and he went on: ""Yes; a batlike wing. A new specimen, undoubtedly. Effie, run round to the professor and ask him to be kind enough to step in for a few minutes."""
"""You might give me sixpence, Daddy,"" said Effie, ""because I did bring you the new specimen. I took great care of it inside my eye, and my eye does hurt."""
"The doctor was so pleased with the new specimen that he gave Effie a shilling, and presently the professor stepped round. He stayed to lunch, and he and the doctor quarreled very happily all the afternoon about the name and the family of the thing that had come out of Effie's eye."
"In the latter part of 1880, at a time when the Washington monument had reached a height of 160 feet, an adventurous and patriotic cat ascended the interior of the shaft by means of the ropes and tubing. When the workmen arrived at the upper landing the next morning, and began to prepare for the day's work, pussy took fright and, springing to the outer edge, took a ""header"" of 160 feet to the hard earth below. In the descent which was watched closely by two score of men, the cat spread herself out like a flying squirrel and alighted on all fours. After turning over on the ground a few times in a dazed manner, she prepared to leave the grounds and had gotten almost beyond the shadow of the monument, when a dog belonging to one of the workmen pounced upon her and killed her, she, of course, not being in her best running trim, after performing such an extraordinary feat. One of the men procured the body of the dead feline, smoothed out her silky coat, and turned the remains over to a representative of the Smithsonian Institution, who mounted the skin and placed it under a glass case. The label on the case tells this wonderful story in a few words: ""This cat on September 23, 1880, jumped from the top of Washington's monument and lived."""
A Brave Queen
"Long ago, when this country was a wild land, there lived a beautiful and brave queen named Boadicea."
"Her husband, the king, was dead, but she had two daughters whom she loved very much."
"Boadicea was queen of a part of Britain. There were no large towns in her land, but there were forests of fine trees, and fields of corn, and wide stretches of grass-land where many cattle and sheep roamed and fed."
"Her people were called Iceni. They were tall and strong, with blue eyes and yellow hair. The men were brave fighters and good hunters. They hunted the bears and wolves which lived in the forests, and they fought the foes of their beautiful queen."
"They made spears to fight with, and strange carts called war-chariots to fight in. These chariots were drawn by swift horses, and, upon the wheels, long sharp knives were fixed. The Iceni drove the chariots very fast among their foes, and the knives cut down and killed many of them."
The Romans from over the sea were the most dangerous enemies of Boadicea and her people.
"In those days the Romans were the best fighters, and the strongest and wisest people in the world. They came in ships to Britain. They had been told that it was a good country, and they hoped to take it for themselves. Some of them came to Boadicea's land, and took a part of it and of her riches. And when she tried to stop them from doing this, they seized her and the two princesses and beat them cruelly."
"This wicked act made the Iceni very angry. From all parts of the land, fierce fighting-men came marching in haste to avenge themselves on their enemies, bringing with them their spears and their war-chariots. When all were gathered together, they fell upon the Romans."
"There were so many of them, and they were so fierce, that the Romans could not stand against them. Thousands were killed, and the rest ran away to their ships."
"But there were many more Romans in other parts of Britain, and when these heard how their friends had been beaten, they came marching in haste to punish the Iceni."
"The Iceni did their best to get ready to defend themselves, but many of their brave men had been slain and others were wounded and weary, so they could not hope again to win a victory over their strong foes."
"Before the battle, Queen Boadicea, with her fair hair waving in the wind, stood before her soldiers and spoke to them. She told them of the wrong which the Romans had done, and begged them to fight bravely for their country. Then she got into her chariot, and with her daughters lying at her feet, drove to and fro, so that all might see them."
"And the soldiers shouted, and promised to fight to the end for their brave queen."
"They did fight long and bravely, until most of them were killed, but their foes were too strong for them. When Queen Boadicea saw that her brave soldiers were beaten, she drank some poison which killed her. She thought it better to die than to be again taken prisoner by the cruel Romans."
King Alfred and the Cakes
"Once, when good King Alfred of England was forced to flee from his strong foes the Danes, he hid himself in a wood. In this wood, there was a small cottage, and Alfred asked the woman who lived there if he might go in and rest."
"Now the woman did not know the king, but she saw that he was an English soldier, and that he was very tired, so she let him come in and sit in her kitchen."
"Upon the hearth before the fire, some cakes were baking, and the woman told the stranger that if he watched them, and took care that they did not burn, she would give him some supper. Then she went away to do her work."
"At first, King Alfred watched the cakes carefully; when they were well cooked on one side he turned the other to the fire. But, after a time, he began to think of his country, and of his poor people, and then he forgot his task."
"When the woman came back, the cakes were black and burnt. ""You are an idle fellow,"" cried she angrily. ""You would be quite ready to eat the cakes, but you will not take the trouble to watch them."""
"While she was loudly scolding, her husband came home. He knew King Alfred. ""Hush, wife!"" cried he. ""It is our noble lord the king!"""
"When the woman heard this, she was much afraid, and she begged Alfred to forgive her."
"The king smiled, and said: ""I will gladly forgive you for your scolding, good wife, if you will forgive me for spoiling your supper."""
"Not Angles, but Angels"
"In old days the people of England were not all free, as they are now."
"Sometimes young men, and women, and little children were sold as slaves, and had to work hard for their masters."
"Many of these slaves were sent to Rome, for the Romans thought the tall, fair Angles very beautiful, and liked to have them as their servants."
And he told them all about it.
"But they all happened to have engagements for that evening; so they praised John's cleverness, and said they were quite content to leave the matter in his hands."
"""But what about my baby?"" said John."
"""Oh, well,"" said the mayor, ""if anything should happen, you will always be able to remember that your baby perished in a good cause."""
"So John went home again, and told his wife some of the tale."
"""You've given the baby to the dragon!"" she cried. ""Oh, you unnatural parent!"""
"""Hush,"" said John, and he told her some more. ""Now,"" he said, ""I'm going down. After I've been down you can go, and if you keep your head the boy will be all right."""
"So down went the blacksmith, and there was the dragon purring away with all his might to keep the baby quiet."
"""Hurry up, can't you?"" he said. ""I can't keep up this noise all night."""
"""I'm very sorry, sir,"" said the blacksmith, ""but all the shops are shut."
"The job must wait till the morning. And don't forget you've promised to take care of that baby. You'll find it a little wearing, I'm afraid."
"Good night, sir."""
"The dragon had purred till he was quite out of breath so now he stopped, and as soon as everything was quiet the baby thought everyone must have settled for the night, and that it was time to begin to scream. So it began."
"""Oh, dear,"" said the dragon, ""this is awful."" He patted the baby with his claw, but it screamed more than ever."
"""And I am so tired too,"" said the dragon. ""I did so hope I should have a good night."""
The baby went on screaming.
"""There'll be no peace for me after this,"" said the dragon. ""It's enough to ruin one's nerves. Hush, then did 'ums, then."" And he tried to quiet the baby as if it had been a young dragon. But when he began to sing ""Hush-a-by, Dragon,"" the baby screamed more and more and more. ""I can't keep it quiet,"" said the dragon; and then suddenly he saw a woman sitting on the steps. ""Here, I say,"" said he, ""do you know anything about babies?"""
"""I do, a little,"" said the mother."
"""Then I wish you'd take this one, and let me get some sleep,"" said the dragon, yawning. ""You can bring it back in the morning before the blacksmith comes."""
"So the mother picked up the baby and took it upstairs and told her husband, and they went to bed happy, for they had caught the dragon and saved the baby."
"And next day John went down and explained carefully to the dragon exactly how matters stood, and he got an iron gate with a grating to it and set it up at the foot of the steps, and the dragon mewed furiously for days and days, but when he found it was no good he was quiet."
"So now John went to the mayor, and said: ""I've got the dragon and I've saved the town."""
"""Noble preserver,"" cried the mayor, ""we will get up a subscription for you, and crown you in public with a laurel wreath."""
"So the mayor put his name down for five pounds, and the corporation each gave three, and other people gave their guineas and half guineas and half crowns and crowns, and while the subscription was being made the mayor ordered three poems at his own expense from the town poet to celebrate the occasion. The poems were very much more admired, especially by the mayor and corporation."
"The first poem dealt with the noble conduct of the mayor in arranging to have the dragon tied up. The second described the splendid assistance rendered by the corporation. And the third expressed the pride and joy of the poet in being permitted to sing such deeds, beside which the actions of St. George must appear quite commonplace to all with a feeling heart or a well-balanced brain."
"When the subscription was finished there was a thousand pounds, and a committee was formed to settle what should be done with it. A third of it went to pay for a banquet to the mayor and corporation; another third was spent in buying a gold collar with a dragon on it for the mayor and gold medals with dragons on them for the corporation; and what was left went in committee expenses."
"So there was nothing for the blacksmith except the laurel wreath and the knowledge that it really was he who had saved the town. But after this things went a little better with the blacksmith. To begin with, the baby did not cry so much as it had before. Then the rich lady who owned the goat was so touched by John's noble action that she ordered a complete set of shoes at 2 shillings, 4 pence, and even made it up to 2 shillings, 6 pence, in grateful recognition of his public-spirited conduct. Then tourists used to come in breaks from quite a long way off, and pay twopence each to go down the steps and peep through the iron grating at the rusty dragon in the dungeon and it was threepence extra for each party if the blacksmith let off colored fire to see it by, which, as the fire was extremely short, was twopence-halfpenny clear profit every time. And the blacksmith's wife used to provide teas at ninepence a head, and altogether things grew brighter week by week."
"The baby named John, after his father, and called Johnnie for short began presently to grow up. He was great friends with Tina, the daughter of the whitesmith, who lived nearly opposite. She was a dear little girl with yellow pigtails and blue eyes, and she was tired of hearing the story of how Johnnie, when he was a baby, had been minded by a real dragon."
"The two children used to go together to peep through the iron grating at the dragon, and sometimes they would hear him mew piteously. And they would light a halfpenny's worth of colored fire to look at him by. And they grew older and wiser."
"At last one day the mayor and corporation, hunting the hare in their gold gowns, came screaming back to the town gates with the news that a lame, humpy giant, as big as a tin church, was coming over the marshes toward the town."
"""We're lost,"" said the mayor. ""I'd give a thousand pounds to anyone who could keep that giant out of the town. I know what he eats by his teeth."""
"No one seemed to know what to do. But Johnnie and Tina were listening, and they looked at each other, and ran off as fast as their boots would carry them."
moment a German soldier on leave came up and spat in his face. The
Frenchman felled the German with a resounding box on the ear.
Alarums! Excursions! A German officer rushed up to enquire while the
Frenchman was struggling with two colossal German military policemen
and the Englishman was striving to free him. Vivie explained to the
officer what had occurred. He bowed and saluted: seized the
soldier-spitter by the collar and kicked him so frightfully that
Vivie had to implore him to cease.
Moreover the Red Placards of von Bissing were of increasing
frequency. As a rule Vivie only heard what other people said of
"them, and that wasn't very much, for German spies were everywhere,"
inviting you to follow them to the dreaded Kommandantur in the Rue
de la Loi--a scene of as much in the way of horror and mental
anguish as the Conciergerie of Paris in the days of the Red Terror.
But some cheek-blanching rumour she had heard on a certain Monday in
October caused her to look next day on her way home at a fresh Red
Placard which had been posted up in a public place. The daylight had
"almost faded, but there was a gas lamp which made the notice"
legible. It ran:
CONDAMNATIONS
"Par jugement du 9 Octobre, 1915, le tribunal de campagne a"

and a glass; but in the act of pouring out a drink for him there came a
"loud rap on the window, and quickly looking round she saw Rance's"
"piercing eyes peering into the room. For an instant she paled, but then"
there flashed through her mind the comforting thought that the Sheriff
"could not possibly see Johnson from his position. So, after giving the"
"latter his drink, she waited quietly until a rap at the door told her"
"that Rance had left the window when, her eye having lit on the ladder"
"that was held in place on the ceiling, she quickly ran over to it and"
"let it down, saying:"
"""Go up the ladder! Climb up there to the loft You're the man that's got"
"my first kiss an' I'm goin' to save you . . ."""
"""Oh, no, not here,"" protested Johnson, stubbornly."
"""Do you want them to see you in my cabin?"" she cried reproachfully,"
trying to lift him to his feet.
"""Oh, hurry, hurry . . .!"""
With the utmost difficulty Johnson rose to his feet and catching the
rounds of the ladder he began to ascend. But after going up a few rounds
"he reeled and almost fell off, gasping:"
"""I can't make it--no, I can't . . ."""
"""Yes, you can,"" encouraged the Girl; and then, simultaneously with"
"another loud knock on the door: ""You're the man I love an' you"
"must--you've got to show me the man that's in you. Oh, go on, go on,"
"jest a step an' you'll git there."""
"""But I can't,"" came feebly from the voice above. Nevertheless, the next"
"""By the time I'm through here, Sallie will be ready to go ashore."""
"Captain Dove looked very fiercely at him, but without effect."
"""Sallie won't stir a step from the ship,"" the old man affirmed, ""till"
"you've handed over the cash."""
"Slyne looked up, in mild surprise."
"""But, dear me! Dove,"" he remarked, ""you don't expect that the London"
lawyer's going to take my word for a girl he's never even seen? Until
"he's satisfied on that point, he won't endorse my note to you. So we've"
_got_ to take her along with us. I'm doing my best to give you a square
"deal; and all I ask in return is a square deal from you."""
"""You'd better not try any crooked games with me,"" growled Captain Dove,"
and sat for a time sunk in obviously aggravating reflections.
"""If we get on his soft side,"" suggested Slyne insidiously, ""there's no"
"saying how much more we might both make."""
Captain Dove rose and retired into his sleeping-cabin without further
"words; while Slyne, picking out with a two-pronged fork the cleanest of"
"the beans on his plate, smiled sneeringly to himself."
"""What's the latest long-shore fashion, Slyne?"" the old man asked after"
an interval. Slyne knew by his tone that he had dismissed dull care from
his mind and was prepared to be quarrelsome again.
"""It wouldn't suit a figure like yours,"" he answered coolly, and was"
"gratified to hear another hoarse growl. For, strange though it may seem,"
"Captain Dove was not without vanity. ""All you really need to worry about"
"""You must not stop here,"" he said. ""You have frightened us all"
terribly. The regiment has come and is attacking. There will be some
"desperate fighting. We must all stick together."""
She caught Nicholson's eyes resting on her. She thought she read pity
"and sympathy in their steady depths, and wondered if he guessed what"
"she had tried to do. But he said nothing, and she followed the two men"
blindly and indifferently back to the bungalow.
CHAPTER X
TRAVERS
"They had no light. They talked in whispers, and now and again, when"
"the darkness grew too oppressive, they stretched out groping hands and"
touched each other. They did this without explanation. Though none
"complained or spoke of fear, each needed the consolation of the"
"other's company, and a touch was worth more than words. Mrs. Cary"
alone needed nothing. She lay on the rough truckle-bed and slept. Thus
she had been for a week--a whole week of nerve-wrecking struggle
against odds which marked hope as vain. Bullets had beaten like rain
"upon the walls about her, the moaning of wounded men on the other side"
of the hastily constructed partition mingled unceasingly with the
cries of the ever-nearing enemy. And she had lain there quiet and
"indifferent. Martins, the regiment's doctor, had looked in once at her"
"and had shaken his head. ""In all probability she will never wake,"" he"
"had said. ""Perhaps it is the kindest thing that could happen to her."""
"Lights were flashing here and there, and when Jimmie at last found"
"himself inside the chimney, he knew that the very room he had recently"
left was being occupied by the outlaws.
"The electric light was out again, and the boy groped with his hands in"
the darkness. Much to his surprise they failed to locate his chum.
“Ned!” he called softly. “Where are you hiding?”
Jimmie heard a chuckle in the darkness and felt a hand on his shoulder.
Then Ned whispered in his ear:
“I guess I’ve stumbled on one of the hidden cells of the mission!” he
said. “Anyway there’s a hole leading out of this chimney that’s big
enough to keep house in.”
"“We’ll be finding a train of cars and an East river ferryboat next,”"
Jimmie chuckled. “We always do find something when we go away from camp.
"If we don’t find anything else, we find trouble.”"
"It was thought safe, now, to turn on the electric light. The rays showed"
a room perhaps twelve feet in size with furniture and furnishings of the
description of those in the chamber below. Although the apartment seemed
to be somewhere near the center of a lofty finger of rock which lifted
"from the eastern slope of the mountain, the air was remarkably fresh and"
pure.
"“There’s an opening somewhere,” Ned suggested. “A shut-in room like this"
would asphyxiate one if there were no ventilation.”
“Then I think we’d better be finding it!” Jimmie advised. “Just listen
to those fellows chewing the rag in the room we recently left!”
"standing, his great height bringing him so near to the low boards of the"
loft where her lover was lying that it seemed as though he must hear the
"wounded man's breathing, all other feelings were swept away by"
overwhelming fear. With the one thought that she must get rid of
"him,--do anything, say anything, but get rid of him quickly, she forced"
"herself forward, with extended hand, and said in a voice that held out"
new promise:
"""Good-night. Jack Rance,--good-night!"""
"Rance seized the hand with an almost fierce gladness in both his own,"
"his keen glance hungrily striving to read her face. Then, suddenly, he"
"released her, drawing back his hand with a quick sharpness."
"""Why, look at my hand! There's blood on it!"" he said."
"And even as he spoke, under the yellow flare of the lamp, the Girl saw a"
"second drop of blood fall at her feet. Like a flash, the terrible"
significance of it came upon her. Only by self-violence could she keep
"her glance from rising, tell-tale, to the boards above."
"""Oh, I'm so sorry,"" she heard herself saying contritely, all the time"
"desperately groping to invent a reason; at length, she added futilely:"
"""I must have scratched you."""
"Rance looked puzzled, staring at the spatter of red as though"
hypnotised.
"""No, there's no scratch there,"" he contended, wiping off the blood with"
his handkerchief.
"""Oh, yes, there is,"" insisted the Girl tremulously; ""that is, there will"
cranks as ever handled timber.  So the clerk said.  And one had a
hankerin' for teak and another for hoak (with odd leanin's now and
"agin for Hafrican and Portugee and French hoak), and another he said"
"'Cuban Sabicu,' and another's word was 'Hackmatack' and 'chestnut'"
hevery time.  So they shoved in bits here and bits there till she was
a reg'lar junk-shop o' samples.  And that's the reason she's a
"foreign talking argument ship.  And a mighty good reason too."""
The crowd listened in silence.
"""If you knew as much about arguin' as you know (_seemin'ly_) about"
"timbers as no man ever heerd of, your argument might stand,"" said"
"Mackenzie, a withered old foc'sle man.  ""But it ain't to reason as"
the natur' of the woods in a ship should make us talk this way or
"that.  If so be a ship was built o' teak, d'ye think we'd talk the"
"'jildy jow,' you black 'son of a gun' lingo?"""
Hart shook his head.
"""No ship ain't never built all of teak as I ever heerd of, and so"
"your eye's out, Mac.  But a man with 'arf an eye could see the"
knowledge of her bein' so built might lead right hup to talk about
"the stren'ths of the countries as well of the vally of their timbers."""
"""So they might,"" said the almost convinced crowd.  ""Now Jack Hart 'as"
"the gift, so to speak, of seein' through things."""
"""And once started, who'd stop it?"" asked Jack triumphantly.  ""I"
"knowed a ship as 'ad fresh crowd after fresh crowd in her, but she"
for ever 'ad a black cat aboard.  And they talked 'cat' to make you
sick.  And I knowed another as 'ad from launch to her hultimate

"oldest and most autonomic system of the body, appear in consciousness as"
"'an intrusion from without, an inexplicable obsession.']"

CHAPTER VI
AVIATION IN DREAMS
Dreams of Flying and Falling--Their Peculiar Vividness--Dreams of
Flying an Alleged Survival of Primeval Experiences--Best explained
as based on Respiratory Sensations combined with Cutaneous
Anaesthesia--The Explanation of Dreams of Falling--The Sensation
of Levitation sometimes experienced by Ecstatic Saints--Also
experienced at the Moment of Death.
"Dreams of flying, with the dreams of falling they are sometimes associated"
"with, may fairly be considered the best known and most frequent type of"
dream. They were among the earliest dreams to attract attention. Ruths
"argues that the Greek conception of the flying Hermes, the god who"
"possessed special authority over dreams, was based on such experiences."
"Lucretius, in his interesting passage on the psychology of dreaming,"
speaks of falling from heights in dreams;[100] Cicero appears to refer
to dreams of flying; St. Jerome mentions that he was subject to them;
Synesius remarked that in dreams we fly with wings and view the world
from afar; Cervantes accurately described the dream of falling.[101] From
Tildy could not keep the delightful secret. When trade was slack she
went and stood at Bogle’s desk. Her eyes were shining; she tried not to
let her words sound proud and boastful.
"“A gentleman insulted me to-day,” she said. “He hugged me around the"
waist and kissed me.”
"“That so?” said Bogle, cracking open his business armour. “After this"
week you get a dollar a week more.”
At the next regular meal when Tildy set food before customers with whom
"she had acquaintance she said to each of them modestly, as one whose"
merit needed no bolstering:
“A gentleman insulted me to-day in the restaurant. He put his arm
around my waist and kissed me.”
"The diners accepted the revelation in various ways—some incredulously,"
some with congratulations; others turned upon her the stream of
badinage that had hitherto been directed at Aileen alone. And Tildy’s
"heart swelled in her bosom, for she saw at last the towers of Romance"
rise above the horizon of the grey plain in which she had for so long
travelled.
For two days Mr. Seeders came not again. During that time Tildy
"established herself firmly as a woman to be wooed. She bought ribbons,"
"and arranged her hair like Aileen’s, and tightened her waist two"
inches. She had a thrilling but delightful fear that Mr. Seeders would
rush in suddenly and shoot her with a pistol. He must have loved her
desperately; and impulsive lovers are always blindly jealous.
difficulties personally had produced an unexpected dividend.
"""As you say, _Mino-sama_,"" Ikeda bowed. ""I merely wanted to make you"
aware of my concern about the pilot. He should be monitored more
"closely from now on."""
"""Which is precisely what I intend to do."" Tanzan Mino's silver hair"
"seemed to blend with the sea beyond. ""There is an obvious solution."
"When he takes the vehicle hypersonic, he will not be alone."""
"""What are you suggesting? No one else--"""
"""Merely a simple security precaution. If he is not reliable, then steps"
"must be taken. Two of our people will be in the cockpit with him."""
"""You mean the scientists from Tsukuba? The cockpit was designed to"
"accommodate a three-man crew, but MITI hasn't yet designated the two"
"researchers."""
"""No. I mean my personal pilot and copilot. From the Boeing. Then if"
"Androv deviates from the prescribed test program in any way, they will"
"be there, ready to take immediate action. The problem is solved."" He"
"revolved back from the window. ""That will be all."""
"Ikeda bowed, then turned and hurriedly made his way toward the door. He"
"didn't like last-minute improvisations, but the CEO was now fully in"
command. Preparations for two additional life-support systems would
have to be started immediately.
"After Tanzan Mino watched him depart, he reached down and activated a"
line of personal video monitors beside his desk.
"""Welcome to the wonderful world of Tanzan Mino. I don't know where the"
"hell we are, but it's definitely not Kansas, or London."""
"""My head feels like I was at ground zero when the bomb hit. My whole"
"body aches."" She groaned and plopped back down on the futon. ""What time"
"do you think it is?"""
"""Haven't a clue. How about starting with what day?"" He felt for his"
"watch and realized it was gone. ""What does it matter anyway? Nobody has"
"clocks in never-never land."""
"Satisfied she was okay, he stood up and surveyed the room. Then he saw"
"what he'd expected. There in the center of the ceiling, integrated into"
"the pattern of light-colored woods, was the glass eye of a video"
camera.
And the music. Still the faint music.
He walked on down to the far end of her room and shoved aside another
"set of sliding doors, also painted with the double-ax insignia. He"
"found himself looking at a third large space, this one paneled in raw"
"cypress. It was vast, and in the center was a cedar hot tub, sunk into"
"the floor. The water was fresh and steaming, and two tiny stools and"
rinsing pails were located conveniently nearby on the redwood decking.
"It was a traditional _o-furo_, one of the finest he'd ever seen."
"""You're not going to believe this."" He turned back and waved her"
forward. In the soft rice-paper glow of the lamp she looked rakishly
disheveled. Japanese architecture always made him think of lovemaking.
"""Our host probably figured we'd want to freshen up for the festivities."
"Check it out."""
type of singing.
Since the standard of music and words in the Gospel Songs is
considerably below that which prevails in our best hymnals as well as in
"secular music and literature taught in the public schools, churches"
should seriously consider the ultimate effect of their too frequent use.
It is a fallacy to assert that the people will respond to nothing
"better. Gospel Songs have a legitimate place, particularly in special"
"services and revivals, but they leave much to be desired in the total"
work and worship of the church. Neither the music nor the words possess
the strength and dignity entirely adequate for the worshipful praise of
the Eternal.
The principal names associated with Gospel Songs are the following:
"_Authors._ Fanny J. Crosby, Philip P. Bliss, Robert Lowry, Katherine"
"Hankey, E. A. Hoffman, and many others. Most of the words, though not"
"all, were written by Americans during the latter part of the nineteenth"
century. Miss Crosby was by far the most prolific of them all and many
of her works are found in all modern hymnals of denominations that use
"this type of music. In Germany, Ernst Gebhardt became the leader of the"
"gospel song movement, composing words and music, publishing numerous"
"song books, and serving as song leader in great revival meetings."
"_Music._ William B. Bradbury, Robert Lowry, W. H. Doane, Philip Philips,"
"James McGranahan, George C. Stebbins, P. P. Bliss, D. W. Towner, Wm. J."
"Kirkpatrick, and others."
"_Song Leaders._ P. P. Bliss, Ira Sankey, James McGranahan, George C."
"Stebbins, Charles Alexander, Homer Rodeheaver."
It should be noted that there is no absolute line of demarcation between
"""Frankly, I haven't had time to read them. However, I think there is"
little doubt as to the mood of my people. They will be indignant and
"angry at Washington bungling."""
He pointed to another hand.
"""Senator, granting the details you outlined are accurate, have you any"
"knowledge as to--"""
"""Young man. _Every_ detail I outlined was completely accurate."" Senator"
Crane withered the reporter with a hostile look and pointed elsewhere.
"""Senator, did you consult with the people responsible for handling the"
"situation before making your speech?"""
"""I tried. I was willing to co-operate in every way, but my patience ran"
"out. Also, I was alarmed at the bungling and inefficiency I saw. For"
"that reason I went straight to the people with my story."""
"""Senator, I have a wire from the governor of your state. It just arrived"
in response to my query as to his attitude on this affair. The governor
"says, quote, _No comment_, unquote. Would _you_ care to comment on his"
"statement?"""
Senator Crane thought he heard a faint ripple of mirth drift across the
"room. But, of course, he had to be mistaken. ""I think the governor"
replied wisely. I expect to return home and confer with him as soon as
"possible."""
"""Senator, can you explain why, out of all the able, sincere officials in"
"Washington, D.C., elected or otherwise, you were the only one with"
"""You know what I mean. They probably don't realize it yet, but you're"
going to end up with the Soviet Far East in your wallet. For the price
"of a hot airplane, you get to plunder the region. They're even going to"
be thanking you while you reclaim Sakhalin for Japan. This _Daedalus_
spaceship is going to cost them the ranch. Have to admit it's
brilliant. Along with financing the whole scheme by swindling Benelux
"tax dodgers."""
"""You are too imaginative for your own good, Dr. Vance,"" he said, a thin"
"smile returning. ""Nobody is going to believe your interpretation of the"
"protocol."""
"""You've got a point. Nobody appreciates the true brilliance of a"
"criminal mind. Or maybe they just haven't known you as long as I have."""
"""Really, I'd hoped we would not descend to trading insults."" He reached"
"to refill Vance's sake saucer. ""It's demeaning. Instead I'd hoped we"
"could proceed constructively."""
"""Why not."""
"""Well then, perhaps you'll forgive me if I'm somewhat blunt. I'm afraid"
my time is going to be limited over the next few hours. I may as well
tell you now that we are about to have the first hypersonic test of the
_Daedalus_. Tomorrow morning we will take her to Mach 25. Seventeen
thousand miles per hour. A speed almost ten times greater than any air-
"breathing vehicle has ever before achieved."""
"""The sky's the limit,"" he whistled quietly. Alex hadn't known the half"
of it. This was the ultimate plane.
"""Impressive, I think you'll agree."" Mino smiled and poured more sake"
serious and convincing tone that the sergeant's eyes burned with
"curiosity, and, telling him that he would see if the papers were in his"
"desk, he went through the door behind the bar.  Two minutes later he"
"returned with the papers in his hand, and an expression of extreme"
astonishment on his face.
"""Here they are; the deeds about the damned houses!"""
"""Ah!  You ... vagabond!  And you pretend to have been a soldier, too!"""
"And Kuvalda did not cease to belabour him with his tongue, as he"
"snatched the blue parchment from his hands. Then, spreading the papers"
"out in front of him, and excited all the more by Vaviloff's"
"inquisitiveness, the Captain began reading and bellowing at the same"
"time.  At last he got up resolutely, and went to the door, leaving all"
"the papers on the bar, and saying to Vaviloff:"
"""Wait!  Don't lift them!"""
"Vaviloff gathered them up, put them into the cash-box, and locked it,"
"then felt the lock with his hand, to see if it were secure. After that,"
"he scratched his bald head, thoughtfully, and went up on the roof of"
the eating-house.  There he saw the Captain measuring the front of the
"house, and watched him anxiously, as he snapped his fingers, and began"
"measuring the same line over again. Vaviloff's face lit up suddenly,"
and he smiled happily.
"""Aristid Fomich, is it possible?"" he shouted, when the Captain came"
opposite to him.
"""Of course it is possible.  There is more than one short in the front"
"alone, and as to the depth I shall see immediately."""
"At that hour before the theatres rose, a lull brooded in the London"
"streets; in this quiet narrow one, the town's hum was only broken by the"
clack of a half-drunken woman bickering at her man as they lurched along
"for home, and the strains of a street musician's fiddle, trying to make"
"up for a blank day.  The sound vaguely irritated Winton, reminding him of"
those two damnable foreigners by whom she had been so treated.  To have
them at the point of a sword or pistol--to teach them a lesson!  He heard
her say:
"""Dad, I should like to pay his debts.  Then things would be as they were"
"when I married him."""
He emitted an exasperated sound.  He did not believe in heaping coals of
fire.
"""I want to make sure, too, that the girl is all right till she's over her"
"trouble.  Perhaps I could use some of that--that other money, if mine is"
"all tied up?"""
"It was sheer anger, not disapproval of her impulse, that made him"
hesitate; money and revenge would never be associated in his mind. Gyp
went on:
"""I want to feel as if I'd never let him marry me.  Perhaps his debts are"
"all part of that--who knows?  Please!"""
"Winton looked at her.  How like--when she said that ""Please!""  How"
"like--her figure sunk back in the old chair, and the face lifted in"
shadow!  A sort of exultation came to him.  He had got her back--had got
her back!
"Vera Karanova stared at him, her dark eyes flooding with concern. ""But"
"you said the transaction was scheduled for Westminster Union Bank, this"
"morning at ten-thirty."""
"""That was merely a diversion."" Novosty leaned back. ""The actual"
"arrangement is turned around. For security reasons."""
"""I don't like this."" Her displeasure was obvious, and mounting. ""There"
"is no reason--"""
"""It's better, I assure you."" He withdrew a white tin of Balkan Sobranie"
"cigarettes from his coat, snapped it open, and withdrew one. Made of"
"fine Turkish Yenidje tobacco, they were what he always smoked on"
important days. This was an important day.
"As he flicked his lighter and drew in the first lungful of rich smoke,"
he thought about how much he hated the dark-haired woman seated beside
"him, dressed in a gray Armani business suit, sable coat, Cartier"
"jewelry. The bad blood between them traced back over five years, begin-"
ning with a T-Directorate reshuffle in which she'd moved up to the
"number three slot, cutting him out of a well-deserved promotion. The"
rumor going around Dzerzhinsky Square was that she'd done it by making
"the right connections, so to speak. It was the kind of in-house screw-"
"job Alex Novosty didn't soon forget, of forgive."
"Their black limo was now passing the Royal Courts of Justice, on the"

intersected the end of Saint Swithins Lane. Just a few blocks more.

4. Hymns of the Western Church: Latin.
Two great names are associated with the music of the Western Church:
"Ambrose, c. 340-97, known as the “Father of Hymnody in the Western"
"Church;” and Gregory the Great, 540-604, the missionary-minded pope, and"
reformer of church music.
"Ambrose, Bishop of Milan, not only composed hymns and music but"
stimulated others to do the same. Under his leadership there developed a
"large body of church music based upon four scales, which came to be"
"known as Ambrosian Chant. Although widely known as a scholar,"
"theologian, and preacher, Ambrose’s most lasting influence was upon the"
music of the church. None of his hymns are found in our collection.
"Gregory the Great, two centuries later, carried forward the work of"
"Ambrose. He added four more scales or modes to the Ambrosian system,"
thus giving to the repertory of church music more definiteness and
variety. The music that developed during the papacy of Gregory came to
"be known as Gregorian Chant, or plainsong, or plainchant. It is “plain”"
"because unadorned, unharmonized and unmeasured. Its rhythm is the free"
"rhythm of speech, the beats falling irregularly. The Gregorian Chant"
remained the music of the church for a thousand years and forms the
a nice room. It ain’t often vacant. I had some most elegant people in
"it last summer—no trouble at all, and paid in advance to the minute."
The water’s at the end of the hall. Sprowls and Mooney kept it three
months. They done a vaudeville sketch. Miss B’retta Sprowls—you may
"have heard of her—Oh, that was just the stage names—right there over"
"the dresser is where the marriage certificate hung, framed. The gas is"
"here, and you see there is plenty of closet room. It’s a room everybody"
likes. It never stays idle long.”
“Do you have many theatrical people rooming here?” asked the young man.
“They comes and goes. A good proportion of my lodgers is connected with
"the theatres. Yes, sir, this is the theatrical district. Actor people"
"never stays long anywhere. I get my share. Yes, they comes and they"
goes.”
"He engaged the room, paying for a week in advance. He was tired, he"
"said, and would take possession at once. He counted out the money. The"
"room had been made ready, she said, even to towels and water. As the"
"housekeeper moved away he put, for the thousandth time, the question"
that he carried at the end of his tongue.
“A young girl—Miss Vashner—Miss Eloise Vashner—do you remember such a
"one among your lodgers? She would be singing on the stage, most likely."
"A fair girl, of medium height and slender, with reddish, gold hair and"
a dark mole near her left eyebrow.”
"“No, I don’t remember the name. Them stage people has names they change"
"as often as their rooms. They comes and they goes. No, I don’t call"
that one to mind.”
No. Always no. Five months of ceaseless interrogation and the

way to dine all by my lonely self when you came tumbling around the
corner. You come with me and we’ll have a cozy dinner and a pleasant
"talk together, and by that time your game ankle will carry you home"
"very nicely, I am sure.”"
"The girl looked quickly up into Chandler’s clear, pleasant countenance."
"Her eyes twinkled once very brightly, and then she smiled ingenuously."
"“But we don’t know each other—it wouldn’t be right, would it?” she"
"said, doubtfully."
"“There is nothing wrong about it,” said the young man, candidly. “I’ll"
"introduce myself—permit me—Mr. Towers Chandler. After our dinner, which"
"I will try to make as pleasant as possible, I will bid you"
"good-evening, or attend you safely to your door, whichever you prefer.”"
"“But, dear me!” said the girl, with a glance at Chandler’s faultless"
attire. “In this old dress and hat!”
"“Never mind that,” said Chandler, cheerfully. “I’m sure you look more"
charming in them than any one we shall see in the most elaborate dinner
toilette.”
"“My ankle does hurt yet,” admitted the girl, attempting a limping step."
"“I think I will accept your invitation, Mr. Chandler. You may call"
me—Miss Marian.”
"“Come then, Miss Marian,” said the young architect, gaily, but with"
perfect courtesy; “you will not have far to walk. There is a very
respectable and good restaurant in the next block. You will have to
lean on my arm—so—and walk slowly. It is lonely dining all by one’s

"I gave him my hand for answer, and told him I would bring Frances to him"
early the following morning.
"I hastened back to Whitehall, and coming upon Frances unengaged, asked"
"her to go to her parlor with me. When she had closed the door, she turned"
"to me, asking:--"
"""What is it, Baron Ned? Tell me quickly. I know there is something wrong"
"with George."""
"""Will you go with me early to-morrow morning to see Betty--very early?"""
I asked.
"Her eyes opened in wonder, and she answered, somewhat amused: ""You have"
"been acting as my guardian for a long time, cousin Ned, and now I think I"
owe it to you to return the favor. You should not see so much of Betty. I
"know you mean no wrong to her, but you will cause her great suffering if"
"you continue to see her, for you must know that already the girl is"
"almost mad with love of you. Yet you cannot marry her."""
"""Nor can you marry some one else,"" I retorted, almost angrily, for a man"
dislikes to be prodded by a painful truth.
"""Ah, well, I suppose we are a pair of fools,"" she said."
"""You're right, Frances,"" I answered philosophically, ""and the only"
"""Come inside,"" Mr. Jobling begged hurriedly, and, looking round as he"
"followed them into his sanctum, ""Mullins!"" he snapped, ""don't stand"
"there staring. Get on with your work, at once."
"""You're later than I expected,"" he remarked to Slyne as he closed the"
"door, ""but just in time. The Court's closed, of course, for the"
"Christmas vacation, but I've filed an application for a hearing in"
"Chambers, and--"""
"He paused as a telephone-bell rang shrilly outside, and a moment later"
"the shock head of his ""managing clerk"" protruded into the room, almost"
as if it did not belong to a body at all.
"""Mr. Spettigrew says that our application in Chambers will be heard by"
"Mr. Justice Gaunt, in 57B, at eleven-thirty sharp this forenoon,"""
"announced that youth and, with a final wriggle of his long neck,"
withdrew.
"""Devil take him!"" exclaimed Captain Dove, somewhat startled and much"
"incensed. ""I wouldn't keep a crested cobra like that about me for--"""
"""Let's see those accounts of yours, now,"" said Slyne, disregarding that"
"interruption, and Mr. Jobling, having first looked at his watch,"
"produced from another drawer a great sheaf of papers, all carefully"
docketed. He slipped off the top one and somewhat reluctantly handed
that to his friend.
"Slyne took it from him eagerly, and sat for a time gloating over it with"
eyes which presently began to glow.
"But when Captain Dove, growing restless, would have glanced over his"
"settled his saucer on the _tatami _and looked up. ""Of course, any"
"questions you have, I would be--"""
"""Okay, how's this. What do you expect to get out of me?"""
"He laughed. ""Why nothing at all. Our reunion here is merely intended to"
serve as a tutorial. To remind you and others how upsetting I find
"intrusions into my affairs."""
"""Then how about starting off this 'tutorial' with a look at your new"
"plane?"" Vance glanced around. ""Guess I should call it _Daedalus_."""
"""_Daedalus I _and_ II. _There actually are two prototypes, although"
only one is currently certified to operate in the hypersonic regime.
"Yes, I expected the _Daedalus_ would intrigue you. You are a man of"
"insatiable intellectual appetite."""
"""I'm not sure that's necessarily a compliment."""
"""It wasn't necessarily meant to be. Sometimes curiosity needs to be"
"curbed. But if we can agree on certain matters, I shall enjoy providing"
"you a personal tour, to satisfy that curiosity. You are a man who can"
well appreciate both my technological achievement and my strategic

(_b_) The wife of a knight or baronet is _Lady_. Whether this title
precedes or follows her forename depends upon whether she had a title
before her marriage.
"That is, if Lady Mary Smith marries Sir John Brown (either knight or"
"baronet), she is _Lady Mary Brown_, also if Hon. Mary Smith marries"
Sir John Brown (knight or baronet) she is _Lady Mary Brown_; but if
"Miss Mary Smith marries Sir John Brown (knight or baronet), she becomes"
"_Mary, Lady Brown_."
"(_c_) A maid of honor retains her _Hon._ after marriage, unless, of"
"course, it is merged into a higher title."
"Thus, if she marries a baronet she is the _Honᵇˡᵉ Lady Brown_; if a"
"peer, the _Lady So and So_. In either case as though she had been a"
peer's daughter.
(_d_) The wife of an earl's (or higher peer's) younger son is never the
_Honᵇˡᵉ Lady_; if she used the _Lady_ before marriage in her own right
"she does not, of course, add anything by such marriage, but the wife"
of a younger son of a lower peer than an earl is _Honᵇˡᵉ Mrs._ (not
"_Lady_)--the younger children of all peers using, of course, the family"
"name, with or without their forenames, according to their rank."
(_e_) If the lady to whom the title _Hon._ belongs in virtue of her
"father's rank marries a commoner, she retains her title, becoming"
"_Hon. Lady_ if she marries a knight or baronet, and _Hon. Mrs._ if her"
husband has no title.
None of these courtesy titles is inherited by the children of those who
"bear them, the third generation of even the highest peer being simply"

"""I admit that every circumstance points to--"""
"""Stop! Don't you give me any more o' that Webster Unabridged. You git to"
"cases. If you didn't come here to steal you came to The Polka to rob it,"
"didn't you?"""
"Johnson, his eyes lowered, was forced to admit that such were his"
"intentions, adding swiftly:"
"""But when I knew about you--"" He broke off and took a step towards her."
"""Wait! Wait! Wait where you are! Don't you take a step further or"
"I'll--"" She made a significant gesture towards her bosom, and then,"
"laughing harshly, went on denouncingly: ""A road agent! A road agent!"
"Well, ain't it my luck! Wouldn't anybody know to look at me that a"

"_Quid est veritas?_--Platonism, or transcendental idealism--Naturalism,"
or transcendental realism--The idea of progress--Progress and truth:
evolutionism--Pragmatism--Croce's new pragmatism--The immanence of
value--The actuality of Truth--Truth as history: the function of error
and of evil--The foundations of Croce's thought.
"There is one problem in the history of human thought, which, however"
conscious we might be of the multiplicity and historical contingency
"of philosophical problems, yet can appear to us as the ultimate or"
"central one, if only because it is an abstract interrogation describing"
"the attitude of the philosopher, and to which every concrete logical"
"research, every act of thought, can be reduced. It is Pilate's"
question: _Quid est veritas?_ What is truth?
"The question itself has no definite meaning, until it receives from the"
"individual thinker a definite content, which is history or experience,"
and the infinite variety of the answers it has received is due to the
infinite variability of that content. But at all times man has been
won your love by a trick. I had to show you the lowest and worst part
"of myself before the best in me could grow--the best in me, which is"
"yours."""
"""You are raving!"""
"""I am not raving. You must see I am not. Look at me. I am calmer than"
"you, though I face certain death. I knew when I came here that the"
"chances were I should be killed before I even saw you, but I had to"
"risk that. I had to win your trust back somehow, honestly and fairly."
"I can not live without your trust."""
"""Beatrice!"" The name escaped him almost without his knowledge. He saw"
tears spring to her eyes.
"""It is true. Your love and your trust have become my life. Then I was"
unworthy of both. I tried to make myself worthy. I did what I could. I
told you the truth--I threw away the only thing that mattered to me. I
"could not hold your love any longer by a lie--I loved you too much!"""
"For that moment the passionate energy of her words, the sincerity and"
"eloquence of her glance, swept back every thought of suspicion. He"
"stood stupefied, almost overwhelmed. Mechanically his lips formed"
themselves to a few broken sentences.
"""You can not know what you are saying. You are beside yourself. Once,"
"in my ignorance, I believed it possible, but now I know that it could"
"never be. Your race despises mine--"""
"""I do not care what you are nor to whom you belong!"" she broke in,"
"exulting. ""You are the man who taught me to believe that there is"
"something in this world that is good, that is worthy of veneration;"
second only to whisper in his ear:
"“Now, these ginks will be watching me every minute, waiting for a chance"
"to shoot. You may catch them off their guard directly and when you do,"
cut and run!”
“So that’s what you did all the talking for?” queried Jack.
"“You bet!” answered Frank. “And while you’re running, I’ll do a little"
sprinting myself.”
"“Here, you!” shouted the leader, almost lifting Frank’s feet from the"
ground as he dragged him away.
“What were you whispering to that boy?” demanded one of the others.
"“I was telling him,” Frank answered, making an insulting face, “that I"
used to have a dog that looked exactly like you.”
The fellow thus insulted sprang for the boy with upraised fist. The
"leader blocked his rush by imposing his own burly form, and the two went"
"down together. The half-breeds sprang forward, too, the intention"
evidently being to assist their companion as against the leader.
"Frank let out a yell which might have been heard half a mile away, and"
"the three boys darted down the mountainside, followed by harmless shots"
from the guns of the half-breeds.
The incident had taken place on a rocky level flanked by steep slopes on
"each side. The place, in fact, was almost like a shelf of rock cut into"
a long fifty percent grade.
"""Well, show me the girl that would want to go to Heaven alone! I'll sell"
"out the saloon--I'll go anywhere with you, you bet!"""
Johnson bent low over her hand and kissed it. The Girl's straightforward
answer had filled his heart to overflowing with joy.
"""You know what that means, don't you?"" a moment later he asked."
Sudden joy leapt to her blue eyes.
"""Oh, yes,"" she told him with a world of understanding in her voice."
"There was a silence; then she went on reminiscently: ""There's a little"
Spanish Mission church--I pass it 'most every day. I can look in an' see
the light burnin' before the Virgin an' see the saints standin' round
with glassy eyes an' faded satin slippers. An' I often tho't what they'd
"think if I was to walk right in to be made--well, some man's wife. It"
makes your blood like pin-points thinkin' about it. There's somethin'
"kind o' holy about love, ain't they?"""
"Johnson nodded. He had never regarded love in that light before, much"
"less known it. For many moments he stood motionless, a new problem of"
right and wrong throbbing in his bosom.
"At last, it being settled that Johnson was to pass the night in the"
"Girl's cabin, she went over to the bed and, once more, began to make it"
"ready for his occupancy. Meanwhile, Johnson, seated in the barrel rocker"
"before the fire, watched her with a new interest. The Girl had not gone"
"very far with her duties, however, when she suddenly came over to him,"
plumping herself down on the floor at his feet.
"""Say, did you ever ask any other woman to marry you?"" she asked as she"
"""But how do the plates function?"""
*       *       *       *       *
"Greca did not know this, save vaguely. She tried to express her little"
knowledge of the scientific achievements of the savage Rogans. After
some moments Brand turned to Dex and said:
"""As near as I can get it, the Rogans, by this peculiar red metal"
"alloy, manage to trap and divert the permanent lines of force, the"
"magnetic field, of Jupiter itself. So the whole red spot is highly"
"magnetized, which somehow upsets natural gravitational attraction. I"
"suppose it is responsible for the discoloration of the ground, too."""
"He turned to question the girl further about this, but she had got"
nervously to her feet already.
"""I'll be taken away soon,"" she said. ""I was brought in here only to"
"urge you to eat the food. I must be interpreter, since the Rogans"
"speak not with the mind, and I know their hateful tongue."""
"""Why are they so anxious for us to eat?"" demanded Dex with an uneasy"
frown.
"""So you will be strong, and endure for a long time the--the ordeal"
"they have in store for you,"" faltered the girl at last. ""They intend"
"to force from you the secret of the power that drove your ship here,"
"so they too may have command of space."""
"""But I don't understand,"" frowned Brand. ""They must already have a"
means of space navigation. They came here to Jupiter from the
"Petunikoff and his kind tremble and perspire before me!"""
"""Ah!  You have a courageous tongue!"" jeered Abyedok."
"""Yes ...  You miser!""  And Kuvalda looked at him contemptuously.  ""What"
do you understand?  What do you know?  Are you able to think?  But I
have thought and I have read ... books of which you could not have
"understood one word."""
"""Of course!  One cannot eat soup out of one's hand ... But though you"
"have read and thought, and I have not done that or anything else, we"
"both seem to have got into pretty much the same condition, don't we?"""
"""Go to the Devil!"" shouted Kuvalda.  His conversations with Abyedok"
"always ended thus.  When the teacher was absent his speeches, as a"
"rule, fell on the empty air, and received no attention, and he knew"
"this, but still he could not help speaking.  And now, having quarrelled"
"with his companion, he felt rather deserted; but, still longing for"
"conversation, he turned to Simtsoff with the following question: ""And"
"you, Aleksei Maksimovitch, where will you lay your grey head?"""
"The old man smiled good-humouredly, rubbed his hands, and replied, ""I"
"do not know ...  I will see.  One does not require much, just a little"
"drink."""
"""Plain but honourable fare!"" the Captain said.  Simtsoff was silent,"
"only adding that he would find a place sooner than any of them, because"
"women loved him.  This was true.  The old man had, as a rule, two or"
"three prostitutes, who kept him on their very scant earnings.  They"
"very often beat him, but he took this stoically.  They somehow never"
"beat him too much, probably because they pitied him.  He was a great"
"lover of women, and said they were the cause of all his misfortunes."
"tears was ready to accompany her tale of woe, so I said hurriedly: ""Don't"
"cry. Laugh while you speak. You will attract less attention."""
"She tried to laugh, but the effort was piteous and became a failure, as"
she said:--
"""George Hamilton has sailed for Canada, and my heart is broken."""
"Again she tried to smile, but the smile never reached her eyes, for they"
were full of tears.
"""How do you know?"" I asked, almost stunned by the news."
"She tried to stay her tears, but failed, and answered between sobs: ""Last"
"night at the queen's ball, the king showed me a letter sent by order of"
"the French king, saying that George had sailed from Bordeaux for Canada"
"nearly a fortnight ago. I could not help showing my grief, and the king,"
"who was boisterously happy, said: 'Now you will forget him and listen to"
"me.' I smiled, but it was a poor effort, and he smiled, showing his"
yellow fangs as he left me. I pray God that I may never be called upon to
"hate another man as I hate him."""
"""I can hardly believe that George has gone to Canada without notifying"
"us,"" I said."
"""Yes, I fear it is true,"" she returned. ""But if I am ever so fortunate"
"as to find him again, I intend to go with him whether he consents or no,"
regardless of father and all the world. Just as soon as I learn where he
"is in Canada, I will go to him. You will take me, won't you, Baron Ned?"""
"""I'll not give that promise,"" I answered. ""But I am sure there is"
something back of King Louis's letter of which we do not know. Surely
"_Elizabeth and Katherine_, off the coast of West Africa. Fitting her out"
"for a pirate, they named her the _Flying King_, and Sample was put in"
"command. In company with Captain Low, he sailed to Brazil and did much"
mischief amongst the Portuguese shipping. In November of the same year the
two pirate ships were attacked by a very powerful man-of-war. Lane got
"away, but Sample was compelled to run his ship ashore on the coast. Of his"
"crew of seventy men, twelve were killed and the rest taken prisoners, of"
"whom the Portuguese hanged thirty-eight. Of these, thirty-two were"
"English, three Dutch, two French, and one Portuguese."
"SANDERS, THOMAS."
An Elizabethan mariner who was taken prisoner by the Moors. He wrote a
narrative of his life as a slave on a Barbary pirate galley.
"""I and sixe more of my fellowes,"" he wrote, ""together with four-score"
"Italians and Spaniards, were sent foorth in a Galeot to take a Greekish"
"Carmosell, which came into Africa to steale Negroes. We were chained three"
"and three to an oare, and we rowed naked above the girdle, and the"
"Boteswaine of the Galley walked abaft the masts, and his Mate afore the"
"maste ... and when their develish choller rose, they would strike the"
Christians for no cause. And they allowed us but halfe a pound of bread a
"man in a day without any other kind of sustenance, water excepted.... We"
"were then so cruelly manackled in such sort, that we could not put our"
"hands the length of one foote asunder the one from the other, and every"
"night they searched our chains three times, to see if they were fast"

"SAWKINS, CAPTAIN RICHARD. Buccaneer."
"how the merchant passed the factory and disappeared into the wood, and"
he wished very much that he might fall and break all his bones.  He sat
"imagining many horrible forms of disaster while watching Petunikoff,"
who was descending the hill into the wood like a spider going into its
web.  Last night he even imagined that the wood gave way before the
merchant and he fell ... but afterwards he found that he had only been
dreaming.
"And to-day, as always, the red building stands out before the eyes of"
"Aristid Kuvalda, so plain, so massive, and clinging so strongly to the"
"earth, that it seems to be sucking away all its life.  It appears to be"
laughing coldly at the Captain with its gaping walls.  The sun pours
its rays on them as generously as it does on the miserable hovels of
the main street.
"""Devil take the thing!"" exclaimed the Captain, thoughtfully measuring"
"the walls of the factory with his eyes. ""If only ..."""
Trembling with excitement at the thought that had just entered his
"mind, Aristid Kuvalda jumped up and ran to Vaviloff's eating-house,"
muttering to himself all the time.
"Vaviloff met him at the bar, and gave him a friendly welcome."
"""I wish your honour good health!""  He was of middle height, and had a"
"bald head, grey hair, and straight moustaches like tooth-brushes."
"Upright and neat in his clean jacket, he showed by every movement that"
he was an old soldier.
"""Egorka, show me the lease and plan of your house,"" demanded Kuvalda,"
impatiently.
"Judas Petunikoff and pave the street with its timbers. By the way,"
"Mokei, I know out of what your wife baked to-day's kalaches; out of the"
frames of the third window and the two steps from the roof of Judas'
"house."""
When those present had laughed and joked sufficiently over the
"Captain's proposal, the sober market gardener, Pavlyugus asked:"
"""But seriously, what are we to do, your honour? ... Eh?  What do you"
"think?"""
"""I?  I shall neither move hand nor foot.  If they wish to clean the"
"street let them do it."""
"""Some of the houses are almost coming down...."""
"""Let them fall; don't interfere; and when they fall ask help from the"
"city.  If they don't give it you, then bring a suit in court against"
them!  Where does the water come from?  From the city! Therefore let
"the city be responsible for the destruction of the houses."""
"""They will say it is rain-water."""
"""Does it destroy the houses in the city?  Eh?  They take taxes from you"
but they do not permit you to speak!  They destroy your property and at
"the same time compel you to repair it!""  And half the radicals in the"
"street, convinced by the words of Kuvalda, decided to wait till the"
rain-water came down in huge streams and swept away their houses.  The
"others, more sensible, found in the teacher a man who composed for them"
an excellent and convincing report for the Corporation.  In this report
the refusal of the street's inhabitants to comply with the resolution
of the Corporation was so well explained that the Corporation actually

"v'y'ge in the _Battleaxe_, there was a Dago in my watch as come from"
the betwixt and between land where Spain jines France.  And he was
"the Dagoest Dago I ever sailed with.  But I knew the breed, and the"
first time he opens his garlicky mouth I hauled off and hit him.  And
then I took his knife away and snapped the point off.  And I says to
"him, 'Now, you black beggar, every time at muster you'll show me that"
"knife, and there'll be peace in the land.'  And he done so, and there"
"was peace."""
"The captain (or ""Guffin"") smote his thigh."
"""You're right, Simcox, you're right, and if Salisbury was to take a"
"leaf out of your log-book in respects of handlin' Dagoes, 'twould be"
"better for all concerned.  But no, not him.  He goes on seein' them"
French make a fleet and he lets 'em!  He actually sees 'em with their
"fleet sharpenin' on the grindstone and never says from the poop,"
"'Chuck that overboard, you swine, or I'll come and 'andle you so's"
"you'll be glad to die.'"""
"The second mate was much gratified, as was obvious by his standing"
first on one foot and then on another.  But Lampert was not so
pleased.
"""Why, you talk--you, captain and you, Simcox--as if they had a fleet."
"Why, it's my opinion--and experts say 'ditto' to me there--that a"
"string o' band-boxes with crackers in 'em, and all on a mud-flat,"
would do as much harm as the French fleet--unless they blows up when
"we takes 'em."""
The Guffin shook his head.

"briskly. After visiting a ""dry"" café, to seal this fortunate"
acquaintanceship--as he insisted upon calling it--he warmed up to us and

"stowed in our spare stateroom. Leaving him there, we went on deck."

"""You rather excel yourself,"" he smiled. ""Registering from Roumania,"
"however, isn't prima facie evidence that he's a Roumanian."""

"explanation, but he had taken a couple of his big strides and was in"
"the control section with Sis. She didn't give ground, though; I'll say"
"that for her. She only came to his chest, but she had her arms crossed"
sternly.

He opened his mouth to its maximum width and raised an enormous hand.
Then he let the air out and dropped his arm.

caustically.
Butt laughed slowly and carefully as if he were going over each word.
"""Wonder if all the anura talk like that. And _you_ want to foul up"

"Roumania dropped out of the war, the new Chancellor of Azuria wired"
imploringly for me to leave my classes at the University and come to
"him--because for years I have advised with Azurian statesmen, frequently"

THE QUEST
"As the world grew gray with waking light, Francesco came from the"
woods and heard the noise of the sea in the hush that breathed in the
dawn. The storm had passed over the sea and a vast calm hung upon the
lips of the day. In the east a green streak shone above the hills. The
sky was still aglitter with sparse stars. An immensity of gloom
brooded over the sea.
"Gaunt, wounded, triumphant, Francesco rode up beneath the banners of"
"the dawn, eager yet fearful, inspired and strong of purpose. Wood and"
hill slept in a haze of mist. The birds were only beginning in the
"thickets, like the souls of children yet unborn, calling to eternity."

takes the place of the Virgin Mary.

STORM MAGIC
The cabin-boy had been traveling around all summer long with his
"captain; but when they began to prepare to set sail in the fall, he grew"
"restless and did not want to go along. The captain liked him, for though"
"he was no more than a boy, he was quite at home on deck, was a big, tall"
"lad, and did not mind lending a hand when need arose; then, too, he did"
"as much work as an able seaman, and was so full of fun that he kept the"
whole crew in good humor. And so the captain did not like to lose him.
But the youth said out and out that he was not minded to take to the
blue pond in the fall; though he was willing to stay on board till
"the ship was loaded and ready to sail. One Sunday, while the crew was"
"ashore, and the captain had gone to a farm-holding near the forest, in"
order to bargain for small timber and log wood--presumably on his own
"account--for a deck load, the youth had been left to guard the ship."
"But you must know that he was a Sunday child, and had found a four-leaf"
basis of all Roman Catholic music today. Some of these chants were
"adapted by Luther for congregational singing, and set to words in the"
"vernacular of the people. A few of the tunes, usually in a form scarcely"
"recognizable from the original, are used today in Protestant hymnals, as"
"for instance, the tune “Hamburg.” Some of the music in the Amish church"
services is traceable to the Gregorian Chant.
The singing in the medieval church was liturgical in character and
confined to the clergy and trained choirs. This was its weakness. The
"laity was not expected to sing, neither were they able to do so."
"Congregational singing, so important in our worship today, had for"
centuries been unknown in the Roman Catholic Church. Reform was
inevitable and it came in due time.
"While only remnants of the music survive, many hymns from the Western"
Church have been translated from the Latin and a few choice ones have
found their way into the _Hymnary_.
Latin Hymns in the Hymnary
"Prudentius, 348-c. 413, “Bethlehem, of noblest cities” (88)"
"Gregory the Great, 540-604, “Father, we praise Thee” (24)"

“Joy dawned again on Easterday” (415)
"Theodulph of Orleans, 9th century, “All glory, laud, and honor”"
(100)
"Bernard of Clairvaux, 1091-1153, “Jesus the very thought” (155)"
"“O sacred Head, now wounded” (539)"
"Bernard of Cluny, 12th century, “Jerusalem, the golden” (262-3)"
"Anonymous, 12th century, “O come, O come, Emmanuel” (67)"
"Savonarola, 1452-98 (Italian), “Jesus, Refuge of the weary” (536)"
"""How can you ask me?"" answered the maiden. ""You have been sitting here"
"yourself, and talking about our wedding the whole afternoon!"""
"""No, I have just come,"" said he. ""It must have been some one else who"
"had taken my shape!"""
Then she gradually came to her senses; but not until long afterward was
"she altogether herself, and she told how she had firmly believed that"
"her sweetheart himself, and all their friends and relatives had been"
"there. He took her straight back to the village with him, and so that"
"they need fear no such deviltry in the future, they celebrated their"
wedding while she was still clad in the bridal outfit of the underground
folk. The crown and all the ornaments were hung up in Melbustad and it
is said that they hang there to this very day.

Black jugglery and deception are practiced upon the poor
"dairy-maid in ""The Troll Wedding"" (Asbjörnsen, _Huldreeventyr_, I,"
"p. 50. From Hadeland, told by a _Signekjarring_, a kind of wise"
woman or herb doctress). Characteristic is the belief that troll
magic and witchery may be nullified if a gun be fired over the
place where it is supposed to be taking place. Then all reverts to
"its original form. Curious, also, is the belief that trolls like"
"to turn into skeins of yarn when disturbed, and then roll swiftly"
away.

"But go on, Linus."""

"a lot of 'ifs', I know, but they add up to a sixty-forty chance. I"
say this because space rifts tend to produce strong responses in any
of the primitive detecting gear. They've certainly been busy running
"down space warps, which indicates that they've been getting a lot"
"of spurious responses."" He smiled. ""If space were entirely clear of"
"foreign matter and space rifts, they'd find their new detector vaguely"
"inefficient. I--"""
Viggon waved a hand to indicate he had heard enough.

Alwyn shrugged his shoulders indifferently. His friend noticed the
gesture and laughed.

"Alwyn flushed a little, and rose from his chair."
"""Not always,""--he answered steadily,--""There have been times in my life"
"when the beauty of women,--mere physical beauty--has exercised great"
influence over me. But I have lately learned how a fair face may
"sometimes mask a foul mind,--and unless I can see the SUBSTANCE of Soul"
"looking through the SEMBLANCE of Body, then I know that the beauty I"
"SEEM to behold is mere Appearance, and not Reality. Hence, unless your"
"beautiful Duchess be like the 'King's daughter' of David's psalm, 'all"

"But Villiers detained him a moment, and looked inquisitively at him"
full in the eyes.
"I reflected for a moment, then in a calm voice answered:"
"""Because I discovered that her heart was not wholly mine."""
She regarded me with undisguised amazement.
"""Do you mean that Yolande had another lover?"""
"""No!""  I cried with sudden resolve.  ""This conversation is not fair to"
"her.  It is all finished.  She has forgotten, and we are both happy."""
"""Happy!"" cried the Countess hoarsely.  ""You are, alas! mistaken.  Poor"
Yolande has been the most unhappy girl in all the world.  She has never
"ceased to think of you."""
"""Then I regret, madame,"" I responded."
"""If you really regret,"" she answered, ""then your love for her is not"
"altogether dead."""
"She spoke the truth.  At this point I may as well confide to you, my"
"reader, the fact that I still regarded my charming little friend of"
those careless days of buoyant youth with a feeling very nearly akin to
love.  I recollected the painful circumstances which led to our parting.
"My memory drifted back to that well-remembered, breathless summer's"
"evening when, while walking with her along the white highway near her"
"home, I charged her with friendliness towards a man whose reputation in"
"Brussels was none of the best; of her tearful protests, of my"
"all-consuming jealousy, of her subsequent dignity, and of our parting."
"After that I had applied to the Foreign Office to be transferred, and a"
month later found myself in Rome.
Kennedy related the history of the Farnese Palace to Cæsar. They went
through the Via del Mascherone and came out into the Via Giulia.
"“This Via Giulia is a street in a provincial capital,” said Kennedy;"
“always sad and deserted; a Cardinal or two who like isolation are still
living here.”
"At the entrance to the Via dei Farnesi, Cæsar stopped to look at two"
marble tablets set into the wall at the two sides of a chapel door.
"Cut on the tablets were skeletons painted black; on one, the words:"
"“Alms for the poor dead bodies found in the fields,” and on the other:"
“Alms for the perpetual lamp in the cemetery.”
“What does this mean?” said Cæsar.
“That is the Church of the Orison of the Confraternity of Death. The
tablets are modern.”
"They passed by the “Mascherone” again, and went rambling on until they"
reached the Synagogue and the Theatre of Marcellus.
They went through narrow streets without sidewalks; they passed across
"tiny squares; and it seemed like a dead city, or like the outskirts of a"
village. In certain streets towered high dark palaces of blackish stone.
These mysterious palaces looked uninhabited; the gratings were eaten
"with rust, all sorts of weeds grew on the roofs, and the balconies were"
"covered with climbing plants. At corners, set into the wall, one saw"
"niches with glass fronts. A painted madonna, black now, with silver"
"jewels and a crown, could be guessed at inside, and in front a little"
lantern swung on a cord.

"""I think very carefully about my options."""
"""Get the money."" She was directing the two remaining _Mino-gumi kobun"
_toward the table.
"""Gonna just rob the bank now, Comrade?"" Vance turned and looked at her,"
then at the three bodies strewn on the floor. The _kobun _seemed to
consider their late colleagues merely casualties of war. The dead men
"received almost no notice. ""Pretty costly little enterprise, wouldn't"
you say. Not a very propitious start for your new era of world
"serenity."""
"""You would be advised to shut up,"" she responded sharply."
"""I feel personally violated by all this."" Nogami had turned to her and"
"his voice was like steel. ""As of this moment, you can put out of your"
mind any illusion I might cooperate further. This outrage is beyond
"acceptability."""
"""We did what had to be done,"" Vera said. ""We still expect your"
"cooperation and I do not think we will be disappointed."""
"""Then your expectation is sadly misplaced,"" he replied icily. His eyes"
signified he meant every word.
"""We will see."" She dismissed him as she turned her attention to the"
money. The two _kobun_ had carefully removed their shiny black leather
jackets now and laid them on the table. Underneath they wore tightly
"tailored white shirts, complete with underarm holsters containing 9mm"
"Llamas. The automatics were back in their briefcases, positioned by the"
Slyne silenced him with a contemptuous gesture.
"""Whatever you do will make no difference to anyone in the wide world but"
"yourself,"" said Slyne. ""If you do what you're told you'll get a great"
deal more than you deserve out of it. If you don't--D'ye think I'd have
"taken you into the team if I didn't know how to drive you!"" he asked,"
"his eyes beginning to blaze. ""Why, my good fellow, if you refuse, if"
"you don't travel up to your collar, if you so much as shy at anything"
you see or hear--I won't even hurt you; I'll just hand you over to the
police.
"""So make up your mind now, quick!"""
"""You've nothing against me,"" quavered the lawyer."
"""No, I've nothing--not very much, at least, yet,"" Slyne agreed, knotting"
"his tie neatly before the glass. ""But--that may be because you haven't"
"embezzled any of my money--yet."" He had most opportunely recalled what"
the detective Dubois had told him about his new friend.
Mr. Jobling's face was almost green. He got up with an evident effort.
"""I was only joking,"" he declared with a most ghastly grin. ""I'll be"
"quite satisfied with ten per cent. of the accumulated income--in fact,"
"we'll call it a couple of hundred thousand pounds, if you like."""
"""All right,"" Slyne agreed imperturbably. ""Make it that amount if you'd"
rather. How long will it take you to get the papers drawn out? It's
"nearly one o'clock. And--you won't be safe till they're signed."""

is not free to choose her friends; and the knights of chivalry are long
"since vanished from the earth.  I would that I might call you friend,"
that sometimes we might meet and hold converse together. I trust that I
"may learn a good report of you, that one day I may speak with pride of"
having known you in your youth.  But that must suffice us.  Let it be
"enough for both.  I may not—"""
"She hesitated, and her voice died into silence. She spoke with a"
repressed emotion which he scarcely understood.  The tumult of his own
heart was such that he could not seek to gauge the depths of her
feelings.
"""If I may not be your knight, let me at least be your friend—your"
"servant!"" he pleaded.  ""And if there is anything wherein I can serve"
"you—"""
She seemed struck by the phrase.  She lifted her bent head and gazed
earnestly at him; but the words she spoke seemed strange.
"""You are the friend of Lord Sandford; is it not so?"""
"""I have been his comrade these many weeks.  He has shown me much"
"kindness and good-fellowship. I owe him gratitude."""
"""And you must know him well, I doubt not.  Tell me, Sir Grey—and I pray"

"watchword, and fawn upon his favour?  Tell me, what think you of him?  A"
"friend must needs speak sooth."""

"pronunciation. ""How far better it is to say: 'Monsieur, permit to me,'"

"""True as sunshine, my dear count,"" I returned. ""There's a vast difference"
"between the trade of butchering and the gentle art of murder."""
"De Grammont threw back his head, laughing softly. ""Ah, good, good! Very"
"good, dear baron! The sentiment is beau-ti-ful and could not be better"
"expressed--in English. You should have been born across the channel."""
"""I wish I had been born any place, not excepting hell, rather than in"
"England,"" I answered."
"""True, true, what a hole it is,"" returned the count, regretfully. ""The"
"Englishman is one pig."""
He saw by the expression of my face that while I might abuse my own
"countrymen, I did not relish hearing it from others, so with true French"
tact he held up his hand to keep me from speaking till he could correct
himself.
"""Pardon, baron, I forgot the 'r,' The Englishman's affectation of a"
"virtue he despises makes of him a prig--not a pig. Non, non! Mon Dieu!"
"Not a pig--a prig! Is it not so?"""

"Two of its nine satellites were in sight at the moment, with a third"
edging over the western rim.
"""Makes you think you're drunk and seeing triple, doesn't it?"""
"commented Dex, who was staring out the thick glass panel beside Brand."
"""Nine moons! Almost enough for one planet!"""
"Brand nodded abstractly, and concentrated on the control board."
Rapidly the ship rocketed down toward the surface. The disk became a
"whirling, gigantic plate; and then an endless plain, with cloud"
formations beginning to take on definite outline.
"""About to enter Jupiter's atmosphere."" Brand spoke into the radio"
transmitter. Over the invisible thread of radio connection between the
"space ship and Earth, four hundred million miles behind, flashed the"
message.
"""All right. For God's sake, be careful,"" came the answer, minutes"
"later. ""Say something at least every half hour, to let us know"
"communication is unbroken. We will sound at ten second intervals."""
"The sounding began: _peep_, a shrill little piping noise like the"
fiddle of a cricket. Ten seconds later it came again: _peep_.
"Thereafter, intermittently, it keened through the control room--a"
"homely, comforting sound to let them know that there was a distant"
thread between them and Earth.

Lower the shell rocketed. The endless plain slowly ceased its rushing
underneath them as they entered the planet's atmosphere and began to
be pulled around with it in its revolution. Far to the west a faint
"replied, her powdered face again puckering into a smile.  ""Do you want"
"to know my honest opinion?"" she added."
"""Yes, I do."""
"""Well,"" she went on, ""I attach very little importance to the rumours of"
a projected sale or lease of Ceuta to us.  I might tell you in
"confidence,"" she went on, dropping her voice, ""that from some words I"
overheard at the garden-party at de Wolkenstein's I have come to a firm
"conclusion that, although during the next few years important changes"
"will be made upon the map of the world, Ceuta will remain Spanish.  My"
country will never menace yours in the Mediterranean at that point.  A
Ministry might be found in Madrid to consider the question of its
"disposal, but the Spanish people would rise in revolution before they"
"would consent.  Spain is very poor, but very proud.  Having lost so many"
"of her foreign possessions, she will hold more strongly than ever to"
"Ceuta.  There you have the whole situation in a nutshell."""
"""Then the report that it is actually sold to France is untrue?""  I asked"
eagerly.
"""A mere report I believe it to be."""
"""But Spain's financial indebtedness to France might prove an element of"
danger when Europe justifies Lord Beaconsfield's prediction and rushes
"into war over Morocco?"""
"""Ah, my dear M'sieur Ingram, I do not agree with the prediction of your"

"direction in which lies the danger of war, but at the other end of the"

"next year it comes up thicker. If you mow it down, remove the seeds,"
"sow it with salt and kill the field, you have a useless plot of land, a"

"Sophia and Evan Wilmington. It was always a great pleasure, she used"
"to say, to have young people about her; and very naturally, since young"
people can be particularly useful in strange places to a middle-aged
"lady. The brother and sister fetched and carried for her all day long,"
"which was very nice and suitable, and Mrs. Winstanley was in her"
"most affable mood. On the day in question, however, she saw, to her"
"astonishment and annoyance, Canon Chisely and Yvonne making their way"
towards her through the crowded lines of tables.
"“Good gracious, Everard!” she said as they came up. “How did you find"
your way here? I thought you were going to Switzerland.”
"“So we are,” replied the Canon. “We have broken our journey. And as for"
"getting here, we took the boat from Dover and then walked.”"
"“The frivolity of the place is infecting you already, Canon,” cried"
"Sophia, with a laugh. “I hope you are going to stay a long time.”"
"“Oh, not too long,” said Yvonne. “It wouldn’t be fair to the Canon, who"
needs some mountain air. This is just a little treat all for me.”
She glanced at him affectionately as she spoke. It was good of him to
tarry for her sake in this Vanity Fair of a place.
"“We were going by Calais, as you know,” said the Canon, explanatively"
to Mrs. Winstanley. “We only changed our minds a day or two ago--we
thought it would be a little surprise for you.”
But after a little it came to him that the yellow gleam did not seem
"any closer; in fact, it grew fainter; he knew then, with a moment's"
"panic, that the tide and wind were too strong for him. He cursed his"
"frail strength, with a smarting in his eyes that did not come from the"
salt water.
There was only one thing he could do. Turn his back on the friendly
light and strike out in the direction of the beach. It would be
"further, but the cross currents of the tide would not impede his"
progress so much.
"For a long time he fought ahead stubbornly, changing his strokes, even"
"swimming on his back. But his breath came with increasing difficulty, a"
sharp pain stabbed at his side. He labored on. The pain grew sharper
and caught at him like a horrible vise. Once he yielded to it and sank
"down, down into the black water. But it passed and, as he rose, he"
"struck out again, blindly, now, for he had lost all sense of direction."
"""Oh, God! Oh, God!"" he shouted in his heart. His Aunt Achsa's God,"
whose All-embracing Love he had questioned because that God had made
"him crooked, must help him now! ""I _got_ to get help!"" God _must_ hear"
him.
A great exhaustion seized him. He sank again with a quivering breath.
But now his feet touched sand. With new strength he plunged ahead.
Again he was in deep water but he swam with eager strokes. The dreadful
pain stabbed but he did not heed. Now he saw moving lights. He was near
the beach! With a heartbreaking effort he fought the strength of the
"water, finally gaining the shallow depths. He heard voices nearby in"
the darkness.

"""You're going to _tell_, Ferdinand, what evil, criminal male is"
"speaking through your mouth!"""
"""Nobody!"" I insisted. ""They're my own ideas!"""
"""They are remarkably well-organized for a young boy's ideas. A boy"
"who, I might add, has previously shown a ridiculous but nonetheless"
entirely masculine boredom with political philosophy. I plan to have a
"government career on that new planet you talk about, Ferdinand--after"
"I have found a good, steady husband, of course--and I don't look"
"forward to a masculinist radical in the family. Now, who has been"
"filling your head with all this nonsense?"""

I was sweating. Sis has that deadly bulldog approach when she feels
someone is lying. I pulled my pulpast handkerchief from my pocket to
wipe my face. Something rattled to the floor.
"""What is this picture of me doing in your pocket, Ferdinand?"""
"A trap seemed to be hinging noisily into place. ""One of the passengers"
"wanted to see how you looked in a bathing suit."""
"""The passengers on this ship are all female. I can't imagine any of"
"them that curious about my appearance. Ferdinand, it's a man who has"
"been giving you these anti-social ideas, isn't it? A war-mongering"
masculinist like all the frustrated men who want to engage in
"government and don't have the vaguest idea how to. Except, of course,"
"in their ancient, bloody ways. Ferdinand, who has been perverting that"
sulky self-respect which would have carried him creditably to the altar
in any English church.
"Etienne faced his death like the son of an ancient race, and a good"
"Catholic. He could not have a confessor, but he said his prayers,"
"committed his soul to God and the Virgin, and faced the black muzzles"
not greatly abashed.
"As for El Sarria, death was his _métier_, his familiar friend. He had"
"lived with him for years, as a man with a wife, rising up and lying"
"down, eating and breathing in his company. ""The fortune of war,"" as"
Cabrera said. El Sarria was ready. Dolóres and her babe were safe. He
asked no more.
And not less readily fell into line Rollo Blair. A little apart he stood
as they made ready to march out of the presence of the Carlist general.
"John Mortimer was already on his way, carefully and conscientiously"
"ordering his going, that he might not in these last things disgrace his"
nation and his upbringing. Etienne and Ramon were following him. Still
"the young Scot lingered. Cabrera, nervously fingering his accoutrement"
"and signing papers at a folding table, found time to eye him with"
curiosity.
"""Did he mean to make a last plea for mercy?"" he thought."
Cabrera smiled contemptuously. A friend of Nogueras might know Ramon
Cabrera of Tortosa better. But Rollo had no such thought. He had in his
"fingers Etienne's last slip of Alcoy paper, in which the cigarette of"
"Spain, unfailing comforter, is wrapped. To fill it he had crumbled his"
last leaf of tobacco. Now it was rolled accurately and with lingering
"particularity, because it was to be the last. It lay in his palm featly"
"made, a cigarette worthy to be smoked by Don Carlos himself."

"the wake of Infidelity, and you will have time to take a comfortable nap"
before your Christian friend returns to the attack or braces up after
the shock sustained by his sentiments and inflicted by these two small
but truly suggestive tables.
One cold fact like this will inoculate one of the faithful with more
modesty than an hour of usual argument based upon the assumptions of the
clergy and the ignorance of his hearers.
"""Yes, there may be for a man, but I insist there is no real intellect."""
"""Well, Sarah,"" I answered, showing irritation despite an effort to appear"
"indifferent, ""it is my opinion that the possession of great intellectual"
"power by a woman is the one virtue with which men, as a rule, find"
themselves most willing to dispense. It gives her too great an
"advantage."""
"""Yes, a soft, plump figure like Betty's, long lashes and red lips,"
"surrounded by dimples, are apt to please a fool."""
"""But they're good in their way, Sarah, you'll admit--excellent!"""
"I retorted sharply, caring little if she saw that I was angry."
"""And men are fools, so there! Not another word about the barmaid!"" cried"
"Sarah, dismissing the subject with a wave of her hand."
"But men, too, sometimes like to have the last word, so I remarked: ""The"
"mother of the Duchess of York was a barmaid, at least, a barmistress."""
"""Yes, but is that any reason why Frances should be kissing this one?"
"Doubtless your friend Betty finds men enough to do the office."""
"""Sarah!"" I cried, springing to my feet, now thoroughly angry. ""If you"
"were a man, I'd give you the lie direct!"""
"Sarah began to laugh and clapped her hands, saying: ""I was leading you"
"on. I suspected you were fond of her. Now I know it."""
"But Sarah's remark, being so near the truth, did nothing to allay my"
"anger, so I told her she was a fool, and went into an adjoining room,"
power. At that a terrible feeling of hopelessness assailed him. His only
chance was to reach the valley where he had little fear of capture; but
"wounded, as he was, that seemed out of the question, and he saw himself"
caught like a rat in a trap. In an access of rage at the situation in
which he was placed he made another effort to raise himself up on his
elbow and peer through the window at the Sierras. The noise that he
"made, slight though it was, awoke the Girl. In an instant she was at his"
bedside drawing the curtain over the window.
"""What you thinkin' of?"" she asked. ""At any moment--jest as soon as the"
trail can be cleared--there'll be someone of the boys up here to see how
"I've pulled through. They mustn't see you . . ."""
"Forcibly, but with loving tenderness, she put him back among his pillows"
and seated herself by the bed. An awkward silence followed. For now that
the man was in his right senses it was borne in upon her that he might
"remember that she had fed him, given him drink and fondled him. It was a"
situation embarrassing to both. Neither knew just what to say or how to
"begin. At length, the voice from the bed spoke:"
"""How long have I been here?"""
"""Three days."""
"""And you have nursed me all that--"""
"""You mustn't talk,"" warned the girl. ""It's dangerous in more ways than"
"one. But if you keep still no one'll suspect that you're here."""
"""But I must know what happened,"" he insisted with increasing excitement."
"""I remember nothing after I came down the ladder. The Sheriff--Rance--"
"what's become . . .?"""
"""Why, it's mutiny, sir."""
"""Exactly! You can say you went out under duress."""
"""I never heard of such a thing,"" stormed the skipper. Then, more"
"quietly, ""But I don't seem to have any choice in the matter; do I?"""
"""None whatever."""
"""Tell them to go to hell!"" growled Balt from the open window above"
their head.
"A blasphemous outcry floated up from the launch, while heads protruded"
"from the deck-house openings, the faces white in the slanting glare."
"""Why don't you heave to?"" demanded a voice."
"Peasley stepped to the end of the bridge and called down: ""I can't"
"stop, my good man, they won't allow it, y' know. You'll have to bloody"
"well come aboard yourself."" Then, obedient to his command, the"
"search-light traced an arc through the darkness and died out, leaving"
"the little craft in darkness, save for its dim lantern."
"Unseen by the amazed quartermaster, who was startled out of speech and"
"action, Emerson gripped the Captain's shoulder and whispered his"
"thanks, while the Britisher grumbled under his breath:"

"“This is up-to-date gambling in cleaned-up New York,” he remarked as we"
waited for the elevator to return for us. “And the worst of it all is
that it gets the women as well as the men. Once they are caught in the

"We rode down in silence, and as we went down the steps to the street, I"
"noticed the man whom we had seen watching the place, lurking down at"
the lower corner. Kennedy quickened his pace and came up behind him.
"“Why, Winters!” exclaimed Craig. “You here?”"
"“I might say the same to you,” grinned the detective not displeased"
evidently that our trail had crossed his. “I suppose you are looking
"for Schloss, too. He’s up in the Recherche a great deal, playing poker."
I understand he owns an interest in the game up there.”
"Kennedy nodded, but said nothing."
“I just saw one of the cappers for the place go out before you went
in.”
“Capper?” repeated Kennedy surprised. “Antoinette Moulton a steerer for
a gambling joint? What can a rich society woman have to do with a place
like that or a man like Schloss?”
Winters smiled sardonically. “Society ladies to-day often get into
"scrapes of which their husbands know nothing,” he remarked. “You didn’t"
"know before that Antoinette Moulton, like many of her friends in the"
"smart set, was a gambler—and loser—did you?”"

"face, and something in her recoiled in sick disgust. Fear, an almost"
"imbecilic fear, was written on the wide-open, staring eyes, and the"
hand that held the revolver trembled like that of an old man.
"""Quick--out by the back way!"" he stammered incoherently. ""I will lock"
the door--so. That will keep them off a minute. They are bound to look
for us here first. Nicholson is retiring with his men--they are going
to have a try to bring down the Rajah. It's our one chance. It may

"you help? Do you want to be killed like sheep?"""
Lois drew him back by the arm.
"""You are wasting time,"" she said firmly. ""Come with us! Why, you are"
"hurt!"""
He looked at the thin stream which trickled down the soiled white of
his coat. A silly smile flickered over his big face.
"ruffian,"" said he to himself. ""If they have the same effect on Sallie, I"
"won't grudge the few francs I paid for them!"""
"He tiptoed down the short stairway, and, having tapped very quietly at"
"the door of the after-saloon, entered without more ado. He judged that"
he might have difficulty in gaining admission if he delayed to ask
leave.
The saloon was empty. But from an adjoining cabin came the sound of
"splashing, and from its neighbour the shuffle of heavy feet, a faint"
suggestion of deft hands busy among crisp muslin and sibilant silk.
Slyne hesitated; he wanted to be very tactful and yet was unwilling to
give up the advantage he had thus gained. He closed the door carefully
behind him. It creaked a little.
From the room whence had come the rustle of feminine garments an
"uncanny-looking figure appeared, and darted an angry, apprehensive"
glance about the saloon. The sound of splashing had ceased.
"""'Morning, Ambrizette,"" said Slyne briskly and standing his ground. ""Is"
your mistress up yet? Tell her I have Captain Dove's leave to pay her a

"The dumb black dwarf's scowl grew darker, but her hand fell away from"
her breast and she halted as Sallie's voice sounded from within.
"""Is that you, Jasper!"" it ejaculated. ""What do you want? I thought--"""
"""I've come back--with good news for you, Sallie--wonderful news!"" said"
"Slyne. ""And I'm in no end of a hurry to be off again. Call Ambrizette in"
"and get dressed, as quick as you can. Captain Dove's waiting breakfast"

"I muse on all this, and understand that her staying here is somehow"
"connected with her carnal desires, with the fact that Solem is still here."
"How muddled it all is, and how this handsome girl has been spoiled! I saw"
"her not long ago, tall and proud, upright, untouched, walking"
"intentionally close to Solem, yet not replying to his greeting. Did she"
suspect him of complicity in the death of the lawyer and avoid him for
"that reason? Not in the least; she avoided him less than before, even"
"letting him take her letters to the post office, which she had not done"
"previously. But she was unbalanced, a poor thing that had lost her"
"bearings. Whenever she could, she secretly defiled herself with pitch,"
with dung; she sniffed at foulness and was not repelled.
"One day, when Solem swore a needlessly strong oath at a horse that was"
"restless, she looked at him, shivered, and went a deep red. But she"
"mastered herself at once, and asked Josephine:"
"""Isn't that man leaving soon?"""
"""Yes,"" Josephine replied, ""in a few days."""
Though she had seized this opportunity to ask her question with a great
"show of indifference, I am certain it was an important one to her. She"
went away in silence.
"Yes, Miss Torsen stayed, for she was sexually bound to Solem. Solem's"
"despair, Solem's rough passion that she herself had inflamed, his"
"""It is nothing to laugh at,"" grumbled Gatepath."
"""Not for you, perhaps. But to my mind the situation is gorgeous. Has"
"this man the legal right of succession?"""
"""Beyond a doubt,"" groaned Gatepath. ""His father saw to that."""
"""Then why not leave matters to take their legal course?"" asked the"

"he not----"""
"""How can you buy him off when he is the heir? You people are nothing but"
"trustees, who must account to him for every penny. If he claims the"
"peerage and estates, you must accept him. You admit that legally he is"
"the heir. I can see what is in your mind, but it won't do, Gatepath, it"
"won't do. If you try any hanky-panky, that pretty neck of yours will"
find itself in a hempen collar. Now if it was only a case for judicious
"ROCHE, CAPTAIN PHILIP, _alias_ JOHN EUSTACE."
"In company with three other mariners--Cullen, Wife, and Neale--this Irish"
"pirate shipped himself on board a French snow at Cork in November, 1721,"
"for a passage to Nantes. Owing to Roche's briskness, genteel manners, and"
"knowledge of navigation, the master used occasionally to place him in"
charge of the vessel. One night a few days out a pre-arranged mutiny took
"place, the French crew being butchered and thrown overboard. The captain,"
"who pleaded for mercy, was also thrown into the sea. Driven by bad weather"
"to Dartmouth, the new captain, Roche, had the ship repainted and"
"disguised, and renamed her the _Mary_. Then sailing to Rotterdam he sold"
"the cargo of beef and took on a fresh cargo with the owner, Mr. Annesly."
"The first night out of port they threw Mr. Annesly overboard, and he swam"
alongside for some while pleading to be taken in. On going into a French
"port, and hearing that an enquiry was being made about his ship, Roche ran"
"away. The crew took the ship to Scotland, and there landed and"
"disappeared, and the ship was seized and taken to the Thames."
"Later on Roche was arrested in London and committed to Newgate Prison,"
"found guilty of piracy, and hanged on August 5th, 1723, at Execution Dock,"
"at the age of 30. The hanging was not, from the public spectators point of"
"view, a complete success, for the culprit ""was so ill at the time that he"
could not make any public declaration of his abhorrence of the crime for
"which he suffered."""
"RODERIGO, PETER."
"A ""Flanderkin."""
"striking. Almost opposite us in a beetling archway, the bowed head and"
shoulders of a man stood up above the common level. There was a little
"space round him, whence men held back; and the red glow of the"
smouldering links which the executioners had cast on the ground at his
"feet, shone upwards on his swollen lips and starting eyeballs. As I"
"looked, the body seemed to writhe in its bonds; but it was only the"
wind swayed it. I went in shuddering.
"On the stairs I met Count Hugo coming down, and knew the moment I saw"
"him that there was something wrong. He stopped me, his eyes full of"
wrath.
"'My man,' he said sternly, 'I thought that you were to be trusted!"
Where have you been? What have you been doing? _Donner!_ Is your lady
to be left at dark with no one to man this door?'
"Conscience-stricken, I muttered that I hoped nothing had gone amiss."
"'No, but something easily might!' he answered grimly. 'When I came"
here I found three as ugly looking rogues whispering and peering in
"your doorway as man could wish to see! Yes, Master Martin, and if I"
"had not ridden up at that moment I will not answer for it, that they"
would not have been in! It is a pity a few more knaves are not where
"that one is,' he continued sourly, pointing through the open door. 'We"
could spare them. But do you see and have more care for the future.
"Or, mein Gott, I will take other measures, my friend!'"
So it had been a ruse after all! I went up sick at heart.
"Hark, how the bells ring on the hillside!"
"Romantic? Yes. Mere sentimentality, mood, rhyme--nothing? Yes."
It is the last happiness.

The sun has returned. Not darkly glowing and regal--more than that:
"imperial, because it is flaming. This you do not understand, my friend,"
whatever the language in which it is dished up for you. But I say there is
an imperial sun in the sky.
"It's a good day for going to the woods; it is sweeping time, for the woods"
are full of yellow things that have come suddenly into being. A short time
"ago they were not there, or I did not see them, or they had the earth's"
"own complexion. There is something unborn about them, like embryos in an"
"early stage. But if I whirl them about, they are miracles of fulfillment."
"Here are fungi of every sort, mushrooms and puffballs. How close is the"
"poisonous mushroom to the happy family of the edible mushroom, and how"
innocently it stands there! Yet it is deadly. What magnificent cunning! A
"spurious fruit, a criminal, habitual vice itself, but preening in splendor"
"and brilliance, a very cardinal of fungi. I break off a morsel to chew; it"
"is good and soft on the tongue, but I am a coward and spit it out again."
Was it not the poisonous mushroom that drove men berserker? But in the
"dawn of our own day, we die of a hair in the throat."
"""With all my heart!"" cried the soldier."
"Petunikoff was silent for a moment, then looked at him, and suddenly"
"asked, coldly and drily, ""And why do you wish to do so?"""
"Vaviloff did not expect such a question, and therefore had no reply"
ready.  In his opinion the question was quite unworthy of any
"attention, and so he laughed at young Petunikoff."
"""That is easy to understand.  Men like to live peacefully with one"
"another."""
"""But,"" interrupted Petunikoff, ""that is not exactly the reason why.  As"
"far as I can see, you do not distinctly understand why you wish to be"
"reconciled to us ...  I will tell you."""
"The soldier was a little surprised.  This youngster, dressed in a check"
"suit, in which he looked ridiculous, spoke as if he were Colonel"
"Rakshin, who used to knock three of the unfortunate soldier's teeth out"
every time he was angry.
"""You want to be friends with us because we should be such useful"
neighbours to you ... because there will be not less than a hundred and
"fifty workmen in our factory, and in course of time even more.  If a"
"hundred men come and drink one glass at your place, after receiving"
"their weekly wages, that means that you will sell every month four"
"hundred glasses more than you sell at present.  This is, of course, the"
lowest estimate ... and then you have the eating-house besides.  You
"are not a fool, and you can understand for yourself what profitable"
"neighbours we shall be."""
"""Dex!"" he cried. ""We're moving! And the motor is shut off!"""
"""We're drawing down closer to the ground, too,"" announced Dex,"
"pointing to their altimeter. ""Our altitude has been reduced five"
"thousand feet in the last two minutes."""
"Quickly Brand turned on the motor in reverse. The space ship, as the"
"rushing, reddish ground beneath indicated, continued to glide forward"
as though pulled by an invisible rope. He turned on full power. The
ship's progress was checked a little. A very little! And the metallic
red surface under them grew nearer as they steadily lost altitude.
"""Something seems to have got us by the nose,"" said Dex. ""We're on our"
"way to the center of the red spot, I guess--to find whatever it was"
that Journeyman found. And the radio communication his been broken
"somehow...."""
"Wordlessly, they stared out the panel, while the shell, quivering with"
the strain of the atomic motor's fight against whatever unseen force
"it was that relentlessly drew them forward, bore them swiftly toward"
the heart of the vast crimson area.
*       *       *       *       *
"""Look!"" cried Brand."
"For over an hour the ship had been propelled swiftly, irresistibly"
toward the center of the red spot. It had been up about forty thousand
"feet. Now, with a jerk that sent both men reeling, it had been drawn"
down to within fifteen thousand feet of the surface; and the sight
that was now becoming more and more visible was incredible.
"""I wait for you!"""
Raniero broke into a boisterous laugh.
"""The bastard! The monk! Go home, Francesco, and don your lady's"
"attire! What would you with a sword?"""
Francesco's mouth was a hard line. He breathed through hungry
"nostrils, as he went step by step toward Raniero."
Then with a swift shifting of his sword from right to left he smote
"him on each cheek, then, lowering his vizor, he put up his guard."
"With an oath Raniero's sword flashed, feinted, turned with a cunning"
"twist, and swept low for Francesco's thigh."
"Francesco leaped back, but was slashed by the point a hair's breadth"
"above the knee. It was a mere skin wound, but the pain of it seemed to"
snap something that had been twisted to a breaking point within him.
He gave a great cry and charged down Raniero's second blow.
"Their shields met and clashed, and Raniero staggered. Francesco rushed"
him across the hall as a bull drives a rival about a yard. Raniero
"crashed against the wall, and Francesco sprang back to use his sword."
The blow hewed the top from Raniero's shield and smote him slant-wise
across the face.
"Raniero gathered himself and struck back, but the blow was caught on"
"Francesco's shield. Francesco thrust at him, before he could recover,"
and the point slipped under the edge of Raniero's gorget. He twisted
free and blundered forward into a fierce exchange of half-arm blows.
"Once he struck Francesco upon the mouth with the pommel of his sword,"
A low exclamation from Craig attracted my attention from Winters. In a
corner he had discovered a small box and had opened it. Inside was a
"dry battery and a most peculiar instrument, something like a little"
flat telephone transmitter yet attached by wires to earpieces that
fitted over the head after the manner of those of a wireless detector.
"“What’s this?” asked Kennedy, dangling it before Muller."
He looked at it phlegmatically. “A deaf instrument I have been working
"on,” replied the jeweler. “My hearing is getting poor.”"
Kennedy looked hastily from the instrument to the man.
"“I think I’ll take it along with us,” he said quietly."
"Winters, true to his instincts, had been searching Muller in the"
meantime. Besides the various assortment that a man carries in his
"pockets usually, including pens, pencils, notebooks, a watch, a"
"handkerchief, a bunch of keys, one of which was large enough to open a"
"castle, there was a bunch of blank and unissued pawn-tickets bearing"
"the name, “Stein’s One Per Cent. a Month Loans,” and an address on the"
Bowery.
"Was Muller the “fence” we were seeking, or only a tool for the “fence”"
higher up? Who was this Stein?
What it all meant I could only guess. It was a far cry from the wealth
"of Diamond Lane to a dingy Bowery pawnshop, even though pawnbroking at"
"one per cent. a month—and more, on the side—pays. I knew, too, that"
"diamonds are hoarded on the East Side as nowhere else in the world,"
"outside of India. It was no uncommon thing, I had heard, for a"
"""We seem to be working toward different objectives,"" Novosty answered."
"""Michael has a solution to everybody's problem. I regret very much"
"you've chosen not to help facilitate it."""
"""The only problem he solved was yours,"" she shot back. ""Mr. Vance"
devised what amounts to an enormous check kiting scheme. You two
"planned to perpetrate fraud. You're nothing better than criminals, both"
"of you, and I intend to make sure you haven't also given us a short"
"count."""
"""Comrade, fraud is a harsh word,"" Vance interjected."
"""You are not as amusing as you think,"" she replied."
"""Humor makes the world go round."""
'This is not a joke. The negotiable instruments in this room are Soviet
funds. I intend to make sure those funds are intact. There will be a
"full and complete count. Now."""
"She's gone over the edge, he told himself. She's definitely going to"
"try and screw us, either wittingly or unwittingly. But who in the room"
is going to help her? That huddled group of Russian bankers now staring
"terrified at Novosty's 9mm? Not damned likely. She's improvising, on"
her own. But her little stunt could well end up sinking the ship.
The two couriers were now spread against the brown textured fabric of
"the wall, legs apart. He walked over and reached into the leather"
"holsters at their hips, drawing out their revolvers. They were snub-"
"nosed Smith & Wesson Bodyguards, .38 caliber. He looked them over,"
"cocked them, and handed one to Eva."
"“One or two other little things,” replied Herold, judiciously. “I 'll"
copy them out and bring them to you. But go on.”
"“Well,” she said, “yesterday afternoon a little bird--I don't know what"
"kind of bird it was--came and sat on the window-sill, and turned his"
"head this way and looked at me, and turned his head that way and looked"
"at me, and I did n't move hand or foot, and I said, 'Cheep, cheep!' And"
he hopped on the bed and stayed there such a long time. And I talked
"to him, and he hopped about and looked at me and seemed to tell me all"
"sorts of wonderful things. But he did n't somehow, although he came from"
"the sky, and was a perfect dear. He must have known all about it, but he"
"did n't know how to tell me. Now, you and John come from the beautiful"
world and tell me wonderful things about it; and I shall never go there
"really, but I can live in it through you.”"
"Constable, the Great Dane, known by this abbreviated title in familiar"
"life, rose, stretched himself, and went and snuggled his head beneath"
"John's arm. John turned, his arm round the hound's neck."
"“But you can live in it through anybody, dear,” said he--“your Uncle"
"Oliver, your Aunt Julia, or anybody who comes to see you.”"
Stellamaris looked at Herold for a characteristically sympathetic
"moment, and then at John. She sighed."
"“I told you it was hard to explain. But don't you see, Belovedest? You"
and Walter are like my gull. Everybody else is like the little bird. You
"know how to tell me and make me live. The others are darlings, but they"
don't seem to know how to do it.”
John scratched his head.
"""You've got some singular new attraction about you, Alwyn,""--he said,"
with a strange sense of keen inward excitement as he met his friend's
"calm yet flashing glance,--""Something mysterious, . . something that"
COMPELS! What is it? ... I believe that visit of yours to the Ruins of
"Babylon had a more important motive than you will admit, . . moreover.."
"I believe you are in love!"""
"""IN love!""--Alwyn laughed a little as he repeated the words.. ""What a"
foolish term that is when you come to think of it! For to be IN love
"suggests the possibility of getting OUT again,--which, if love be true,"
can never happen. Say that I LOVE!--and you will be nearer the mark!
"Now don't look so mystified, and don't ask me any more questions just"
"now--to-night, when we are sitting together in the library, I'll tell"
"you the whole story of my Babylonian adventure!"""
"And with a light parting wave of the hand he left the room, and"
Villiers heard him humming a tune softly to himself as he ascended the
"stairs to his own apartments, where, ever since he arrived, he had made"
it his custom to do two or three hours' steady writing every morning.
"For a moment or so after he had gone Villiers stood lost in thought,"
"with knitted brows and meditative eyes, then, rousing himself, he went"
"on to his study, and sitting down at his desk wrote an answer to the"
Duchess de la Santoisie accepting her invitation.
CHAPTER XXXIV.
REWARDS OF FAME.
"""Well, you know, Lampert, as I never 'ad no opinion of their fleet."
But that ain't the question.  Salisbury may have 'is reasons for not
"takin' it away, though I fails to see 'em; but the real question is,"
why we don't have a man with guts and go in command.  It's my firm
belief as there's many a merchant captain as could work the
"diplomatic game to better hadvantage.  Look at the experience we has,"
"dealing with owners contrary as hell, and with consignees and with"
"'arbour-masters and pilots.  Where Salisbury is wrong, is in his not"
goin' about and freshin' up his mind.  And he works by rule o' thumb
and dead reckoning.  It ain't no wonder we can see where's his eye's
"out."""
"""It ain't,"" said the compliant Simcox."
"""Well,"" sighed Lampert, ""I owns freely as I don't feel that sure I'd"
"like to run his show."""
The Guffin laughed.
"""But you ain't 'ad my experience yet, Lampert.  Now, I'd hundertake"
"to come right down into the harena, and make them French and Germans"
"sit up like monkeys on a horgan while I played the tune."""
"""I believe you,"" said Simcox, rubbing his hard hands."
"""Look at the difficulties we 'as to contend with,"" said the skipper,"
with a rapidly thickening utterance and an increasing loss of
"aspirates--""look at the vig'lance we 'as to use.  Rocks _and_ shoals"
"_and_ hother ships.  It's 'igh education to be a master-mariner, and"
the Board of Trade knows it--knows it well.  This 'ere crowd's all

"There was no one in the lobby when he arrived there--no dead bodies,"
"either. But on the sidewalk, in front of the building, a woman lay dead"
in a pool of blood.
"In a sick rage, Taber looked in both directions and saw the android dive"
through a group of people half a block away. He tipped them over like
tenpins and ran on. Taber gripped the gun tight and started in pursuit.
He could not fire because there was enough sidewalk traffic to make it
"dangerous. On ahead, the android's path was blocked by a man. He sought"
to get clear but the android passed him close enough to jam the knife
into his neck and send him screaming to the sidewalk.
"A uniformed patrolman appeared on the other side of the street, further"
down. He took the situation in and understood Taber's frantic gesture. A
"car screamed to a halt as the patrolman raced across the street, drawing"
his gun.
"The android, seeing his escape cut off, veered into an areaway. The"
patrolman got there first and plunged in after him.
"Taber, gasps tearing at his lungs, arrived thirty seconds later. During"
"that time, he'd expected the sound of shots from the patrolman's gun."
But there was silence.
"He braked on his heels, skidded into the areaway, and saw the android"
"advancing on the patrolman. The latter stood motionless, the gun hanging"
useless at his side.
"""Drop! Drop!"" Taber yelled. He cursed as he tried to angle in the narrow"
areaway in order to get a clear shot.
"""She may be able to do so,"" answered the Abbé, shrugging his shoulders."
"He spoke very bad English throughout the consultation. ""But the stars,"
"too, may be very persuasive with King Charles. To be plain, he will"
"probably consult you, and if--"""
"""I am to see him to-night. That is why your visit was postponed until"
"to-morrow,"" interrupted Lilly."
"""That is as I supposed,"" remarked the Abbé. ""Now, if I buy Dunkirk for"
"one hundred thousand pounds, you shall receive two thousand pounds within"
"ten days after signing the treaty, and Baron Clyde will be my surety."""
"""Two thousand pounds?"" mused Lilly. ""That is rather a small sum in so"
"great a transaction."""
"""I doubt not the purchase may be made without the help of the stars if"
"you feel that two thousand pounds is too small a sum to be considered,"""
returned the Abbé.
"""No, no,"" said Lilly. ""I understand that you wish me to set a figure and"
"work out the solution of this affair, and if I learn from the stars that"
it is to King Charles's interest to accept your offer of one hundred
"thousand pounds for the city of Dunkirk, I am to receive--"""
"""If King Charles accepts!"" interrupted the Abbé."
"""Ah, I see! Yes, yes, of course,"" returned Lilly. ""I shall go to work"
immediately and set my figure. Of course I do not know what I shall
"learn, but I shall be glad to learn from the stars that which will enable"
me to advise the king according to your wishes. Two thousand pounds are
"two thousand pounds, and the word of a king is but a breath."""

"quarter, of what he told me of the inner working of the Secret"
"Service, Scotland Yard, which admires and loves him, would cast him"
"out, lock him up securely in gaol, and prepare for me a safe"
"harbourage in a contiguous cell. So for both our sakes I must be very,"
very careful.
"""You have been most helpful to me,"" he said handsomely at parting,"
"""and if anything good turns up on the North-East coast, I will let you"
"know. Could you come if I sent for you?"""
"""I would contrive to manage it,"" said I."
"Dawson went away, and the pressure of daily work and interests thrust"
"him from my mind. For a month I heard nothing of him or of Cary, and"
then one morning came a letter and a telegram. The letter was from
"Richard Cary, and read as follows: ""A queer thing has happened here."
A cruiser which had come in for repair was due to go out this morning.
"She was ready for sea the night before, the officers and crew had all"
"come back from short leave, and the working parties had cleared out."
"Then in the middle watch, when the torpedo lieutenant was testing the"
"circuits, it was discovered that all the cables leading to the guns"
"had been cut. Dawson has been called in, and bids me say that, if you"
"can come down, now is the chance of your life. I will put you up."""
"The telegram was from Dawson himself. It ran: ""They say I'm beaten."
"But I'm not. Come and see."""
"""The deuce,"" said I. ""Sabotage! I am off."""
"""Now you be careful, Ferdinand,"" Sis called after me as she opened a"
"book called _Family Problems of the Frontier Woman_. ""Remember you're"
"a nice boy. Don't make me ashamed of you."""
I tore down the corridor. Most of the cabins had purple lights on in
"front of the doors, showing that the girls were still inside their"
hammocks. That meant only the ship's crew was up and about. Ship's
crews are men; women are too busy with important things like government
to run ships. I felt free all over--and happy. Now was my chance to
really see the _Eleanor Roosevelt_!
*       *       *       *       *
It was hard to believe I was traveling in space at last. Ahead and
"behind me, all the way up to where the companionway curved in out"
"of sight, there was nothing but smooth black wall and smooth white"
"doors--on and on and on. _Gee_, I thought excitedly, this is _one big"
ship_!
"Of course, every once in a while I would run across a big scene of"
stars in the void set in the wall; but they were only pictures. Nothing
that gave the feel of great empty space like I'd read about in _The Boy
"Rocketeers_, no portholes, no visiplates, nothing."
"So when I came to the crossway, I stopped for a second, then turned"
"left. To the right, see, there was Deck Four, then Deck Three, leading"
inward past the engine fo'c'sle to the main jets and the grav helix
going _purr-purr-purrty-purr_ in the comforting way big machinery has
"when it's happy and oiled. But to the left, the crossway led all the"
way to the outside level which ran just under the hull. There were
portholes on the hull.
In the white track was a brilliant silver object travelling along at a
"great speed. A number of anti-aircraft guns opened fire simultaneously,"
"and all around the shining fugitive innumerable stars of pale, liquid"
gold flashed out and melted away again.
"""I bet they're puttin' 'is bloody wind up! Rotten bastard, bombin' a lot"
"o' wounded! If I get 'old of a Fritz up the line, I'll murder 'im. Yer"
"won't catch me takin' no more pris'ners, I tell yer."""
A flashing star suddenly seemed to envelop the aeroplane.
"""Got 'im that time--bloody good shot--'e's comin' down, look, look, 'e's"
"comin' down! Look, 'e's all in flames!"""
"But the aeroplane sped on, growing smaller and smaller. Then the white"
"beam swung back and was extinguished, while the guns ceased firing."
"""Fine lot o' gunners we got--couldn't 'it a Zep 'alf a yard orf! They"
"ain't worth the grub they get!"""
We returned to our marquee and sat down on our kits. My friend Private
"Black came in after us, smiling ruefully. I asked him what was the"
matter.
"""I was playing the piano in the Sergeants' Mess when the first one"
dropped. We all jumped up together and rushed out. Then the second one
burst and I lost my head and didn't know where I was going. I darted to
"and fro, tripping over tent-ropes and dashing up against revetments. I"
"never had the wind up so much in all my life. I couldn't get my breath,"
there was a kind of weight on my stomach and a tightness round my chest
"and throat, and my knees kept on giving way all the time. The third one"
burst and I fell down and crawled under some ropes and lay flat against
"""It's too bad I've got somebody in the best room,"" said Eilert. ""They're"
"gentlefolk from the city. They came down here through Stordalen, and they"
had to walk because the cars have stopped for the season. They've been in
"my house for quite some days, and I think they'll be staying on a while"
"yet. I think they're out now, but of course it means I can't let you have"
"my best room."""
"I looked up, and saw a face in the window. A shiver ran through me--no, of"
"course not a shiver, far from it, but certainly this was a fresh surprise."
"What a coincidence! As we were about to enter the door, there was the"
"actor, too--standing there looking at me: the actor from the Tore Peak"
"resort. It was his knees, his coat, and his stick. So I was right--I"
"_had_ recognized her face at an upper window. Yes, indeed, the world"
is small.
The actor and I greeted each other and began to talk. How nice to see me
"again! And how was Paul, the good fellow--still soaking himself in liquor,"
he supposed? Funny effect it has sometimes; Paul seemed to think the whole
"inn was an aquarium and we visitors the goldfish! ""Ha, ha, ha, goldfish; I"
"wish we were, I must say!--Well, Eilert, are we getting some fresh haddock"
"for supper? Good!--Really, we like it here very much; we've already been"
"here several days; we want to stay and get a good rest."""
"As we stood there, a rather stout girl came down from the loft and"
addressed the actor:
"""The missis wants you to come right upstairs."""
"""Oh? Very well, at once.... Well, see you later. You'll be stopping here,"
"too, I expect?"""
He hurried up the stairs.
arrival of another squadron from Centauri. He found himself busy
readjusting the search pattern to accommodate this new contingent.
He eyed the pattern in the stereo and hoped it was good enough.
*       *       *       *       *
There was the basic aggregate of nine full squadrons spread out flat in
a space lattice that ran back and forth from narrow end to wide end of
the cone of probability. There was one full squadron of roving ships
"that went aimlessly back and forth across the pattern, just to cope"
with the happenstance factor.
One squadron was parked at either end of the search grid as space
"markers, with a computer ship at either end to maintain a constant"
check on their space coordinates. The big search pattern shuttled from
"one end to the other, and if they came back to miss the marker ships,"
they retraced their path so that no space went uncombed.
The infrawave chattered and Space Admiral Stone was calling for
Commodore Theodore Wilson.
"""How're you coming?"""
"Wilson replied, ""We're still at it, Admiral. So far we haven't seen"
"her."""
"""Don't forget, Wilson, there's more lost out there than the woman you"
"want."""
"Ted wanted to snap back angrily, but all he said was, ""You don't mind"
"if I take this search personally, do you, Admiral Stone? I'm not"
"""Oh, I don't know,"" Sidney laughed. ""I'm all mixed up. I guess I was"
"trying to say something Mr. Dugald said once to me."""
"""Oh, _Dug_!"" laughed Pola. ""He's nutty about all that! Look at the way"
he lives here on the Cape. But mother says he'll get over it when he
marries. Now I have no intention of getting serious this grand day so
"let's have another piece of that chocolate fudge cake--it's on me, too,"
"remember!"" Which was Pola's pretty way of pretending she did not know"
that Sidney did not have any money with her. The dollar Sidney had
earned for posing had long since been spent.
"Sidney was relieved that Pola had rescued her from the ""deep water."" At"
the same time she suffered from the sense that she had not made Pola
see Mart in another light. She had failed in loyalty. The sparkling
blue of the bay that stretched before them only reminded her that this
"was the hour she usually went swimming. Due to Pola's ""complex"" she had"
not gone swimming for a whole week.
"Even with her mouth full of the fudge cake, she vowed to herself that"
the very next day she would hunt out her chums and her old pastimes.
Pola and Mr. Dugald must plan without her!
She had promised to dine again at the hotel with Pola and her mother
but as soon as she could after dinner she returned to Sunset Lane.
Because of her determination her heart was lighter. And her way was
"made easier, too, for Mrs. Allan had told Pola at dinner that the"
"""Truxtons were at Chatham Bars."" Pola had been as excited over the"
Truxtons as her mother.
"""Can we go and see them right away?"""
"""Not tonight. But I have arranged for a car and Shields will drive us"
"I jumped out and tried the door. It was locked, and I banged loudly"
without getting any answer. It would not do to lose an unnecessary
"minute, for the many miles we should have to walk later on loomed"
"unpleasantly ahead, but I knew there were pretty certain to be water"
"and washing-basin behind that door, and did not intend to leave them"
"unused if I could help it, _chokidar_ or no _chokidar_. So, I took a"
"butting run with my shoulder, the door gave, and I set out in search"
of the water tub.
"An open door on my right showed me a small room, absolutely empty,"
except for a row of tins against the wall. Knowing that petrol was
carried in such tin drums I went and examined them. The next moment
"Allan heard a shout that brought him hastily inside, wondering"
"whether I had gone mad, had been bitten by a wild beast, or was"
being murdered.
"""Look!"" I cried, as he came running up to me. ""Look at those tins and"
"tell me what's inside!"""
"Allan seized hold of one of the drums, read what was written on it,"
"gave it a shake, and we could both hear the blessed sound of lapping"
inside.
"""It's petrol, sir,"" he whispered in an awed voice."
Petrol in the desert--petrol where one would as soon have expected to
find a Bond Street jeweller!
At first we could neither of us believe it. Personally I imagined we
"had both got temporary jim-jams, but Allan, with his usual stolid,"
"common sense, opened one of the drums, tested the contents, and"
contribution to Christian hymnody has not been only the Gospel Songs
"represented by the writings of Fanny Crosby, but the more permanent"
"works of Whittier, George W. Doane, Hosmer, Samuel Longfellow,"
"Washington Gladden, S. F. Smith, and many others. Our musical"
"contributions have been less conspicuous, but the tunes of Mason are"
coming into their own again and many of them will doubtless survive for
"a long time, as will also those of Bradbury, Hastings, and others."
The tendency today in American hymnbooks is to unite the best in English
and German traditions. The _Hymnary_ illustrates this trend. It makes
large use of the English hymns while at the same time preserving a
"considerable body of the German chorales. In keeping with this trend,"
"the recent hymnbooks of the Episcopal, Presbyterian, Methodist and other"
"churches of English origin, incorporate some of the German chorale tunes"
and in some cases the translations of the words. The hymn books of our
time have become the channels through which flow the rich contributions
to the stream of Christian hymnody from Christian people of all times
and places.

"Mr. Coxon may be forgiven for being, on this same important Monday, in a"
state of some nervous excitement. He had a severe attack of what are
"vulgarly called ""the fidgets,"" and Sir John, who was spending the"
"morning at the Club (for his court was not sitting), glanced at him over"
his eye-glasses with an irritated look. The ex-Attorney-General would
"not sit still, but flitted continually from window to table, and back"
"from table to window, taking up and putting down journal after journal."
"Much depended, in Mr. Coxon's view, on the event of that day, for Sir"
"John spoke openly of his approaching retirement, and an appointment"
sometimes thought worthy of a Premier's acceptance might be in Coxon's
"grasp before many weeks were past, if only Medland and his noxious idea"
of getting a first-class man out from England could be swept together
into limbo.
"""What's the betting about to-night?"" asked the Chief Justice, as in one"
of his restless turns the brooding politician passed near.
"""We reckon to beat him by five,"" answered Coxon."
"""Unless any of your men turn tail, that is? I hear Fenton's very"
wobbly--says he daren't show his face in the North-east Ward if he
"throws Medland over."""
"""Oh, he's all right."""
"""Been promised something?"""
"""You might allow some of us to have consciences, Chief Justice,"" said"
"Coxon, with an attempt at geniality."
"""Oh, some of you, yes. But I'll pick my men, please,"" remarked Sir John,"
"with a pleasant smile. ""Perry's got a conscience, and Kilshaw--well,"
dismay. For some reason she could not understand she had offended Mart.
And Pola had snubbed her. It had indeed been a cruel fate that had
brought Pola out on the wharf at that precise moment!
"She spent a lonely afternoon in Top Notch, too miserable to even pour"
"out her heart to ""Dorothea."" Then she helped Aunt Achsa prepare supper"
"and after supper, which was lonely, too, for neither Lavender nor Mr."
"Dugald were there, she insisted upon clearing up the dishes while Aunt"
Achsa went down to Tillie Higgins'.
Swishing her hands in the soapy water Sidney pondered sadly the things
she had longed to learn of Pola. Her name--why she hadn't even found
out her name! What had her teacher said of that theme she had written
on her visit to the Romley house? Where did Pola live? Of course she
might see her again--Pola had said that they'd be in Provincetown for a
"few days, but she did not _want_ to see her; she did not want Pola to"
see Sunset Lane and the little gray cottage and Aunt Achsa and
Lavender. Pola would laugh at them and she would hate her!
At that moment footsteps crunched the gravel of the path and a shadow
fell across the kitchen door. Sidney turned from the table. There stood
Mr. Dugald and with him--Pola.
"""I've brought my cousin, Sidney. She blew out to the Cape with that"
ill-wind we felt this morning. If you know what we can do with her I'll
"be your slave for life."""
Playfully pushing Dugald Allan aside Pola walked into the kitchen.
"""Isn't he horrid? You wouldn't dream that he's really crazy about me,"
"would you? I told him how we'd met, even before this morning. He'd"
written home that Miss Green's cousin was here but I never dreamed it
abandoned by God?  Have we no punishments nor prophets from the Lord?
"Who then will teach us?"" Tyapa spoke strongly and plainly, and there"
"was faith in his words.  He had been speaking a long time, and the"
"teacher, who was generally drunk and in a speechless condition, could"
"not stand it any longer.  He looked at the dry, wrinkled old man, felt"
"the great force of these words, and suddenly began to pity himself.  He"
wished to say something so strong and convincing to the old man that
Tyapa would be disposed in his favour; he did not wish to speak in such
"a serious, earnest way, but in a soft and fatherly tone.  And the"
teacher felt as if something were rising from his breast into his
throat ...  But he could not find any powerful words.
"""What kind of a man are you? ...  Your soul seems to be torn away--and"
you still continue speaking ... as if you knew something ...  It would
"be better if you were silent."""
"""Ah, Tyapa, what you say is true,"" replied the teacher, sadly. ""The"
people ... you are right ... they are numberless ... but I am a
stranger to them ... and they are strangers to me ... Do you see where
the tragedy of my life is hidden? ... But let me alone!  I shall suffer
"... and there are no prophets also ...  No.  You are right, I speak a"
great deal ...  But it is no good to anyone.  I shall be always silent
"...  Only don't speak with me like this ...  Ah, old man, you do not"
"know ...  You do not know ...  And you cannot understand."""
"And in the end the teacher cried.  He cried so easily and so freely,"
"with such torrents of flowing tears, that he soon found relief."
"""You ought to go into a village ... become a clerk or a teacher ..."
"You would be well fed there.  What are you crying for?"" asked Tyapa,"
sadly.
"Gyp nodded.  Anything--anything!  And when the maid was gone, she thought"
mechanically: 'A cup of hot tea!  How quaint!  What should it be but
hot?'
"The maid came back with the tea; she was an affectionate girl, full of"
"that admiring love servants and dogs always felt for Gyp, imbued, too,"
with the instinctive partisanship which stores itself one way or the
other in the hearts of those who live in houses where the atmosphere
"lacks unity.  To her mind, the mistress was much too good for him--a"
foreigner--and such 'abits!  Manners--he hadn't any!  And no good would
come of it.  Not if you took her opinion!
"""And I've turned the water in, m'm.  Will you have a little mustard in"
"it?"""
"Again Gyp nodded.  And the girl, going downstairs for the mustard, told"
"cook there was ""that about the mistress that makes you quite pathetic."""
"The cook, who was fingering her concertina, for which she had a passion,"
answered:
"""She 'ides up her feelin's, same as they all does.  Thank 'eaven she"
"haven't got that drawl, though, that 'er old aunt 'as--always makes me"
"feel to want to say, 'Buck up, old dear, you ain't 'alf so precious as"
"all that!'"""
"And when the maid Ellen had taken the mustard and gone, she drew out her"
"concertina to its full length and, with cautionary softness, began to"
"practise ""Home, Sweet Home!"""
"To Gyp, lying in her hot bath, those muffled strains just mounted, not"
"quite as a tune, rather as some far-away humming of large flies.  The"
That evening I sat eating alone in the dining room. Since we had not
"brought back any haddock, the visitors upstairs had no desire to come"
"down. All they wanted, Eilert's wife said, was some bread and butter and"
milk to be sent up.
XXVIII
Next morning they had gone.
"Yes, indeed, they left at four in the morning, at dawn; I heard them"
"perfectly well, for my room was near the stairs. The knight of the plump"
"thighs came first, clumping heavily down the stairs. She hushed him, and"
her voice sounded angry.
"Eilert had just risen too, and they stood outside for some minutes,"
"negotiating with him for the boat--yes, at once; they had changed their"
"minds and wanted to leave, immediately. Then they went down to the boat,"
"Eilert with them. I could see them through the window, chilled by the cold"
of early morning and short-tempered with each other. There had been a
"frost during the night; ice lay on the water in the buckets, and the"
"ground was harsh to walk on. Poor things--no food, no coffee; a windy"
"morning, with the sea still running rather high. There they go with their"
knapsacks on their backs; she is still wearing her red hat.
"Well, it was no concern of mine, and I lay down again, intending to sleep"
"till about noon. Nothing was any concern of mine, except myself. I could"
"not see the boat from my bed, so I got up again--just to while the time"
"away--to see how far they had gone. Not very far, though both men were"
*       *       *       *       *
"Then I passed Deck Twelve and there was a big sign. ""Notice! Passengers"
"not permitted past this point!"" A big sign in red."
I peeked around the corner. I knew it--the next deck was the hull. I
"could see the portholes. Every twelve feet, they were, filled with the"
velvet of space and the dancing of more stars than I'd ever dreamed
existed in the Universe.
"There wasn't anyone on the deck, as far as I could see. And this"
"distance from the grav helix, the ship seemed mighty quiet and lonely."
If I just took one quick look....
But I thought of what Sis would say and I turned around obediently.
"Then I saw the big red sign again. ""Passengers not permitted--"""
Well! Didn't I know from my civics class that only women could be Earth
"Citizens these days? Sure, ever since the Male Desuffrage Act. And"
didn't I know that you had to be a citizen of a planet in order to
get an interplanetary passport? Sis had explained it all to me in the
"careful, patient way she always talks politics and things like that to"
men.
"""Technically, Ferdinand, I'm the only passenger in our family. You"
"can't be one, because, not being a citizen, you can't acquire an Earth"
"Passport. However, you'll be going to Venus on the strength of this"
"clause--'Miss Evelyn Sparling and all dependent male members of family,"
this number not to exceed the registered quota of sub-regulations
"pertaining'--and so on. I want you to understand these matters, so that"
you will grow into a man who takes an active interest in world affairs.
"No matter what you hear, women really like and appreciate such men."""
heard from the crippled dwarf.
"""It has nothing to do with you,"" she repeated; ""it is a matter of the"
"Gitanos!"""
"But there came up from the bottom of the ravine, the lantern-jawed"
"Sergeant, long, silent, lean, parched as a Manchegan cow whose pasture"
has been burnt up by a summer sun. With one beckoning finger he summoned
"La Giralda apart, and she obeyed him as readily as the boy had obeyed"
"her. They communed a long time together, the old gipsy speaking, the"
coffee-coloured Sergeant listening with his head a little to the side.
At the end of the colloquy Sergeant Cardono went directly up to Rollo
and saluted.
"""Is it permitted for me to speak a word to your Excellency concerning"
"the objects of the expedition?"" he said, with his usual deference."
"""Certainly!"" answered Rollo; ""for me, my mission is a secret one, but I"
"have no instructions against listening."""
The Sergeant bowed his head.
"""Whatever be our mission you will find me do my duty,"" he said; ""and"
"since this cursed plague may interfere with all your plans, it is well"
that you should know what has befallen and what is designed. You will
pardon me for saying that it takes no great prophet to discover that our
"purposes have to do with the movements of the court."""
Rollo glanced at him keenly.
"""Did General Cabrera reveal anything to you before your departure?"" he"
The tiny sun had leaped up over Jupiter's horizon; and with its
appearance they had sent the ship planing toward their mysterious
"destination. Beneath them the fog banks were thinning, and ahead of"
them were no clouds. For some reason there was a clarity unusual to
Jupiter's atmosphere in the air above the red section.
"""Red spot one mile ahead, altitude forty thousand feet,"" reported"
Brand.
He and Dex peered intently through the port glass panel. Ahead and far
"below, their eyes caught an odd metallic sheen. It was as though the"
ground there were carpeted with polished steel that reflected red
firelight.
"Tense, filled with an excitement that set their pulses pounding"
"wildly, they angled slowly down, nearer to the edge of the vast"
"crimson area, closer to the ground. The radio keened its monotonous"
signal.
"Brand crawled to the transmitter, laboriously, for his body tipped the"
scales here at nearly four hundred pounds.
"""We can see the metallic glitter that Journeyman spoke of,"" he said."
"""No sign of life of any kind, though. The red glow seems to flicker a"
"little."""
Closer the ship floated. Closer. To right and left of them for vast
distances stretched the red area. Ahead of them for hundreds of miles
they knew it extended.
"""We're right on it now,"" called Brand. ""Right on it--we're going over"
"the edge--we're--"""
Dex Harlow was a six-foot Senior Lieutenant who had been on many an
out-of-the-way exploratory trip. Like Brand he was just under thirty
and perpetually thirsting for the bizarre in life. He was a walking
document of planetary activity. He was still baked a brick red from a
"trip to Mercury a year before: he had a scar on his forehead, the"
result of jumping forty feet one day on the moon when he'd meant to
jump only twenty; he was minus a finger which had been irreparably
frost-bitten on Mars; and he had a crumpled nose that was the outcome
of a brush with a ten-foot bandit on Venus who'd tried to kill him for
"his explosive gun and supply of glass, dyite-containing cartridges."
"He clutched Brand's fingers in a bone-mangling grip, and threw his hat"
into a far corner.
"""You're a fine friend!"" he growled cheerfully. ""Here I'm having a"
"first rate time for myself, swimming and planing along the Riviera,"
with two more weeks leave ahead of me--and I get a call from the Old
"Man to report to you. What excuse have you for your crime?"""
"""A junket to Jupiter,"" said Brand. ""Would you call that a good"
"excuse?"""
"""Jupiter!"" exclaimed Dex. ""Wouldn't you know it? Of course you'd have"
to pick a spot four hundred million miles away from all that grand
"swimming I was having!"""
"""Would you like to go back on leave, and have me choose someone else?"""
inquired Brand solemnly.
"""Well, no,"" said Dex hastily. ""Now that I'm here, I suppose I might as"
"well go through with it."""
"She looked at me keenly, and I fancied her colour rose. But she only"
"answered, 'Yes, Martin. But you see I have not one. I am alone.'"
"'And lonely, my lady?'"
"'Sometimes,' she answered, smiling sadly."
"'But this evening?' I replied, feeling that there was still something"
I did not understand. 'I should not have thought you would be feeling
"that way. I have not been here, but when I came in, my lady----'"
"'Pshaw!' she answered with a laugh of disdain. 'Those boys, Martin?"
"They can laugh, fight, and ride; but for the rest, pouf! They are not"
"company. However, it is bedtime, and you must go. I think you have"
"done me good. Good night. I wish--I wish I could do you good,' she"
"added kindly, almost timidly."
To some extent she had. I went away feeling that mine was not the only
"trouble in the world, nor my loneliness the only loneliness. She was a"
"stranger in a besieged city, a woman among men, exposed, despite her"
"rank, to many of a woman's perils; and doubtless she had felt Fraulein"
Max's defection and the Waldgrave's strange conduct more deeply than
any one watching her daily bearing would have supposed. So much the
"greater reason was there that I should do my duty loyally, and putting"
"her first to whom I owed so much, let no sorrow of my own taint my"
service.
But God knows there is one passion that defies argument. The house
next Herr Krapp's had a fascination for me which I could not resist;
"and though I did not again leave my lady unguarded, but arranged that"
"Steve should stop at home and watch the door, four o'clock the next"
afternoon saw me sneaking away in search of St. Austin's. Of course I
"Wearily again, Commodore Wilson called Commander Hatch, who skippered"
one of the scout carriers. He told Hatch to make himself available
"either to Hugh Weston or Maury Allison, to investigate infrawave"
response targets as they saw fit.
Then Wilson hit the sack to finish his off-duty.
"He dozed fitfully, but he did not sleep worth a damn. He would have"
been better off if he could have taken the controls of one of the
"spacers and gone out himself. Then, at least, he would have something"
to fill his mind and idle hands....
Alice Hemingway awoke from a rather pleasant dream that had something
"to do with either ice skating or skiing, or it might have been"
tobogganing--the dream had faded so fast she could not be sure--to face
the fact that she was feeling on the chill side.
"Her blanket had slipped. She caught it around her, and in minutes"
"felt fairly warm again. It was not so much, she thought, the actual"
"temperature in the lifeship, but the whole damned attitude of people,"
and everything else that was so chilling.
"The lights were running all right, and from deep below she could hear"
the ragged throb of the pedal generator. She wondered which of the two
men was pumping it this time.
"When Jock Norton came in, she knew. He was mopping his face with a"
"towel. He looked clean and bright, freshly shaved."
"She looked at him and wished she could have a hot shower herself, and a"
change of clothing. She wanted a ten-hour sleep in a nice soft bed with
"clean sheets, too, and wearing a silk-soft nightgown."
When the three lads came to the finger of granite upon the top of which
"the two fires showed, they first made a careful examination of the"
thickets close by and then ascended to the top.
"“These fires were made to constitute a signal, all right!” Jack"
"declared, poking at the now dying embers."
"“Sure!” answered Frank. “You see, no cooking was done here, and there is"
no camp in sight.”
"“Besides, the position of the blazes on this high rock shows that the"
"fires were built so that the columns of smoke might be seen,” suggested"
"Harry. “It was Indian talk, all right!”"
"“Well, there’s no one here in need of help so far as I can see!” laughed"
"Jack, “and so we may as well go back to the camp.”"
"“That’s the thing to do,” Frank urged. “To tell the truth, I don’t feel"
exactly right about leaving Gilroy there alone.”
"“Aw, we’ll hear him sleeping before we get within a rod of the cave,”"
"laughed Jack. “Gilroy is a good old chap, and father thinks a lot of"
"him, but he doesn’t know much about this kind of a life. I’ll bet that"
"right now he’s dreaming about grizzly bears, and lions, and crocodiles,"
and panthers.”
"From their position in the forest, after their departure from the rock,"
they could see nothing of the signal from the north which had attracted
"Jimmie’s attention, so there seemed nothing for them to do but to return"
to camp. Therefore they set out at good speed.
"""My poor Yolande!  My poor daughter!""  Finding that my endeavours to"
"console her were futile, I went forth and made inquiries of the three"
frightened maidservants regarding what had occurred.
"One of them, a dark-eyed Frenchwoman in frilled cap, whom I had seen on"
"my previous visit, said, in answer to my questions:"
"""Jean discovered the poor mademoiselle in the petit salon about a"
quarter of an hour after m'sieur had left.  She was lying upon her face
"near the window, quite rigid.  He shouted; we all rushed in, and on"
"examining her found that she was already dead."""
"""But was there no sign of a struggle?""  I inquired, leading the way to"
the room indicated.
"""The room was just as m'sieur sees it now,"" she answered, with a wave of"
her hand.
"I glanced around, but as far as I could distinguish it was exactly as I"
had left it.
"""There was no mark of violence--nothing to show that mademoiselle had"
"been the victim of foul play?"""
"""Nothing, m'sieur."""
Could it have been a case of suicide?  I wondered.  Yolande's words
"before I had taken leave of her were desponding, and almost led me to"
believe that she had taken her life rather than face the man Wolf who
had so suddenly arrived in Paris--the man who exercised upon her some
"mysterious influence, the nature of which I could not guess."
He intended to make sure it didn't. The planning had been split-second
up until now; this was no moment to relax his guard.
"Yes, it was good he was here. As he studied Comrade Karanova, he"
realized that something about her was still making him uneasy. So far
"it was merely a hunch, but his hunches had been right more often than"
he liked to think.
He tried to push the feeling aside. Probably just paranoia. She
"obviously was here today for the same reason he was, to make sure the"
Soviet money was returned safely. She probably was also still worried
"about the protocol, but that problem was hers, not his. From today on,"
the KGB would have to work out their in-fighting back home the best way
they could. The ground rules were changing fast in Moscow.
"Besides, Dzerzhinsky Square was about to become part of a previous life"
"for him. If he could just clear this up, get his commission, he'd be"
set. Forever. Enough was enough. Maybe he'd end up in the Caribbean
"like Michael, drinking margaritas and counting string bikinis."
The elevator door opened. Facing them were Michael Vance and Eva
Borodin.
"""Glad you could make it."" Vance glanced coldly at Vera. ""Right on time."
"The money arrives in exactly seven minutes."""
"She nodded a silent greeting, pulling her sable coat tighter as she"
strode past. The bank officials lined up along the corridor watched her
"with nervous awe. Even in London, T-Directorate brass had clout."
They moved as a group down the long carpeted hallway leading to the
"counting room. On this floor everything was high-security, with"
"distinctly, though at that time, my poor friend, you were not a little"
"portly, and now you are a man shrunken."""
"""And my name?"" he asked, flattered that a beautiful woman should recall"
him so distinctly.
"""It is a strange name--Gatepath. An old English name redolent of the"
soil. Roger Gatepath. Your firm bears no prefix of initials and no
"suffix of company. You call yourselves Gatepaths. Just Gatepaths, as"
"though your status were territorial."""
"He crowed with pleasure. By an exercise in memory, Madame Gilbert had"
tied him to her chariot wheels.
"""Right!"" cried he. ""Right in every particular. You are the most"
"wonderful of women. For two minutes I spoke with you, and that was"
"nearly four years ago. I was one of a large party, an insignificant"
"lawyer lost in a dazzling company of titles. Yet you have remembered."""
Madame left the sense of flattery to soak in. She did not spoil the
impression that she had made by explaining that she would have
remembered a lackey with just the same accuracy.
"""And you, Madame?"" he asked. ""Have you been all these years doing war"
work with the Italian Red Cross? The years have passed and left no mark
"upon your face and figure. I, who comfortably filled out my clothes, am"
"shrunken, yet time and sorrow have spared you."""
"""Nevertheless, I have been pretty hard at work,"" said Madame briskly. ""I"
was present at that party ostensibly as an official of the Italian Red
Cross. In fact I was there to see that no harm befell the Royal
Personages who were in my charge. While we moved about those pleasant
in certain curiosities. She had seen that morning what had escaped the
Canon’s notice--the stranger’s grasp on Yvonne’s arm and the insolent
"admiration on his face. This fact, coupled with Yvonne’s agitation, had"
"put her upon the track of scandal. The result was, that at the concert"
"she made interesting discoveries, and, piecing things together in her"
"mind afterwards, bided her time to make use of them."
"It would be for the Canon’s sake, naturally. A woman of Mrs."
Winstanley’s stamp is always the most disinterested of God’s creatures.
She never performed an action of which her conscience did not approve.
But she was such a superior woman that her conscience trembled a little
"before her, like most of the other friends whom she patronised. She did"
not have to wait long. The Canon called upon her soon after his return
to invite herself and the Wilmingtons to dinner. It was his last
"evening at Ostend, and Yvonne was not feeling well enough to spend it,"
"as usual, at the Kursaal."
"“Yvonne is still poorly, Everard?” she asked, with her air of"
confidential responsibility.
"“A little. She has been gadding about somewhat too much lately, and it"
has knocked her up.”
“Has it not occurred to you that her encounter this morning may have had
something to do with it?”
"“Of course not,” replied the Canon, sharply. “It would be ridiculous.”"
"“I have reasons for not thinking so, Everard. The man was singing at the"
Kursaal this afternoon. Here is his name on the programme.” She
handed him the slip of paper. He read the name among the artistes. “M.
Bazouge.” He returned it to her.

_SUPERSTITIONS_
"The three of them went to a rather dirty tavern in the same lane,"
and settled themselves by the window. This post was a good point of
"observation for that narrow street, so crowded and so picturesque."
"Workmen went by, and itinerant vendors, women with kerchiefs, half"
"head-dress and half muffler, and with black eyes and expressive faces."
"Opposite was a booth of coloured candies, dried figs strung on a reed,"
and various kinds of sweets.
"A wine-cart passed, and Kennedy made Cæsar observe how decorative it"
"was with its big arm-seat in the middle and its hood above, like a"
prompter’s box.
Giovanni Battista ordered a flask of wine for the three of them. While
"he chatted and drank, friends of his came to greet them. They were men"
"with beards, long hair, and soft hats, of the Garbaldi and Verdi type so"
abundant in Italy.
"Among them were two serious old men; one was a model, a native of"
"Frascati, with the face of a venerable apostle; the other, for contrast,"
"looked like a buffoon and was the possessor of a grotesque nose, long,"
thin at the end and adorned with a red wart.
"""To what do you refer?"""
"""You told me that you loved me, Gerald,"" she said in a deep voice,"
"suddenly grown calm.  ""You swore by all you held most sacred that I was"
"all the world to you, and that no one should come between us.  Yet past"
events have shown that you have forgotten those words of yours on the
"day when we idled in the Bois beneath the trees.  You, too, remember"
"that day, do you not--the day when our lips met for the first time, and"
"we both believed our path would in future be strewn with flowers?  Ah!"""
"she sighed, ""and what an awakening life has been to me since then!"""
"""We parted because of your refusal to satisfy me as to the real state of"
"your feelings towards the man who was my enemy,"" I said rather warmly."
"""But was it justifiable?"" she asked in a tone of deep reproach and"
mingled sweetness.  Her blue eyes looked full upon me--those eyes that
"had held me in such fascination in the golden days of youth.  ""Has any"
single fact which you have since discovered verified your suspicions?
"Tell me truthfully;"" and she leaned towards me in an attitude of deepest"
earnestness.
"""No,"" I answered honestly, ""I cannot say that my suspicions have ever"
"been verified."""
"""And because of that you have returned to me when it is too late."""
"""Too late!""  I cried.  ""What do you mean?"""
"""Exactly what I have said.  You have come back to me when it is too"
"late."""
recognized by those whom I did know ha my former life.  There is scarce
an antechamber in those fine houses where patrons dwell where I might
not meet the curious and impertinent regard of those who would know me
"again. That I will not brook.""  And now Grey’s eyes flashed, thinking of"
"Lord Sandford, and how he would chuckle to hear how low his rival had"
"fallen.  ""No; if I am to succeed at all, I must needs do so without a"
"patron. If I fail, there is one resource left.  Able-bodied paupers are"
"sent to the wars.  I can go thither and fight."""
Again a smile flickered over the Old Lion’s face; but the tapster was
"entering with the smoking viands, and the gleam in Grey’s eyes bespoke"
the wolf within him.
"""Set to, my friend, and make a good meal.  When we have cleared the"
"trenchers, you shall come with me to my lodging.  I would hear the end"
"of your tale; but that can wait till after supper."""
*CHAPTER XI.*
*THE LION’S DEN.*
"""Welcome to the Lion’s Den!"" spoke the man Wylde, as he threw open the"
"door of a room which he had unlocked, and kicking a smouldering log upon"
"the hearth, evoked a cheery blaze, by the aid of which he lighted a lamp"
"that swung over a table littered with books, papers, and quills."
"Grey stepped within the threshold, and looked about him with curious"
eyes.  The house they had entered a few minutes before was a tall and
"had no use. Yet, yet--my original guess stuck firmly in my mind,"
"improbable though it might be, and had just been nailed down"
tightly--I scorn to mystify the reader--by a few simple sentences
spoken in French.
CHAPTER VII
THE MARINE SENTRY
We had a whole day to fill in before we could get any news of Dawson's
"vigil in the _Malplaquet_, and I have never known a day as drearily"
"long. Cary and I were both restless as peas on a hot girdle, and could"
not settle down to talk or to read or to write. Cary sought vainly to
persuade me to read and pass judgment upon his Navy Book. In spite of
my interest in the subject my soul revolted at the forbidding pile of
manuscript. I promised to read the proofs and criticise them with
"severity, but as for the M.S.--no, thanks. Poor Cary needed all his"
sweet patience to put up with me. By eleven o'clock we had become
"unendurable to one another, and I gladly welcomed his suggestion to"
"adjourn to his club, have lunch there, and try to inveigle the"
"Commander of the _Malplaquet_ into our net. ""I know him,"" said Cary."
"""He is a fine fellow; and though he must be pretty busy, he will be"
glad to lunch somewhere away from the ship. If we have luck we will go
"back with him and look over the _Malplaquet_ ourselves."""
"""If you can manage that, Cary, you will have my blessing."""
He did manage to work the luncheon part by telephoning to the yard
"Monsieur considered this a great joke, exclaiming:"
"""It is not so much as that! She is but three--to me, always three! Yet,"
"as you say, I might better find her with you than anywhere! A despairing"
"search, my boys!"""
Tommy's eyes were twinkling as he murmured sympathetically:
"""If it's a three-year-old you want, there's a place in Havana called"
"'Casa de Beneficencia Maternidad,' where furtive-eyed damsels leave"
"kiddies at twilight, ring the doorbell, and beat it. You might pick up"
"one there, as a last resort."""
"""But--but,"" Monsieur began to sputter, when I threw an orange at Tommy,"
"explaining to our agitated guest that he was a cut-up devoid of ideas,"
really an intellectual outcast.
"""Well,"" he cried, seeming to exude pleasure, ""I will stay with you a"
"while, eh? Maybe we can teach him something--this cut-upping Tommy of"
"yours!"""
"He had fallen in with our scheme most agreeably, and later Tommy"
confided to me that he was glad we wouldn't have to sit on the old
fellow's head.
"Passing that afternoon beneath Morro Castle, the _Whim_ tacked prettily"
through the entrance of Havana harbor and in another scant two miles
dropped anchor.
"Havana Bay is a dancing sheet of water, as bright as the skies and"
hardly less contagious than the city's laughter. But when one drops
He went back into the drawing-room.  There they were--just passing the
"side of the house. Five minutes, and they would be down at the turning."
"He stood at the window, waiting.  If only that fellow did not come in!"
Through the partition wall he could hear him still tramping up and down
the dining-room.  What a long time a minute was!  Three had gone when he
"heard the dining-room door opened, and Fiorsen crossing the hall to the"
"front door.  What was he after, standing there as if listening?  And"
"suddenly he heard him sigh.  It was just such a sound as many times, in"
"the long-past days, had escaped himself, waiting, listening for"
"footsteps, in parched and sickening anxiety. Did this fellow then really"
"love--almost as he had loved?  And in revolt at spying on him like this,"
he advanced and said:
"""Well, I won't wait any longer."""
Fiorsen started; he had evidently supposed himself alone.  And Winton
thought: 'By Jove! he does look bad!'
"""Good-bye!"" he said; but the words: ""Give my love to Gyp,"" perished on"
their way up to his lips.
"""Good-bye!"" Fiorsen echoed.  And Winton went out under the trellis,"
conscious of that forlorn figure still standing at the half-opened door.
Betty was nowhere in sight; she must have reached the turning.  His
"mission had succeeded, but he felt no elation.  Round the corner, he"
"picked up his convoy, and, with the perambulator hoisted on to the taxi,"
"journeyed on at speed.  He had said he would explain in the cab, but the"
only remark he made was:
"""You'll all go down to Mildenham to-morrow."""
"And Betty, who had feared him ever since their encounter so many years"
in lockers for a while without speaking. Then he spoke slowly and
deliberately.
"""It strikes me that when I was an officer of the bodyguard, in the"
"service of the late Fernando the Seventh, my right royal namesake (and"
"in some sort predecessor), there was another room used for the private"
stores and pieces of the officers. If I mistake not it was entered by
"that door to the right, but the key appears to be wanting!"""
"He added the last clause, as he watched the frantic efforts of Rollo,"
"who had immediately thrown himself upon the panels, while the Señor was"
in the act of rolling out his long-drawn Castilian elegances of
utterance.
"""Hither, Cardono,"" cried Rollo, ""open me this door! Quick, Sergeant!"""

"But Rollo, now keen on the scent of weapons of defence, would not admit"
"a moment's delay, and the Sergeant, inserting his curiously crooked"
"blade, opened that door as easily as he had done the French window."
Muñoz stepped forward with some small show of eagerness and glanced
within.
"""Yes,"" he said, ""the officers' arms are there, and a liberal allowance"
"of powder."""
"""They are mostly sporting rifles,"" said Rollo, looking them over, ""but"
"there is certainly plenty of powder and ball."""

"Once more I was run into a party of English, the last for this year."
They arrived by steamer in the morning and stopped at the trading station
"for a few hours, meanwhile sending up a detachment through the valley to"
"order a car to meet them. Stordalen, Stordalen, they said. So they had"
apparently not yet seen Stordalen--an omission they must repair at once.
And what a sensation they made!
They came across by rowboat from the trading station; we could hear them a
"long way off, an old man's voice drowning out all the others. Eilert"
"dropped everything he had in hand, and ran down to the landing place in"
"order to be the first on the spot. From Olaus's house, too, a man and a"
"few half-grown boys went down, and from all the houses round swarmed"
curious and helpful crowds. There were so many spectators at the landing
place that the old man with the loud voice drew himself up to his full
"height in the boat and majestically shouted his English at us, as though"
his language must of course be ours as well:
"""Where's the car? Bring the car down!"""
"Olaus, who was sharp, guessed what he meant and at once sent his two boys"
"up the valley to meet the car and hurry it on, for the Englishmen had"
arrived.
"They disembarked, they were in a great hurry, they could not understand"
"why the car had not come to meet them: ""What was the meaning of this?"""
"There were four of them. ""Stordalen!"" they said. As they came up past"
"""Yes,"" he answered, ""and I shall visit him without delay."""
"""In Paris?"" I asked, not quite sure that Monsieur le Grand was King Louis"
"of France, and not desiring to know certainly."
"""In Paris,"" he answered, giving me to understand by his manner that he"
must tell me nothing more definite of Le Grand's identity.
"""Don't tell me what you know of the business this letter refers to, but"
"tell me whether you know,"" I said, hoping that George might at least tell"
me it meant good fortune for him.
"""I cannot even conjecture the business upon which I am wanted,"" he said,"
"""but I hope that it may give me an opportunity to be of service to the"
"writer."""
Thus I was relieved of the disagreeable task of trying to induce George
"to leave England, and was very thankful to escape it."
"After a long silence, during which he read the one-line letter many"
"times, he asked:--"
"""Are you willing to bring Frances to me early to-morrow morning, if she"
"will come?"""
"""Doubtless I can,"" I answered. ""Her willingness to come has been shown"
"all too plainly of late; but ought I bring her?"""
"""Yes. It will be the last time I shall ever see her unless good fortune"
"lies in this letter, and for that I hardly dare hope. You know that when"
"a man's luck has been against him for a long time, it kills the very"
roots of hope and brings him almost to doubt certainty. Soon after I have

"forename, and do not fill out the forenames: e.g., _Friedlander"
"und Sohn, Raphael_, not under _Raphael_; _Stokes, F. A. Co._, not"
"_Stokes, Frederick A. Co._"
The consulter is much more likely to remember the family than the
Christian name. Whether the Christian name is written at the end
"or thus, _Town (John)_ and _Bowers (Henry)_, all firms should be"
"arranged after all the other entries of the first family name, i.e.,"
_Friedlander und Sohn_ after all the _Friedlanders_.
"This rule might be extended to include corporations, colleges,"
"libraries, etc., whose legal names include forenames. Entry under a"
"forename, as _Silas Bronson Library_, and especially under initials, as"
"_T. B. Scott Public Library_, is awkward. But the public habit is not"
yet sufficiently settled to justify an exception.

South America under the name of the place; all other societies

"where they are established, may be entered under the place with a"

"act promptly. Crouching low, he slid over the edge of the car, hung"
"lightly for an instant, and then disappeared. Half a dozen of the"
"top-riders observed his feat, wonderingly, but made no comment, deeming"
it prudent not to express surprise at what might be the conventional
manner of alighting in this bewildering city. The truant passenger
"dodged a hansom and then floated past, like a leaf on a stream between"
a furniture van and a florist’s delivery wagon.

James Williams. Then she faced about and sat still while the Rubberneck
auto stopped at the flash of the badge under the coat of the
plainclothes man.
"“What’s eatin’ you?” demanded the megaphonist, abandoning his"
professional discourse for pure English.
"“Keep her at anchor for a minute,” ordered the officer. “There’s a man"
on board we want—a Philadelphia burglar called ‘Pinky’ McGuire. There
"he is on the back seat. Look out for the side, Donovan.”"
Donovan went to the hind wheel and looked up at James Williams.
"“Come down, old sport,” he said, pleasantly. “We’ve got you. Back to"
"Sleepytown for yours. It ain’t a bad idea, hidin’ on a Rubberneck,"
though. I’ll remember that.”
Softly through the megaphone came the advice of the conductor:
"“Better step off, sir, and explain. The car must proceed on its tour.”"
James Williams belonged among the level heads. With necessary slowness

"A Bill to Consolidate, with Amendments, the Enactments"
relating to Naval Prize of War.
Whereas at the Second Peace Conference held at The Hague in the year
"nineteen hundred and seven a Convention, the English translation whereof"
"is set forth in the First Schedule to this Act, was drawn up, but it is"
desirable that the same should not be ratified by His Majesty until such
amendments have been made in the law relating to naval prize of war as
will enable effect to be given to the Convention:
And whereas for the purpose aforesaid it is expedient to consolidate the
law relating to naval prize of war with such amendments as aforesaid and
with certain other minor amendments:
"Be it therefore enacted by the King's most Excellent Majesty, by and"
"with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and"
"Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of"
"the same, as follows:--"
PART I.--COURTS AND OFFICERS.
_The Prize Court in England._
"[Sidenote: The High Court. [54 & 55 Vict. c. 53, s. 4.]]"
"1.--(1) The High Court shall, without special warrant, be a prize court,"
"and shall, on the high seas, and throughout His Majesty's Dominions, and"
"in every place where His Majesty has jurisdiction, have all such"
jurisdiction as the High Court of Admiralty possessed when acting as a

it. What would happen after that she was too listless to think. It was
"summed up in negations; and these again melted into one great want, the"
absence of the man to whom her imagination and her heart blindly and
obstinately clung.
"Lady Eynesford had left her newspaper, and Alicia found her hand upon"
"it. Taking it up, she read Medland's evidence at the inquest. A sudden"
revulsion of feeling seized her. Was this the man she was dreaming
"about, a man who calmly, coolly, as though caring nothing, told that"
story in the face of all the world? Was she never to get rid of the
spell he had cast on her before she knew what he really was? For a man
"like this she had sacrificed her self-respect, bandied insults with a"
"vulgar upstart, and brought on her head a reproach more fitting for an"
ill-mannered child. She threw the paper from her and rose to her feet.
She would think no more of him; he might be what he would; he was no fit
"subject for her thoughts, and he and the place where he lived and all"
"this wretched country deserved nothing better than to be forgotten,"
"resolutely, utterly, soon."
"""I am very sorry, Mary,"" she was saying, ten minutes later; ""I deserved"
"all you said. I don't know what foolishness possessed me. See, I have"
"written and apologised to Mr. Coxon."""
And Lady Eynesford kissed her and thanked heaven that they would soon
have done with Mr. Coxon and--all the rest.

ADJECTIVE-HEADINGS
"In general, a noun or a substantive phrase should be selected for the"

SUBJECT-MATTER
It is not possible to formulate rules for indexing subject-matter
"as definitely as has already been done with names, places, etc. The"
judgment of the indexer and his analytical skill will be called fully
"into play. The effort should be to express in the index, in the"

"in his text. As an aid to the nature and form of the entries, a page of"
"text is shown on the opposite page, and the entries which would appear"

5. Hymns of the Bohemian Brethren.
"The followers of John Hus who came to be known as the Bohemian Brethren,"
"and later as the Moravians, were the first Protestant group to introduce"
congregational singing into their worship. They also published the first
"Protestant hymnbooks, one in 1501 and another in 1505, containing 89 and"
"400 hymns, respectively, in their native Bohemian tongue. Their efforts"
to introduce congregational singing were sternly opposed by the Roman
hierarchy. The Council of Constance condemned Hus to be burned at the
"stake and warned his successor, Jacob of Misi, to cease the singing of"
hymns in the churches. It decreed:
"If laymen are forbidden to preach and interpret the Scriptures, much"
more are they forbidden to sing publicly in the churches.
"As a result of their persecution, the Brethren in 1508 sent out"
messengers to search for true Christian people into whose communion they
"might apply for admission—one to Russia, one to Greece, one to Bulgaria,"
and one to Palestine and Egypt. All returned unsuccessful. No such
"Christians had been found. They therefore remained in their own country,"
giving themselves assiduously to the translation and printing of the
Bible.
In 1522 the Brethren sent two messengers to Luther to greet him and ask
his advice. Luther became interested in them and welcomed their
fellowship. He was impressed with the hymnbook the Brethren had
"published, and later used some of the hymns in his own work."
"Accordingly, within four hours of receiving his appointment, Terence"
"bade his parent farewell and proceeded by rail to Devonport, where"
"the ""Sunderland"" was lying. It was nearly dark when he alighted at"
Millbay station. Here he called a taxi and was whirled off to the
"Dockyard, whence a picquet boat conveyed him to the cruiser, which"
was lying at a buoy in the Hamoaze.
"""We're off under sealed orders at six o'clock tomorrow morning,"""
"announced one of his new shipmates, a junior lieutenant, Teddy"
"Barracombe by name. ""Of course, we are quite in the dark, but there's"
a strong idea floating around that the ship's off to the Near East.
Just my mark! According to all accounts we'll be pretty busy in the
"Dardanelles."""
"""That's all very fine for you,"" commented Oswestry, the torpedo"
"lieutenant, ""but where do I come in? We can't use torpedoes against"
"fortifications, you know, and there's precious little floating about"
"for us to go for."""
"""Don't take on, Torps,"" said Barracombe cheerfully. ""You never know"
"your luck. Wait and see."""
"""I'd rather t'were the other way about,"" corrected Torps. ""Seeing"
your torpedo leave the tube and waiting for the enemy ship to be
blown up. No Dardanelles for me. So I hope to goodness it's the North
"Sea. By Jove, I do!"""
"As soon as the ""Sunderland"" was clear of the breakwater the momentous"
orders were opened. It was not to the Near East; the cruiser had to
proceed to Dover and await further instructions.
"pitiful to hear. And the castle was hung with black, and in the whole"
kingdom proclamation was made from all pulpits that whoever could help
"the king's daughter should get her, and half the kingdom besides. Then"
"Tom, Dick and Harry, and the best physicians in the country came along."
But none of them could help the princess.
But one day a foreign doctor from afar came to court. He was not from
"their country, he said, and had made the journey purposely just to try"
"his luck here. But he must see the king's daughter alone, said he, and"
permission was granted him.
"The king's daughter recognized him, and grew red and pale in turn. ""If"
"I help you now, will you marry me?"" asked the youth. Yes, indeed she"
"would. Then he gave her one of the magic apples, and her horns were only"
"half as large as before. ""But I cannot do more until I have my cap,"
"and my table-cloth, and my purse back again,"" said he. So she went and"
"brought him the things. Then he gave her still another magic apple, and"
"now the horns were no more than tiny hornlets. ""But now I cannot go on"
"until you have sworn that you will be true to me,"" said he. And she"
"swore that she would. And after she had eaten the third apple, her"
"forehead was quite smooth again, and she was even more beautiful than"
in days gone by.
Then there was great joy in the castle. They prepared for the wedding
"with baking and brewing, and invited people from East and West to come"
"to it. And they ate and drank, and were merry and of good cheer, and if"
"they have not stopped, they are merry and of good cheer to this very"
day!
NOTE
"be prolonged, seeing that the glow of the sun-rising was already"
reddening the sky to the east.
Etienne was secretly fingering his beads. And El Sarria thought with
satisfaction of the safety of Dolóres; he had given up hope of Concha a
full hour ago. The ex-Miguelete had doubtless again played the traitor.
He took a cigarette from Rollo without speaking and followed him across
the uneven floor between the heaps of trodden grain.
"They were led down the stairway one by one, and as they passed through"
"the ground floor, with its thick woolly coating of grey flour dust, a"
"trumpet blew without, and they heard the trampling of horses in the"
courtyard.
"""Quick!"" said a voice at Rollo's elbow, ""here is your chocolate. Nothing"
like it for strengthening the knee-joints at a time like this. I've seen
"men die on wine and on rum and on brandy; but for me, give me a cup of"
"chocolate as good as that, when my time comes!"""
Rollo drank the thick sweet strength-giving stuff to the accompaniment
of clattering hoofs and jingling accoutrements.
"""Come!"" said a voice again, ""give me the cup. Do not keep the general"
"waiting. He is in no good temper this morning, and we are to march"
"immediately."""
The young man stepped out of the mill-door into the crisp chill of the
"dawn. All the east was a glory of blood-red cloud, and for the second"
time Rollo and his companions stood face to face with General Cabrera.
It was within a quarter of an hour of the sun-rising.

anything was carried in the hand.
"She found Monsieur Harmost fidgeting up and down the room, whose opened"
windows could not rid it of the smell of latakia.
"""Ah,"" he said, ""I thought you were not coming!  You look pale; are you"
"not well?  Is it the heat?  Or""--he looked hard into her face--""has"
"someone hurt you, my little friend?""  Gyp shook her head. ""Ah, yes,"" he"
"went on irritably; ""you tell me nothing; you tell nobody nothing!  You"
"close up your pretty face like a flower at night.  At your age, my child,"
one should make confidences; a secret grief is to music as the east wind
"to the stomach.  Put off your mask for once.""  He came close to her."
"""Tell me your troubles.  It is a long time since I have been meaning to"
"ask. Come!  We are only once young; I want to see you happy."""
But Gyp stood looking down.  Would it be relief to pour her soul out?
Would it?  His brown eyes questioned her like an old dog's. She did not
want to hurt one so kind.  And yet--impossible!
Monsieur Harmost suddenly sat down at the piano.  Resting his hands on
"the keys, he looked round at her, and said:"
"""I am in love with you, you know.  Old men can be very much in love, but"
"they know it is no good--that makes them endurable. Still, we like to"
feel of use to youth and beauty; it gives us a little warmth.  Come; tell
"me your grief!""  He waited a moment, then said irritably: ""Well, well, we"
"go to music then!"""
"It was his habit to sit by her at the piano corner, but to-day he stood"
"as if prepared to be exceptionally severe.  And Gyp played, whether from"
"overexcited nerves or from not having had any lunch, better than she had"
CHAPTER XXIII.
THE FLIGHT.
"One of the men--it was I--muttered something to Marie, and she snuffed"
"the wick, and blew up the light. In a moment it filled the room,"
"disclosing a strange medley of levelled weapons, startled faces, and"
flashing eyes. In one corner Fraulein Max and the two women cowered
"behind one another, trembling and staring. At the table sat my lady,"
"with dull, dazed eyes, looking on, yet scarcely understanding what was"
"happening. On either side of her stood Steve and I, covering the"
"general with our pistols, while the Waldgrave, who was still too weak"
"for much exertion, kept guard at the door."
"Tzerclas was the first to speak. 'What is this foolery?' he said,"
scowling unutterable curses at us. 'What does this mean?'
"'This!' I said, producing a piece of hide rope. 'We are going to tie"
"you up. If you struggle, general, you die. If you submit, you live."
"That is all. Go to work, Steve.'"
"There was a gleam in Tzerclas' eye, which warned me to stand back and"
"crook my finger. His face was black with fury, and for an instant I"
thought that he would spring upon us and dare all. But prudence and
"the pistols prevailed. With an evil look he sat still, and in a trice"
Steve had a loop round his arms and was binding him to the heavy
chair.
I knew then that as far as he was concerned we were safe; and I turned
"to bid the women get cloaks and food, adjuring them to be quick, since"
"A sigh escaped her, and her hand sought my arm."
"""I was young once, m'sieur,"" she said in that calm, refined voice which"
had long ago always sounded so much to me like that of my own dead
"mother.  ""I understand your feeling--I understand perfectly.  It is only"
my poor daughter who does not understand.  She knows that you have
"forsaken her--that is all."""
It was upon my tongue to lay bare to her the secret of my heart's
"longings, yet I hesitated.  I remembered that calm, serious, sweet-faced"
"woman on the other side of the English Channel, far from the glare and"
glitter of life as I knew it--the fevered life which the diplomat in
"Paris is forced to lead.  I remembered my troth to Edith, and my"
conscience pricked me.
"""Could it be possible,"" I reflected, ""that Yolande was really in the pay"
"of a Government hostile to England?""  Kaye was already nearing Berlin"
with the intention of searching out her actions and exposing her as a
"spy, while Anderson had already denounced her as having been a party to"
an attempt to secure the secret which he had carried from Berlin to
Downing Street.
With a mother's solicitude the Countess could for some time only speak
"of Yolande's mysterious attack; but at last, in order to prosecute my"
"inquiries further, I observed, during a lull in the conversation:"
"""At the Baroness de Chalencon's last night a friend of yours inquired"
"about you, madame."""
"""A friend?  Who?"""

[Illustration: FRUIT COMPANY STEAMER AT WHARF]
The United Fruit Company is by far the greatest agricultural enterprise
the world has ever known. Its fruit plantations constitute a farm half a
mile wide and more than seven hundred miles long. All of its farm lands
exceed in area the 1332 square miles which constitute the sovereign
"State of Rhode Island. On these farms are more than 25,000 head of live"
stock. This agricultural empire is traversed by nearly 1000 miles of
railroad. To carry the fruits from the plantations to the seaports there
are employed 100 locomotives and 3000 freight cars. An army of nearly
"40,000 men is employed in this new and mammoth industry. The republics"
of Central America were inland nations before the United Fruit Company
made gardens of the low Caribbean coast lands and created from the
"virgin wilderness such ports as Barrios, Cortez, Limon and Bocas del"
Toro.

explained briefly. “When he’d eat it he went off agin.”
“Didn’t he say where he was going?” Bainbridge asked.
The cook shook his head. “Nary word.”
“And you didn’t happen to see what direction he took?”
"“Nary a sight,” was the reply. “I was busy inside.”"
"Bob frowned for a second, and then shrugged his shoulders. After all,"
"what did it matter where the fellow had gone, so long as he had taken"
himself away? It was very natural for him to avoid the man who had so
"humiliated him, though it was rather puzzling to have him slip away"
without apparently encountering any one.
"Bob proceeded to give his orders to the cook, explaining that he would"
have to pull up stakes at once and start down the river.
"“The boys will be a long way from here by nightfall,” he said, “so"
you’ll have to hustle. I’ve saved out a couple of men to help you and

Outside the mess tent he hesitated an instant. Then he entered the other
"tent. This time he did not pause by the door, but crossed hastily to the"
"farther corner, where there was a small space crudely partitioned off"
"from the main portion. This would be Schaeffer’s sanctum, of course, and"
Bob entered it curiously--only to stop with an exclamation of mingled
"surprise, anger, and chagrin."
The place was in the utmost disorder. Blankets were rolled up in a ball
I flattered myself that we had all done a neat bit of convincing lying in
a good cause.

saying:--

to pull some posies and yer was squeezin’ de oder gal to beat de band.
"She says it looked cute, all right all right, but it made her sick. She"
"says yer better git busy, and make a sneak for de train.”"
The young man gave a low whistle and his eyes flashed with a sudden
"thought. His hand flew to the inside pocket of his coat, and drew out a"
"handful of letters. Selecting one, he handed it to the boy, following"
it with a silver dollar from his vest-pocket.
"“Give that letter to the lady,” he said, “and ask her to read it. Tell"
"her that it should explain the situation. Tell her that, if she had"
"mingled a little trust with her conception of the ideal, much heartache"
might have been avoided. Tell her that the loyalty she prizes so much
has never wavered. Tell her I am waiting for an answer.”
The messenger stood before the lady.
“De gent says he’s had de ski-bunk put on him widout no cause. He says
"he’s no bum guy; and, lady, yer read dat letter, and I’ll bet yer he’s"
"a white sport, all right.”"
"The young lady unfolded the letter; somewhat doubtfully, and read it."
Dear Dr. Arnold:   I want to thank you for your most kind and opportune
"aid to my daughter last Friday evening, when she was overcome by an"
attack of her old heart-trouble in the conservatory at Mrs. Waldron’s
reception. Had you not been near to catch her as she fell and to render
"proper attention, we might have lost her. I would be glad if you would"
call and undertake the treatment of her case.
CHAPTER XV
THE JOURNEY HOME--THE FISHING AND WORKING OF THE KALOMA SHELL
I
The return journey of the Sinaketan fleet is made by following exactly
the same route as the one by which they came to Dobu. In each inhabited
"island, in every village, where a halt had previously been made,"
"they stop again, for a day or a few hours. In the hamlets of Sanaroa,"
"in Tewara and in the Amphletts, the partners are revisited. Some"
"Kula valuables are received on the way back, and all the talo'i"
gifts from those intermediate partners are also collected on the
return journey. In each of these villages people are eager to hear
about the reception which the uvalaku party have received in Dobu;
"the yield in valuables is discussed, and comparisons are drawn between"
the present occasion and previous records.
"No magic is performed now, no ceremonial takes place, and there"
would be very little indeed to say about the return journey but for
two important incidents; the fishing for spondylus shell (kaloma)
"in Sanaroa Lagoon, and the display and comparison of the yield of"
Kula valuables on Muwa beach.
"second he stood in awkward silence, swallowing hard in his"
embarrassment. Then he raised his head again.
"“I don’t need your job,” he said, in a poor imitation of devil-may-care"
"defiance. “I’ll get my time, and----”"
Bainbridge cut him short. “You’ll get down to the drive and _work_. Beat
it now--quick!”
"Without another protesting word, Kollock turned meekly and obeyed."
CHAPTER XII. THE TEST
"Before he had taken a dozen steps, Kollock was furious with himself, and"
by the time Bainbridge was out of sight the wrath of the riverman had
risen to a white heat.
From the first he had tried to dislike Bainbridge. Pete Schaeffer had
"been his friend, and after he had been whipped Curly made up his mind"
that there could be no getting along in a crew bossed by the victor.
Then came that brief but pointed interview with Bob which affected him
so oddly. He had never before had anybody tell him that he was to be
"trusted; most bosses had been emphatic in saying the opposite thing. Or,"
"if they kept silent, they showed in a dozen obvious ways that they"
considered him in the same class with his notorious brother.
Then there was the incident of the day before. Curly could not help
admiring the manner in which Bainbridge had handled the crowd that was
trying to hold up the drive. It was exactly the sort of thing he would
"like to have done himself, and his heart warmed toward the man with the"
"courage and ability to act in that fashion. Moreover, Jack Joyce was an"
"for some word of Lavender, but the words failed in her throat. Cold,"
"forlorn, hungry, she crept to her room, threw off her clothes and"
huddled down into the bed-clothes.
"They would all blame her--Miss Vine and Mr. Dugald, Aunt Achsa, Doctor"
Blackwell. Probably now Pola would have more complexes to suffer;
Pola's mother would be angry and they could never be friends again. And
Mart--Aunt Achsa had said old Mrs. Calkins could be terrible when she
"was ""worked up!"" Even if Lavender lived Aunt Achsa would never forgive"
her and if he _didn't_ live--Mr. Dugald had said he was fighting. Those
boards creaking faintly meant that Doctor Blackwell and Aunt Achsa were
helping Lavender fight. Dear old Lav with his fine dreams!
The desperate longing for Trude shook her. She sobbed into her pillow.
And yet the longing brought only added remorse. Trude would scold her.
Trude would take her home. That meant stinging humiliation. How Vick
would laugh at her when everything was over. A case of rum! Sidney
writhed under the soft covers.
Somewhere boards creaked again--Lavender's fight. Sidney pictured the
doctor and Aunt Achsa bending over him. And outside everything was so
"quiet and gray. That was the way death probably came, Sidney thought."
On the morrow they would send her home--in disgrace. She might not even
"be allowed to see Lavender, or Mart, or Pola--or Mr. Dugald. Someone"
would telegraph to Trude and Trude would meet her back at Middletown.
"She would live a long, sad life of penance behind the crumbing stone"
wall she had so detested.
But the thought of the wall and the shelter of the old house brought
such a surcease of torment that the girl had fallen into a heavy sleep.
When she wakened it was to a consciousness of bright sunshine--and
"been the crowning blow to her."""
"""I have told madame your mother everything,"" I said.  ""Do not be uneasy"
"on her account."""
"""Ah,"" she sighed, ""how I regret that we came to Paris!  I regret it all,"
"Gerald, save that you and I have met again;"" and she stretched out her"
"hand until it came into contact with my coat-button, with which she"
toyed like a child.
"""And this meeting has really given you satisfaction?""  I whispered to"
"her, heedless of the presence of the others."
"""Not only satisfaction,"" she answered, so softly that I alone could"
"catch her words, and looking into my face with that expression of"
"passionate affection which can never be simulated; ""it has given back to"
"me a desire for happiness, for life, for love."""
"There were tears in those wonderful blue eyes, and her small hand"
trembled within my grasp.  My heart at that moment was too full for mere
"words.  True, I loved her with a mad fondness that I had never before"
"entertained for any woman; yet, nevertheless, a hideous shadow arose"
"between us, shutting her off from me for ever--the shadow of her"
"secret--the secret that she, my well-beloved, was actually a spy."
CHAPTER NINE.
AT THE ELYSEE.
"Having reassured myself of Yolande's recovery, I was compelled to rush"
"off, slip into uniform, and attend a dinner at the Elysee.  The function"
"was a brilliant affair, as are all the official junketings of the French"
"After a short walk, Jack beckoned the boys to his side and suggested"
that they take a route to the camp different from that which they had
followed on leaving it.
"“You see, boys,” he explained, “that was a signal, all right, and we"
"haven’t found out the cause of it. So far as we know, it was put up to"
get us away from the camp.”
"“I’m beginning to think it was,” Frank announced. “Either to get us away"
"from the camp for the purpose of capturing us, or for the purpose of"
raiding our provisions.”
"“Well,” Jack went on, “if we duck away to the south and return to the"
"camp by a new course, anyone watching for us might watch in vain.”"
“That’s the idea!” Harry answered.
"“Then here we go the south,” Frank suggested, starting away at as swift"
a gait as was possible in the thicket.
They had proceeded but a short distance when every tree bole of good
size immediately in front of them seemed to their astonished eyes to
"yield a scowling, dirty half-breed. The boys drew their guns."
"“No use, lads!” a voice said, speaking in good English. “The men in the"
"bushes have you covered. Anyway, there’s no harm intended.”"
“Why the holdup?” demanded Jack.
The man who had spoken now advanced to Jack and looked him keenly in the
face. Although carrying the general appearance of the gang of
"half-breeds at his back, the boys could see by the fellow’s face and"
"""No, you have a problem."" She examined him confidently. ""Because if"
"those materials are not returned to us, we will be forced to take"
"actions you may find harsh."""
"""Give it your best shot,"" he went on, glancing at Eva and hoping they"
"could keep up the bravado, ""because we've got a few cards in our hand"
too. Forget the money--that's history now--but we could still be in a
"position to blow your whole project sky high."""
"""You two are the only ones outside our organization who know about the"
"protocol. That knowledge will not be allowed to go any farther."""
"""Don't be so sure. For all you know, we've already stashed a copy"
"somewhere. Left word that if anything happens to either one of us, the"
package gets sent to the papers. Made public. Think what some premature
"headlines would do for your little project."""
"""We have thought about it, Mr. Vance. That contingency has been"
"covered."""
"""Well, if I don't know what the other player's got, I tend to trust my"
"own cards."""
But why play at all? he suddenly found himself musing. Fold this hand
and go for the next move.
"Before leaving Crete he'd transmitted a copy of the protocol, still in"
"its encrypted form, to his office computer in Nassau. At the time it'd"
merely seemed like prudence; now it might turn out to be a lifeline.
One phone call and it could be transmitted back here this very
afternoon. The magic of satellites in space. Knock out another quick
"from the mill-house, the fate of which must have afforded a striking"
object-lesson to a costive magistracy in trouble about a forced loan.
"""We are undone,"" he cried; ""I am a married man, your Excellency, and"
have not a _maravedi_ to call my own. You had better shoot me out of
"hand, and be done with it. Indeed, we cannot possibly pay."""
"""Go and find your father,"" cried Cabrera; ""he pocketed half of the price"
of Don Ramon Garcia's house. I cannot see my namesake suffer. Tell him
that two thousand _duros_ is the price up till noon. After that it will
"have risen to four thousand, and by three of the afternoon, if the money"
be not paid into the treasury of the only absolute and Catholic
"sovereign (in the present instance my breeches pocket), I shall be"
reluctantly compelled to shoot one dozen of the leading citizens of the
township of Sarria. Let a strong guard accompany this young man till he
"returns from carrying his message."""
"In this way did Cabrera replenish the treasury of his master Don Carlos,"
and with such pleasant argument did he induce reluctant _alcaldes_ to
discover the whereabouts of their strong boxes.
"For a remarkably shrewd man was General Ramon Cabrera, the butcher of"
Tortosa.
CHAPTER XXIV
HOW TO BECOME A SOLDIER
"""Absolutely."""
"""It would, moreover, not be possible for anyone to enter or leave"
"without your knowledge?""  I suggested."
"""M'sieur understands me perfectly.  Mademoiselle must have fallen to the"
"floor lifeless immediately after I had let you out.  She made no sound,"
"and had Jean not entered with her letters, which the concierge had"
"brought, my poor young mistress might be lying there now."""
The average Frenchwoman of the lower class is always dramatic wherever a
"domestic calamity is concerned, and this worthy bonne was no exception."
She punctuated all her remarks with references to the sacred personages
of the Roman Catholic religion.
"""You haven't searched the room, I suppose?"""
"""No, m'sieur.  Madame gave orders that nothing was to be touched."""
This reply was eminently satisfactory.  I glanced again around the
"place, now dim in the falling twilight, and ordered her to throw back"
the sun-shutters.
"The woman went to the window and opened them, admitting a flood of"
"mellow light, the last crimson of the glorious afterglow.  Up from the"
"boulevard came the dull roar of the traffic, mingling with the sound of"
"distant bells ringing the Ave Maria.  The bonne--an Alsatian, from her"
"accent--crossed herself from force of habit, and retreated towards the"
door.
"""You may go,"" I said.  ""I will remain here until the doctor arrives."""
"kept the drive from jamming. He was hot and sweaty, and generally weary"
"as he continued his way downstream, and his wrath was naturally instant"
"when, on suddenly rounding a bend, he came upon Curly Kollock, cool,"
"calm, and unruffled, sitting comfortably on a rock, enjoying a"
cigarette.
"As the latter saw Bainbridge, he flushed slightly, and half rose from"
"the bowlder. Then, with a stubborn twist of his lips, he sank back"
"again, pulling hard on the cigarette, and doing his best to look"
unconcerned.
"Bob walked straight up to him, and stopped."
"“Well,” he said bitingly, “I’m sorry you’ve lost the use of your feet"
and hands. Is it paralysis?”
"Kollock’s flush deepened, and he mumbled something inane about taking a"
"smoke. He found that he had arisen, apparently without volition, and was"
"standing before the other man, who stared at him a long half minute."
"“This is no rest cure,” said Bob at length. “You’re paid for helping the"
"drive along. I don’t want any loafers in this gang. Understand? Now, get"
down to the head of the drive--and do something!”
"Kollock’s face was flaming, and his eyes gleamed angrily. “I don’t take"
"that line of talk from anybody!” he growled, clenching his fists"
threateningly. “I’ll----”
"“You’ll do what I said, and do it quick!” Bainbridge’s voice was not"
"raised above a conversational pitch, but there was a ring in it which"
seemed to take the fight and bluster out of the big riverman with the
effectiveness of a keen knife thrust into an inflated bladder. For a
into a better channel.[23] Such stories are so easy to recognise that
"it would be useless to make a formal list, but I shall make further"
allusion to this in dealing with stories from the lives of the saints.
"These, then, are the main elements to avoid in the selection of"
material suitable for normal children. Much might be added in the way
"of detail, and the special tendency of the day may make it necessary to"
avoid one class of story more than another; but this care belongs to
another generation of teachers and parents.

At last they had reached the high plateau. A dog barked. The wood
suddenly swarmed with bearded and grotesque forms. They did not
recognize in Francesco the monk who had spent a night in their midst.
"The goatherd had maliciously disappeared, as if to revenge himself for"
his interrupted orisons. With glowering faces they thronged around
"Francesco, a babel of voices shouting questions and threatening the"

THE ABBEY OF FARFA
Wherewith they played so prettily
"That Lucifer laughed merrily,"
And all the residue of the fiends
Did laugh thereat full well like friends.

"Now, by our honour, said Lucifer,"
No devil in hell shall withhold her;
"And if thou wouldest have twenty mo,"
"Wert not for justice, they should go."
For all we devils within this den
Have more to-do with two women
Than with all the charge we have beside;

Apply thy pardons to women so
That unto us there come no mo.
"_Johan Johan_, or, at greater length, _The Merry Play between Johan"
"Johan the Husband, Tyb his Wife, and Sir Jhon the Priest_ (printed"
"1533), contains only the three characters mentioned, but possesses a"
"theme more nearly deserving the name of plot than do the other two,"
"namely, the contriving and carrying out of a plan by Tyb for exposing"
"her boastful husband's real and absolute subjection to her rule. Yet,"
"even so, it is extremely simple. Johan Johan is first heard alone,"
declaring how he will beat his wife for not being at home. The tuggings
"of fear and valour in his heart, however, give his monologue an"
"argumentative form, in which first one motive and then the other gains"
"the upper hand, very similar to the conflict between Launcelot Gobbo's"
conscience and the Devil. He closes in favour of the beating and
then--Tyb comes home. Oh the difference! Johan Johan suspects his wife
"Mr. Dugald ran with all speed to Rockman's, the other men after him. As"
their hurrying steps echoed through the silent street heads popped out
"of windows, doors opened. Then more men, half-dressed and dressing as"
"they ran, rushed after them toward Rockman's. They knew, with that"
"intuition inbred in seacoast communities, that something was wrong. Old"
"Simon Tibbetts, too crippled to join the gathering crowds, rang up"
Commander Nelson at the Life Guard station on the backside.
"When, in the gray light of the dawn, the _Sally_ chugged up to"
"Rockman's wharf with its precious cargo Sidney and Mart found a weary,"
anxious crowd of men and women gathered there. And as Cap'n Davies and
Saunders lifted the girls ashore a lusty shout of rejoicing went
up--eager hands reached out to touch the rescued as though to make
certain they were safe and sound.
"Sidney had eyes only for Mr. Dugald who seemed to tower above them all,"
"his eyes dark lined with the strain of anxious watching, his mouth set"
"sternly. And strangely enough, at first, Dugald Allan saw only Sidney,"
"yet it was not strange, for the white-faced, shrinking, abject girl,"
"barefooted and disheveled, who was hiding behind Mart and Sidney, had"
little semblance to his gay young cousin.
Mr. Dugald opened his arms and Sidney ran into them like a little
"child, and clung to him. He felt her slender body shaking."
"""I--I can't help crying. I wanted Trude--so much!"""
"""_I_ was thinking of Trude, too. Thank God!"" But Sidney was too moved"
at the moment to wonder at his words or that the cheek he bent to hers
was wet with tears.
"alone!"""
"""Oh, yes, I can,"" she murmured. ""I always make things alone!"""
"I tried to fathom the meaning of this, but gave it up and started to go"
"on deck. If I could take her father off to one side and explain, well"
and good. He would perhaps sympathize with my mistake when he understood
that it was partially the result of a desire to fill Monsieur with
"spirits. Considering this, I spoiled everything by asking:"
"""What does he look like?"""
"""My father?"" she gasped, in a wondering way."
"""No--yes--certainly not! I mean--oh, this is intolerable! I don't know"
"your father, never saw him in my life--unless he was the one with you"
last night when you drove me frantic with that ball of paper trick! But
what you did has nothing to do with my being here. I've not wilfully
followed. A stupid boatman mistook your yacht for my own when I was--I
"mean to say, when I was too engrossed with the memory of you to notice"
"his mistake."""
"From alarm her look gave way to wonderment, then almost to mirth. It was"
"a hard place for a girl to be in, and I expected her to leave me now,"
find the old chap and promptly have me hanged to a yard-arm. The fact
that there are no yard-arms on schooner yachts made no difference. And I
"do believe she was considering that when a sailor passed us, looking"
enough like Tommy to have been his twin brother.
"""Jack,"" she said to him, ""tell Mr. Graham to come below!"""
"The fellow saluted and left, and I stared at her in surprise, saying:"
"Custom-dues, for passage of soul to other world, 285"
"Customs-officers, celestial, 284"
"Cybele, rites of, 586"

PART I.
"In front of you is the main street, with two rows of miserable looking"
huts with shuttered windows and old walls pressing on each other and
leaning forward.  The roofs of these time-worn habitations are full of
"holes, and have been patched here and there with laths; from underneath"
"them project mildewed beams, which are shaded by the dusty-leaved"
elder-trees and crooked white willows--pitiable flora of those suburbs
inhabited by the poor.
"world. He and I were raised here in New York, just like two brothers,"
together. I was eighteen and Jimmy was twenty. The next morning I was
to start for the West to make my fortune. You couldn’t have dragged
"Jimmy out of New York; he thought it was the only place on earth. Well,"
we agreed that night that we would meet here again exactly twenty years
"from that date and time, no matter what our conditions might be or from"
what distance we might have to come. We figured that in twenty years
"each of us ought to have our destiny worked out and our fortunes made,"
whatever they were going to be.”
"“It sounds pretty interesting,” said the policeman. “Rather a long time"
"between meets, though, it seems to me. Haven’t you heard from your"
friend since you left?”
"“Well, yes, for a time we corresponded,” said the other. “But after a"
"year or two we lost track of each other. You see, the West is a pretty"
"big proposition, and I kept hustling around over it pretty lively. But"
"I know Jimmy will meet me here if he’s alive, for he always was the"
"truest, stanchest old chap in the world. He’ll never forget. I came a"
"thousand miles to stand in this door to-night, and it’s worth it if my"
old partner turns up.”
"The waiting man pulled out a handsome watch, the lids of it set with"
small diamonds.
"“Three minutes to ten,” he announced. “It was exactly ten o’clock when"
we parted here at the restaurant door.”
"“Did pretty well out West, didn’t you?” asked the policeman."
"“You bet! I hope Jimmy has done half as well. He was a kind of plodder,"
"though, good fellow as he was. I’ve had to compete with some of the"
removed from the trunk of your family tree. He had only the faintest
tinge of blue blood in his veins. He was an absolute outsider. We'll
"hear no more about _him_ now."""
"""You mean that it's an absolutely sure thing for her,"" Captain Dove"
"suggested, and Mr. Jobling looked pained."
"""I can't afford to risk anything on uncertainties, sir,"" he answered"
"stiffly. ""And I'll stake my professional reputation on--"""
"""Oh, never mind about all that,"" Slyne broke in, folding his share of"
"the papers together and pocketing them. ""The syndicate's safely floated."
And now--as to our next move.
"""You'd better get away back to Genoa by the five o'clock train, Dove."
And you must take Ambrizette with you; I'll get Sal--Lady Josceline
another maid in Paris--one who won't attract quite so much attention to
us as that damned dwarf would.
"""Jobling and I will go on there by the night-mail, on our way to London"
with--Lady Josceline. You can take the _Olive Branch_ round to some safe
"English port and lay her up there in the meantime. As soon as you land,"
you can rejoin us--at Jobling's address. By that time we'll probably be
"ready to redeem our note to you."""
"""By that time,"" Captain Dove returned with concentrated bitterness,"
"""you'll have found some way to give me the slip altogether. D'ye take me"
"for a blind idiot, Slyne? D'ye think I'm going to let Sallie out of my"
"sight, with you?"""
"Slyne was visibly disconcerted. ""But--aren't you going to take your ship"
"round to England?"" he asked, in genuine surprise. ""You can't very well"
'Where is Marie?' I cried.
She did not answer. No one answered; and I knew. Steve swore again. I
think he had known from the beginning. I began to tremble. On a sudden
my lady lifted up her voice and cried shrilly--
'Marie! Marie!'
Again no answer. But this time I did not wait to listen. I ran from
"them into the darkness the way we had come, my legs quivering under"
"me, and my mouth full of broken prayers. I remembered a certain"
"solitary tree fronting the poplars, on the other side of the way,"
"which I had marked mechanically at the moment of the fall--an ash,"
whose light upper boughs had come for an instant between my eyes and
"the sky. It stood on a little mound, where the moorland began to rise"
"on that side. I came to it now, and stopped and looked. At first I"
"could see nothing, and I trod forward fearfully. Then, a couple of"
"paces on, I made out a dark figure, lying head and feet across the"
"road. I sprang to it, and kneeling, passed my hands over it. Alas! it"
was a woman's.
"I raised the light form in my arms, crying passionately on her name,"
"while the wind swayed the boughs overhead, and, besides that and my"
"voice, all the countryside was still. She did not answer. She hung"
"limp in my arms. Kneeling in the dust beside her, I felt blindly for a"
"pulse, a heart-beat. I found neither--neither; the woman was dead."
And yet it was not that which made me lay the body down so quickly and
stand up peering round me. No; something else. The blood drummed in my
"ears, my heart beat wildly. The woman was dead; but she was not Marie."
"She was an old woman, sixty years old. When I stooped again, after"
"and saw, a hundred yards or so away, a bent and dreary figure trudging"
down the metal paving of the street. It was a figure like those to be
"seen on Earth, which placed it as belonging to Greca's race."
"The tall leader drew forth one of the shock-tubes. Seen near at hand,"
it was observed to be bafflingly simple in appearance. It seemed
devoid of all mechanism--simply a tube of reddish metal with a sort of
handle formed of a coil of heavy wire.
The Rogan pointed the tube at the distant figure.
"Greca screamed, and screamed again. Coincident with her cry, as though"
"the sound of it had felled him, the distant slave dropped to the"
pavement.
*       *       *       *       *
That was all. The tube had merely been pointed: as far as Brand could
"see, the Rogan's ""hand"" had not moved on the barrel of the tube, nor"
even constricted about the coil of wire that formed its handle. Yet
"that distant figure had dropped. Furthermore, fumes of greasy black"
smoke now began to arise from the huddled body; and in less than
thirty seconds there was left no trace of it on the gleaming metal
pavement.
"""So that's what those things are like at full power!"" breathed Dex."
"""My God!"""
"The Rogan leader spoke a few words. Greca, huddled despairingly on the"
"floor, crushed by this brutal annihilation of one of her country-men"
"before her very eyes, did not translate. But translation was"
"unnecessary. The Rogan's icy, triumphant eyes, the very posture of"
"distance glimmered the sea, and by a rock upon the hillside, armed"
"men, a knot of spears, shone like spirit sentinels athwart the west."
"Mists were creeping up the valleys, as the sun went down into the sea."
A few sparse stars gleamed out like souls still tortured by the
mysteries of life. An inevitable pessimism seemed to challenge the
"universe, taking for its parable the weird afterglow of the west."
Deep in the woods a voice sang wild and solitary in the gathering
"gloom. Like the cry of a ghost, it seemed to set the silence"
"quivering, the leaves quaking with windless awe. The men who looked"
"towards the sea heard it, a song that echoed in the heart like woe."
The duke pointed into the darkening wood.
"""Trust your own heart: self is the man! Through a mistaken sense of"
duty have you been brought nigh unto death and despair! Trust not in
"sophistry: the laws of men are carven upon stone, the laws of Heaven"
"upon the heart! Be strong! From henceforth, scorn mere words! Trample"
"tradition in the dust! Trust yourself, and the God in your heart!"""
The distant voice had sunk into silence. Francesco listened for it
with hands aloft.
"""I must go,"" he said."
"""Go!""--"
"""I must be near her through the night!"""
"""The moon stands full upon the hills! I will await you here!"""
"Dim were the woods that autumn evening, dim and deep with an ecstasy"
"""Since nakedness has always existed ..."""
"""Yes, and it created Rome,"" said the teacher."
"""Yes, of course,"" says the Captain, beaming with joy. ""Romulus and"
"Remus, eh?  We also shall create when our time comes ..."""
"""Violation of public peace,"" interrupts Abyedok.  He laughs in a"
"self-satisfied way.  His laughter is impudent and insolent, and is"
"echoed by Simtsoff, the Deacon and Paltara Taras.  The naive eyes of"
"young Meteor light up, and his cheeks flush crimson."
"Kanets speaks, and it seems as if he were hammering their heads."
"""All these are foolish illusions ... fiddle-sticks!"""
"It was strange to see them reasoning in this manner, these outcasts"
"from life, tattered, drunken with vodki and wickedness, filthy and"
forlorn.  Such conversations rejoiced the Captain's heart.  They gave
"him an opportunity of speaking more, and therefore he thought himself"
"better than the rest.  However low he may fall, a man can never deny"
"himself the delight of feeling cleverer, more powerful, or even better"
"fed than his companions. Aristid Kuvalda abused this pleasure, and"
"never could have enough of it, much to the disgust of Abyedok, Kubar,"
"and others of these creatures that once were men, who were less"
interested in such things.
"Politics, however, were more to the popular taste.  The discussions as"
to the necessity of taking India or of subduing England were lengthy
and protracted.  Nor did they speak with less enthusiasm of the radical
measure of clearing Jews off the face of the earth.  On this subject
official? But the very German nurses and doctors at the Red Cross
hospital had spoken of her having given free treatment in her Home
"to Germans who needed immediate operations, and for whom there was"
no room in the military hospitals--And for such a trivial offence as
_that_--and to kill her before there could be any appeal for
reconsideration or clemency. Oh _what_ a nation! She would tend
their sick and wounded no more.
She hurried on up the ascent of the Boulevard of the Botanic Garden
on her way to the Rue Royale. She burst into von Giesselin's office.
He was not there. A clerk looking at her rather closely said that
"the Herr Oberst was packing, was going away. Vivie scarcely took in"
"the meaning of his German phrases. She waited there, her eyes"
"ablaze, feeling she must tell her former friend and protector what"
she thought of his people before she renounced any further
relations with him.
"Presently he entered, his usually rather florid face pale with"
"intense sorrow or worry, his manner preoccupied. She burst out:"
"""_Have_ you seen the Red Placard they have just put up?"""
"""What about?"" he said wearily."
"""The assassination by your Government of Edith Cavell, a crime for"
"which England--yes, and America--will _never_ forgive you.... From"
"this moment I--"""
"""But have you not heard what has happened to _me_? I am _dismissed_"
"from my post as Secretary, I am ordered to rejoin my regiment in"
Lorraine--It is very sad about your Miss Cavell. I knew nothing of
it till this morning when I received my own dismissal--And _oh_ my
"dear Miss, I fear we shall never meet again."""
"had, as he saw it. And yet once or twice he saw the pure gold of this"
girl shine through the mist that his egotism had raised between him and
all objects.
"“This way of living that you speak of,” she said, “sounds so futile and"
purposeless. Haven’t you any work to do in the world that might
interest you more?”
"“My dear Miss Marian,” he exclaimed—“work! Think of dressing every day"
"for dinner, of making half a dozen calls in an afternoon—with a"
policeman at every corner ready to jump into your auto and take you to
"the station, if you get up any greater speed than a donkey cart’s gait."
We do-nothings are the hardest workers in the land.”
"The dinner was concluded, the waiter generously fed, and the two walked"
out to the corner where they had met. Miss Marian walked very well now;
her limp was scarcely noticeable.
"“Thank you for a nice time,” she said, frankly. “I must run home now. I"
"liked the dinner very much, Mr. Chandler.”"
"He shook hands with her, smiling cordially, and said something about a"
"game of bridge at his club. He watched her for a moment, walking rather"
"rapidly eastward, and then he found a cab to drive him slowly homeward."
In his chilly bedroom Chandler laid away his evening clothes for a
sixty-nine days’ rest. He went about it thoughtfully.
"“That was a stunning girl,” he said to himself. “She’s all right, too,"
"I’d be sworn, even if she does have to work. Perhaps if I’d told her"
"the truth instead of all that razzle-dazzle we might—but, confound it!"
I had to play up to my clothes.”
But when in her mirror she saw him standing behind her--he had crept into
the bedroom like a cat--fierceness came into her.  She could see the
"blood rush up in her own white face, and, turning round she said:"
"""No, Gustav, go out to the music-room if you want a companion."""
"He recoiled against the foot of the bed and stared at her haggardly, and"
"Gyp, turning back to her mirror, went on quietly taking the pins out of"
"her hair.  For fully a minute she could see him leaning there, moving his"
"head and hands as though in pain. Then, to her surprise, he went.  And a"
vague feeling of compunction mingled with her sense of deliverance.  She
"lay awake a long time, watching the fire-glow brighten and darken on the"
"ceiling, tunes from ""The Tales of Hoffmann"" running in her head; thoughts"
"and fancies crisscrossing in her excited brain.  Falling asleep at last,"
"she dreamed she was feeding doves out of her hand, and one of them was"
"Daphne Wing.  She woke with a start.  The fire still burned, and by its"
"light she saw him crouching at the foot of the bed, just as he had on"
"their wedding-night--the same hungry yearning in his face, and an arm"
"outstretched.  Before she could speak, he began:"
"""Oh, Gyp, you don't understand!  All that is nothing--it is only you I"
want--always.  I am a fool who cannot control himself. Think!  It's a
"long time since you went away from me."""
"Gyp said, in a hard voice:"
"""I didn't want to have a child."""
He said quickly:
"""No; but now you have it you are glad.  Don't be unmerciful, my Gyp!  It"
is like you to be merciful.  That girl--it is all over--I swear--I
"son found examples the most worthy of imitation, and began to profit"
by them. This anecdote has become incorporated by the Chinese into a
"proverb, which they constantly quote: The Mother of Mentius seeks a"
neighbourhood.”
Another influence we have to counteract is that of newspaper headings
which catch the eye of children in the streets and appeal so powerfully
to their imagination.
Shakespeare has said:
"Tell me where is Fancy bred,"
"Or in the heart, or in the head?"
"How begot, how nourished?"
"Reply, reply."
It is engendered in the eyes
With gazing fed: and Fancy dies
In the cradle where it lies.
Let us all ring Fancy's knell.
"I'll begin it--ding, dong, bell."
“_Merchant of Venice._”
"If this be true, it is of importance to decide what our children shall"
"look upon as far as we can control the vision, so that we can form some"
idea of the effect upon their imagination.
"Having alluded to the dangerous influence of the street, I should"
hasten to say that this influence is very far from being altogether
bad. There are possibilities of romance in street life which may have
just the same kind of effect on children as the telling of exciting
stories. I am indebted to Mrs. Arnold Glover (Hon. Sec. of the National
"Organisation of Girls' Clubs), one of the most widely informed people"
"""Won't you sit down?"" he suggested with debonair courtesy."
But she shook her head; she was evidently afraid to receive him on any
such friendly footing. She did not even care to ask him what he was
doing in evening dress at breakfast-time and on board the _Olive
Branch_. But in her troubled eyes he could read that unspoken inquiry.
"""I've been travelling all night to get back to you, Sallie,"" he told"
"her, in a low, eager tone, ""and I hadn't time to change--I was in such a"
hurry to tell you the news. I've come to take you away from the _Olive
"Branch_,--and Captain Dove. I've come to set you free."""
"She stared at him as though she had not heard aright, her lips parted,"
"her eyebrows arched, a faint, puzzled, questioning frown on her"
forehead.
"""I've come to set you free,"" he said again."
"""At what price?"" she asked suddenly, with disconcerting directness, and"
his would-be straightforward glance wavered.
"""Don't put it that way!"" he urged. ""I ask no more than the fulfilment of"
"the promise you made me. And--listen, Sallie. I've found out who you"
really are and where your home is. I'll take you there if only you--
"""I'm not asking you to marry me right away, either, remember. All you"
must do in the meantime is to sign without question some papers that
will be required. Then I'll make everything quite safe for you and take
"you to your own home."""
The quick doubt in her eyes had given place to an expression of helpless
amazement and growing dismay. But he did not wait to hear anything she
house and garden. Surely you could be happy in—in—appreciating it for a
change. Or you could take up some hobby.”
"And Lola the baby had chimed in loftily, “All men ought to have"
hobbies. It makes life impossible if they haven’t.”
"Well, well! He couldn’t help a grim smile as painfully he began to"
climb the hill that led into Harcourt Avenue. Where would Lola and her
"sisters and Charlotte be if he’d gone in for hobbies, he’d like to"
"know? Hobbies couldn’t pay for the town house and the seaside bungalow,"
"and their horses, and their golf, and the sixty-guinea gramophone in"
the music-room for them to dance to. Not that he grudged them these
"things. No, they were smart, good-looking girls, and Charlotte was a"
remarkable woman; it was natural for them to be in the swim. As a
"matter of fact, no other house in the town was as popular as theirs; no"
"other family entertained so much. And how many times old Mr. Neave,"
"pushing the cigar box across the smoking-room table, had listened to"
"praises of his wife, his girls, of himself even."
"“You’re an ideal family, sir, an ideal family. It’s like something one"
reads about or sees on the stage.”
"“That’s all right, my boy,” old Mr. Neave would reply. “Try one of"
those; I think you’ll like them. And if you care to smoke in the
"garden, you’ll find the girls on the lawn, I dare say.”"
"That was why the girls had never married, so people said. They could"
have married anybody. But they had too good a time at home. They were
"too happy together, the girls and Charlotte. H’m, h’m! Well, well."
Perhaps so....
By this time he had walked the length of fashionable Harcourt Avenue;
"Risca than Risca saw into him. He did not answer the question, for he"
"penetrated, through the fuliginous vapours whence it proceeded, into the"
"crystal regions of the man's spirit. It was he, after a while, who held"
"Risca with his eyes, and it was all that was beautiful and spiritual"
in Risca that was held. And then Herold reached out his hand slowly and
touched him.
“We go down to Southcliff together.”
Risca drew a deep breath.
"“Let us go this evening,” said he."
A few hours afterward when the open cab taking them from the station
to the Channel House came by the sharp turn of the road abruptly to the
"foot of the cliff, and the gusty southwest wind brought the haunting"
"smell of the seaweed into his nostrils, and he saw the beacon-light in"
"the high west window shining like a star, a gossamer feather from the"
wings of Peace fell upon the man's tortured soul.
CHAPTER III
IT will be remembered that Stellamaris was a young person of bountiful
fortune. She had stocks and shares and mortgages and landed property
faithfully administered under a deed of trust. The Channel House and
"all that therein was, except Sir Oliver and Lady Blount's grievances,"
belonged to her. She knew it; she had known it almost since infancy.
The sense of ownership in which she had grown up had its effect on her
"character, giving her the equipoise of a young reigning princess, calm"
"something a little suspicious about one of his eyes, and a squat,"
queerly-shaped old fellow in semi-clerical garb and wearing smoked
"glasses, completed the party. Their waiters began to hover about them,"
and the fashionable world went on with its dinner.
"""Who was that _lovely_ girl?"" the Duchess of Dawn demanded of her"
"_vis-à-vis_, the veteran soldier, and he, reputed among women to have no"
"heart at all, recalled himself with an evident start from the reverie"
"into which he had fallen. He almost blushed, indeed, under the duchess's"
blandly discerning smile.
"""I don't know, I'm sure, duchess,"" he returned, smiling also, in spite"
"of himself, and beckoned to a servant behind him, whom he despatched on"
some errand.
"""She's registered as Miss Harris, your lordship,"" the man announced in"
an undertone when he returned.
"""Miss Harris!"" echoed the prince, who was also a soldier. He had"
"overheard. And, as he in turn caught the duchess's eyes, he lay back"
"laughing, a little ruefully. But the man opposite him, the master of"
"armies, was not amused."
"""I'd like to know who and what those three fellows with Miss Harris may"
"be,"" said he."
*       *       *       *       *
"At their table in the corner, they seemed to be thoroughly enjoying"
themselves. The three men were toasting Sallie and each other with equal
good-will. And even Sallie had dismissed from her mind the last of her
lingering doubts as to the reality and endurance of her part in that
get the Marines to teach you--he asked no questions. With one word he
"called the guard to attention, and himself saluted me--me a private! I"
handed him my rifle--there was an inch of blood at the point of the
"bayonet--and hobbled off to the nearest ladder. My word, I could"
"scarcely walk, and as for climbing a ship's ladder--I could never have"
done if some one hadn't given me a boost behind and some one else a
hand at the top. The Commander and the Major of Marines were both in
"the wardroom; I walked in, saluted them as a self-respecting private"
"should do, and told them the whole story."""
"""It was Petty Officer Trehayne,"" said I calmly--and waited for a"
sensation.
"""Of course,"" replied Dawson, greatly to my annoyance. He might have"
"shown some astonishment at my wonderful intuition; but he didn't, not"
"a scrap. Even Cary was at first disappointing, though he warmed up"
"later, and did me full justice. ""Trehayne a spy!"" cried Cary. ""He"
"looked a smart good man."""
"""I am not saying that he wasn't,"" snapped Dawson, whose nerves were"
"very badly on edge. ""He was obeying the orders of his superiors as we"
"all have to do. He gave his life, and it was for his country's"
service. Nobody can do more than that. Don't you go for to slander
"Trehayne. I watched him die--on his feet."""
"Cary turned to me. ""What made you think it was Trehayne?"" he asked."
"This was better. I looked at Dawson, who was brooding in his chair"
with his thoughts far away. He was still seeing those eyes fading out
under the glare of the electrics between the steel decks of the
_Malplaquet_!
"""It was a sheer guess at first,"" said I, preserving a decent show of"
"""Oh--h, take me back to the cabin!"" moaned Pola."
"""I guess we might as well,"" muttered Mart. Their matches had been long"
since exhausted; they had been of little avail for the one ship's light
on the boat was without oil.
"One on each side of her, Mart and Sidney helped Pola down into the"
"cabin. The boat was rolling heavily now in the rough sea, each lift and"
drop sending terror to the three young hearts. In the blackness of the
night the waves looked mountain high. Even Mart was glad to shut them
from view.
"""If--if we're going to drown I'd rather drown in--a--room,"" gasped"
"Pola, clinging to Sidney and burying her face in Sidney's shoulder."
It seemed to the girls as though months had passed since Lav had
plunged to what they felt certain was his death. The _Arabella_ had
"tossed about on the roughening water like some wild thing, her old"
timbers creaking and groaning under their new living. Just at first
Sidney and Mart had been too concerned in quieting the panic-stricken
Pola to face their danger; not until Pola had exhausted herself did
they think of their possible fate.
"Unless Lav succeeded in reaching the beach and giving an alarm, they"
"might toss about for days or be dashed to pieces on some reef. Or,"
"worse fate, Jed Starrow and his gang might find the boat and--"
"""Wh-at are you thinking about, Mart?"" whispered Sidney after a long"
"time of silence, broken only by the howling of the wind and the"
"pounding of the water. ""Let's talk--and then we can't hear--"""
“Don’t go. Send her an excuse--and take me for a drive. It would do me
"good, and I should so love to be alone with you.”"
It was the very first time in her life that Yvonne had consciously
cajoled a man. Her face flushed hot with misgivings. It was with a
mixture of her sex’s shame and triumph that she heard him say.
"“Whatever you like, dear. It is still your holiday.”"
CHAPTER XIII--Dis Aliter Visum
But the best laid schemes of Yvonnes and men often come to nothing.
"While she was devising, on her drive along the coast, a plan for"
"spending a quiet dangerless evening at the hotel, Mrs. Winstanley was"
"sitting in solitary dignity at the concert, nursing her wrath over"
"Professor Drummond’s “Natural Law in the Spiritual world,” a book which"
she often perused when she wished to accentuate the rigorous attitude of
her mind.
Yvonne had reckoned without Mrs. Winstanley. Otherwise she would have
"offered her a seat in the carriage. As it was, Mrs. Winstanley felt"
more resentful than ever. Under the impression that the Canon was to
"accompany her to the Kursaal, she had graciously dispensed with the"
"escort of the Wilmingtons, who had gone off to see bicycle races at the"
Vélodrome. She was left in the lurch.
To dislike this is human. To wrap oneself up in one’s sore dignity is
"more human still, and there was much humanity that lurked, unsuspected"
"by herself, in Mrs. Winstanley’s bosom. It asserted itself, further,"
said:
"""You deserve to win, Boyd; you have made a good fight."""
"""Oh, I'll win!"" he declared, wearily. ""I've got to win; only I wish we"
"were past Port Townsend."""
"""What will happen to Fraser?"" she queried."
"""Nothing serious, I am sure. You see, they wanted me, and nobody else;"
once they find they have the wrong man I rather believe they will free
"him in disgust."""
"A moment later he went on: ""Just the same, it makes me feel depressed"
and guilty to leave him--I--I wouldn't desert a comrade for anything if
"the choice lay with me."""
"""You did quite right,"" Cherry warmly assured him."
"""You see, I am not working for myself; I am doing this for another."""
"It was the girl's turn to sigh softly, while the eyes she turned toward"
the west were strangely sad and dreamy. To her companion she seemed not
at all like the buoyant creature who had kindled his courage when it
"was so low, the brave girl who had stood so steadfastly at his shoulder"
"and kept his hopes alive during these last, trying weeks. It struck him"
suddenly that she had grown very quiet of late. It was the first time
"he had had the leisure to notice it, but now, when he came to reflect"
"on it, he remembered that she had never seemed quite the same since his"
interview with her on that day when Hilliard had so unexpectedly come
to his rescue. He wondered if in reality this change might not be due
to some reflected alteration in himself. Well! He could not help it.
THE UNCLEAN THING.
"A few days later, Mr. Dick Derosne was walking in the Park at noon. He"
had been down to the Club and found no one there. Everybody except
"himself was at work: the politicians were scattered all over the colony,"
conducting their election campaign. Medland himself had gone to his
"constituency: his seat was very unsafe there, and he was determined to"
"keep it if he could, although, as a precaution, he was also a candidate"
"for the North-east ward of Kirton, where his success was beyond doubt."
"His friends and his foes had followed him out of town, and the few who"
were left were busy in the capital itself. Such men as these when at the
"Club would talk of nothing but the crisis, and, after he had heard all"
"there was to hear about the Benyon affair, the crisis began to bore"
"Dick. After all, it mattered very little to him; he would be out of it"
"all in a month, and the Medlands were not, when he came to think of it,"
"people of great importance. Why, the Grangers had never heard of them!"
"Decidedly, he had had enough and to spare of the Medlands."
"Nevertheless, he was to have a little more of them, for at this instant"
"he saw Daisy Medland approaching him. Escape was impossible, and Dick"
had the grace to shrink from appearing to avoid her.
"""The deuce!"" he thought, ""this is awkward. I hope she won't--"" He raised"
his hat with elaborate politeness.
Daisy stopped and greeted him with much effusion and without any
embarrassment. Dick thought that odd.
"""I was afraid,"" she said, ""we were not going to see you again before you"
"disappeared finally with the Governor."""
Then the other said to me:
"""This is a thing I have never told anyone yet, but I will tell it to you"
now. There are times when I almost wish I could see German troops
marching victoriously through the streets of London. It is not my reason
"that is speaking now, but my bitterness, which has become stronger than"
"my reason."""
I understood him far too well to make any comment.
"And then after a long silence, I said: ""I wonder if anybody else thinks"
"like that."""
"And he answered: ""Yes, there are many--more than you would believe."""
"But the first added: ""We must remain neutral--that is our one and only"
"duty. The more malevolent our neutrality the better, but it must be"
neutrality. Remember that there are Germans whose bitterness prompts
them to wish that British troops were marching through the streets of
"Berlin. I think their wish is juster than yours, but both wishes cannot"
"be fulfilled, and it is therefore desirable that the next best thing"
"should happen, namely, that both the Allies and their enemies should be"
"entirely deprived of victory."""
"I agreed, but added:"
"""Yes, fundamentally one must remain neutral, but in relation to present"
circumstances one cannot remain neutral. It is our business to arraign
"England, our own country, and not Germany. It is for every nation to"
discover its own faults. There are many Germans of courage and honesty
who will condemn their country for the crimes she has committed. But
"misery, the Girl's face turned pale."
"""What do you mean?"" she asked."
"Johnson coloured, hesitated, and finally with a swift glance at the"
"clock, he briefly explained:"
"""I mean it's hard to go and leave you here. The clock reminded me that"
long before this I should have been on my way. I shouldn't have come up
"here at all. God bless you, dear,"" and here their eyes came together and"
"seemed unable to part,--""I love you as I never thought I could . . ."""
But at Johnson's queer look she hastened to inquire:
"""But it ain't for long you're goin'?"""
For long! Then she had not understood that he meant to go for all time.
How tell her the truth? While he pondered over the situation there came
"to him with great suddenness the thought that, perhaps, after all, Life"
never intended that she should be given to him only to be taken away
almost as suddenly; and seized with a desire to hold on to her at any
"cost, he sprang forward as if to take her in his arms, but before he"
"reached her, he stopped short."
"""Such happiness is not for me,"" he muttered under his breath; and then"
"aloud he added: ""No, no, I've got to go now while I have the courage, I"
"mean."" He broke off as suddenly as he had begun, and taking her face in"
his hands he kissed her good-bye.
"Now, accustomed as was the Girl to the strange comings and goings of the"
"men at the camp, it did not occur to her to question him further when he"
"told her that he should have been away before now. Moreover, she trusted"
prove that; but I doubt if they could ever analyze that atomic motor
"with no hint as to how it works."""
"Silence descended on them again, in which each was lost in his own"
thoughts.
"How many hours had passed, the Earthmen did not know. They had spent"
the time in fruitless planning to escape from their tower room and go
back to the ship again. Though how they could get away in the ship
when the Rogans seemed able to propel it where-ever they wished
"against the utmost power of their motor, they did not attempt to"
consider.
"One of Jupiter's short nights had passed, however--a night weirdly"
"made as light as day by red glares from the plates, which seemed to"
"store up sunlight, among their other functions--and the tiny sun had"
risen to slant into their window at a sharp angle.
Suddenly they heard the familiar drawing of the great bolts outside
"their door. It was opened, and a dozen or more of the Rogans came in,"
with Greca cowering piteously in their midst and attempting to
communicate her distress to Brand.
*       *       *       *       *
At the head of the little band of Rogans was one the prisoners had not
"seen before. He was of great height, fully two feet taller than the"
others; and he carried himself with an air that proclaimed his
importance.
"The tall one turned to Greca and addressed a few high-pitched, squeaky"
"words to her. She shook her head; whereupon, at a hissed command, two"
"was striving after speech. Slyne, outwardly cool and contemptuous of his"
"visible fury, stood gazing down at him, hands in pockets. Mr. Jobling"
"was wriggling restlessly in his chair, glancing from one to the other,"
prepared to flee from the coming storm.
"Still without a word, Captain Dove reached again for the"
"brandy-decanter, directly defying Slyne. Slyne stepped forward and"
snatched it out of his hand.
"Simultaneously, the old man and Mr. Jobling sprang from their seats, the"
"former making for Slyne and the latter for the door, which opened just"
"as he reached it, so that he all but fell over a boy in buttons who had"
knocked and entered carrying a telegram on a tray.
"Slyne had not moved. Captain Dove, almost at his throat, spun round on"
one heel.
"""For me?"" Mr. Jobling exclaimed anxiously as he ripped the envelope"
open. And a slow pallor overspread his puffy pink features while he was
perusing its contents.
"""From Mullins, my managing clerk,"" he mumbled as he passed the message"
"to Slyne, who looked it over indifferently, and then re-read it aloud in"
"a low but very ominous voice: ""'_American claimant landed at Genoa"
yesterday. Now on way to London. Court granted decree in his favour._'
"Handed in at Chancery Lane, in London,""--he pulled out his watch--""fifty"
"minutes ago."""
The page-boy had disappeared. Slyne pushed suddenly past Mr. Jobling and
set his back against the door. Captain Dove was approaching the
"terrified solicitor softly, on tiptoe, his fists clenched, all his"
tobacco-stained fangs displayed in a grin of fury. One of his long arms
"""I win,"" he announced, briefly, his eyes alone betraying the inward"
"fever. He dropped the cards before her on the table. ""Three kings,--and"
"the _last hand_!"""
"Suddenly, as though some inward cord had snapped under the strain, the"
"Girl collapsed. Limply she slid downward in her chair, one groping hand"
"straying aimlessly to her forehead, then dropping of its own weight."
"""Quick, Jack,--I'm ill,--git me somethin'!"" The voice trailed off to"
nothingness as the drooping eyelids closed.
"In real consternation, the Sheriff sprang to his feet. In one sweeping"
"glance his alert eye caught the whisky bottle upon the mantel. ""All"
"right, Girl, I'll fix you in no time,"" he said cheeringly over his"
shoulder. But where the deuce did she keep her tumblers? The next minute
he was groping for them in the dark of the adjoining closet and softly
cursing himself for his own slowness.
"Instantaneously, the Girl came to life. The unturned cards upon the"
table vanished with one lightning movement; the Girl's hand disappeared
"beneath her skirts, raised for the moment knee-high; then the same,"
"swift reverse motion, and the cards were back in place, while the Girl's"
"eyes trembled shut again, to hide the light of triumph in them. A smile"
flickered on her lips as the Sheriff returned with the glass and bottle.
"""Never mind,--I'm better now,"" her lips shaped weakly."
"The Sheriff set down the bottle, and put his arm around the Girl with a"
rough tenderness.
"""Oh, you only fainted because you lost,"" he told her."
"Averting her gaze, the Girl quietly disengaged herself, rose to her feet"

"notice of the volume,[46] usually a little above the center, set in"
"caps and small caps, or in small caps alone. At the foot of this same"
page the printer usually places his imprint.[47]
DEDICATION
"The dedication is a page set in the monumental style, generally in"
"small capitals. This must always be a right-hand page, and the reverse"
must always be blank.
PREFACE
Ordinarily the preface is set in the same size of type as the body. If
"it is written by some one other than the author, it is frequently set"
in italic to mark the distinction. This is particularly true in case
the book contains an introduction as well. If the preface is of unusual
"importance, it is sometimes customary to have it set in type one size"
"larger than the body, or double-leaded."
TABLE OF CONTENTS
After the preface and before the list of illustrations comes the
"contents, occupying whatever number of pages may be necessary. The"
style of its composition is dependent entirely upon the subject-matter
and the typographical arrangement of the volume.
"light parts, and to carry the rollers evenly over a form in printing."
(_c_).--Type-high pieces of metal placed around pages or forms to
"be electrotyped, to prevent injury to the face of the type or the"
"plates in the subsequent processes, and cut away from the plates"
before printing.
=Bed= (_p_).--The flat part of a press upon which the type or form is
"placed. The part on which the sheet is placed is called the platen, or"
the cylinder.
=Benday Plates= (_e_).--Plates made by laying shaded tints on copper or
"zinc, and etching them to produce colors or combination of colors when"
printed.
=Beveled Sticks= (_c_).--Strips of furniture wider at one end than the
other; they are used with wooden quoins in locking up on galleys and in
chases.
"=Bible India Paper= (_g_).--The thinnest paper made for books, formerly"
only made in England and Italy; now made in America. A very high-grade
stock. See _Oxford Bible Paper_.
"=Binder= (_b_).--A temporary cover for periodicals and pamphlets,"
usually arranged so that it may be taken off and attached to subsequent
copies of a publication. A bookbinder.
=Black Letters= (_c_).--A style of letter or type characterized by
black face and angular outlines. It was designed by the early printers
from a current form of manuscript letter.
=Blank= (_g_).--A page upon which no printing appears.
must pay me one of her garters as her admission fee to this inn. If she
"be madam, she enters free. It is a privilege conferred on the Maid's"
"Garter by good St. Augustine when he was Bishop of Canterbury, so long"
"ago that the memory of man runneth not to the contrary."""
"""What nonsense is this?"" asked Frances, turning to me, and Bettina asked"
"the same question with her eyes. I explained the matter, and Frances,"
"turning to the porter, said:--"
"""I'll buy you off with a jacobus or a guinea."""
"""Not a hundred guineas would buy me off, my lady,"" answered the porter,"
"bowing, ""though I might say that a shilling usually goes with the"
"garter."""
"""Well, I'll send you both the shilling and the garter from my room,"" said"
"Frances, moving toward the inn door."
"""The garter must be paid here, my lady. The shilling may be paid at any"
"time,"" returned the porter, with polite insistence."
"Frances was about to protest, but Betty, more in sympathy with the"
"eccentric customs of inns, modestly lifted her skirts, untied her garter"
"and offered it to the porter, telling him very seriously:--"
"""I am a maid."""
"The porter thanked her gravely, whereupon Frances, turning her back on"
"the audience in the doorway, brought forth her garter, gave it to the"
"porter, and we were admitted."
"Our supper, beds, and breakfast were all so good that they reconciled"
"we are beginning to quarrel, Everard? It is slightly vulgar. I am your"
"oldest friend, remember, and I am trying to acquit myself of a painful"
duty to you.”
"“Duty is one of the chief instruments of the devil, if you will excuse"
"my saying so,” replied the Canon."
"“Oh, very well then, Everard,” she said hotly. “You can go on being"
a fool as long as you like. I saw your wife struggling in this man’s
"embrace, more or less, this morning. Two or three strange coincidences"
have been forced upon my notice. For your sake I have been excessively
"anxious. My conscience tells me I ought to take you into my confidence,"
and I can do no more. You can see the Christian name of this Bazouge
"in the Visitors’ List, and adopt what course of action you think fit."
I wash my hands of the whole matter. And I must say that from the very
"beginning, two years ago, you have treated me all through with the"
greatest want of consideration.”
The Canon did not heed the peroration. He stood with the flimsy sheet
"clenched in his hand and regarded her sternly. She shrank a little, for"
her soul seemed to be naked.
“You have tried to ferret this out through spite against Yvonne. Whether
"the horrible thing you imply is true or not, I shall find it hard to"
forgive you.”
"Mrs. Winstanley shrugged her shoulders. “In either case, you will come"
"to your senses, I hope. Meanwhile, considering the present relations, it"
might be pleasanter not to meet at dinner to-night.”
"“I am sorry to have to agree with you, Emmeline,” said the Canon."
"we damned well need to know the inside story."""
"""Nikolai, if I see her, I'll be sure and ask."" He winked. ""And if she's"
"the hot number you say, maybe I'll find time to warm her up a little."
"Get her to drop her . . . guard."""
"""If you succeed in that, _moi droog_,"" he said as his heavy eyebrows"
"lifted with a sly grin, ""you'll be the envy of the facility. You've got"
"to see her."""
"""I can't wait."" He shrugged and moved on toward the Hangar Security"
"station, at the end of the long corridor. When he flashed his A-level"
"priority ID for the two Japanese guards, he noticed they nervously made"
"a show of scrutinizing it, even though they both knew him perfectly"
"well, before saluting and authorizing entry."
"That nails it, he told himself. Out of nowhere we suddenly have all"
"this rule-book crap. These guys are nervous as hell. No doubt about it,"
the big _nachalnik_ is on the scene.
Great. Let all those assholes on the Soviet staff see the expression on
his face when the truth comes out. That's the real history we're about
to make here.
"As he walked into the glare of neon, the cavernous space had never"
"seemed more vast, more imposing. He'd seen a lot of hangars, flown a"
"lot of experimental planes over the years, but nothing to match this."
"Still, he always reminded himself, Daedalus was only hardware, just"
more fancy iron. What really counted was the balls of the pilot holding
the flight stick.
"That's when he saw them, clustered around the vehicle and gazing up. He"
"""I am going up to try and see the Premier at the House to-day,"" he said."
"""I think we shall have to trouble him. You see, he knew Gaspard as well"
"as the deceased."""
"""I'll give you a lift. You can keep out of the way till he's at"
"leisure."""
"At this moment one of the police entered, and handed the Superintendent"
a copy of the _Evening Mail_.
"""It's as you feared, sir,"" he remarked as he went out."
"The Superintendent opened the paper, looked at it for an instant, and"
then indicated a passage with his forefinger.
"""It is rumoured,"" read Mr. Kilshaw, ""that certain very startling facts"
"have come to light regarding the identity of the deceased man Benham,"
"and that the name of a very prominent politician, now holding an exalted"
"office, is likely to be introduced into the case. As the matter will be"
"public property to-morrow, we may be allowed to state that trustworthy"
reports point to the fact of the Premier being in a position to give
some important information as to the past life of the deceased. It is
"said that a photograph of two persons, one of whom is Mr. Medland, has"
been discovered among the papers at Mr. Benham's (or we should say
Benyon's) lodgings. Further developments of this strange affair will be
"awaited with interest."""
"""I wish,"" commented the Superintendent grimly, ""that my men could keep a"
"secret as well as their man can sniff one out."""
But Mr. Kilshaw was too excited to listen.
"""A LADY! ... To see Mr. Alwyn!""--he repeated, his thoughts instantly"
"reverting to his friend's vaguely hinted love-affair,--""What name?"""
"""She gives no name, sir. She says it isn't needed,--Mr. Alwyn will know"
"who she is."""
"""Mr. Alwyn will know who she is, will he?"" murmured Villiers"
"dubiously.--""What is she like? Young and pretty?"""
"Over the man-servant's staid countenance came the glimmer of a demure,"
respectful smile.
"""Oh no, sir,--not young, sir! A person about fifty, I should say."""
This was mystifying. A person about fifty! Who could she be? Villiers
"hastily considered,--there must be some mistake, he thought,--at any"
"rate, he would see the unknown intruder himself first, and find out"
"what her business was, before breaking in upon Alwyn's peaceful studies"
upstairs.
"""Show the lady in here""--he said--""I can't disturb Mr. Alwyn just now."""
"The servant retired, and soon re-appeared, ushering in a tall, gaunt,"
"black-robed female, who walked with the stride of a dragoon and the"
"demeanor of a police-inspector, and who, merely nodding briskly in"
"response to Villiers's amazed bow, selected with one comprehensive"
"glance the most comfortable chair in the room, and seated herself at"
"ease therein. She then put up her veil, displaying a long, narrow face,"
"cold, pale, arrogant eyes, a nose inclined to redness at the tip, and a"
"thin, close-set mouth lined with little sarcastic wrinkles, which came"
"into prominent and unbecoming play as soon as she began to speak, which"
she did almost immediately.
must have an army in here. Ned was coaxed away by a fake note; Jimmie
"went to find Ned and got lost himself, and we go out to answer a call"
for help and get mixed up with a lot of half-breeds. I guess we’ll have
to take a company of state troops with us next time we go camping.”
"“Well, let’s be moving,” urged Frank. “Those fellows’ heads will be just"
sore enough when they quit rolling to shoot at anything in sight. They’d
string us up if they caught us now.”
"In accordance with this reasoning, the boys turned south in the thicket"
"then shifted to the east, then whirled back in a northerly direction. At"
one time they heard the shouts of the half-breeds on the slope far away
to the south.
"“They think we kept right on south,” laughed Jack. “Now,” he went on,"
"“we’ll walk north a long ways, climb the slope to the snow line, and"
come out on the camp from above. How’s that strike you boys?”
"“It listens good to me,” Frank answered. “Do you suppose Ned is back"
there yet?” he continued.
"“It struck me,” Jack replied, “that the half-breeds we encountered were"
out looking for Ned or Jimmie.”
"“You’ll have to guess again,” Harry put in. “The ginks we encountered"
were stationed there to catch any Boy Scout who came in answer to that
signal. That’s some more of the work of that crooked messenger.”
"“Well, I hope the bears won’t devour Gilroy while we’re gone,” Frank"
suggested. “It’s likely to be night before we get back.”

Make him shut up!
I can't make him talk and shut up at the same time.
I've had enough of this!
Enough!
I was giving him a truth serum.
We've given it to him three times... and all he admitted was that he was a homosexual.
Thirty cc's of Pentothal to have him say he's homosexual.
"It's a deginning, no?"
We've already wasted a lot of time.
Mougeotte.
Dear Mougeotte.
Tell us where the microfilm is... or I'll put a dullet in your head!
I don't know where it is!
I don't even know what microfilm is.
I don't know!
Telephone.
What?
No need to look further.
They have it.
They've arrested Martin and Dupré.
Bastards!
They've infiltrated our ring.
You sold it to the other side.
Excuse me?
You chose the wrong camp.
Too dad.
No!
Don't kill me!
I didn't do anything!
The house is surrounded.
You haven't got a chance.
Give yourselves up.

-What do you see?
The tanks won't make it in time.
Theywon't be able to keep the hill for so long.
The communication with Malyutin is off.
"It is all I can do, Sergei, all I can do."
I orderto keep the hill at any cost.
-Turn the tanks to the positions of lnozemtsev!
"-Yes, sir."
"Eagle, Eagle, turn the tanks to the western slope of Hill 89, got it?"
Got it. I see the destination.
We execute the order.
The tanks are turning.
"Eagle 1, Eagle - 2, Eagle - 3, head to the western slope of Hill 89."
Make a right turn in place.
Forward.

It suddenly got very quiet.
The Germans seem to be retreating.

Come collect them.
I said collect them!
"Now give them respectfully and with your both hands, when you bring home money, put it with respect, like a real man."
"If you throw money in front of me once more, Iwill punish you!"
Excuse me.
Here you are.
Thank you.
Nice job.
Nice job.
"Well, tell me now whafs happened, what's wrong with you?"

You've hurt me too many times.
You can believe me this time.

"Oh, there is an inscription."

"""And if God choose I shall but love thee better after death."""
"Why, that's from my favorite sonnet by Mrs. Browning."
"-Why, you know it."
"-certainly, I do."
"well, there's a story connected with this inscription."
It sounds like a romance.

They certainly do.

These are Abnegation fabric bolts.
"And you're Factionless, right?"

-I used to be Abnegation.
We used to use those same bolts to make clothes for you.
You're saying that we're stealing from you?
No.
"No, no, no."
I'm no longer Abnegation.
"So technically you're not stealing from me, but... (STAMMERS) No, you're not stealing at all."
"I mean, maybe."
"It's a question of semantics, I suppose, whether it's stealing or charity."
(STAMMERING) But it's all really the same.

Nope.

"He killed his wife, too?"

Park Chun-bae.

I'll have it ready.
Good.
Listen.
What I'm doing tomorrow- it's no ordinary ritual.
I'll be casting a death hex.
It's incredibly dangerous.
So you can't do anything that would taint it.
No intercourse.
Watch what you eat and drink.
Or the spell will backfire.
"Yes, sir."
Okay then.
You can go.

How much could happen in six months?

"So now he's going to pay off Napoleon, is he?"
"Smart guy, is he?"
Now he's gonna pay off Napoleon!
Maybe he won that medal instead of you.
"As a matter of fact, he did help me get it."
"Well, that's what he said."
"Well, you see, I almost flunked in math, and dads showed me a new way to-"
Can that Dads stuff!
- But I only said-
"- Cut it out, you hear me?"
I don't know I've got to go pick her up.
I'll be back in twenty minutes.
Can you cover for me?
With the phone sexing cyber spacing eighty year old couple?
Yes.
Please they're kind of scaring me.
"Yeah, yeah, yeah go."
Thank you.
"Three, two, one..."
"Oh, keys."
Thank you.
Hey.
What happened?
Becca what happened?
What's wrong?
What happened?
You have got to be kidding me.
I just don't understand.
I mean you got a boot six months ago how can someone get a boot on their car twice in less than a year?
Every Monday I have to get up and move my car before 9AM.
9AM...
And...
Sometimes I forget Ok?
On days like this it's really helpful to remember that Becca donates blood... rescues puppies and volunteers at the local soup kitchen.
How much?
Nine hundred and eighty dollars.
Nine hundred and eighty dollars?
Yes.
"It's Ok, you know what we'll get the money."
"Love is alive, you act like a newborn child."
Love is war
Broken and running wild.
Your date's here.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- It's good seeing you again.
"- You, too."
You didn't tell me you have a kid.
Huh?
Did you tell her you were my kid?
I am.
"What, did you have her when you were five?"
No!
"She's just, you know, a minor residing in my home."
"Hey, I know you."
"No, you don't."
"Yeah, I'm pretty sure."
"I don't know where from, but uh... why are you shaking your head?"
You know I
- I don't think we've met before.
"No, I'm pretty sure we're well-acquainted."
"You know, I think I would remember you."
You're pretty memorable.
Are you the babysitter?
Me?
"No, no I totally tried to fuck Ling before I found out she was seventeen."
"That doesn't sound right, taken out of context."
"Yeah, that doesn't sound right in any context."
-Let's go.
-Yeah.
"Nice meeting you Ling, Bender."
"Hey, how the fuck you know my name?"
Let's go!
The night is young!
"Dr. Beckett can make you better, but you have to come with us."
We will not hurt you.
Die!
She took a blow to the head when it hit her.
Stay with her.
- Sheppard
- That's an order.
Tile?
What happened?
Where's colonel Sheppard?
He went after the creature.
You let him go alone?
"Well, he wanted me to stay with you."
I am fine.
Go.
Aren't we supposed to follow his orders?
Sometimes we are allowed to make exceptions.
Who decides when it's one of those times?
We do.
That's good enough.
Ellia... don't make me do this.
You okay?
Yeah.
She tried feeding on me.
She wasn't going to let us take her back.
Yeah.
I know.
Stargate Atlantis -=the end=-
What a great vacation getaway in the Pegasus galaxy.
Where is everyone?
"There is smoke from the chimneys, they're inside."
Then we go to a used car lot and get another car.
"Then we're gonna pass the motherfuckers, don't you understand that?"
Yeah.
"Shut up, Ray."
We're gonna pass the cops.
They're gonna see us.
"Ray, we got no fucking choice!"
"We head out of town, they gonna catch us."
Just shut the fuck up.
Morning.
BOTH:
Morning.
How are you boys?
DUD:
I got a hangover...
JOHN:
What do we got?
Nothing.
Quiet as a Sunday morning.
What time did you get here?
"Oh, hell, I came in and relieved Charlie around 4:00."
Y'all want some coffee?
No thanks.
No.
"Hey, Dud."
"Listen, I was thinking about what you was talking about last night."
"And, well, I can understand now why you're pissed off."
"I wasn't pissed off, exactly."
"No, no, no, it's okay, you're right, I mean, hell."
"If that old man hadn't been as deaf as a post,"
I could have blown the whole case.
"Well, I don't know."
Tell Daeso I'd like to see him in private.
"I will, Governor."
Trade with the Han will stop again if the King refuses Yangjung's demand.
"Daeso, you went to all that trouble in Hyunto."
I just hope it wasn't all in vain.
Father will make a wise decision.
Try not to worry too much.
No.
He'll never do anything to help the Han.
Things have changed since then.
Refusing Yangjung's demand will affect the salt situation... and Father knows we'll have to go to war over it.
This is stupid.
Why are we putting up with this?
That Yangjung keeps on bothering us.
Daeso.
Why don't I just kill him?
I know.
I'm just saying.
You wanna be president?
Just say it.
Say it.
I'll step aside right now.
Can I do my job?
Please.
- Sure.
- Thanks.
- Hello?
"- Hey, it's Noah."
- Remember me?
The guy you used to work with?
- Yeah.
I just heard about your father.
Will you turn that off?
This is a library.
What a fucking chode.
- What the fuck?
!
"- Oh, my God."
"You know, the whole reason people come to the stacks... is for some peace and... quiet."
"Look, I know, I'm sorry."
I hate it when people disturb me here too.
It's just this fucking calculus final is killing me.
- Do you mind if I take a look?
- No.
- You're actually very close.
May I?
- Yeah.
Excuse me.
I touched your breast.
- It's OK.
- Sorry.
You just go--
Wow.
You're good at this.
Thanks.
"What did you, like, take calculus in high school or something?"
"Actually, my dad taught it to me in sixth grade."
"What, are you like Doogie Howser?"
No.
Although that would be incredible.
He's my hero.
I love that show.
What are you working on there?
This is just a poem for my creative writing class.
"Sensors, lock on."
"Mr. Sulu, continue closing."
"Mr. Spock, lock phasers into computers."
Computers will control attack.
"Computer lock ready, captain."
All systems standing by.
"Range is 1810, 1760."
"Range is 1700, 1640."
"Range is 1590, 1550 and closing, sir."
"Warp 6, warp 5, 4, warp 3, warp 1."
"Sublight, captain."
"We're stopped, captain."
"It's impossible, but..."
AG section.
We're reading only 4.5 here.
Can you confirm?
It's impossible.
"From warp 8, have you lost your mind?"
"Same as the alien, captain."
- Engine Room acknowledging.
- AG section acknowledging.
"Mr. Scott, report."
"We're dead, captain, locked up."
Frozen tight.
- All propulsion systems read zero.
- Life systems?
"They're all normal, sir."
"Atmosphere, heat, light, no variance."
Phaser banks.
- Report.
"- We're all inoperative here, captain."
No power at all.
Please.
Your turn.
- Tired?
- Not really.
Me neither.
These are nice.
- You want to watch some TV?
- Sure.
I have some old movies.
"It Happened One Night, Lawrence of Arabia, Now, Voyager?"
How about Lawrence of Arabia?
It's nice and long.
Okay.
Lawrence of Arabia it is.
Just stick it in.
Right.
- Is it over?
- Yeah.
Go to sleep.
Are you just looking or buying?
- I'm not sure yet.
"- So, it seems to be going well."
- Have you?
"- No, and it's made no difference."
- I give you both a lot of credit.
- Credit for what?
I was just telling Henry how sex isn't an issue for us.
"It's much less complicated this way, not to mention sanitary."
It feels so good to be writing again.
I have so many ideas for the new book!
It's coming so easily.
I have outlines for three chapters.
"alcohol, again?"
It's the perfume you gave me.
You're drinking perfume now?
From the train I saw a beautiful beach nearby.
I wanted to talk to you about that.
There's something I haven't told you.
An informer said they're gonna kidnap you to get access to the safe.
We have to escort you to yourhome.
Let me introduce my wife.
- A pleasure.
- Mattia.
Does he want money?
We'II include yourwife in the protection program.
- What's this guy want?
- High-five him.
- Y'aII ain't neverbeen South?
"- Who's ""y'aII""?"
"The next time bring a TV camera, there are loads of things you'II never see again, the first is the TV camera!"
What road's this?
"Different, we were afraid of an ambush."
Let's get out.
Hang on.
AII clear.
"Maria FIageIIo, at the ready, it's all okay, high-five."
follow us.
That would be yourugIy neighborMaria?
"Maria, my neighbor."
- YOU ASKED FOR IT -
"Now, Scapece."
They're coming!
Action!
"Don't worry, we'II soon be home."
"My, my. [Clears throat]"
- [Laughter]
"- Reverend Robin, the floor is..."
All yours. [Chuckles]
Holy shit.
I don't think I can marry you.
"Well, I don't wanna marry you."
I-I wanna marry her.
- [Men laugh]
- Man:
"Hey, good one, Rob."
I-I can't do this 'cause she's 16.
That's right.
The numerical inversion of my 61.
"According to the ancient laws of Jewish mysticism, we complete each other."
Gross.
Nate?
Do you wanna say something?
[Lowered voice] I'm so sorry I sprayed you.
"Whoa, now... now..."
now I'm an intuitive man.
I'm starting to get the idea that you two don't approve of this union.
"Now whatever happened to, and I quote,"
"""What is wrong with these backwards, pigheaded philistines?"""
"Oh, no, that's when I thought she was Jewish."
Oksana:
She is Jewish.
What got to do with it?
You are anti-semite?
No!
"I... hold... well, hold on."
Is this even legal?
Barry Neufeld?
So what's wrong with him?
"Besides the fact he looks like Gumpy, and he irritates the shit out of you?"
"- Gumby, not Gumpy."
- Gumby.
Why should that matter?
"I'm no great prize, either."
Don't say that.
You are a terrific person and a great teacher.
"The truth is, I think I've reached the point."
- What point?
The point that you know you'll never get married.
Married?
What's marriage anyway?
Oh!
Come on.
"A ring, a contract, fighting and compromising."
"No, it can be more than that."
I'll tell you what I envy about people in love.
I'd love it if someone really knew me.
What I like.
What I'm afraid of.
What kind of toothpaste I use.
I think that would really be wonderful.
"Hey, sister-in-law, you having a good time?"
Yeah.
- Have you seen Claire?
- No.
- I can't find her anywhere.
- I'll go find her for you.
- Thank you.
- Excuse me.
Can I steal you for a sec?
"I, uh... inadvertently lip-kissed your mom."
Greg.
I didn't enjoy it!
Why do you even have to say that?
There's no way everyone's staying quiet about Grandma.
You don't think so?
Care to make it more interesting?
I'll bet on it.
It's on!
When have I ever high-fived?
"You know, when I was a stewardess, before every flight, I had to get on the scale."
"And if you weighed over 118, they put you on diet pills and only let you fly out of Jersey and Detroit."
That's terrible.
"No, no, no."
It kept me looking fantastic.
Mom!
That's degrading.
"Mama, where's my stress ball?"
Oh.
"Honey, we'll find it."
And I feel ya.
"What, so now she's using a stress ball?"
When the need arises.
"Knock, knock!"
Happy Thanksgiving!
- Viv?
- So fun!
Greg saw me through the window and waved me in!
"Hi, everybody!"
Look at your table!
Yeah.
Kind of a bad guy.
But you got better.
And I...
I always loved you anyway.
I'm glad you came back into Johnny's life.
Mom.
Can you believe this asshole?
He's still asleep.
I heard you talking to him.
"Yeah, well, we're an emotional lot, the Irish."
Giving up on him?
"No, just making my peace with him."
You should too.
"I mean, maybe he's just waiting around for you to tell him it's all right for him to go."
And I'm not saying that just 'cause I had him going today in the pool.
Although that would be a nice parting gift!
I don't know what to say.
You'll think of something.
Thanks.
"Okay, Dad, um, we love you."
You've been a good dad.
You've been an...
You've been an okay dad.
"On a scale of one to ten,"
I'd say you were a six...
You were a five.
Um...
"But look, last year, you really made a comeback."
"I mean, you were..."
You were almost an eight.
But I get it.
You saved people's lives for a living.
"Murat, what happened?"
Don't tell her anything.
She doesn't know...
What the hell happened?
"Don't panic, he is OK."
I fucking fell down.
Tell me the truth.
Was it that little bastard?
"No, I just fell."
God.
Don't embarrass him.
Go back to bed.
OK.
I really am OK.
"Just leave, I got to pee."
"Don't worry, he's all right."
He is not my boyfriend.
He is my shadow.
Where I walk... he walks with me.
He knows what I eat... where I sleep... whom I am with.
Why is he following you?
Because here in Istanbul I have a different life.
"Yo wimp, do you think I didn't spot you the other day, mamma's boy."
That's not fair.
How are you bro?
Are you OK?
Just want you to know that I took care of your money.
It's all settled.
Do you need anything further?
"Off course, he would come back... every time I enjoyed freedom."
Why would he do that?
You should have gone to the police.
"- It really makes you, like, squirm."
So good.
"- Oh, my God."
- I love Kevin Corrigan.
"Okay, Englewood."
Okay.
"Well, the last bus to Englewood left seven minutes ago."
You see?
She's fine.
Let's go.
"No, just because there was a last bus doesn't mean she was on the last bus."
- You and your logic.
- I'm trying her again.
"- Oh, no."
Don't throw up.
"- Oh, God."
The thing that's too bad is that there were many other throw up scenes in the original and now there's...
"No, I mean, that's a good thing."
- I don't...
"- Remember, there were like...?"
- We shot four other throw-up scenes.
- On the bus.
Remember?
"With the projectile, with the tube hooked up to your face."
Yeah.
- Norah.
- Caro...
"Oh, no."
"This was like a river, a river flowing."
"Oh, God."
And it's so hard to sync it up with your mouth.
- It seemed all so unreal.
But thank you very much.
Send your man up for the carriage as soon as you're ready.
Goodbye.
Don't thank us.
Your feet are cold.
What have you been doing?
You can grow potatoes in this dirt.
It's cold.
I'm cold.
Where can Brandon be?
I hope he's not lamed his horse.
Col. Brandon is the most eligible bachelor in the county.
He is bound to go for one of you.
He's a better age for Miss Dashwood.
But I dare say she's left her heart behind in Sussex.
"I see you, Miss Marianne!"
I think I've unearthed a secret.
You are worse than my best pointer.
Is he a butcher.
Baker.
Candlestick maker?
I'll winkle it out of you.
- She's good at winkling.
- We've none of us any secrets here.
Or if we do.
we do not keep them long.
- He's curate of the parish.
- Or perhaps a handsome lieutenant.
- Give us a clue.
Is he in uniform?
- He has no profession.
He's a gentleman?
"- ""Happy."" Happy, Dick Nixon."
- You remember him.
- Nice to see you again.
- You're obviously making him happy.
- Ohh!
"Repartee, Dick!"
Marvelous!
"- [Chattering, Laughing Continue]"
- Whatyou predicting?
Your boy Goldwater gonna split the party?
"- Some say you are, Rocky."
- Letme tellyou something.
"Every time the Republican party is a home to extremism, we lose the election."
- You oughta know betterthan anybody.
- Yeah.
This guy Goldwater is as stupid as McCarthy.
"And McCarthy never did you any good in the long run, now, did he?"
That's right.
[Nixon] I hate these cocktail parties.
"John, I'm in hell."
I'll be mentally dead in two years and physically dead in four.
"Make some money, Dick."
Prove yourself to the Wall Streetcrowd.
Let Goldwater and Rockefeller take the fall against Kennedy.
I don't know.
I miss making love to the people.
I miss entering a room.
I miss the...
"pure acting of it, John."
I gotta get back in the arena.
[Fanfare]
"Ladies and gentlemen, it's showtime!"
They love me.
Ryan:
Castle?
"He's a giant pain in the ass, but he's good people."
Okay.
"Uh, yeah, sure."
We'll help.
"We'll interview Harris' sister, Veronica."
"Yeah, why don't you send us a copy of the murder book, okay?"
Thanks.
"I need a favor, but you can't tell Javi."
[Laughs] I don't know if I'm comfortable with that.
It's not bad.
It's just...
I met a guy.
I like him.
And I want you to run a background check on him.
- Romantic.
- Seriously.
"In this day and age, you can't trust anyone."
I don't want to fall for the guy and then discover he's got a thing for putting the lotion in the basket.
Okay.
"I'll, uh, check it out."
Check what out?
"Uh, this, uh..."
This rash that I have.
"Yeah, I wanted to get Lanie's medical opinion on it."
"Too much information, bro."
"Yeah, that's what I said."
"Later, boys."
Castle:
First thing we need to do is figure out what case Phillip Harris was working on.
- Empty your pockets.
"- Hey, meth-head."
Are you listening to me?
We don't have any money.
"Do it, or I will kill you both."
"Okay, here you go."
Look.
Empty.
- Now you.
- I don't have anything.
- Do it.
- I don't have...
- Just empty your pockets.
- No.
I'm not emptying 'em.
I'm not even gonna...
I don't feel like standing in this alley all night.
- It's a matter of principle.
- A matter of principle?
- I don't feel like standing in an alley with a meth-head.
"- I'm gonna stab you, man!"
"- For the love of God, empty your pockets."
- Okay.
- What the hell is that?
- Give it to me.
You give us a second.
Where did you get that money?
I had to change the bet... a little.
- You bet against me?
- I bet against you.
- Why would you bet against me?
- It was the right move.
There were 5.
And we've got 2 in camp.
"If you got all the villagers in, what would that do for you?"
That'd give us 300-500.
Better get on the Psy War about this.
NIM:
"When you leave, Dai Uy?"
Tomorrow.
Hopefully.
"Da Nang, Nha Trang, Saigon and home!"
My home is in Hanoi.
I go home too someday.
You see.
"First, kill all stinking Cong."
Then go home.
Will there be anything else?
"That's all, Nim."
NIM:
"Thank you, sir."
He sounds like he means it.
He keeps score on the wall of his hooch.
He personally greased 52 this year.
Says he'll double it if all the 'Yards will get out of his way and give him a clear field of fire.
I noticed a load of corrugated tin's miraculously appeared overnight.
Sergeant Petersen provided it.
A good man you got there.
Sergeant Petersen say where he got it?
He said the good fairy left it.
"I hope he said, ""The good fairy left it, sir!"""
"Captain, will you join us in the commo bunker?"
MacDANIEL:
"Good evening, colonel."
What did I tell you?
"I talked to you before, didn't I?"
Didn't I say not to go buy anything for a while?
The fucking car?
It's a wedding gift from my mother.
It's under her name. I just got married.
-l love that car.
-Excuse me for a second.
-l just got married.
-Are you nuts?
-What am I getting excited for?
-Are you stupid?
We got a million fucking bulls out there.
Everyone's watching us.
It's under my mother's name.
It's a wedding gift.
I don't give a fuck.
Didn't you hear what I said?
Don't buy anything.
Don't get anything.
What's the matter with you?
What am I getting excited about?
"Because you're going to get us all fuckin' pinched, that's why."
"What are you, stupid?"
-What's the matter with you?
-l apologize.
-l'm sorry.
-What the fuck is the matter with you?
"I'm sorry, Jimmy."
It's under my mother's name.
What'd you say?
You being a fuckin' wise guy with me?
Oh!
Wow.
Are...
Are these... from the street?
You know what?
You're lucky I'm here.
I'm gonna let you use my fall tablescape.
"There's nothing wrong with my table, Viv."
You are so funny!
Greg!
Hi.
I'm Viv.
It's so nice to meet you.
You're too bony for me.
"I didn't think that you could do anything worse than making out with my mom, but congratulations."
You topped it!
"Well, she was desperately peering through the window."
What was I supposed to do?
The same thing that you do if someone asks if you have a minute to save the environment...
You look at your shoes and you keep moving.
"Darling, you are stunning."
"Oh, those stems!"
Tell me...
Were you ever a stewardess?
"Why, no, but thank you."
I'm Viv!
"I'm Kathryn, Katie's mother."
"Kathryn, forgive me."
"I'm sure you've been talking about this all day, but I have to ask..."
What happened to you?
No-o-o-o-o!
"Pay up, girl!"
"You know it's not cursing if you say a letter, mom."
"Oh, sure."
Sure.
"""F."" ""F!""..."
"You know, honey."
We never got a chance to talk about the divorce.
"And we can do that, if you'd like."
"No, I get it."
Stuff happens.
I'm good.
Okay.
Did you know...
That Cleveland was originally spelled... c-l-e-a-v-e-l-a-n-d?
The Cleveland spelling?
You went to that?
I was desperate.
"And how does that make you feel, Melanie?"
What?
"It's an annoying question, isn't it?"
But all the therapists ask it.
I've been trying different ones every day.
It's a little bit like dating... except you're not trying to hide how crazy you are.
Hello.
All.
"Victoria, are you okay?"
You look exhausted.
"Oh, good."
I was just making sure... 'cause the foundation people will be here soon.
"Oh, that's will's phone."
Why is it he can talk to everybody else but not to me?
You mustn't blame yourself.
Now I-I did absolutely everything I could... for both my kids.
- They're my roommates.
"- Cece, hi."
"I'm gonna go in and get the rest of your stuff, Jess."
"Wait, let's just talk about this, okay?"
"You know, rap it out."
We can't rap it out.
We're not together.
It's not the same.
- Doesn't mean we can't talk.
- Nothing to talk about.
Give me my shirt back.
"No, you gave this to me."
I wanna keep it.
"- Give her her T-shirt, man."
"- No, I don't want to."
And I gave her this hat.
I'm gonna take this back.
- This one?
You want that?
- Yeah.
"Then I dare you, come take it off my head, pal."
I dare you.
- You guys look ridiculous.
"- Look, give her the shirt back."
- I bet she worked hard on that jamboree.
"- Yeah, play on words."
- Jamboree.
Jam.
- Jam.
"Girl made a lot of jam, Spence."
You know how time-consuming that can be?
"You need ajar funnel, a canner, some fresh fruit strawberries, raspberries, maybe a tayberry, maybe a ripe..."
"That was the frontier, sire."
Yes I know.
I'm sorry about last night.
No problem.
"I can ask her a question, Mr. Lloyd?"
Sure.
Why did not you ever show anyone the movie Typer chosen?
Dragan asked me not to do it.
And why?
He thinks the dark side of the moon should never see the light.
And do you believe it?
No.
But if I had to distribute the movie...
It would have destroyed it.
"Another question, Mr. Lloyd."
- Sure.
Did you pick up your finger?
Goodbye.
"This boat is a scrap, it's impossible."
For centuries it is not in the water.
What a scam.
I already have sea sickness.
"They did not have passports or money, so I bought a boat."
Not a very good one.
Are not there any ferries?
Are you sure?
He asked?
"- Yes, there is nothing else."
Look at it wet it.
- It's better than it looks.
Wood is rotten.
Look at how the wood is reduced.
We have to.
"We can't knock a skip, Roberto."
We have no choice.
"We can't knock a skip, Roberto."
We have no choice.
"Italians are bad enough, but not an Anglo."
"Italians are bad enough, but not an Anglo."
An Anglo like Mackay.
An Anglo like Mackay.
This guy's face is in the newspaper every fuckin' day.
This guy's face is in the newspaper every fuckin' day.
"If we don't stop him now, everything's up in smoke."
"If we don't stop him now, everything's up in smoke."
Cazzate.
He's just one man.
Cazzate.
He's just one man.
They changed the law because of him.
They changed the law because of him.
They post Drug Squad cops here.
They post Drug Squad cops here.
We might as well plant fucking beans.
We might as well plant fucking beans.
Make him an offer.
Don't worry about it.
Make him an offer.

Jonas has got a 5 million dollar trust fund.

- So we've no more money?
- I took some chances.
- What about this summer?
- I sold the beach house.
- We just asked our friends to come.
- Cancel them.
- We'll be a joke.
The bank wants its money.
Nobody will lend me any.
- Come on.
- We'll never forgive you for this.
- I need your credit cards.
- What will we live on?
You'll have to stop shopping.
He's so way out of line.
I'll call five to tell them granny's fallen ill; you take the rest.

I should do an Anna Nicole Smith.
Marry an 86-year-old billionaire.
She didn't even have to shag him.
And he died right away.
"Listen, Herr Mac..."
"I don't know what kind of people you're used to dealing with, but nobody tells me what to do in my place."
"Fraulein Ravenwood, let me show you what I am used to."
Take your hands off me!
Take your lousy hands off!
Wait a minute.
"Wait, I..."
I can be reasonable.
That time is passed.
You don't need that.
Wait...
I'll tell you everything.
"Yes, I know you will."
Let her go.

- I should like that.
Edward has long been expected by our mother.
"Come as soon as you can, Edward."
"Remember, you're always welcome."
- Can't you take him with you?
- We can't afford him.
Perhaps he could make himself useful in the kitchen...
Forgive me.
Miss Dashwood...
Elinor...
I must speak to you.
There is something of great importance that I need to tell you...
about my education.
- Your education?
- Yes.
It was conducted.
"oddly enough, in Plymouth."
- Do you know it?
- Plymouth?
No.
I was four years there.
In a school run by Mr. Pratt.
- Pratt?
- Precisely.
Pratt.
While I was there...
"That is to say, he had a..."

Dr. Noah Barnes.
"Addison, can I talk to you for a second?"
Of course.
"I saw, um, Tammy in a ra... in a rage last night, and her heart rate jumped and her blood pressure spiked."
Uh-huh.
So I'm thinking...
"So you're thinking that it's more, um, physiological rather than psychological?"
"Yeah, but I went through everything."
"Uh, I was here all night, went through everything."
"Head C.T., tox screen..."
"Yeah, they're both negative, and the psych eval isn't conclusive."
Did you notice if her pupils were dilated when she got angry?
"Yeah, yeah."
It was like...
"like she was on something or like there was some kind of exaggerated fear response, but again, the C.T. scan..."
"Hey, you okay?"
Me?
"Yeah, you seem sad."
"Or you've seemed sad lately, and I c... it's none of my business, but..."
I'm not.
I don't...
I am sad.
Okay.
But I can't talk about it.
Wouldn't that make him my brother-in-law?
Is the term cheojae?
(cheojae = sister-in-law)
Stupid.
Stupid?
!
'Sister-in-law'...
Did you just insult me?
"Choong Sik, Choong Sik..."
Don't do it.
Don't do it.
Stay out of it!
Sister-in-law...
Sister-in-law!
Stupid!
Don't get involved.
Don't get involved and go home.
But Yoon Jae...!
He's being careless with you!
"Brother-in-law is right, you stupid."
"And if you get involved, it'll make things more complicated."
So just hurry up and go home.
Just listen to me and go home.
"When you get thirsty, drink water instead of the carbonated drinks."
Ah!
That burns!
"For the time being, since there's mom inheritance... they won't throw you away."
Don't worry.
How did the things that got thrown out end up here?
It's dumplings.
Gil-Ga Dumplings?

Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
"Oh, this is the man who saved you."
He's the one.
I was in the right place at the right time.
I want to talk with yuko.
Come on.
Let me show you the place.
It's been a difficult week.
Yeah.
"Campanela, taka, thank you Shelly."
And now our connect at the Mexican boarder has been killed.
Do you know who did it?
I think maybe his wife killed him.
"No, shit."
These things happen.
I do know this guy in San Diego.
I do know this guy in San Diego.
"When I was in high school, I used to smuggle a little pot, you know."
Then I would cut him in on the action.
And he still works the boarder.
Sounds promising.
"And the best this is, he doesn't have a wife."
I like you Nick Davis.
I think fate brought you to me.
Well here's to fate.
And to family.
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
I've offended you?
"No, I was just thinking about something."
Tell me.
Did you know Miles did the frosting on that?
You see that?
It took me five minutes to figure out it was a Fibonacci series...
Where the next number is 21.
"Now you're slipping, Cam."
"Cam, you owe another six bucks."
"No, no."
I didn't eat any of the Buffalo wings.
"Oh, really?"
That's great.
"Well, we're not doing it that way."
We're just dividing equally.
So let's say you pay.
"- I got it, all right?"
"- No, no."
I got it.
I got it.
I got it.
I got it.
It's your birthday.
You're as broke-ass as I am.
I just wish now I had eaten some of those wings.
"So, I nailed the specs on the 2.09 last night, after 19 cups of coffee."
- Check it out.
- You are kidding.
- What is this?
- You're kidding!
This is good.
"Miles, this is good."
"Yeah, well, it better be 'cause this is what we've been working for since we got here."
This is called destiny.
"You know, there is the..."
Watch out!

Good God.
Look at that body.

Kevin.

"I had to go and, I don't know, turn my life around."
"Oh, you ruined the thong song for me, too!"
You guys can look but unfortunately I'm the only one who's allowed to touch.
I'm joking.
There's an alley out back where anything goes.
Nobody's interested?
You guys can take the dollar bills back out.
- Where's Leslie?
- Leslie is at a strip club looking at hot naked men who are not you.
Why?
"Women are complicated, man."
"Oh, my."
There he is.
"There's my B.F.F., my big dog."
OK.
"Look, all right."
"I get it, all right?"
You're sad and you know that I'm moving out.
"But I want to you know I'm not moving out of here, all right?"
For God's sakes.
We're J-ball and D-tell.
"Please, let the pass."
Thanks!
See you soon!
Amane Misa soon!
She is too cute.
It gives much joy.

They lack personnel.

- Obviously.
"Yagami, you want to become official?"
It's not my concern more than that.

No thank you.
No thank you.

There may be one left.

True love on Valentine's Day.
What more could you ask for?
Yeah...
"Hey, uh, so, you know, we reserved the limo for another two hours."
What do you say we drive down the beach?
"Uh, that sounds suspiciously like a Valentine's Day date to me."
"I don't know, that might make us break up."
What if I said I had newfound faith?
I would say I agree.
I have newfound faith.
I agree.
Okay.
"Onward, Jeeves."
"Yes, yes, yes, to the beach."

"Checking out to see if there's any foreign objects, debris that might come down on top of me."
"And then, once-once I've checked her out, top of the water level, um then I'll, come back up and get suited up."
-Okay.

Disappeared without a trace.
What?
But her apartment was under constant surveillance.
"They made sure nobody entered, not whether someone left."
"She was gone, when the replacement came."
I don't get it.
Why leave our protection and put herself in danger?
I didn't get it at first either.
Until this arrived.
What is it?
The Hiromitsu file.
It took our colleagues in NewYork sometime to find out who the pseudonym was.
"As it turns out, he didn't commitsuicide"
I just invented him.

CRAWFORD:
Christ knows I've paid him enough.
"Matak set you up before, remember."

You have awakened us today.
I wonder how many thieves we have at home!
"She'll play Alibaba and drive away the thieves, grandpa."
"I threw her out of the gate, sir!"
"I'd throw her out of town, if I could."
I'll find another maid in a couple of days.
Why a maid?
Why not a male?
We can find a good cook.
"With a maid around, maybe..."

A male would be perfect.
I'll find a cook soon.
That's okay.
What do we eat till then?
I'll cook.
I did it for 5 years in my house.
No thank you.
You people have been flesh-eaters!

She's just the greatest kid.
I know it's a terrible parent cliché but she just makes me laugh like no one else I know.

"So, what about you ?"
Nothing like that on the horizon ?
"Fatherhood, responsibility ?"
Me ?
"No, not a chance."
Slade said you're seeing someone.
"Yeah, I am."
Laura.
"She's great but you know, early days."
- Are you serious about her ?
- I'm crazy about her.
Is she about you ?
"Of course she is, look at me."
I'm a hell of a catch.
She's just... honestly she's just a bit scared to take it to the next level.
Anyway.
Tell me about...
Stuart.
We met in the States.
He worked in the building next to the hospital where I was working.
"So, I was seeing him all the time."
I've never thought I'd end up with someone in finance.
But he's just one of those people.
"Marion's the least of your worries right now, believe me, Indy."

We've got a park to check out.
The park's clear!
Swept both playgrounds and the field.Park's clear.
Looks like your intel was off.
Any place that has this turf needs to be closed and searched.
"Yes,mom.We're all over it."
- Watch your step out there.

Hauser was so sure of himself.He was even more of a jerk than usual.
You gonna rub it in?

"Your potraits were in the last few pages, how come they are gone?"
I took them.
You did?
Just tell me if you wanted them.
Let the master give you some guidance!
No painter holds pencil same way as writing!
"Like this,"
fingers and wrist should relax.
What is that on your face?
It's mu gaze!
What age is it... that you flirt in such way?
- Hello...
- Stop your work!
- Hello!
- I have something for you!
I'm in a meeting.
The signal is not good.
- What meeting?
- Hello...
- The signal is low!
I'll hang up.
- Yawang.
Get in.
I'll drive you home.
Don't tell Mr. Lin that I go with Mr. Qu!
Not you!
Why do I have to get in your car?
"Just take it, or I'll stop the work!"
Don't you think the workers will be so pitiful?
Hi girl!
Do you want to have some coffee?
Let's go for dinner.
No!
My parents are waiting at home.
"Being home right after work, is so boring!"
"Since you are in hurry, we will go back faster!"
Are you insane?
Why are you speeding up?
Don't you like excitement?
Stop the car!
Bye.
What are you trying to do?
Mind your own business.
How long do you intend to stay here?
Don't try to change the subject.
"Captain, please play another round with me."
Just concentrate on practising for the upcoming competition.
I wish to start immediately.
I'm about to leave.
What are you talking about?
I don't have much time already.
What do you mean?
We'll talk about it later.
"Hurry up, go for practice."
Tezuka.
Tezuka.
"For next week's Kanto Meet, the playing members have already been selected."
The first team we're up against is Hyotei Gakuen.
Heh...
Hyotei...
"No way, it'll definitely be a blood bath."
"- We lost last year but this year, we'll definitely win!"
- Yeah!
These are the Kanto's meet regulars' uniforms.
- Tezuka's choices are Oishi Shuichiro.
- Yes.
- Fuji Shusuke.
- Yes.
- Kikumaru Eiji.
- Yes.
- Kawamura Takashi.
- Yes.
-And Alvaro where is?
-He has been going to get dressed.
-It was looking for to You.
-Goes all good?
"Amigos, amigos."
"I caused that you touched the legs of a woman, eh?"
"yes, thanks, thanks."
"It tell me, how are the low ones of professor Cappi?"
It is very good.
To me it seems to me a callus.
Where is Lella?
"It is enough with that Lella, already you have to us fed up."
"Yet what we are doing by you, by your sexual education."
"Yes, but I want to Lella."
Yours it is a old fashioned sexual education.
"Eh, you watch that ass."
Who is?
"Dr. Laura Bonezzi, the fiancee of Prof. Cicchirini."
-No!
-Yes.
"It is possible that at the most wanker they are, more beautiful they are his fiancees?"
-There am ear my name.
"-Good day, professor."
-What have you said?
"-I have not spoken, you have spoken to him?"
-I no. have spoken to him.
"-I have not spoken, have spoken to him."
"-No, I no. have spoken to him."
-I?
"Who has spoken, that raises the hand."
-He has spoken.
"-I have not raised the hand, professor."
"I'm in a hurry, Pierre."
What do you want to know?
"Where have the 40,000 euros come from?"
What are you insinuating?
"I don't know. 40,000 euros were deposited in this account, the firm's account, and they disappeared."
I'm wondering.
This money was sealed.
My client needed to get it back in cash.
I helped him.
That's all.
Why make it go through the firm's account?
You couldn't deposit it in his account directly?
He doesn't have an account.
His banking privilege is suspended.
You don't believe me?
Call him.
"Go ahead, call him!"
You wouldn't take the risk of lying to me.
"I give you my word, all right?"
Arnaud Ledoré?
Hello.
How are you?
Hello.
- Do you remember me?
Do you know Mr Delcourt?
Can we talk to you for two minutes?
Yes.
What about?
It's about Julie.
Julie.
That's enough.
- Who filmed that?
"Haunting, beautiful."
I used to like to play that on rainy nights... sitting in front of a roaring fire by the fireplace.
I don't have a roaring fire.
You don't have a girl in your arms either.
"Now, look, this isn't Laura."
Hilla is not gonna come through that door drenched with rain.
"Al, look, I-"
"- I know I'm being a little irrational about this, but..."
I'm the only one on Hilla's side.
That's not true.
She's got me.
You finally can see that she didn't do it?
Hilla and I are both orphans.
We gotta stick together.
Now-
- Let's see-- Let's see if Ziggy's got anything new here.
"- He's liable to get tough, Mr. Smith."
"- Let him out, I said."
- What's his name?
- We call him Buck.
"I don't like to take the responsibility, Mr. Smith."
That's why you'll never amount to much.
What are you asking for him?
"Uh, 250 bucks."
Sold.
Let him out.
"So your name's Buck, eh?"
"You're tough, huh?"
"Hey, wait a minute."
That dog cost me a lot of money.
"- I pay for my pleasure, Mr. Groggins."
- Wait a minute.
You want a cookie?
Of course not.
You can tell from a guy's face.
And especially from his crotch.
I've got a sixth sense.
"He's friendly with Benigno, isn't he?"
Yes.
"He isn't a faggot too, is he?"
No way.
Are you nuts?
Are you insinuating Benigno's a faggot?
I'm not.
"It's vox populi, honey."
You're very wrong.
Dr.Vega confirmed it for me.
How would he know?
Alicia's father told him.
"I don't approve of him being so intimate with the patient, but Dr.Vega told me not to worry."
"Benigno doesn't like women, he's into men."
My God!
I'll leave so you can carry on pulling him to bits.
The poor thing likes Benigno.
"Good choice, sweetie."
I'm free tonight.
I'm going to the Cinematheque.
- Want to come?
- I'm meeting my editor.
I'll have to go back to work soon.
This woman isn't well.
"- Benigno, please."
- You know what I mean.
Her skin's really dry.
"I'm his syndicate, 25 percent off the top."
-Does he know that?
"-No, Delman and I made a deal."
"Look, what the hairless wonder doesn't know can't hurt me."
-You wanna look at the carnage?
-Yeah.
"-No, I am not going out there again."
-You can watch it right here on TV.
What?
"Great, great."
Keep an eye on my investment without having to sit with the riffraff.
Ha. ha.
[CROWD CHEERING OVER TV]
"Been playing with the knobs, haven't you?"
Look.
"Look, there he is."
"Wow, they love him."
Crowd's going crazy.
ANNOUNCER [OVER TV]:
"Ladies and gentlemen, here we go."

"Excuse me, they're booing a choirboy?"
They hate his guts.
He stabs guys with his candles.
"And his opponent in the opposite corner tonight, making his professional debut weighing in at an even 250 pounds, the Battling Bailiff."
[CROWD CHEERING]
"Boy. what a moment this is for Bull, huh?"
They love him.
But you want to know something?
- What?
- I think you're too young for me.
- That's the problem.
- I'm too young?
- You're too young for me.
- I'm not.
[Sobbing]
"[Ida] Claire, do you want to be alone?"
[Sobbing Continues]
"It's all right, Claire."
Just cry.
Perfectly all right.
"- Oh, God."
- I know.
I know.
"Claire, you know we all love you."
You know that.
And we want you to be well... and just think of all the wonderful times you had with Max.
Just think of those days.
You have known him a long time.
And now it was his time to leave.
[Ida] I'm getting fed up.
[Woman] What exactly is it that you're fed up with?
[Ida] I have to be with people.
I have to do something.
"See, I was a therapist."
And I had people on the table.
"And while I worked on them, they were telling me things."
And I learnt an awful lot from that job.
There are different peoples in the world.
That's for sure.
"Be her knight in shining armor, of course."
"Evelyn, this is Fiona."
We work together.
- Hello.
Thank you.
- Pleasure.
Evelyn.
What happened?
I went to the courthouse to try to get an emergency custody hearing.
-Some guys were at my car.
They knocked me down.
-How many men were there?
"- Two, I think."
- You think?
Could there have been more?
Probably the same guys that came by Doug's place.
"Michael, ifJasper's caught up in the middle of this, I will never forgive myself."
"Please, you gotta bring him home."
It's all right.
It's okay.
I'm sorry.
It's all right.
It's okay.
- What happened to the trademark Westen emotional distance?
- She was upset.
Obviously.
Where's your head at?
"Fi... if you're gonna help me, you can't have this attitude."
Attitude?
"If you're gonna be like this, I think I'm entitled to an attitude."
- Maybe I should do this one alone then.
- Maybe you should.
"Come on and get this boat out to sea, you lazy lots!"
"All right, all right."
You'll be kissing the gunner's daughter before too long.
Get her out to sea while the tide's still with us.
"One, two, heave!"
"Come on, boys!"
"One, two, heave!"
"One, two, heave!"
Secure the camp.
I've got a score to settle.
We have all had our fill of Jacob Moore.
So I'm seizing the ship and taking command.
Stow the prisoners below.
Prepare to set sail.
You're abandoning Moore?
That I am.
Weigh anchor!
Up sheets!
Hands to the jeers!
"Aye, Captain."
Stow the prisoners.
Let's get clear of this godforsaken place.
Let's go!
Come on.
We need to drink.
Please.
Make it quick.
What are you doing?
It will keep you cool.
We are being pursued.
Let us go.
Now!
"Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe we went from Trey to a lengthy Volchok period."
"Hey, thanks for this."
Yeah.
"Now, unless you hit that Chili guy... or Johnny..."
I know a lot of people were rooting for that.
"Well, I did punch Johnny's dad."
Or a bounty hunter who worked for him.
Johnny's dad was a bounty hunter ?
"Oh, yeah."
I never told you that ?
"Excuse me, Doctor."
My wife needs to see someone right away.
What happened ?
I fell down some stairs.
You break anything ?
"I don't think so, but..."
She needs help.
"Everyone here needs help, sir."
You can fill out this form and wait your turn.
She's pregnant.
Any bleeding ?
"No, but something isn't..."
isn't right.
I'm sorry.
Try to make yourself comfortable.
Hang on a second.
Sandy...
"Hang on one second, all right ?"
I'll be right back.
"Excuse me, Doctor."
My wife would never complain.
She would never put her needs in front of anybody else's.
Dear Anna!
"Finally, I've got a nice load back to Berlin and could already be with you the day after tomorrow."
Now it's over!
But...
"As if the Devil were involved, today the car axle broke and now it can take a while again."
Man!
"Well, has she decided yet?"
- She is still here.
"- Well, do you already know how and where?"
Mrs John!
Mrs John!
Mrs John!
...Here...
"Watch out, you'll marvel at what I've prepared for you here."
"Mrs John...please, Mrs John."
But I cannot...here...
- have my child all alone.
Mrs John..
"- But Pauline, be quite calm."
What is going to happen?
I've everything ready here...
At the pharmacy they asked me if I intended to set up a hospital.
You just watch how cosy I'll make it for you...
But Mrs John...please...
I cannot have my child...here...
"All by myself, Mrs John..."
"But I'll be with you, Pauline."
"I and Bruno... and he'll watch over you, day and night."
"Breathe deeply, Pauline!"
Very deep and quiet.
As I read it to you from the book.
That's fine.
"- Hey, what's up?"
"- Oh, hey, come in."
This is Dr. Black.
Tracy and Jacob Myers.
They're very good friends.
- Hello.
Lovely to meet you.
- Hello.
Dr. Black is our star brainiac here at the Cube.
Oh.
"""May the source of strength who blessed the ones before us help us find the courage to make our lives a blessing."""
"So, Jacob's experienced a sudden spiritual conversion."
He's bonkers.
We've always been bad Jews.
I can count on one hand the times we've gone to temple.
All of a sudden...
I'm enlightened.
Beautiful office.
I think we need a full neurological work-up.
I'm happy to help.
Would you like to come to my office?
You can tell me all about it.
- Thank you.
Thank you so much.
- It's okay.
- Oh.
- What are you doing?
- The Myers are philanthropists...
- I'm just standing here.
- You're standing in the hallway.
"- And they've just recently joined the board at the Cube,"
- so make sure they get VIP treatment.
Heck no!
"Well, I thought you might be, asking such personal questions."
- Good night.
- Good night.
"Boss, she's a woman in a million."
- You think so?
- Yeah.
She don't talk.
Oh!
"All right, get on with the dogs."
"No, thank you."
I'll cross the way you men do.
Hold on!
Hold on!
Stick with it.!
Hurry up!
Hurry up!
Don't forget the gun!
Say!
"Nice, modest little prices they have here."
They practically give things away.
"Say, boss, how much we got this side of the grave?"
Just about enough for a room in a poorhouse.
This mansion over here'll do.
Come on.
"- Come on, Buck."
"- Come on, Buck."
"Well, Mrs. Blake, I guess it's about time to say good-bye."
There's an officer of the Mounted Police down the street.
They'll get you back to the States.
"We'd stake you ourselves, only, well, we've mislaid our funds."
"Yeah, yeah."
"âª Go home âª âª Broken bodies line the dance floor Piling on top of me âª âª I tried my luck, now what the fuck To do with the misery?"
âª âª Witness all the mess I will regret âª âª By this time next morning âª âª Broken bodies line the dance floor Piling on top of me âª
âª Broken bodies line the dance floor Piling on top of me âª
Oh.
Um...
What time is it?
I don't know. 10:17?
Are you all right?
Tired.
I didn't sleep.
I have an incredible headache.
You're dehydrated.
- Did I drink last night?
- You don't remember?
"Yeah, you drank."
At... at that bar?
"At the bar, here..."
Here?
Did something hap...
Did I do something?
I don't wanna talk about it.
What...
"Hi, boys!"
"Oh, I gotta run."
I gotta pick up the twins from my mother's and drop them off at daycare because I got the lunch shift today.
"Hope that things work out for you soon,"
- honeybunch.
- Oh.
"Alright, I'll see ya when I see ya."
Bye!
Bye.
"No disturbance, that's an order."
Yan-ling!
Jun-kit!
What happened?
Fung-wu!
Stop!
What's this all about?
They won't let Yan-ling see you.
You must have provoked them!
No!
He said there can be no disturbing the chess game.
Is it true?
It's the Highness's order.
No disturbance from anybody.
Please go to Mr. Chao!
And you two better leave.
You better go back!
Fung-wu!
"Go back, don't cause any trouble!"
Let's go!
I feel something odd will happen tonight.
Now why is chess so mysterious?
It's a game.
You go on ahead.
I'll keep watch here.
Make sure you don't fight!
I won't!
We don't accept anybody as a monk so easily.
I want to acquire the mystery of Shaolin kung-fu.
I'm a sincere Buddhist.
What's wrong with accepting me?
Please calm down!
What?
What's real is the cop we have tied up in the basement.
"When Marius calls, we can let him go."
The cop does not care about us.
- I swear to God...
- How do you know that?
It seems to me... we let him go.
"Best case... prison, my business destroyed, and Family Services takes Amanda."
- No.
- I won't let that happen.
[phone buzzes]
"[buzzing] [door closes, lock latches]"
- Hey.
"- Hey, Pete."
I'm just going out.
Where to?
"I was gonna go, uh, go see my friend..."
"- you know, the married one."
- Yeah.
"Yeah, I thought..."
I thought maybe... you were going out to slash another one of my tires.
Huh?
The liquor store across the street... they have a security camera.
I saw you.
Why?
- [gulp]
"- Fucking why, huh?"
Why?
"Don't you fucking say that it was about this trunk thing because I already apologized to you for that, okay?"
[breathing heavily]
Porta-Potty.
What?
WAS FORCED OUT OF THE DODGERS AT THE END OF THE 1950 SEASON
"AFTER A POWER STRUGGLE WITH CO-OWN ER WALTER O'MALLEY,"
LEAVING JACKIE WITHOUT HIS FRIEND AND DEFENDER.
THE 1951 BROOKLYN DODGERS WERE LOADED WITH ALL-STARS.
"AND AS SPRING TRAINING BEGAN,"
THEY WERE CONFIDENT THAT THEY HAD THE BEST LINEUP IN BASEBALL.
"BY MID-MAY, ROBINSON WAS BATTING OVER .400"
AND THE DODGERS WERE IN FIRST PLACE.
BUT HE WAS STILL A TARGET.
"BEFORE A GAME IN CINCINNATI,"
LETTERS HAD BEEN SENT TO THE REDS AND THE LOCAL NEWSPAPER
CLAIMING THAT JACKIE ROBINSON WOULD BE SHOT
IF HE TOOK THE FIELD.
NEWCOMBE:
"I WON'T USE THE WORDS THAT THEY USED, BUT THEY SAID,"
"""IF YOU SHOW UP TODAY AT CROSLEY FIELD, YOU ARE GOING TO DIE."""
"JACKIE SAID, ""WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?"""
"I SAID, ""WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK?"""
"HE SAID, ""ARE YOU GOING TO THE BALLPARK TODAY?"""
"I SAID, ""ARE YOU GOING?"" HE SAID, ""YES, I'M GOING."""
"I SAID, ""WELL, I'M GOING, TOO."""
VIN SCULLY:
THAT WAS DEADLY SERIOUS.
"THEY HAD F.B.I. MEN THROUGHOUT THE BALLPARK,"
ON THE ROOFTOPS.
AND THEY HAD A MEETING BEFORE THE GAME.
IT WAS PRETTY TENSE.
AND IT GOT PRETTY QUIET.
AND WHAT...
WHAT DO WE SAY?
"GENE HERMANSKI, KIND OF A KIDDER, SAID,"
"""HEY, SKIPPER, I GOT AN IDEA."
"-Listen, I'm sorry I hung you with that."
"-No, forget about it."
"Actually, this one witness, Fuentes..."
"... webothfeltthathehadmoreto say,  you know..."
... likehewasembarrassed in front of his wife.
-Martinez is calling him up.
KELLY:
Wait a minute.
Fuentes. I interviewed the guy.
He seemed okay.
-Yeah?
It's probably nothing.
"-Well, let me know, okay?"
"Yeah, sure."
"Mr. Fuentes, it's Detective Martinez."
My partner and I got the impression maybe something was bothering you...
... maybeyoufeltuncomfortable talking about it.
"We thought you might want to come in and talk, like, private, man-to-man."
"Okay, good."
"You work nights, right?"
"Well, how about tomorrow morning?"
Great.
"All right, just ask for Detective Martinez or Medavoy."
Beautiful.
He's coming in.
You think Roberts offed her?
He's an asshole.
We know that.
Whether he committed a murder?
We'll get the toxicology.
We'll find out.
Big night?
Philip.
I hope that wasn't too bad.
It's always bad.
There's just degrees of bad.
"Oh, hey."
How's it going?
Mmh... good.
We met before.
Er...
I don't think we have.
You sure about that?
Um...
I wanted to tell you I really liked your book.
"Those advance copies really get around, huh?"
"Anyway, the first one's better."
"Um, I haven't read it."
I'm not some weird groupie or anything.
"No, if you were a groupie, you likely would have read both my books."
Are there book groupies?
Author groupies?
"Not many, but yeah."
Hey!
(WHISTLES) Quick thought I just had.
I'm not doing any press for the book at all.
"Readings, interviews."
Nothing.
- You cannot be serious.
"- Oh, quite."
"That's a horrible, horrible idea."
I don't like the idea of being on display.
My mind is made up.
I wanna be left alone.
Maddy!
"I can't believe you are doing this, Maddy!"
I didn't bring you here so you could catch it.
"Shannon, relax."
This is for our safety.
You said The Beast is killing animals.
It could easily turn on us if it isn't contained.
"So, what?"
Then you're going to let it go?
"I'm not in the business of caging wild animals, no matter how unusual."
"We put it in here to get a closer look, that's all."
That's cool with me.
That thing has some serious fangs.
Shan.
OK.
I'm sorry.
It's just... it just got real all of a sudden.
"That's why I'm here, Shannon."
To show the world The Beast is real.
OK?
OK.
They'll kill us.
What are you going to say to them?
I don't know but I don't think sorry's going to cut it.
We could go back.
Do you want to?
Look.
Put it on me.
Tell them I made you do it.
"Thanks, but I'll take the blame."
I've earned it.
It's starting.
He was pretending to be unconscious.
I gave him another injection.
Now he doesn't have to pretend.
He has a weak heart.
You can only give him 30ccs within...
"Listen, we know what we're doing."
Is there anything else?
I've located the woman.
She is at the Robin Masters estate with a man named Magnum.
"- Yes, Mr Masters?"
"- 'Higgins, it's me.'"
How did you get this number?
I had it changed.
"'I was lucky, I guess."
I have a little problem.'
- How perceptive of you.
"- Higgins, I can't get out of the car."
'The car?
You've wrecked the car?
'
"No, I haven't wrecked it."
I just can't get out of it.
- Where are you?
- In the Audi.
The Audi?
"- Very clever, Magnum."
"- 'Just get the dogs, Higgins."
'Get the dogs.'
"Tommy, this is silly of you to bring me to this fancy house."
You wouldn't want me to take you some place sleazy?
That would be more in character.
"- More tea, Mrs Greenberg?"

"Adam, nice to meet you."
All right.
"I'm here to get you home safe, my friend."

Good.
After you.
Thank you very much.
Which way's your car?
My car is right over there.
- When?
"When you do, that's why you never see me."

JOB OPPORTUNITIES FOR WOMEN
These places aren't on the map.
We don't know where they are.
- What's in it for me?
- What do you want?
What size are those?
Size big.
These places are hard to find.
Almost 500 pesetas.
- Five hundred.
- And the smokes.
For the ride.
"I told you, nobody lives there."
It's abandoned.

When has Gertrude ever gotten anything right?
"- I mean, really."
"- Madam, please--"
This girl shows up in rags and doesn't speak.
Not my idea ofa princess.
"If Eric's looking for a girl, I know a couple of... highly available ones right here."
"Oh, Eric, be reasonable."
"Nice young ladiesjust don't swim around rescuing people... in the middle ofthe ocean, and then flitter off into oblivion like some--"
"I'm tellin' ya, Grim."
She was real.
"I'm gonna find that girl, and I'm gonna marry her."
"Come on, honey."
Don't be shy.
"Oh, Eric, isn't she a vision?"
"Uh, you look wonderful."
"Come, come, come."
You must be famished.
"Let me help you, my dear."
There-
"- Oh, there we go."
"Eh, that's better."
"Now, quite comfy, hmm?"
"Ha, ha."
Good.
"It's, uh--"
Hissisterdoes notknowb.kbi.
- Are you sure?
-therearechurchesallovertheworld.
- Each almost have to find him.
- Look.
I guess I'll have to look at care of the little girl.
"- Jade is right, but I can handle it."
- I got it.
I'm coming there.
- Why?
Do not have to do.
And you hate Toronto Would.
"- This is officially a mess, and I will brush."
Now we have a plane to catch.
- I say kidnapped a girl.
- I missed my house.
They knew how to be there?
.
- I can not trust anyone.
- You can trust me.
- Is this correct?
"Mike gave your name, Father."
I knew how good?
- She did not know.
- I listened to confession?
"Even if you listened, you paylaşamazdım, you know."
"- I have no time to play the game, Father."
"- Admission of never listen, but there was a burden on seemed."
- I never said anything about the people we do business?
- No.
- What?
- What is it?
"Okay, what's going on Marta?"
Know what I think?
I think you set me up.
I think this amnesia is bullshit.
"No, no."
"Oh, fuck me."
What?
"You're gonna tell me, you don't know who this is?"
Who is it?
"It's Jared, damn you."
"Paolo and Yale are dead, Marta."
Why?
I don't know.
"Alright, I don't remember anything, I swear."
Is Jared a victim too or is he in on this?
"Yeah, um, I'm getting out of here."
What're you gonna do?
It's Kyra.
I told you to turn off your cell phone.
What have you gotten us into?
Why are you calling here?
Because I told her to.
You know she was packing to leave when we got here.
"Oh, I haven't spoken to you since Berlin, partner."
"What do you want, Jared?"
"Oh, come on."
You're a smart guy.
"You've spoken to Marta, you found my place."
You must have figured it out by now.
Numbers to the Swiss bank account.
There ya go.
This can't be agency sanctioned.
"- All right, let's get goin'."
"- Hold on, hold on, hold on, Big Bob..."
I got to ask you a question before this all goes down.
- All the guards in Guantánamo are gay?
"- Fuck, no!"
Ain't nothing gay about getting your dick sucked!
You're the ones that's gay for sucking' my dick!
- What?
- In fact... creeps me out just bein' around you fags.
- But--
- All right.
- Wait--
- Get down on your knees...
- and open your mouths.
"- Please, Big Bob."
Why don't you just kick our ass instead?
- Get on your fucking knees!
- All right.
All right.
"- All right, all right, all right, all right."
"- You go first, dude."
"Jesus, Kumar."
I hate you so much!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
"God, his dick smells like shit, dude."
Holy shit!
- What the hell happened?
- That terrorist fuck bit my dick!
- Come on.
"- Wait, wait, wait, wait a second!"
Should we?
just... here. look.
[sighs] here. put this on.
- geez. [sighs]
- come on.

"[gun pops, thud, baby coos]"
- decorating.
- [sniffs] [gun cocks]
"- nice shot, little man!"
- [laughs]
"- so sorry about the mess, but we were not expecting company."
"- amanda jones, department of children and family services."
quite a place you have here.
do you mind if i look around?
"- oh, absolutely not."
"please, mrs. jones, have a look-see."
[dogs barking in distance]
- yep.
that right there is pure gold.
that's a real lock of constantine's hair -- the lead singer.
god rest his soul.
"yeah, i probably would've sold you one night, harley, just to be with him, hmm?"
why is she jotting that down?
- [sighs]
- where are you going?
- to talk with tim in town.
- what?
now?
"- yeah, i promised uncle bob."
- i'll drive you.
It's very pretty.
It's a gift.
"Don't be surprised, it's nothing special."
You want to reorganize the factory.
It will only be possible... if you're in charge.
Put it in the other room.
A bit further behind.
Djénéba!
We have to see each other less frequently.
Why?
I'm not afraid of gossip.
People stick their noses into other people's business.
Do you mean my husband?
Of course.
You'll regret... the day when... he catches you.
There's nothing to be worried about.
Sure there is!
He's already been divorced four times.
"Right now he loves you, make the best of it."
Enough.
I know what I want.
Don't get angry.
Let's change the subject.
What are you doing on Thursday?
I don't know yet.
What's your plan?
Come over by my house.
I won't be able to.
Sing to Fakoli!
Praise his majesty!
Fakoli's worthy descendant.
Great Griot!
- And the plane wasn't even full.
- See?
How far will that get you?
You can't even take your mistress on a weekend trip.
Nothing.
"All right, fine."
"But tomorrow morning, these people are going to be in my office."
- What do you want me to tell them?
- Send them to me.
I'll explain everything.
"They'll understand, don't worry."
Anything else?
Your appointment is here.
Who is this guy?
Remind me.
Joseph Kay.
Heads up a department at St. Louis.
- I'm not sure what he wants.
- Heads up a department?
Something like that.
"""Something like that."""
"""I'm not sure what he wants."""
What's that supposed to mean?
Why send him to me?
- You were recommended.
- By who?
- Who upstairs?
- Ross.
I see.
- Your daughter called.
"- Oh, yeah?"
She left you messages at home and...
It's already there?
Let me ask you one thing.
What is your true form?
What do you think is my true form?
The devil.
You're the devil.
Why can't you answer?
You've already said it.
I'm the devil.
Shaman
I'm almost there.
Where are you?
Are you home?
I'm with the woman now.
You mustn't let her tempt you.
Never.
"Whatever she tells you, you must go to your daughter now."
Do you understand me?
Understand?
Do you?
Is that your shaman?
Don't believe what he tells you.
They're in on it together.
Isn't that right?
You're already certain I'm the devil.
That's why you came here... carrying that sickle.
"My words, whatever I say- they won't change your mind."
No.
That's not true.
There's no doubt.
You came here to confirm your suspicions about me.
That's not true!
I need to...
I don't...
I've got...
I need to go...
Out of my way!
It's a panic attack.
That's all.
What?
It sounds like you're having a panic attack.
"I can't breathe, I can't..."
Maybe it's because you wanna fuck your sister.
What?
Do you want to fuck your sister?
No!
Jesus!
It's just people say panic attacks come from some deeply repressed sexual urges.
You know?
What?
"I was just testing a theory, see."
"Actually, I'm talking shit, cos it turns out a panic attack's just a fuckload of adrenaline mainlining into your heart."
It's just how we deal with danger.
"Fight or flight, they call it."
Right?
I don't know you.
"Are you a fighter or a flighter, Tony Stonem?"
Cos depending on your answer... well...
A lot depends on your answer.
I'll see you around.
"Hi, Effy."
How are you?
I'm fine.
How are you?
There isn't going to be a place to live.
There isn't gonna be a honeymoon...
... becausethereisn't gonna be a wedding.
Okay.
And one other thing.
No little girl of mine is gonna be named Eudora.
[WOMEN gasping AND giggling ]
vin:
I figure it's been a while since you boys were in Texas.
YATES:
That right?
Yeah.
Texas is thataway.
Just shut up and ride.
EZRA:
"Here we go, gentlemen."
Here you go.
"Hey, I need me another drink over here."
I was not made for honest labor.
Inez:
Then let me do it.
Do what?
Tend your bar.
And clean and make repairs.
Until you and I really get the place going.
By then you'll make me your partner.
"Listen, señorita."
"Uh, I am not looking for a partner."
And you certainly cannot tend bar here.
And you can?
You see that gentlemen at the end of the bar?
He'd eat you like half a sandwich.
She's smart.
I was a little protective of her when we first got here.
I just wasn't sure how she was gonna deal with your scene.
I think she's dealing just fine with my scene.
I think she likes it.
"Obviously, she's getting stoned with you..."
-...and she's reading Spin.
-I don't read Spin.
I've never read Spin.
She found her own way into the studio.
It had nothing to do with me.
Yeah.
"It's always like that with you, isn't it?"
They....
They always just happen to find their way in.
What's that supposed to mean?
"It means you're charmed, that's all."
Someone's looking out for you.
Nobody's looking out for you?
I'm sorry.
Come on.
Your life looks good from my perspective.
-I've worked for what I have.
-And I haven't?
-You are so stuck on the negative.
-I'm not.
"Yes, you are."
-You've blocked out all the fun we had.
-I haven't blocked it out.
It's all filed.
What about the trip to Veracruz?
Yeah.
I do.
Nicole?
Nicole!
Nicole...
"- This better be good, Conner."
- I have a heart failure patient.
"- You've seen my face, right?"
- I'm sorry?
Beauty rest.
"It's the only shot I got, Conner."
She had a loss and she...
She just collapsed.
"Short of breath, complaining of pain in her chest."
"STAT echocardiogram suggests acute heart failure, ejection fraction is 20 per cent."
"Oh, and I got your email about Dallas."
"- They sucked you in, did they?"
- Looks like it.
"- This patient, she's..."
"- Yeah, look:"
"you and Peter Cutler, you're doomed, Conner."
And then where will you be?
"You'll be in Dallas, surrounded by strange,"
Dallas-like people who don't understand you.
"Sir, the patient is an EMT and her wife died"
- and now I think she's had a heart attack.
- An EMT?
- Nicole Foster.
- Book an angiogram.
I'll be right there.
"Mel, we need to talk."
Are we OK?
"Actually, I'm not so sure."
"- I mean, it's not good for clothes."
- It's just cheese.
- It's wax.
"It's, like, balled up wax."
"- Oh, the wax."
- I love the happiness of that moment.
- Yeah.
- Look at Jonny's face.
- Yeah.
- John Cho.
- Holla back.
- I love that shirt.
"- I bought that from the wardrobe sale and gave it to Eddie, a.k.a. Jesus Christ."
"- Oh, really?"
You did?
- Yeah.
The hype man knows what you want but he's not sure if you want it enough.
Do you really want it?
Do you really want it?
This was funny.
"So you just randomly picked this extra to be, like, the guy who loves the band, right?"
I didn't even pick him.
"Our AD, Christo, picked him."
"He said, ""You okay with this guy being the fan of the band?"" I said, ""Yeah."""
- Then the backflip.
"- All of a sudden, he can do a backflip and no one knows it."
Right.
"And it was just something he just did, right on a whim?"
"He said, ""Can I dance?"
"Can I do whatever I want?"" I said yes."
- Look at this.
- And then he threw in the backflip.
"- Ben, don't."
"I know you. 0nce you get worked up, you start a fight."
Will you come to the market with us tomorrow?
"As a matter of fact, Louis Bernard, the big buyer from Paris, was going to take us to the marketplace tomorrow."
- Yeah. I think I'll cancel out.
- Sit down and eat your dinner.
- We
- We'd love to go.
"- 0h, we'd be delighted."
I don't know why he gets so worked up over unimportant things.
"(Exclaims In French) Non, Monsieur!"
Monsieur.
(Speaking French)
(People Chattering)
"(Drumming, Chanting) # Ho!"
Ho!
Ho!
"# Ho, ho, ho, ho!"
(Yells)
(Speaking Arabic Language)
"What's he saying, Mrs Drayton?"
"He's the teller of tales, Hank."
Isn't this exciting?
Just like the county fair when I was a kid.
They got everything but the balloon ascension.
(Chuckling)
What's so funny?
Did you ever see a balloon ascension?
I was thinking.
You know what's paying for these three days in Marakesh?
- Me.
- Mrs Campbell's gallstones.
You accuse me of stealing them!
?
I didn't say that!
"Do you mean me, then!"
?
"I didn't say that, either!"
"I'll fix you, if you call me a thief!"
"I won't let you off, either!"
What are you doing?
Beat you for calling us thieves!
Don't run!
Stop!
You again!
?
"Fate brings us together, from however far I bet your 109,200 miles are right here!"
Right beside your Nanking's 18 mounds!
Oh no-here comes Mr. Ugly!
A basket of grapes isn't worth this!
Two heads think better than one
Let's talk this thing over!
"Yes, we walk on two legs"
We can't let a quadruped best us!
The loser will lead the dog away
Tiger!
Snake!
Dragon!
Mantis!
Crane!
My crane will eat your mantis!
"If a man's unlucky, he'll see ghosts in the sun?"
Pick a little more!
Can I ask your name!
"-Oh shit, we gotta go."
-Wow!
The mother lode.
- I think you're right.
"No, wait, wait, wait."
Go back.
Jaelen.
Is this her?
-It is.
-Who is she?
- A young woman Jaelen had the good taste to fall in love with.
"- You do have a good taste, my friend."
-She's being held at the Dulce Base.
I'm quite sure her friends and family would be interested to know that.
- How soon would you be able to upload?
-Right now.
-Where are the files going into?
-To an old compadre of mine.
- They'll upload to sixty [ indistinct] globally.
The initial launch should reach about 6 million people.
What's ETA?
-Just under four hours.
- By morning the flood gates will be open.
35.39 degrees north.
And 106 .54 degrees west.
- Southwest corner of the Haines Canyon Reservoir.
-Remember.
Sun fall.
You'll give them the Purean.
"And Robert, you can go with them."
"- Like you, Jaelen, there are people that I can't leave behind."
Not with what's coming.
This is the Jordan family estate?
Wasn't no Jordan family nothin'.
This is where I was in foster care.
Oh.
Sorry.
Me and two other dudes and a girl with messed-up fingers.
I'm so lucky I got out of here.
"It's not luck, I mean..."
"You got out of here because you're very talented, and... people love you, and..."
Are you peeing?
Where's Donaghy?
I wanna talk to him right now.
"Last time I saw him, he was riding a crane camera."
"Oh, I have Pete for you."
"Pete, oh, my God."
I didn't know.
"No, hey, listen."
It'll--it'll give me a chance to spend more time with my kids.
I'm quitting.
I'm quitting right now.
"No, no, no, no, no."
You have the best job in New York.
Don't quit over this.
Don't buy all the hot dogs.
Okay?
I don't want to do this without you.
"Hey, I thought we cut the Cat Lady sketch."
We're two minutes short!
"So, let me introduce myself."
My name is Lurleen Katz.
And these are my cats.
She's using a real cat?
I'm already dead.
I got nothing else to live for.
"[Hotch] Tracy, you need to tell him."
Tell me what?
What the hell's going on here?
He needs to know.
"Kaman, while you were in a coma,"
I found out I was pregnant.
Oh...
I didn't know what to do.
I thought you were gonna die.
"Oh, baby, I'm so sorry."
You're telling me... that's my son?
"[Hotch] Kaman, you don't want to do this in front of your son."
Put it down.
"Baby, if you don't do it for me, do it for him."
Don't you want to know his name?
What's your name?
Daniel Kaman Anderson.
"[Hotch] Thomas Kemp wrote,"
"""Love feels no burden,"
"""thinks nothing of its trouble,"
"""attempts what is above its strength,"
"""pleads no excuse for impossibility,"
"""for it thinks all things are lawful for itself and all things are possible. """
"[Jack] Dad, don't look at me."
I'm not looking.
Are you almost ready?
- Yes.
- You need any help?
- No.
- Okay.
It's Dad's receipt books.
You found Dad's stinginess collection.
I thought Morn threw out that crap.
Aren't you starving?
Are you telling me he wrote down all his expenses?
It's from when he used to wake us up with a whistle.
"""Dad's inspection."""
Cheapskate.
"On July 12, 1980 you ate a Popsicle, Dorona-."
"Look. ""Popeye Popsicle for Dorona, 40 agorot."""
What's a Popeye Popsicle?
I'm glad you've calmed down.
You had me worried with your freak-out-.
What?
You look nice in those undies.
Surprising.
Did you think I sleep in a suit?
You have a cute ass.
- God help you with that sinful talk...
- Why sinful?
Maybe we don't have the same father?
"Who knows, maybe we have a different mother."
Maybe you came out of thin air like Jesus.
"But if I had to choose, I prefer you."
"You're sexier than him, too bad you're gay."
Look.
He stopped keeping track 6 months after I was born.
So what?
Why did he stop?
Did he stop spending?
Maybe he was fed up-
- Right-I was born and he got fed up-.
You folks will be seated right here in passenger car one with the big grapes.
And I'm gonna take these little raisins back to the end of the vine.
"- Bye, Mom."
- Bye!
Whoa!
It's the biggest chocolate fountain on a train in North and South America.
The world's biggest is in Guatemala.
I did not know chocolate came from fountains.
I want to put my head in it.
And my feet.
"Ethan, thank you very much for the guided tour."
"Uh, looks like we'll be setting up shop here for the day."
For your troubles.
"Uh-uh, no-no-no-no-no, no-no-no... no."
"Oh, here you go, one more for you."
"Uh, kids... no."
I'm sorry.
"Okay, one more for you."
Oh.
"Ye... actually, uh..."
"Thank you, Ethan."
if you could put that down.
"Kids aren't allowed anywhere near the buffet, or the passenger cars."
But you are absolutely welcome to...
the Juice Caboose!
"Ugh, what a dump."
"Hey, there's someone there."
Regular Sized Rudy?
"Louise, Gene, Tina..."
what are you doing here?
"Hold on, Beanbag, I'll be right back."
I know these guys from school.
"–Hey, hey!"
Everything all right?
Yeah.
Just a little spring cleaning.
Let's ride.
I thought this was about I.D'ing somebody.
"Actually, we're more interested in the kidnapping charge... that was filed against you in 1993."
That was a misunderstanding.
"–You were 35 at the time, right?"
–Correct.
–And your girlfriend was in high school?
–She was 18.
And you took her away on vacation for two weeks and never told her parents.
I know.
"In hindsight, it was just a bad judgment call."
But Amanda was an adult.
You're 17 years older than Marcy too.
"You like 'em young, Bob?"
Yeah.
They just...
feel right.
Did Kayla feel right?
I wouldn't know.
–I know how you feel.
–Excuse me?
What'd your partner do?
He's not backing me up on the shooting.
–If that guy costs me a promotion...
–He's not backing you up?
–After all I've covered for him.
–You covered for him?
–What did he do?
We just got back from the Balkans.
What was the artifact you found?
A metal box.
An Ark.
The Ark of Solon?
Atticus thinks so.
But that's incredible.
The Ark of Solon is like the Loch Ness Monster of archaeology.
People think it's a legend.
Isn't it supposed to hold the Torch of Truth from Atlantis?
Don't know.
We haven't opened it yet.
This came off a scratch on the side.
"Can you analyze it for me, please?"
Sure.
I'll run some tests in the lab.
Thanks.
Would you like to carry my books?
"Yeah, sure."
What a madhouse.
How do you stand the noise?
This is the rush hour.
You should be here when it's really quiet.
It's enough to drive you batty.
Kelly!
I'm so sorry I missed your lecture.
It's impossible London traffic.
"Hello, Simon."
"Oh, do you remember--?"
MacGyver.
Professor Carson.
"You were at Thera with that buffoon, Atticus."
Did you send Gallow for Dr. Mead?
[Ursula]:
"Yes, I suggested he came straight to the house."
Good.
Good heavens!
What's going on here?
"Dorcas, we have a visitor."
Is the spare room ready?
"- I'll do it, Miss Janet."
"- This way, Mr. Pendered."
We have to go straight up the stairs.
[Bird chirping]
You can get out for a start.
I was talking to the magpie.
- You should've been more polite.
"- Oh, get on with it."
He's decent.
You can come in now.
He's obviously exhausted.
That ankle's gonna take some time.
"Doesn't have much to say for himself, does he?"
Perhaps he doesn't understand.
He doesn't look English.
"Yes, well, leave him to sleep."
I'll take a look in the morning.
I'll see myself out.
"- Thank you, Doctor."
Don't keep building up that fire.
"If he doesn't have a fever now, he soon will have."
We'd better leave him.
There's nothing we can do for the moment.
[Door opening]
What task?
"Come to Wu Yen Road,"
You'll see a black car 9413.
On Friday thirteenth?
Just get into the car and I'll tell you what to do.
"Remember: better come early than late, late than never."
Right way!
"Not now, tonight!"
Tonight?
Then what shall I do now?
I even sent my secretary away!
Find something to do to kill time.
I haven't taken my milk yet.
Nuisance really!
Taxi...!
Shut up!
What the hell are you yelling about?
Damn you!
Shit!
"You think this is a night market, shut up!"
"Get lost, or I'll call the police."
Damn you!
"- Hi, Hitler!"
"- Hurry up, go!"
Go to the front!
Don't turn around!
There's match inside the drawer.
"Listen, a Jew has taken a ""Beast"" to H.K. from Europe."
To be handed to an American.
Your task is to help him find the American.
What does he look like?
The Jew will tell you.
You should have pubic hair.
"Oh,please."
The head of the English department has a Prince Albert.
So we says.
"You know,you should try this."
It's actually making me kind of randy.
"It's like all out there,you know?"
"I know,I saw."
Augie is going to lose his mind.
That's great.
Why can't you come with me?
I can't put pants on.
I'm all tender.
- So wear a skirt.
- I'm going to be cold.
Wrap a scarf around it.
I think tonight I'm going to consist of S'mores and marathon sex with a grateful boyfriend.
"Fine,whatever."
You suck.
Have fun.
"You,too."
So why didn't I ever meet this guy?
Because we spent most of the relationship sitting in his van talking about feelings.
"You know,sometimes I'm out and I look around at all the men and it makes me want to go home and,like,knit Marty blanket or something."
"Go,Johnny!"
"Whoa,crybaby's a little badass."
Bitch!
Bitch!
Bitch!
Bitch!
Bitch!
Bitch!
- It's giving me a cough.
- It is not giving you a cough.
It's lovely.
"Come on, catch up!"
- Over there is a field of rabbits.
- I don't want to see rabbits.
- Is anything superior to this?
- I told you it would rain.
- Blue sky!
Let us chase it!
- I'm not supposed to run.
Are you hurt?
- I cannot walk.
Run and fetch help.
- I will run as fast as I can.
Margaret!
Don't be afraid.
He's quite safe.
- Are you hurt?
- Only my ankle.
May I have your permission to ascertain if there are any breaks?
It is not broken.
Can you put your arm about my neck?
Allow me to escort you home.
At last!
She fell down and he's carrying her!
"Marianne, are you hurt?"
It's a twisted ankle.
It's not serious.
I felt the bone.
And it's sound.
- I cannot begin to thank you.
Not so soon.
How about tomorrow?
Let me tell you something.
"No need, just drop me a line."
Some chick is crazy about me.
I'm irresistible!
That's a good joke.
"Very funny indeed, good night!"
You are jealous.
"Guess, who's come to find me?"
The boss's fiancee
B.?
"How dare you call her B., only I can."
She calls me Robin darling too!
Robin darling?
Are you kidding?
"She's so sexy, she even tried to seduce me."
Tore everything off to rush and take a shower...
You mean her?
Me of course!
But she told me to do so.
Do you get it?
But it's very clear what she wanted to do.
Why is she lying on your bed?
I haven't done anything yet!
How dare you steal my first girlfriend?
I didn't.
Don't deny it.
This is the end of our friendship!
Did you go and visit him?
Yes I did!
Did you tell him to take a shower?
Teach school.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- What were you going to ask me?
- That.
- What?
- What you do.
I teach school.
School teacher?
What was it like out in Indian territory?
Lonely as hell.
- What did you do out in the West?
- Cowboy.
What do you do for Mr. Coble?
Cowboy.
"Joe, I think we've found our man."
Not anything in Brown's Hole I couldn't take care of.
"Well, I think Horn's reputation... might be as effective as his Winchester is here."
I have quite a good reputation myself.
It always seems to precede me.
"I know that, Joe, but... your political ambitions are gonna fit right in with our future plans."
"Now, we don't wanna forget that, do we?"
"And, besides... there won't be no chocolate cake for Horn up there at Brown's Hole."
- Where are you from originally?
- Hawaii.
Hawaii?
"Yeah, Hawaii."
Did you live in one of those grass huts?
In a hotel.
- They have those there?
- Sure they do.
Sure come a long way to teach school in Wyoming.
Romeo.
"Oh, no."
"Thus, with a kiss, I die."
No.
No.
No.
"Oh, no."
"Oh, no."
So pale?
My best beloved husband lies here dead.
Not Romeo.
My child.
Not him of all.
"Oh, what unkind hour has brought to pass this miserable deed."
"Alas, my lady, we are overturned."
No.
A greater power than we can contradict has thwarted all our plans.
"Come away from death, contagion and unnatural sleep."
Leaving my husband to face this alone?
The watchman.
"My lady, come away."
Unkind!
To drink it all and leave no drop so I could follow after.
"Nay, good my lady."
Listen now and come.
I will hide you in a sisterhood of nuns.
"Stop, stop, not to question why."
- We must away.
- You go.
I must bid farewell to Romeo.
"Stay then, until you are at peace."
But linger not.
I'm going.
Dylan?
"Beka, tell me you are not onandromeda."
I am not onandromeda.
Except i am.
I'm looking for spare parts.
Am i missing anything?
We've been boarded.
Make your way to my quarters.
We'll take back the ship.
"So lock ourselves in and fly to where, exactly?"
"One step at a time, beka."
"Rhade, beka is on deck 41."
We're going to meet at my quarters.
"Beka's back on board, huh?"
"Well, not working out"
"As the greatest plan you ever devised, is it?"
"If you've got a better one, i'd like to hear it."
"See what i mean, rhade?"
Rhade?
They've kept us alive.
Merciful and incompetent.
Really?
Is now the time for insults?
I always wanted you two to bow down before me.
"Hey, guys, what's up?"
Take them away.
There's a class b asteroid
In the abbott belt.
It's hollow.
You don't say.
It is a tesseract generator.
- Not this one.
Never got their zoning approved by the city.
Still an old warehouse.

They're coming up to the diversion point now.
Zoom in on the tracker.

Follow vehicle down.
Follow vehicle is down.
Something's not right here.
"- Go, Dave and I will cover Mejia."
- Let's go.
You okay?
Yeah.
Is anybody hurt?
- What the hell happened?
- I don't know.
The steering locked up.
The thing veered off the road.
- Can you get it started?
"- No, it's shut down."
It's not going anywhere.
I'm calling Martello.
"Uh, we're on radio silence"
"He's right, we don't want to give away our position."
I think you really need to talk to him.
Just to play it safe.
Jenkins.
Let me handle Martello.
You come with me.
"The rest of you, stay here, and wait for a recovery vehicle."
Would you like some tea?
Thank you
"Oh, no thank you."
- Would you like some?
- No.
"Are you sure, it's very good!"
I said no.
Maybe some biscuits?
I baked them myself.
Gate away from me!
Ronon!
It's alright.
It's OK.
"They hate me, don't they father?"
No...
They just don't know you.
Was that really necessary?
"You can dress her up and teach her table manners, but it's not gonna change who she is."
"Teyla, this is Sheppard."
Come in.
"Go ahead, Colonel."
Is Ellia still in the cave?
Yes.
Has she been there the whole time?
"Yes, why?"
I just found another victim.
"Apparently, he's only been missing a couple of hours, which means she couldn't have done it."
Looks as though Zaddik may have been telling the truth after all.
We must defend ourselves!
Colonel Sheppard.
Is there any progress with this hunt?
We're working on it.
- What are you two up to?
"Nothing, God, don't be such a paranoid freak."
"Party time, princess."
It's time for us to say goodbye.
Like hell.
"We made a deal, Karp."
- Liana's coming.
- She's... she's coming here?
It's a family reunion.
And I'm off to one of my own.
"Farewell, my sweet."
Your generosity will not be forgotten.
It was just an accident.
Motorcycles don't have seat belts.
You could have died.
"If you had died, I'd be alone."
"You wouldn't be Flynn, you'd just be dead."
"Emme, I said I'm sorry."
What else do you want me to say?
Huh?
"He's fine, he's fine, he's fine, he's fine."
"How are you holding up, Emme?"
Holding what up?
How are you doing with Flynn being hurt?
I'm fine.
He's not going to die.
Did my counselor leave?
"She'll be here in a few minutes, take you back home."
You mean school.
This is my home.
"Yeah, of course it is."
I'm gonna go look for Haydn.
Been trying to get those two together for a year.
"I did it, and now I'm like a dog off his leash."
"Okay, Dad."
"And let me tell you, I didn't waste any time."
I'm on the Tinder.
"Oh, okay, well, it sounds like you're good."
I'm banging my balls off!
"Medium rare, medium rare."
I want that burger medium rare.
Are you at the OTB?
"Yes, I am."
And you'll never believe what horse is running today...
Daddy's revenge.
How perfect is that?
"I got big money on this one, kid."
They're off!
"Go, go, you son of a bitch, run!"
"Spike him, spike him, you miserable little munchkin."
Hit him!
Hit him like you're wearing big boy pants!
That's it!
"Oh, faster, faster!"
"Santa needs you back at the village, yes!"
"Go, you son of a bitch, go!"
Yes!
Winner!
Revenge!
"Oh, ah, shit."
Dad?
"Oh, shit."
"Hey, Frank, it's me, Smolinski."
"Yeah, I don't know how comas work, but if you can hear me, screw you and wake up, you big shit."
My father gave us that.
This is yours.
Remember this?
"Oh, no."
Can we just do this without any theatrics?
Please.
- We should have some kind of ceremony.
- What?
"You know, with the boys."
Some kind ofthing so they don't forget we were once-
What are you doing?
Richard?
Leave them alone.
- Do I look well to you guys?
- You should be in here packing.
"Objectively speaking, if you weren't my children... would you think, that guy looks okay?"
He looks like a guy who might have a wife and kids and stuff?
- Are you mad at us?
"- Yeah, totally."
I think you look good.
"Okay, good."
"Space, space, dash."
Is that a Bengal tiger?
I don't know.
"Space, space, space."
Dash.
"And in the dark of the night, and it does get dark... when I call a name-"
When I call a name.
It'll be your name.
What's your name?
Nevermind.
Let's go.
"Yeah, it's Ollie and Danny."
All right.
Never mind his eyes.
What about an airway?
Is he breathing?
"Do you copy, Ollie?"
What else have you got?
Is he conscious?
I don't know what to say.
"His eyes are open, but..."
"It's not the same thing, Ollie."
"Yeah, sorry about that, Kingdom."
We've got a multi-trauma.
Major head injuries.
"He's breathing, dazed, but conscious, probably shocky."
"Minimally responsive, compound fractures to the ribs, both tibia."
Fracture to both ankles.
Looks like his pelvis is fractured as well.
But it's hard to tell.
We've got multiple head injuries.
"BP is 78 over 44, it's going down."
"Respiration is, I'm going to say, 32."
- He's tachy.
- Heartbeat clocking 140.
Make that 150.
"All right, get a line in him, Danny."
Colour?
Saturation?
"His eyes are open and he's still looking around, but..."
There's Ollie the ophthalmologist with more eye data.
Got the line?
Line's in.
Move!
"Sasaoka-sama, open the door, please open the door!"
"Yoshikuni-sama, Yoshikuni-sama!"
Yoshikuni!
Yoshikuni!
Yoshikuni!
Yoshikuni!
You are always looking at me with those eyes... those eyes!
Treating me as a fool!
You will eventually end up in hell anyway!
Yoshikuni!
"Kayo, I'm coming now!"
You are supposed to be protecting me.
Old... mas...ter...
The way people think and the way demons think are different...
I beg of you...
I beg of you!
"I beg of you, I beg of you, I beg of you, I beg of you!"
Think of something!
"Odajima-sama's request, together with this..."
I am left with no other choice.
"Come forth, the Makoto and the Kotowari is known!"
The sword... shall be unsheathed!
What!
This... you let me see this?
You deserve it!
It is best that everyone dies!
"Good, good... cat... you are a good boy..."
No!
Save me!
This is the past.
"Please show us everything, until the end."
"Mom, mommy, I've found Daddy!"
"Dad, we've been looking for you."
Look at the stones I've gathered!
"Igor, what is this?"
You've spent two hours in the cold wind with your bronchitis!
But I finished my sketch.
Now I know what my new painting will look like.
You're like a child.
Let's go home.
Farewell!
I hope you'll overcome your fears.
Are you talking to yourself again?
Anya?
Anya?
Anechka?
Show me your sketch.
It's nothing special.
It's beautiful.
"Hello, partner!"
How was Paris?
- Any problems?
-The entrance is closed.
"It must be opened, then."
It's not possible.
We're waiting for a government delegation
But we're running late!
I'll see to that now.
What are you doing?
You!
I told you we're running late.
We have a charter flight!
You can lose your driver's license for that!
How long has he been down there?
Not long enough!
Adam...
The auction is about to start.
Christos hasn't turned up
What an idiot.
What's he playing?
You have to run the auction.
Me?
Yes.
Fuck!
Christos!
Are you serious?
Yes!
You're the oldest.
"It has to be a Clios, naturally."
That's the way things are done.
"This night, this gala might affect the situation of every one of us."
Great.
You haven't seen this before.
I don't tnink so.
This is all very impressive.
That's very kind of you.
A vision!
"Oh, forgive me..."
I had a few things I had to tie up.
"Please, not another word."
"So impressive of you, I thought, to hold such an event so soon after your terrible loss."
"I'm sorry, I hope that wasn't..."
"No, not at all!"
You look like you could use a top-up.
Absolutely.
"That's you, Frank."
I'm a wild horse.
That's what makes us such a great team.
- It's so unfair.
- What?
"- It's boring, but I give it my all."
- The idea is for her to get off.
- Why don't you lick the alphabet?
- Why?
So she thinks I'm clever?
Haven't you ever licked the alphabet?
"First you lick an A, then a B, C..."
The variation really turns them on.
Everybody does it.
- You never have?
- Never.
- Nicolaj Kopernikus taught me.
- Does he even know the alphabet?
"He told me he'd gotten complaints, so he'd adopted that technique."
- Thanks.
- Cheers.
- Are we going to the office?
"- Yes, but..."
"One, two..."
I can't drive.
Will you give me a lift?
We have to stop by the home and pick up the Gimp.
- You have to meet the mouth painter.
- Right.
But you're using your hand.
Listen...
"The picture you sold me, you painted with your mouth, right?"
And you went to I.A.?
- Mm-hmm.
- Are you crazy?
Apparently.
I'll take the lead on this.
You jump in if you have a question.
Joe Penn?
Yeah.
We need to talk to you about the complaint you filed.
I already told you guys everything last night.
We're with Internal Affairs.
We conduct our own investigation.
I'm kinda busy.
You wanna retract your statement?
Then tell us what happened.
"I'm drinking a beer, talking to my buds."
"Out of nowhere, this dickmo flies--"
- Which dickmo would that be?
- The big ugly one.
Taggot?
He starts going off on Val.
- Who's Val?
- The bartender.
Taggot was drunk.
How do you know?
- You could tell.
- But how?
Were you sitting next to him?
"Did you buy his drinks, count how many he had?"
"Was he slurring his words, stumbling--"
Why would you assume officer Taggot was drunk?
'Cause Val was trying to cut him off.
- It was like a blow to me when he passed away.
"- Yeah, it was sudden."
It was
- It was terrible.
I never felt that way before.
He always used to say to me...
"""You know, Claire... if it won't be you, it'll never be anybody else."""
- What does that mean?
- He wanted me to marry him.
- Did he ask you?
- Sure.
- So why didn't you?
- So I said I wasn't ready to -
- I wasn't ready to get married.
- What are you waiting for?
I wasn't ready
- It is a lot of things you have to do when you get married.
Like what?
What did you have to do?
Inviting the people.
There's a lot of work involved.
Yeah.
Sure.
I would have helped you.
Max was a wonderful man.
"- He was never married, was he?"
- No.
- I know that.
- No.
- So you would have been his first wife -
- And again he said to me -
"He always said to me, ""Claire, if it won't be you... it'll never be anybody else."""
She ran away.
There is nothing I can do.
She left all her stuff behind.
- Did you hit her?
- Ah whatever.
She's right.
I'm not good enough for her.
- Suddenly.
- Yes.
- I know who she ran away with.
- Who?
Some guy she's known for a while.
They met on the street.
He even gave her a fur.
- A fur?
- Yes.
Yu-lu
Heroes do not shed tears easily...
Only if they are not heart-broken
Who might you be?
Your eyes must be bad
"We met at Kaifeng 3 years ago, Knight Fan!"
May I ask your revered name?
Chang Wu-ch-l've sought you two months
Something I can do for you?
Teach me the 18 falls of the lmmortals
We've been friends-why be enemies?
Come-let's get a drink!
"No, now that I've found you... I want to see which of us is the best"
"Please give me the honor, Knight Fan!"
Come on-let's have a drink first
Your drinking days are about over
"She drank too much, that's all."
"Oh, yeah?"
What about Marseille?
When will you realize nothing's going on...
Too much garlic...
"Let's give her a few days and then, Shai, you go talk to her."
We stressed her out.
You mean I stressed her out?
- I didn't say that.
- Then why did you look at me?
Butt out.
Who asked you?
You're right.
"- Ricky, what are you doing?"
- Going to have some fun.
How did you know my size?
I asked Ricky.
You're tough on him.
"I didn't tell him to come, and you butt out."
Did he cheat on you?
- Did he hit you?
- Are you crazy?
Then what is it?
"You're just like Aunt Rosa, always hiding things."
"That's right, like the adoption thing."
You even hid it from Morn.
Why can't you share?
- None of your business.
- We can help.
How?
You want to be a surrogate mother?
You're such a hypocrite.
"- Let's go make our vision real, dude."
"- Yeah, no, my vision."
"- Yeah, I know, but we're sharing it."
"- Yeah, no."
We're not.
"Get out of here, man."
"Do you even know what friendship is, dude?"
"Does it have anything to do with taking all my money, my drugs, and apparently trying to share my girlfriend?"
- She's not your girlfriend.
- Go.
Get out of here.
"- Go, go."
Get out of here!
"- 'Til next time, Conner."
You need help.
Hey.
"Griff, get out of here!"
Griff!
"- Griff, what..."
"- Natasha, listen to me."
One of the greatest regrets of my life is that you and I...
- No!
"- Natasha, I have so much to tell you."
"- Griff, my boyfriend's upstairs."
- So leave him up there.
- You're high!
- I have important news.
I am no longer clean.
- Listen to me...
"- Griff, I haven't used in months."
You're taking out the recycling in the middle of the night in your pyjamas.
"I mean, what happened?"
She might even die.
How is she?
She went on a hunger strike outside the King's chambers.
She's been out in the cold for four days and nights.
The wretched woman.
She's trying to kill herself.
The King is ignoring her.
Now that Jumong is dead the King doesn't need a hostage.
Why won't he let her go?
He still wants to win her heart.
Your Highness!
Your Highness!
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!
Your Highness...
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!
Your Highness...
Your Highness.
"Hurry up, take her to her chamber."
"Yes, sir."
"Your Highness, I'm here."
How do you feel?
You've gained consciousness but you'll die if you don't take this.
Please drink some.
I'm ready to die.
I have nothing to fear.
You're dismissed.
I have something to tell you.
I'm the assassin Prince Daeso sent to Jolbon.
I told Prince Daeso that I'd killed the Commander... but he's not dead.
Is Jumong really alive?
Even afterworking hard all day..
"..even after starving, I collected only 900 rupees."
I cant understand what to do.
"Brother, this is Mumbai city."
"If you lose hope so soon, then.."
..you wont be able to do anything.
Then what else should I do?
"How can a man, who earns just 50 or 100 rupees.."
"..a day, pay back sirs Ioan worth lakhs of rupees?"
"If your intentions are good, then you can do anything."
No!
"To earn money, a man needs to be smart.."
..cunning and educated.
"And I am an illiterate, a duffer, foolish."
What can I do?
Everything will be alright.
God is there.
hell make everything alright.
Oh God!
Make me worth getting sirs old days back!
"65, 1, 1."
Take one..
-Action!
Yes.
I am a criminal.
And this dark world of crime..
Cut it.
- Im sorry.
"Make-up, come here."
Take two..
-Action!
Yes!
There's nothing edible in here.
"So, do you want..."
Where's Angela?
She left early.
"She must of had her reasons, or whatever."
"Well, do you want me to bring you to the hospital..."
- or do you just want to go to school?
"- Well, I... lt's whatever you want, sweetie."
Your mom says that it's up to you.
I guess...
I guess school.
"You rescheduled with Rosenfeld, right?"
And you've got the estimates?
Right?
I got them.
Yes.
Hey?
"Who's in there, what happened?"
Nothing happened.
I'm fine.
- Stop looking at me.
- Stop looking at me.
What are you doing here anyway?
- You are playing this all wrong.
- What are you talking about?
Please.
"Your dad's seriously sick, right?"
You shouldn't even be here.
"People are feeling sorry for you, right?"
- Use it.
Take advantage.
"- You're saying... I'm saying, you have a personal tragedy with a loved one."
"Whatever you need, Mom."
Whatever you need.
Hey.
How was the pier?
"Okay, I'm not being funny, but there was literally one shop."
Are you serious?
"- I know, right?"
- Yeah.
There are more shops than that... in jail.
"Well, I'm sure you found a way to have fun."
Did Mom seem weird to you?
"Um, not more than usual, but she's fine."
Don't worry.
Well...
"I will be in my room, avoiding risky activities."
So... yeah.
Mom just went off on me and made it clear she doesn't want me to ride.
"- Well, did you talk to her about it?"
- Have you met Mom?
Good point.
Mm-hmm.
Anyway...
"How have you been, Dad?"
How's your time-out going?
It's been pretty quiet.
A little too quiet without you guys.
But tell me about that cute little island you're on.
Did Rosie meet the queen yet?
"The queen, she is in London."
And it's...
It's cool.
I met some new friends.
That's enough!
You're mistaken.
No mistake!
Witnesses?
I will be a witness.
He is Lun Taichen.
He's your father's old accountant.
"And he caused your father's death, by betraying him and watching him die in jail."
And then he drove your mother to insanity.
Shut up!
Who are you?
"I'm Old Honshu, Jeng's old servant."
"I know you stole that factory from them, and then all their land, and after that you got rid of every last one of their servants."
"But here you are, hunted by the police."
"You, you, ran away that night."
"I met you a few years ago, and I've been following you ever since then, just waiting for the chance to get my revenge."
I want to see you die before my very own eyes!
You're telling lies!
Honshu!
You go!
Right.
Come with me!
Uncle.
Where's Lun Sanye?
He escaped.
You okay?
Nevermind.
(gasping)
You okay?
Lun Sanye.
Lun Sanye?
"Tell me, what happened to Mei?"
-Jesse.
-Jake.
That one was a big mistake.
I think that's it except for you.
"And all of Crowley Corners, too."
Hot in Cleveland is recored in front of a live studio audience.
Did you know Cleveland was originally spelled... c-l-e-a-v-e-l-a-n-d?
"From John Moses cleaveland,"
"- see, their dropped the 'a'...!"
- Shut up!
Thank you.
The nominations for the daytime emmys...
- were just announced.
- Oh.
"All right, who cares, who cares, ah-- best actress."
Susan lucci...
Well-deserved.
"Crystal mcallister, nobody, nobody, and..."
Victoria Chase!
Yay!
Good for you.
"Oh, it's my 16th nomination."
"Uh, waiter?"
"Uh, I realize it's only 8:00 in the morning, but we're celebrating, and I would like... some champagne in my orange juice."
You mean the usual?
Yes.
Although I've never won this thing.
"And this year, I definitely don't have a chance."
Crystal mcallister from the strong and the gorgeous... pulled a really underhanded stunt.
What'd she do?
She died.
I've never seen either of these.
I'm so sorry.
You know I have no choice.
I have to order the release of the detainee.
"If you live, my daughter dies."
- We'll call Jenny.
- She'll stay on top of Haskell.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
Why is your hand on my person?
"You, as a person of interest in this screwedup case, aren't going anywhere until I get answers."
Laura.
"Thank you, Jenny."
You'll follow him home?
You won't take your eyes off of him?
Cross my heart.
He's out.
"Down, girl."
Down.
I'm gonna sit by Mimi's bed in that hospital.
I'm not moving till she comes to and I.D.'s him.
Nico and a chick who should probably be committed... that's nothing new.
What's new is one who's worth the trouble.
Good luck at the hospital.
"Yeah, thanks."
"Welcome home, dirtbag."
"- Hello, officer."
- Ma'am.
Ma'am.
Is this Mimi's room?
"- She can't have visitors, ma'am."
- I'm a friend.
I'd like to be there when she wakes up.
- You don't have to wonder anymore.
Stop.
- Shock him.
- Clear.
He's flat.
This city takes care of its own.
Set a press conference for 12:00.
Make sure the Post takes the first question.
"You know what the first question will be ""Whose bullet was it?"""
"Call Senator Marquand, be cool."
Tell him everything's under control.
I'm just staying ahead of the curve.
"Abe, get a copy of Tino Zapatti's probation report."
Which Zapatti is that?
A nephew.
"One conviction, off on probation."
A punk.
We're headed for Park Drive.
How's about we swing over to the FDR?
We'll make better time.
What's your pleasure?
Where did the boy live?
Give me a read on the boy's apartment.
515 South 5th Street.
5th Street.
Marcy and Broadway.
That's where we're going.
"We've got no advance, no protection."
That's where we're going.
I'm the mayor.
"Make room here, please."
We need some help around here.
Mickey...
Judas...
Mickey...
Judas...
"To survive, it's better to survive..."
See what's left?
"The old man's dead, Donald's dead, my woman..."
Your woman was a twat.
"Here, park this!"
You don't have to bad-mouth Martine!
It's a bit late for niceties!
I have a woman and a friend.
I'm home and dry.
"You said that, didn't you?"
"- No, it was you."
- Same thing.

We've gotta pull out the stops.
"It's not The Beatles any more, it's Attilla and the Destroyers... no future."
"If there's still a future, it's tomorrow, 15 rue Nergal."
Now duck.
You trust this jerk with the hot stuff?
- The hot stuff and the ice queen!
- My virgin Mary!
Would you like some medication?
"Sure, I know a drugstore."
"Antoine and I knocked it off a few times, years ago."
"For peanuts, petty cash or speed!"
"Remember, Antoine?"
We'll keep the hearse.
Why not leave it here?
For what?
I can understand why people would want to pay to see her.
"Well, Julia, surely not."
(Julia):
"What are we doing but watching her, William?"
About time you paid for help.
How much you offering?
- Five cents.
- Ten.
"A nickel, final offer!"
What do you know?
- I seen him.
- Did you now?
- He went to see that beast in the cage.
- What of it?
I took him there.
Near the river.

What?

It was right here two days ago!
"Yes, I'm sure it was."
"Give us that nickel back, you little thief!"
The tent was right here!
Honest!
I swear it's the truth!
Here.
"You stay out of trouble, alright?"
"So, the victim was definitely attacked here at Travis's campsite."
Which the lying sod failed to tell us he moved.
Bloody Irish tinkers!
Nothing but trouble when they show up in their caravans.
Ten to one that that knife's the murder weapon.
It took some time.
Will she be OK?
I don't know.
Her heart's gonna be weak for a while.
"Maybe forever,"
I don't know.
You know Dr. Jerry Gordon is the guy for you.
You do know that?
Thanks for your help.
- I couldn't get in.
- It happens.
And Dallas.
Exciting.
Big trauma centre...
Congrats.
That's great.
"You don't mean that, do you Jerry?"
Sure I do.
I'm thrilled you're gonna be thousands of miles away.
Doc?
- I didn't touch the guy.
"- No, that bruising around his neck just appeared like magic."
"What was it, a choke hold before you put him in the car, or after?"
"I wouldn't make accusations like that, Doc."
I'll do whatever I want.
He almost died.
Which would have been a real tragedy.
We still need to talk to Mr. Pike.
"He's going to be a little busy, what with the CT scans and the trip to ICU."
"Well, we'll just wait."
There it is.

"Oh, sorry."
"So, Tubby."
Is he very sad?
What?
What did he look like when you saw him?
He looked like someone finishing off a pasty.
"For frig's sake, Enid, if there's any havoc caused, you've caused it."
Dithering and faffing about.

It's from the photographer who took my pictures.
"Fine, whatever."
"Morning, mom."
He's still sleeping.
He stayed up all night studying.
"Sure, I'll tell him to call you."
"Hey, where have you been?"
I've been holding the room upstairs for you.
You have no clients left.
"Boss, I was at a photo shoot..."
"Today is the photographer, tomorrow it will be eitherfilms or dance..."
Let me explain...
"Son, you're betteroff as a Zenne."
Off you go...
"Cavit darling, should we also change the lights upstairs?"

None.
Unless you count the place on the card he sent me to propose.

""""" The Old Hawaiian Aloha Wedding Chapel."""
That's a proposal?
"Well, wouldn't any reasonable girl take that as a proposal?"
- Did you go there?
- Without Roger?
"For heaven sakes, why?"
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Yoo-hoo.
Yoo-hoo.

We're just looking for a friend.
"You mean you're, uh, not the future Mr. and Mrs. Lloyd Brockman?"

Don't you wish to be married here?
Yes.
No.
"Oh, I see."
Uh...
I wonder if it'd be possible if we could see your gardens?
Rose.
- Just tell Claire I had to run.
"- Rose, I'm sorry."
I really thought I was over him.
I hate this.
It's so stupid.
- I must sound so pathetic.
"- No, not at all."
"He asked if Claire was happy, and I lied."
- Isn't that awful?
- Nothing criminal.
- Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.
- Are you feeling better now?
A little.
"- You know, Rose, it takes time."
"- Yeah, I know."
I want you to know that I really value our friendship.
It means a lot to me.
"I feel the same way, which is why tonight..."
"I better go home, I have to get dinner ready."
"I'll see you at 8:00, okay?"
Shall I bring anything for your mother?
"Yeah, a wooden stake and a crucifix."
Bye.
Rose loves to fold napkins.
It's one of her idiosyncrasies.

How about my acne or that piano tie I wore to the senior prom?

You were the guy in the piano tie.

I think you got something in your ear... oh!
Awesome!
Did you...?
What is it about grandpas that they can always find change in kids' ears?
"I know you're really enjoying yourself, Richard, but I just want you to know, it doesn't bother me at all."
- It doesn't?
- No.
Not even a little bit?
I said it doesn't bother me.
The three of us are to leave immediately.
"By ""immediately"", I do presume you mean after breakfast?"
Since I've paid for it.
D'ARTAGNAN:
"I think we should wait for Athos, let him know where we are going."
Wait how long exactly?
(DOOR OPENS)
I'm going to have to start charging you lodgings.
You're here so often.
Is this a complaint?
Do I look dissatisfied?
"- (LAUGHING) No, no."
- (GRUNTS)
I will not be responsible for distracting the Captain of the Musketeers from his duties.
"After all, the King and Paris depend on you."
(LAUGHING) I'll...
I'll get breakfast.
(ATHOS GRUNTING)

This is the first time that my Dad's money is going to the right place.
Just let the job happen.
The neighbour's kids don't let me drink tea in peace.
Take this.
Shoot Bittu right here.
What did you do?
"It's empty, right?"
"Yes, empty... just one bullet."
"Stop, stop!"
What if somebody had gotten shot?
DEAN:
"Thanks for the scrap, Floyd."
Sorry I can't pay you more.
"But it, it's got this,"
"- um, this large bite out of it."
- (MACHINE WHIRRING)
That's why I'm selling it.
It's got a large bite out of it.
What could've done this?
- I told you what.
"- Oh, yeah."
(SNICKERS) Strange invaders.
Thanks for believing me.
I really did call the government.
Yeah.
They're sending someone to take care of the whole thing.
"Jeez, Earl."
You really are crazy.
"I mean, who in the hell would the government send?"
"Kent Mansley, United States Government, Unexplained Phenomena Department."
- Marv Loach.
I'm the foreman here.
- What happened here?
Not sure.
"Sometimes the line'll snap if the weather is bad, sure."
"But for a whole tower to get twisted up like that, whoa!"
It's got me beat.
It's almost like it was bitten off by some enormous beast.
Enormous beast.
"Yeah, what do you think?"
Escaped gorilla?
"Uh, what department is that again?"
I just walk around.
"I want to be swept off my feet, you know?"
I want my children to have magical powers.
I am prepared for amazing things to happen.
I can handle it.
Ellen.
Guess who's joining the Olympics?
- Guess who's joining the Olympics?
- Who?
- Me.
- Really?
- How is the love of my life?
- Can I borrow this?
Of course.
Which one is that?
Ohh.
My granddaughter and her boyfriend who won't marry her... are going to become art.
That's a limited access floor.
You need a swipe card.
Oh.
I'll just get off on two then.
You want the offices?
"- Actually, are you Nancy Herrington?"
- Yes.
Okay. 'Cause I wanted to show you my art.
I brought this tape I thought we could watch.
Okay.
Why don't you send it to this address.
"Oh, but that's here."
Can't I just hand it to you?
It'll get lost.
It's better if you send it.
"- What, screw with you?"
Because I can.
You're my son.
Thank you.
I'm sorry I can't be 15 minutes early like you are.
I have an actual job I go to.
"- Collecting disability, I'm sure, is not as time-consuming as whatever you're doing."
Do you two need a minute?
I can come back.
No.
It's fine.
"What are you having, Dad?"
I'm buying.
I'll have a couple of scrambled.
Is that all?
You don't want bacon?
You love bacon.
Get bacon.
He loves bacon.
Get him some bacon.
Rye toast.
Right?
And I'll have scrambled egg whites and avocado.
Thank you.
Avocado?
Is that what you eat with your lawyer friends?
Avocado.
- I'll be right back.
Why do we...
"Can we just, like, try to have a normal conversation of some kind?"
I'm not starting anything.
- Fine.
But I wanted to check in first.
"- Well, I'm doing great."
Thanks for asking.
- Check in on Stefan.
"Oh, him?"
"Oh, he's..."
He's terrible.
What's the matter?
"He's just back to boring, strait-laced, off the junk."
You've successfully cured him of anything that was interesting about his personality.
- Don't forget who helped me.
- I hate myself.
"Hey, did Uncle John mention anything to you about my field trip with the teacher?"
"No, I've still been avoiding him."
Why?
What's he up to?
- I'd love it if you could find out for me.
- I gotta go.
I'm late.
Have fun with the Mystic queen.
I know I did.
[SCOFFS]
Elena called.
So these are the specs for the History Department's Founder's Day float.
We're gonna be re-creating the Battle of Willow Creek.
Tyler's been nominated to head up the design.
- By who?
- By me.
I've seen your sketches.
- I'm not really into the whole...
"- You just pick your team, be creative and..."
And don't screw up.
Monica Howard.
You're the first one who's given me a full name.
"Well, the 12 steps are anonymous and talking to the police is not part of the program."
"Yeah, right, right."
"So, uh..."
How well did you know Skip Holling?
I was his sponsor.
"He was, um..."
a really nice guy.
"You know, he was doing really well with his recovery."
"Did he have any, uh... friends, enemies, any relationships?"
Probably all three.
"You know, I don't think I'm much help."
"We just talked about booze, that's it."
Right.
"Thanks, thanks, uh..."
If I have any more questions?
"Yeah, you can--you can reach me here, Detective..."
"Schanke, Don Schanke."
Hi.
Thanks.
"Monica, if you don't mind me asking, what was your..."
Addiction?
Yeah.
I do mind.
"I was hoping she'd say ""balding married men."""
[TELEPHONE RINGING]
[ANSWERING MACHINE CLICKS]
"Yeah, Nick Knight."
"I'm either in bed or incommunicado, so if you want to leave your name and number, go ahead."
SCHANKE:
"Hey, Nick, got any bad habits?"
Don't know her.
You sure?
She worked there the same time you did.
Lots of girls worked the club.
They come.
They go.
Some stay only for couple of days.
"How come you looking for her anyways, somebody been gone that long?"
"A relative died, left her quite a bit of money."
"Here you are, Papa."
"If we want any money around here, I gotta catch the bus to go to work."
"Hey, maybe you can give my Kiki one ride."
Take the beer with you.
I'll call some of my friends from the old days.
"And you come back tonight, maybe I'll have something."
Fair enough.
Thanks.
"You get some rest, okay?"
Sure.
"Hey, stop fussing over me like I'm an old man."
"If I like, I can go swim all the way out there and back again."
"Well, you are an old man, but I love you anyway."
Aloha.
"Aloha, Papa."
[ Phone Ringing ]
Mueller.
"[ Man Speaking, Indistinct ]"
What'd you tell him?
"[ Man Continues, Indistinct ]"
Okay.
I'll tell her.
"[ Woman ] Oh, uh, don't worry about dinner."
Where are you guys going?
Don't you want to play anymore?
Was it something I said?
Sheesh.
"I know you're not counting cards, because I spot cheaters for a living."
So how do you do it?
Ever hear of just being good?
I make it a daily practice.
- I practice being the best.
- At cards?
And other things.
"Well, you'll have to tell me about it, someplace I can hear you."
I have a room.
I have a suite.
You win.
Watch those.
She's in.
Nice pad for a cruise line employee.
I'm an independent contractor.
Better perks.
"Now, where were we?"
You move fast.
- Life's short.
- I have a feeling...
I'm not the first girl you've brought to your suite.
Why waste the night talking about other women?
I like you.
I like champagne.
I'm gonna go freshen up.
Be my guest.
I caught you...
Putting on lipstick.
Bye-bye.
"Doctor, this is an emergency."
This man has been shot.
Come on in.
Let's have a look at you.
Here you go.
Let's get some of these things off so we can take a look at it.
Easy...
There.
Now get up here on the table.
Alright.
Now turn a little bit.
Let me take a look at this.
When did this happen?
Just a little while ago on the street.
Hm-hmm.
You know I'm gonna have to report this to the police.
You know who did it?
"A sniper, I think."
"Hand me a shot, please."
"Sniper, huh?"
Is it serious?
"Well, if you mean are you gonna die?"
I don't think so.
"You know, one of the greatest dangers arising from a gunshot wound is infection, but... they have a cure for that now."
This just came out.
I've had some very dramatic results with it.
What's it called?
Penicillin.
There we are.
My forceps.
Does that hurt?
"All right, you then."
"- Uh, Wendy?"
"- Hi, Stan."
"Look, I just want you to know."
"If you want to, you know, be with that Briden kid, then you should."
What?
"I mean, I see the way you two are together and I don't wanna be in your way."
"- Stan, that's ridiculous."
- It is?
I would never leave you for Briden.
- Really?
"- No way, that'd be stupid."
I wouldn't have chance with Briden he could have any girl he wants.
"There you go, feel better, p-p-pal?"
What am I supposed to do?
I can't just sit back and watch some kid steal my girlfriend away.
"I mean, Wendy says she'll never leave me for him."
But what if she just doesnt wanna hurt my feelings.
"She said he could get any girl he wants and that means if he wanted, he could have my girl."
This is all so crazy.
"I mean, really, how could my day get any worse?"
No-no.
"No, I'm not doing it."
I'm not doing it.
"No, fuck off, I'm not doing it."
"Oh, geez, you're no fun."
"- Hey, Briden."
- Hey.
"- Hi, Briden."
- Hi.
"- Hey, Briden."
- Hey.
Get out!
Come here!
What are you smiling for?
You deaf person!
Gate?
!
Out?
!
Get out!
Who?
Then say so!
Why beat around the bush?
"Won't you go away, rascal?"
He was eating my head!
And why were you asking them?
- Are you nervous?
- Yes.
This girl has shot into my heart like a bullet.
"She sells flowers, yet fires bullets."
That's why it's said that one cannot trust the female species.
When I was hit with the bullet the first time...
- ...it hadn't been so painful.
"- But the pain is sweet, isn't it?"
- But what next?
- What do you mean?
Will this matter proceed further or not?
How will it proceed further?
You know I cannot do a thing.
I too don't know anything.
I haven't fallen in love often.
Brother!
"How are you, brother?"
You're just after a Fredrick March type
That would be lovely
"Please, I'm serious"
I'll keep my eyes open
"Don't forget, will you?"
"Please, for Fujio's sake"
You're leaving?
Off to the Ginza Today's act of motherly love
My niece from Osaka arrives here tomorrow
It'll be good to see her again
I like the girl
"She's such a smart, tidy girl"
Goodbye!
Goodbye!
Didn't know you had a sister like this
Be serious.
Silly
Goodbye
I'm getting hungry Is there anything to eat?
There are some biscuits
Something a little more solid?
Like what?
What is there?
Noodles?
Noodles?
How about sushi?
A bit too cold...
Then what...
Rice?
Topped with eel.
But then again...
You're hard to please
"""Take this, all of you, and eat it for this is my body."""
"When the supper was ended, he took the cup."
Again he gave you thanks and praise.
"He gave the cup to his disciples and said, ""Take this all of you, and drink from it."
This is the cup of my blood.
"The blood of the new and everlasting covenant, the mystery of faith."""
What an excellent day for an exorcism.
You'd like that?
Intensely.
But wouldn't that drive you out of Regan?
It would bring us together.
You and Regan?
You and us.
-Did you do that?
-Uh-huh.
-Do it again.
-In time.
"No, now."
In time.
"Mirabile dictu, don't you agree?"
You speak Latin?
How long are you planning to stay in Regan?
Until she rots and lies stinking in the earth.
What's that?
Holy water.
You keep it away.
It burns!
"Oh, it burns!"
Who are you?
"You know, I'm, like, in seclusion."
"No, I'm just exhausted from work."
Um....
- Lucky you.
Living with the Chase's.
- Yes.
Whoopty- do.
"If you guys are friends again, you don't have to conceal it."
I can take it.
You see that nurse right there?
She blames me.
She thinks that I brought the heart attack on... by my sexual demands.
"No, actually, my sexual commands."
What is it?
Good news?
What makes you think that?
"Actually, Andy is pretty much the same?"
But I thought that you... I was on my way to Allegheny Systems when I realized...
- l forgot the estimates.
- Here.
I can't believe I did this.
Anyway...
"Wait, here, here!"
- Graham!
This is beautiful!
- lt's a lemon- hazelnut tort.
- Thank you!
- When did you?
"I couldn't sleep, I was up waiting for you."
"Oh, my God, Patty."
- You waited up for me?
- Only until three.
I guess I'm going to be late for this meeting. I better phone him.
Your husband is an artist.
"Oh, God, I can't bear it."
"OH, GOD."
"NO PRESSURE, SAM."

I COULDN'T HOLD HIM OFF ANY LONGER.
"WELL, WHAT ABOUT STIEGEL?"
AM I SUPPOSED TO DROP THE CASE IN SOMEBODY ELSE'S LAP?
POLLAN'S GOT CANCER.
AND IT'S GETTING WORSE.
I'M -- I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.
"LOOK, SAM, I-I KNOW YOU WANTED TO TRY THAT CASE,"
"AND I RESPECT YOU FOR THAT,"
That's the one.
He was convinced that the Holy Grail was there.
For the love of Christ.
"Yes, he was looking for that too, don't doubt it."
"-The Nazis believed in the power of relics, the lance with which Longinus pierced Christ or the Arc of the Covenant."
I've heard of that.
Someone wants to rewrite history and we won't allow it.
"Ernesto, you speak German."
You should go immediately with Irene to Madrid in the 40s.
and find out what Himmler wants.
I suppose he'll be staying at the Ritz.
"Yes, that hasn't changed."
For the moment.

Eat slowly.
It's hot and spicy.
I can't eat this.
Are you going to die if you eat it?
Keep it down and be quiet!
Yoon Jae...
"The food must be spicy for you, so how about a nice refreshing beer?"
Huh?
Alcohol?
Why not?
"Sure, sure."
I'm not going to die if I drink it.
Father...
Yoon Jae has to drive.
Da Ran...
I don't have a car because it was in the accident.
Yoon Jae...
"You're not even well after the accident, so you shouldn't be drinking."
"I think if I have one drink, it'll help me fall asleep easily."
"-Please give it to me, father-in-law."
"-Dad, dad...!"
Me too.
Alcohol for an 18 year old minor?
No way!
A kid can't drink!
You can't...!
No one's going to deny that you're a teacher...
That's right.
"Since I'm a teacher, I can't watch a student drink alcohol."
You don't have to take me back...
"In that case, sir the camp is prepared to escape and evade on order through places in the wire and mines only ""A"" Team and Captain Nim know about."

The Democrats did.

- Woot?
Ugh.
What was that?

Give it back to the women.
"Oh, thanks very much."

You're looking much better today.

"Okay, that will be fine."
"Then, we'll hold off on the film for now, but if he gets any worse... ."
He gets x-rayed.
He says he didn't do it.
"D, I don't like this any better than you do, man."
He wouldn't lie.
"Come on, man."
Did he lie about the tagging?
Or the weed they found in his pocket?
"Look, K.J.'s a good kid, but right now, his judgment basically sucks."
I wanna talk to this Doctor... .
-Dubenko.
"-Yeah, the security guard too."
"D, they don't wanna press charges, man."

Where'd the glasses come from today?
Somebody chucked them on stage.

What's High School Musical 3?
"You know, the sequel to High School Musical 1 and 2."
What's High School Musical 1 and 2?
There's not even condiments on his bologna sandwich!
You got that?
"Got that,"
Capt. Kechichian?
We were up late.
For a good cause.
"Sure, loitering in a bar at 2 AM, after defacing the wall of a Government building, how can I fault you for being so admirable!"
- Anything else?
- A lead on the van jobs.
A Serbian arms-dealer:
Victor Dragan.
We got a tip off from an informant.
A reliable source?
Not at all.
What do you say?
I know the fellow.
A sadistic loner.
"Barring a lucky break, he'll be tough to nail."
Luck can be engineered.
Briefing's over!
"Vrinks, you stay."
I've been appointed Police Commissioner.
As of when?
I take over on Sept 1.
Congratulations.
I hate to leave before I've cleaned house.
"I want that gang, Leo."
As my farewell gift.
You'll get them.
Another thing:
someone will get my desk.
You're the right man.
Klein wants to be Chief.
"There are less spots, doc."
Rash: 31 spots 1 or 2 spots doesn't count as better.
But at least it's less.
Thank you.
Did you do exactly as I told you?
Yes.
Really?
Yes.
So what went wrong?
Let me ask you more personal questions.
I need to find out more.
What's your favorite food?
Shrimp dumplings from 7-Eleven.
Your favorite food is from 7-Eleven?
Nothing else to eat at night.
And it tastes good.
They also have rice balls.
Are you joking?
I'm not joking.
They really have them.
"Then on your free days, what do you do?"
Whoa that's hard to answer.
"No, it isn't."
"How about movies, music, the mall, and the beach?"
Nothing?
Everything you said is a waste of time.
How is that entertaining?
"Go to the mall, to do what?"
To buy clothes?
I don't buy any.
You don't buy any clothes at all?
I can still wear my old ones.
They were sent to the shooter.
We traced the I.P. address.
Comes straight from this office.
(sighs)
O-Only I couldn't have sent these.
See the date and the time?
I wasn't here;
I was with a client at a hotel on Kalakaua.
I can prove it.
"Okay, Abby, who else has got access to your computer?"
Just my assistant Andrew.
He's taking off.
Hey.
Hey!
(siren wailing nearby)
(truck horn blaring)
(tires screech)
You should've let me die.
"Andrew, why would you do this?"
"I'm in love with you, Abby."
I've always loved you.
I just wanted you to stop.
Unrequited love.
Second oldest motive there is.
(alarm system chimes)
(exhales)
"Hello, Sam."
"Geez, Joe."
When'd you get back?
"You know me, I come and go as I please."
"Family is safe and sound, fast asleep."
"Well, can I assume you didn't break into my home just to say hello?"
Yeah.
Yeah.
Surprised to see your pal Greg here.
Surprised to see your pal Greg here.

How you doing?
Fine.

(SCOFFS) What's with you?

You know what he calls you - a poser.

How can you be mates with him?

TERRY:
It's obvious you're not happy.
TERRY:
It's obvious you're not happy.
GREG:
"Mate, I'm as happy as a pig in shit."
GREG:
That's what I'm counting on.
"Where do you want to go, hey?"
What do you want to see?
Rrr!
Argh!
Is that her?
The woman twice dead.
"She's rather pretty, isn't she?"
She's not possible.
"Right then, Clara Oswald."
Time to find out who you are.
This is so depressing.
I was almost married.
I was so close to being done.
"Living a life of no makeup, wearing flats, being on the bottom."
"Maybe I was wrong about marriage, it sounds awesome."
"Look, don't worry, Lil."
"I mean, it's normal to feel this way."
It's not normal to make us put on these dresses and sing Kanye West.
"But, you know what?"
Anything to help you get over Neal.
"Uh, uh, uh."
"I told you, no one is allowed to say ""the n word"""
in this apartment.
"Shouldn't no one say ""the n word,"" ever?"
Then we should probably stop singing Kanye West.
You know what?
I'm over it.
I'm not even thinking about it.
Someone pass me another Neal.
"Uh, I mean, a beer."
"""For today's voice action""."
[Loud roar].
"""...just now finished race number 2."
We got race number 3 loading in the gate.
"""Open amateur class for 85cc and larger bikes""."
Everyone's trying to earn their way to the Texas amateur all-star amateur nationals.
"Top 12 go every year, and today is qualifying race."
Race number 3 at the starting line.
Right now ....
Yeah Jacob.
Jacob wooo.
The 45 are about to enter the first turn here at cow-boy Badlands MX park.
Again the top 12 qualify for the Texas amateur all-star.
Jacob Wilson now starts to put up a little bit of pressure running up front.
Jacob.
Gary Owens also appears....
"Couple of laps in, here we go with Gary Owens, Jacob Wilson and Jason...."
Come on.
All three of them.
And Jacob Wilson now takes over the lead....
"Good, good."
While Gary Owens is on his track.
"Owen makes the pass, puts Jacob Wilson over the berm."
[Kick start -engine not starting]
[Not starting]
[Starts].
Is Wes here?
No.
Come on.
"Hey, you were great."
Okay.
Anything else I can get you boys?
- Just leave me alone!
You little shi...
"Are you okay, Felix?"
"I mean, fucking crying, the big fucking girl!"
"You fucking crybaby doll, get off my fucking fanny!"
That was intense.
- You are such a bastard.
- And your point is?
"Yeah, walk away like a little girl."
"Cheers, geeze."
Yeah.
So how was Christmas?
Pretty boring.
It's good to be out and about again.
- You didn't come to McGinty's.
"- No, I couldn't make it."
- Okay.
- How was it?
Gemma was there.
So?
- I'm just saying is all.
"- You know she chucked me, right?"
"Yeah, I heard."
I am kinda kicking myself.
She was one sweet shag.
And they said romance was dead.
But it was all that bloody Felix's fault
"Right, but that was months ago."
- You sure it's such a big deal?
"- Yeah, it was to her."
"Said she'd seen the real me, blah-fucking-blah."
"I tell you what, I wouldn't mind landing another couple of punches on that twitchy little face of his."
"I know, but I""m scared."
"L""m so scared."
"Oh, sweetie."
"You know what, baby, you might just get it all."
You just might get it all.
"I love you, Mama."
"I love you so much, Cassie."
"Let""s get you dressed."
"""And they cheered and they cheered more and more."
"""They""d never seen anything like it before."
"""""My goodness, my gracious,"" they shouted."
"""""My word!"
"Lt""s something brand-new."
"""""Lt""s an elephant bird."""
"""And it should be, it should be..."
"""it should be like that, because Horton was faithful."
"""He sat and he sat."
"""He meant what he said and he said what he meant."
"""And they sent him home happy..."""
"""One hundred percent."""
"So, the sun was shining, the earth was turning... and my daughter walked into the rest of her life with open arms."
And it finally hit me:
Maybe Cassie has it right.
Wouldn't it be something if my daughter has it right?
"Bye, sweetie, we love you!"
"Bye-bye, darling."
Who are you?
Jesus.
You okay?
Do I look okay?
"If you were any thinner, you wouldn't exist."
Have you had a nice day?
"Oh, what's this ***"
"Thank you, Nana."
It's so good to be here with you.
This place is so so acceptable.
Aha!
I got it.
I got the job!
We can definitely move out.
"Yeah, I know."
"I know, I was pretty speechless myself at first, but then I thought ""Hey, come on!"
"You know this was just a matter of time."""
I am...
a manager.
Right.
"Well, this is calls for a celebration."
Let's see.
"Would you like a go, Samuel?"
"No, ma-maybe not go too mad."
So we're going to have to throw ourselves into the house hunting.
"You'll be good at that, eh, Becky?"
"Well, not too far away I hope."
"We'll still be seeing you, won't we?"
Yeah.
"I mean yeah, of course."
You'll come to Sunday lunch?
Yeah.
"Yeah, when we can."
Alright.
I've not been on Facebook for four and a half months.
It is time for a status update methinks.
"Won't be strange, dear?"
Siri is a little ...
-are You fine?
What the fuck you think you are?
Thought he could be quiet and I never find out?
I could not say that Christer was helping us.
There was nothing between Christer and I since high school.
He worked for you!
It was with you that he talked that night!
I can cry if I want to!
Okay.
"Sit down, Siri."
-With Whom you spoke?
'They did not believe me.
"They think I knew, and now they want a lot of money."
-With Whom you spoke?
-I Did not say anything.
A journalist found out.
It was with you that he slept when we were discussing?
"Yes, a few nights on the couch."
I've never been with him.
"You met secretly at night, was not it?"
Why do not you stop him?
It was dangerous!
It was you who did join ...
What the fuck.
You're not my sister.
"He wanted, right?"
He wanted revenge for what happened in Sweden.
He was killed because he worked for you.
You killed him!
"And now they're killing me, too."
The same.
Those two have been my bedrock.
"Yeah, I'm sorry about Darla."
"How's she doing, uh..."
How's she doing in prison?
I think she's okay.
"You know, I learned something."
Sometimes you just have to let your kids... sit in their own mistakes.
Sometimes you can't fix 'em.
Yeah.
"Well, I should get back to the hotel."
"You know, I'm guest of the day."
"[Chuckling] Say, listen, we have a half a pitcher of sangria, it's still early."
"Come on, hang around a while."
Okay.
Let me pour you some.
- Oh.
- Oh!
"Oh, I'm so sorry."
"No, no, no, don't worry about it."
Don't worry about it.
It's okay.
"No, I'm gonna show you something."
You're gonna love this.
- I'm such a klutz.
"- No, you're not a klutz."
"Stop it, you're not a klutz."
"That's what I've been sayin', I've been waiting to show this to somebody."
- [Spraying]
- Watch.
"This new Stain Master, it is amazing."
It is gonna revolutionize the carpet industry.

- That will be 3.75.
- But I didn't have to pay yesterday.
"Okay, 7.50."
"Oh, honey, sweetie, baby."
"It's the ring, Robin."
The ring has power.
When a woman puts on an engagement ring... it's like when Bilbo Baggins wears the one ring in The Hobbit.
- Okay.
"Can you say that again, but not in nerd?"
- Sure.
"Uh, the ring is like the cloak that Harry Potter wears to sneak around Hogwarts."

NiaII.

Who's the first to admit their farts?
You should be proud of a smell like that.

AII right.
I appreciate it.
Recording this third album has been extremely hard.
We've been waking up in the morning and going straight to the studio.
Then going to the arena  doing a show.
And then going straight back to the studio after a show.
So it's been really tough for us this time.
AII of my 1 0 minute slumber.
"We have to get "" Best Song Ever."""
"It felt like it was the next morning and you were already waking me up and I was like, ""Oh, my God."""
"One, two, three."

My bad.
No!
No way a bit of weed is worth two years!
Mr St. Clair--
"Please, take a seat."

If he pleads guilty to all charges--
I'm not guilty of anything!
Sentencing will likely be 3-6 months.
And there's a possibility of a suspended sentence.

Baby pictures of Luke?
More than baby pictures.
You're gonna watch Luke grow up to sappy music.
Why are you doing this?
To get all the crying out of your system so you don't melt down at the graduation.
It's like when you drink too much and your friends get you super-wasted so you never drink again for the rest of the week.

"Too many people like your cousin here, gettin' sent back."
"Look man, I ain't tryin' to come back."
"So, you intend to cease your criminal activities then?"
(chuckles)
Right...
"Well, a passport, 25,000 US dollars."
"Yo, what happened to fifteen?"
That was years ago!
"Now, homeland security, makin' tings a lot tougher for the little man."
"The normal rate is 30,000 US dollars."

"I told you stay off that shit, didn't I tell you?"
I told you!
"Money got tight, alright--"
What do you mean money got tight?
Huh?

All you had to do was stay in school.

Yes.
Are you Inspector Arivazhagan?
Yes.

"Who is this at my station, questioning me?"
"Hey, Panju!"
Sir!

Sir?
Find out what this man wants.
"Okay, Sir."
Come.
Did I really speak to the Inspector?
Yes.
Why are you bugging us?
"Tell me, is he really Inspector Arivazhagan?"
"Yes, he is."
You came so furiously to meet this very same Arivazhagan.
Manoj.
"Manoj, please relax."
I can understand that you are in some trouble.
Your car was involved in the accident.
The person with you must have driven the car.
Your intention of saving her is not wrong.
But a life has been lost.
"Don't get scared, Manoj."
We are not dealing this case officially.
"Only if you tell the truth, we can save you and your friend."
- Can everybody just shut up?
!
- I hate it.
Sorry about that.
Anyway...
Hello.
Hello.
Is this Phil dumpster?
"What do you want, Gil?"
Got to be kidding me.
Hang on.
I need you to send a gift to mom for her birthday from the both of us.
"No, I did it last year."
"I know, and I need you to do it again."
"Look, I've got a conference call at 1:20."
"Then Luke's tutor comes to the house, 2:45 sales meeting, and I still got to get Alex to Judo."
And yet you somehow found time to bitch at me.
Wow!
You really can have it all.
Ugh.
"Honestly, just get her a stupid gift card, you big baby!"
You're back in second place with your favorite view.
Ugh.
Why does everything with him have be so dramatic?
Why are we stopping?
Hey.
Hey.
Oh.

"Okay, first you berate me on the phone, then you show up to my office and berate me in per..."
"Oh, w-what is this?"
I don't care for this.
"If you get up now, you will finish it in time."
You can work here.
I brought your computer.
There's WiFi too.
This is why I told you not to call me a douchebag.
But this is about finishing work and being responsible.
Just a little bit more.
Only 2 photos.
"If you finish this job, you can rest as many days as you want."
"And when you're done, we'll go to NYC together."
Ok?
So what did you say to him?
I told him I want to sleep.
Damn.
Was Peng angry?
He wasn't.
Just told me to fuck off and change careers.
Don't worry.
I will find you some jobs.
Will you do one thing for me?
Don't do anything stupid like this again.
I'm asking you as your best friend.
Alright.
Je.
You have to have a baby.
What?
I came back from the dead just to see your kid's face.
So you are free today?
Yeah.

-Could we talk about this another day?
-St.
Louis you held up a card game.
"Moline, Illinois, 13 months."
Assault on a railroad investigator.
They gave me something.
If you plead innocent and make me try you for homicide I'm going to see that you pay.
What're you sayin'?
This have something to do with this accident?
-I wasn't even driving.
"-Oh, you weren't even driving."
You were too drunk to drive.
You were too drunk to walk.
"You have a witness at the filling station, yes."
Who do you think you're dealing with?
-I know you killed him.
-Come on.
-I remember that.
There was a serious conversation about kicking Zayn out of the band.
"Oh, my God."
Imagine.
NiaII would have to be the mysterious one.
I don't know.
I think if I wasn't in One Direction right now I would be working in a factory or being a fireman.
-That's quite funny.
-Yeah.
Why did you wanna be a fireman?
I don't know.
I liked the idea of saving someone.
What about the factory?
"well, that's just because me dad worked there."
would you have not considered opening your own bakery?
I was a great baker.
Fish!
Yes!
-Yeah!
-bloody hell!
Fish!
Fish!
Fish!

You must be joking.
"Well, cut it out."
"You'll eat, right?"
"Hey, aren't you going to take my order?"
Leave it to me.
"Fine, then."
Reminds me of when we met.
"Just like now, you were quietly eating the kimchi meatloaf I made."
Was I?
Yeah.
You ate it and told me it was like your mom's cooking.
"Oh, I remember."
"You cook so well, I'm sure your restaurant will do well."
So good luck.
But not Korean food.
What?
My restaurant... will serve soba and sake.
You can make soba?
It'll take time.
So you'll have to work extra hard.
Hena.
Are we... breaking up?
Don't talk about that.
"Yeah, this really is good."
Your meatloaf really is the best.
Want some?
Nice to see you again doctor Jones.
Thank you.

Always knew someday you'd come walking back through my door.
I never doubted that.
Something made it inevitable.
So what are you doing here in Nepal?
I need one of the pieces your father collected.
I learned to hate you in the last ten years.
I never meant to hurt you.
I was a child.
I was in love.
It was wrong and you knew it!
You knew what you were doing.
Now I do.
This is my place.
Get out!
I did what I did.
You don't have to be happy about it.
But maybe we can help each other now.
"I need one of the pieces your father collected, a round piece about this size, with a hole in off center with a crystal."
You know the one I mean?
Yeah.
I know it.
Where is Abner...
Where is Abner?
Abner is dead.

"He's like a cage fighter, all wiry and feral."
"- And rich too, don't forget."
- Ah... he's perfect.

What boyfriend?
"You do actually love Paul, don't you?"
"Honey, right now, I can't even remember his name."
"So what do you do, Justin?"
- I'm an Army man.
"- Wow, respect."
- Seen any combat?
- Afghanistan.
Three tours.
Can't seem to get enough of the blood and dust.
"So you're with Eleanor, right?"
"For my sins, yes."
"Though, I'm not..."
I'm not convinced it's going anywhere.
- And we've done it but considering I...
- Are you and Gemma an item?
- got back...
- Why?
You interested?
No.
"No, she's not my type."
She's right up Felix's street though.
"Yeah, right."
What's the joke?
You think she's too good for him?
"Well, he made a move at the end of summer term."
Didn't work out too well.
You okay?

"What do we get, what we get, what we get, what we get, man?"
"What, what, what?"

"Oh, hey, I got it."
I got eleven.
"Hey, man, how much money we get?"
Nothin'.

"Come on, guys, I can't drive with you guys like this!"
Mr. sawamato's position in the family places him at great risk.
They have both decided it would be safer to remain apart.
That's bullshit.
"I mean look how happy they are, you know?"
Look as shu.
I wouldn't want to hide that.

Hey!
Ahh!
Get your hands off me.
"I'm waiting for Nick Davis, man."
Oh fuck!
"He's a little rough, but he's a great guy."
I know you'll like him.
"Hey, Nick what's happening, buddy."
"You're looking good, buddy."
You're looking good.
"You're looking good, buddy."
You're looking good.
You OK?
"Yeah buddy, cool."

Getting bigger every day ain't it?
It's good to meet a friend of nicks.
Sure thing.
Me and Nick go way back.
We used to hang out and do things I wouldn't even do with my brother.
We got some stories we could tell don't we Nick.
Hot one ain't it Billy?
- What am I missing?
"- Perspective, for one."
That's a loss and a win.
How is that the downfall of my gym?
You worried?
No.
[Chuckles] Come on.
"Alvey, you got to be a little concerned."
Not a bit.
And this isn't an interview.
"Well, I appreciate the apology, but it's not necessary."
"You know what, you haven't seen my gym, right?"
Let me give you the 10-cent tour.
"This way, the next time you butcher me, you know what the fuck you're talking about."
- Mind if I take some photos?
"- Whatever you need, Mario."
[Music playing]
[Indistinct chatter]
Hey.
Lisa's looking for you.
She's in her office.
All right.
I'll be right there.
What's up?
Shut the door.
I saw you training with Alvey today.
"Oh, man, I fucking sucked."
I was so nervous.
He was impressed.
He made it a point to tell me that.
- No shit.
- No shit.
"- No, Tommy."
- I promised Rosemary.
- What the fuck did you tell her?
Nothing.
She asked me to look out for you.
That's all I'm asking you to do.
Look out for me.
"And when you see me, don't stop."
"That way, you're not breaking any promises to anybody."
"Tell me, Paul..."
What?
Why do you want me under your train?
It's just...
I've had... two people die under my train this month.
"Jesus, you're a serial killer!"
No.
They weren't my fault.
They got this rule.
"If you have three in a month, they pay you off."
Ten years' wages.
Lump sum.
Mm...
What were you planning to do with this pay-off?
- Buy more books?
- Get out of London.
"Go and live in Scotland, on an island."
- Get away from everything.
- Really?
Life in the fast lane get too much for you?
Youth is wasted on the young.
"You know, somebody famous said that."
- What were you planning to do on this island?
- It's too personal.
- For her or for you?
Jackson.
What?
When?
Is Flynn all right?
What can you tell me about Viktor Karp?
I don't know the name.
Karp was moving lithium out of the mine you and mom ran.
ETU raided the offices last week.
He started as a drug runner.
Now he transports weapons.
Is Musa planning an attack?
"- I mean, is that what the Purge is?"
- I...
I don't know.
I never met Karp.
Only your mother dealt with him.
"So Mom dealt with Karp, what did you do?"
I had other business.
I also maintained the family unit.
I took my job seriously.
That part was always real.
Guy's got nine lives.
Got away with just cuts and bruises.
And a hell of a hangover.
We sure it was just an accident?
Doc says his blood alcohol level was 0.23.
"Deliberate, then?"
Because of his wife?
That and he's battle-bent.
Came at me pretty hard yesterday.
- What do you need?
- Just general stuff.
- You guys go and be in love.
- See you back at the house.
What if you shoot the person who throws the pigeon in the air?
Would that count?
Sorry.
"No, I should have signaled or honked."
My fault.
"I guess it was inevitable, us running into each other."
- It's a very tiny community.
- I guess so.
- How's the diner?
- It's still there.
Yes.
I knew that.
"I'm able to empirically, with my eyes..."
"- Hey, Luke, do you think we could..."
- I got to get back.
Okay.
Right.
I'll get it.
"- Hi, Grandma."
"- Hello, Rory."
Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.
I'm thrilled to see you on no notice.
"So tell me, what's this about?"
You were so mysterious on the phone.
I wanted to talk to you about something in person.
"Well, come in."
It's an English tea service.
One of the advantages of our having an English maid.
I'm so hungry.
"I thought there was a cracker, or like some fruit left or some shit."
I don't know.
Put that away.
"Oh, I'm sorry."
Are you here to hurt me?
No no no.
No no.
"No no, we don't wanna hurt you."
Okay.
Not at all.
I'm sorry about him.
Yeah.
"We're robbers, and we're stuck down here with you."
You're robbers?
Yeah.
You don't make any sense.
We were pulling a heist.
I'm the leader.
He's part of my crew.
"Yeah, don't, don't judge us on our rugged exterior."
Find anything yet?
Nothing.
I think we just should have sent that text.
"Look, it was a good plan, okay."
"We found the jammer, we killed it, we could have gotten a phone call out."
So no one knows that you're here?
No.
Wait a minute.
Why would you rob this place?

"I don't know... off the top of my head, maybe not bring home a little, tiny horse."
"Well, it's too late for that."
"I'd let her fall asleep first, if I were you."
"She does get a little randy in the evening, huh?"

"So, what was this advice?"
I might need to plagiarize myself down the line.
You told me that I didn't have to go into the family business.
You said I should make my own choices.
"So you've managed to do your own thing, then, huh?"
"Yeah, for a while, yeah."
And I think I went to college because of you.
"But, you know, people grow up."
Yeah.

- What's that?
Who?
"In the gold temple, they catch Sgt. Cutter."
Who's they?
Priests or what?
Very bad men.
They'll give him torture.
"Go help, quick."
- How many men?
- Don't know.
- I run away quick to bring help.
- I'll bet you ran away quick.
"And you'll run back just as quick, too."
Show me the way.
- I'll pick a dozen men.
- You'll pick nothing!
I'm going alone.
You haven't a chance.
I'm not killing Cutter by riding in with a troop.
They'll cut him up if we have a rescue party.
- Right.
We'll go together.
- No.
"Tommy, what's the matter?"
"Cutter got himself into a mess, and Mac and I are going to get him out."
"Don't worry, I'm not taking him."
I'm going as a sergeant in Her Majesty's service.
- I'm not taking any civilians with me.
- Who's a civilian?
- How many?
- Five riders.
Maybe more.
Hyah!
Shh.
Shh.

(NEIGHING)
PORTHOS:
Red Guards.
"Aramis, you are to return with us to the palace."
The King commands it.
"We have business, on behalf of Minister Treville."
Are you questioning a royal order?
"No, believe me, if we were, we wouldn't be taking it up with the messenger boy."
(CHUCKLES)
(CHUCKLES)
"If you come now, you won't be arrested."
Very well.
I'll see you back at the garrison.
Get him some food.
"You'll stay here until nightfall then, we'll take you out of Paris under cover of darkness."
"And please don't draw attention to yourself, hmm?"
Where are you going?
I must make sure my absence has not been noted.
But I will be back.
"Oh, and remember, if any of Grimaud's men ask your name, it is?"
"- ""Victor""."
I know.
"- Yes, quite right."
(CHUCKLES)
Victor!
I'm not sick of you at all.
And wow!
"It's been a good like six months, right?"
What?
Six months?
Then the Ice Land sign is like eight months?
You think we'd only last a year and a half?
I don't know.
I don't want to be presumptuous.
- I don't know if you're married orwhat.
- I'm not.
"Well, I'm separated."
We separated last month.
I was thinking... that Tyrone... was like 20 years away at least.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Okay.
"Well, actually I was thinking..."
"Tyrone is, like, when we die of old age."
"And this is, like, our whole life together, this block."
"See, that's perfect."
- Let's do it thatway.
- Okay.
"Well, guess it can't be avoided."
Everyone dies.
I could walk you to your car.
"Maybewe should just be glad... that we lived this long, good life together."
"You know, it's so much more than most people ever get to have."
- Okay.
- Okay.
"- Well, don't be afraid."
- Okay.
"–Uh, is it really necessary?"
"–Yeah, do you mind?"
"–No, not at all."
–Great.
Follow me.
Hey.
Fleetwood's been checkin' in with his parole officer... doin' community service and scrubbing' graffiti.
Sumbitch is totally clean.
You?
I ran some of the names he had in his Palm Pilot.
He had four two-strikers in his address book.
You need a new C.I.?
–Doesn't everyone?
–I'm gonna hit the head.
"Then we can go do some arm twisting', huh?"
"–Vic, we need to talk."
–What's up?
Claudette's got Tio's ledger.
He was supposed to burn that.
"Well, apparently, Armadillo burned him first."
Claudette wants to run your financials against Tio's records.
Fine.
Let her.
–You sure?
–Trust me.
She's not gonna find anything.
–What's Joe Clarke doing here?
–You know Joe?
I remember his picture in the papers.
He can't be here.
"Hey, he's a friend of mine."
And he's also an embarrassment to this department.
"""Then the discharge..."

"Sharon, it's not fair!"
You've been in there ages!
Get out of there.
You leave Sharon alone.
"You all right in there, Sharon?"
Yeah.
Coming.
"Ah, no, no."
There's no hurry.
"No, I've been in already."
Ohh...
"Jesus, what were you drinking last night?"
I'm going back to bed.
"Ah, yeah, go on."
Good girl.
"I'll go on without you, what?"
- What's up with her?
- You shut your mouth.
Get in there and get your clothes on.
"Go down to get your breakfast... and get a bleedin' job for yourself, right?"
"Sharon, we're going to have to tell them."
"Stop it, will yous?"
We don't want to be tripping over each other.
I don't know of any operation.
You recognise this guy?
No.
Is he American?
Don't know.
He's not in our database.
- You mind running him for me?
- Sure.
No problem.
Appreciate it.
- How long you been stationed here?
- Six months.
"- How do you like Vancouver, so far?"
- I love it.
You're with Organised Crime?
I'm the director of the OCU.
I've got a question for you.
Maybe you could help me out.
We just started an operation on a biker gang up here.
Got a long reach into the States.
Maybe you could share some intel?
You're talking about the Disciples?
A guy named Dante.
Dante Ribiso.
They're some bad boys.
I'll put together an intel package for you.
Let me see what I can find out about this guy.
- Give me a couple of days.
- Sounds good.
There she is!
- Show me what you got.
I haven't stepped out
What about your apprentice?
If we're that skillful... we'd have rebelled long ago!
Get out!
"Okay, okay."
"Master, I'll take you to bed"
"Big Brother, Fan's death is questionable"
Do you think it's the old fart that did this?
That's not possible
The old fool does not have that ability!
It must be someone from the outside!
Who could it be?
The killer is in the temple
I am waiting for you
Very good!
Very good!
It's better than a stage performance!
Relax
You are too slow
Watch out!
Look clearly
"So it's you, you short-lived asshole!"
Don't be so mean!
Don't you want to know who killed Fan San?
Who is he?
Watch carefully!
I am the killer
Why did you kill him?
Because Jin Tianyun is my friend
Jin Tianyun!
How nasty!
I'm still a virgin!
"Honest, that night, when you walked out of my place I made as if I didn't care."
I did care.
"After you'd gone, I kept wishing you'd come back."
"Truly, I did."
"This man, Hyde, will never trouble you again."
I give you my word.
How do you know?
He'll come back!
He'll come back and kill me!
No.
He won't come back.
I'll see to it.
"Oh, you don't know him, sir."
"Oh, you don't know him."
"He ain't human, he ain't!"
I gave you my word.
You'll never see Hyde again.
You must believe me.
"I believe you, sir."
I believe you.
You must go now.
"Yes, sir."
"Yes, sir."
"For a moment, I thought..."
Goodbye.
"I'm sorry, I shouldn't have admitted such a person."
I didn't know she was hysterical.
That's all right.
I'm glad you admitted her.
"Now, about the wedding, we've got a lot to discuss."
- We've never been married before.
- Let's not get upset.
"Legs, up to here!"
I'll think about it.
"Good, don't take so long!"
I've got to drink something.
Why are you coming here?
I walk around the whole day  and think about how I could live.
I come back here and wait...
"Mainly, I've been waiting on you, my dear."
You've really downsized quite a bit.
My father started all that.
I've told someone about you.
Could you imagine living here with us?
He'd like to take a look at the hotel.
Why?
He could do a lot more for you.
Why are you coming here?
You leave everything open.
"Very nice, without any obligations."
We have the ability to speak.
What is it that you do all day?
What do I do?
But you're still staying?
I'm still staying.
It's so silent here.
No singing.
Where is Emilia?
She's taking a walk.
What?
It's one in the morning.
I have no idea.
Perhaps she's singing outside now.
What do you do before you come here?
Be a dear and grab me a double skinny vanilla milkshake.
"Oh, right."
And don't forget.
With sprinkles on top.
Love sprinkles on top.
Stop!
Are you deliberately trying to sabotage me?
You know what's amazing about you people?
Nothing.
"You wouldn't know ""amazing"" if it sat up in your soup."""
This is garbage.
"In fact, that's where garbage belongs."
"Now write me an amazing hit song, or start looking for a new job."
"Because that's what I'll be doing, if you don't come up with a hit for..."
"Livi, darling."
"Oh, my little sweetie."
"Oh, little Cookie, all cooped up inside here."
We need to get you outside for a walk.
"Yes, we do."
"Looking fabulous as always, Livi."
"Spare me the soft soap, Megan."
Let's hear that new song you told me about.
"Well, um, you see..."
Yes?
Um...

Hmm?
- It's gonna take some work.
"- I appreciate that, Lucy."
Don't say I never did anything foryou.
I neverwould.
Did she say anything before--
She wished that things had turned out differently.
Tell me about Doug and Jasper.
On theirway to a new life in an undisclosed location.
He's gonna have to come back for trial.
[ Sighs ] Wanted you to have that.
Andl have anotherpresent foryou.
It's your new identity.
- It shouldgetyou to D.C. orwherever.
- [ Sighs ]
"Thankyou, Lucy."
It's the least I could do.
What about your car?
"Whatever it costs, I want to reimburse you."
Don't worry about it.
I'm not gonna be in Miami that much longer.
- I'll seeyou again?
- Maybe.
- Lucy.
- Sam.
"So, is thatyour new I.D.?"
Yep.
I could get into the White House pressroom with these documents.
- I don't thinkyou're gonna need it.
- Why is that?
Just got a call from a buddy... one ofthe guys I asked to keep an eye out on this burn notice business.
- You might want to rethinkyour trip to D.C.
- Why?
You were the one that taught me that.
- Mm-hm.
- What are you really doing here?
You caused quite a stir.
"You blew into town, saw everyone except for the man who made you."
- I'm a little hurt.
- I'm so sorry.
Did you bring the device?
[CHUCKLES]
- Ow.
"- Heh, heh."
- What are you doing with John Gilbert?
- We dated when we were young.
- He was a little bit in love with me.
"- I'm sure, one of the many."
"Now, this invention, what do you want with it?"
"Oh, me personally?"
I don't want anything with it.
I'm just doing what I'm told.
"You know, Damon, we're on the same side."
"- Oh, yeah?"
Which side is that?
- Katherine's.
She wants John Gilbert to have the device.
I think that you know that she's not happy when she doesn't get what she wants.
- Why are you doing her dirty work?
- Don't kill the messenger.
We both know that you can't control Katherine.
- She does what she wants.
- Pfft.
And so do I.
"- Oh, really, Damon?"
I never should have let him stay.
I should have dragged him into that bus.
It's not your fault.
All that talk about death's sweet embrace.
You know what?
It's not sweet.
It hurts.
Did Gene have any allergies?
I can ask his mother.
Absinthe and wine are the only things Lexia drinks so it's all we serve.
"I've got to say I could go for a tequila every now and then, you know?"
"And Gene Hansen, what was he drinking the night he died?"
Absinthe.
Anything else?
Not that I know of.
Drugs?
In a nightclub?
Half the kids here are using.
Did Lexia know that?
She'd have to be blind not to.
"Yeah, she sure would."
Now this is truly a surprise.
"I need your help, detective."
I don't do parking tickets.
It's not about parking tickets.
Really?
"Well, you must want to know what to get Vicki for her birthday."
You know what?
"Between you and me, she really loves kitten posters."
This was a mistake.
"Hey, hey, Fitzroy, come on."
"Hey, come on."
- Only because you lick the alphabet.
- He what?
He licks the alphabet to fight the monotony.
"A, B, C..."
"Bon appetit, Frank."
- What is going on?
- It's these two studs' latest thing.
- You lick the alphabet?
It's...
- It's a bit gross.
- How unromantic.
You do that?
- Casper taught Frank to do it.
- I could've thought of it myself.
"- Look, buster!"
Don't discuss our sex life with him!
I didn't.
Then how does he know what you do?
- I don't know...
- I won't have it!
- Let me finish...
- No!
"You fuck retards and lick the alphabet, you jerk!"
"- Please don't move your leg, Casper."
- I thought you were handicapped.
- I'm sorry about the retard.
- That was a lousy thing to do.
- Golf tomorrow?
- You bet.
It's nice and peaceful.
All you hear is an...
- What do you call that bird?
Yeah.
It really is.
In a way.
"Oh, in every way."
I wanted a slightly different image so I thought maybe Bollywood Elvis would be good.
"I'd get a butler, but he can be an anteater and..."
my best friend's got four arms.
"Is it the next step from the Boosh, would you say?"
I think for me.
Julian wanted to go off and do some straight theatre and explore that.
I wanted to get hold of the animation side of it.
We'd the Moon and the 2D animation in the Boosh and I wanted to see how far you could take that.
So the guy that I work with did the Moon and animation in the Boosh.
And I met him at art school.
"The brief was to try to make the most psychedelic, weirdest show ever."
You've fulfilled your brief.
DOORBELL Oh!
"Noel, Noel..."
It's Noel's House Party!
I wonder who THIS could be.
CHEERING
Hello!
Look at you!
Hello.
..Sarah Harding!
Look at you.
Hi.
Look at this.
"You two know each other, I assume?"
"Yeah, well, kind of."
Yeah.
What does that mean?
It was a good plan.
"But if there's one thing that I've learned in life, it's to always have a backup."
That would be you.
Your immunity makes you a perfect plan B.
You wouldn't turn from the bite.
You wouldn't die.
But you would be able to do one very important thing.
"Do you know what that is, Lydia?"
(distorted) Lydia!
a project by @olivethewenno enjoy watching
"Is that you, Ines?"
I said...
Don't play with fire!
You'll get burned!
It doesn't hurt?
It won't hurt me?
"Oh God, my dear!"
Who did it?
What happened?
50 hours in surgical room.
That's crazy.
Even for you.
Do you think he will forgive me?
He will.
But I won't.
Is it time to get him?
For me?
What do you mean?
"A week with you, in 10 years of our marriage!"
- Anais...
- That's all I get.
- Deal.
And stop bothering me about my hair.
We're interfering with your personal life?
I'm closing it ... relax.
God knows what he'll start thinking in his head now.
"Hey, what happened?"
"- There is nothing wrong, man."
Relax.
- Not that.
What about the booklets?
I've solved that problem.
He'll send them home.
69 Rafet.
It's super.
"Come on, I will take care of this."
It was obvious that something like this would happen.
"I'm telling you, I'll take care of it."
Don't do this.
"Oh, this is bad."
Can you please put yourjacket on?
"Ok, I'm putting my jacket on."
"Wait, I'll end this issue."
What's this guy's name?
Mert!
Yes?
"Hi, this is Zeynep Erez."
I'm Mert's new guidance counselor.
"If you have some time, can I have a word with you?"
Don't feel sad dear.
"If he wants to get divorced, then divorce him."
Don't say it like that dear.
It just hurts.
"- Don't answer it, Stokes!"
- May I enquire why not?
"They're wearing dinner jackets, we've got to change."
"- Come on, James."
"- Very good, sir."
Answer the door and attend to them.
We'll be right down.
"Yes, Mr Twelvetrees."
"Oh, er, good evening."
"We're a bit early, I'm afraid."
"Oh, that's all right."
Come in.
(Door closes)
I'll take your hats and coats.
Nice weather we've been having.
I was saying to my wife this morning what nice weather we've been having.
- It rained last Thursday.
"-Yes, but apart from that."
- It didn't rain very much.
- No.
Came through my roof.
Nearly had the ceiling down.
I'm sure his lordship's maid doesn't want to hear our domestic problems.
"I don't mind, I'm very sympathetic."
"This way, please, and I'll announce you."
Just look at this place.
All got through the sweat of our labours.
"Don't start, Jock."
We've only just got through the door.
- Mr Foster.
"- (Cissy) Good evening, Mr Foster."
- Mr Barnes.
Get some sleep.
Then you'll feel better.
"- Asger, can't you stay a while?"
- It's Saturday.
"Business, you know."
Just for a while.
I never did anything right.
Never.
Nothing.
I never did anything right.
Never.
Nothing.
I never did anything right.
Never.
The burn goes from my forehead down across the cheek.
I had three operations in Holland.
"It won't get any better, they say."
They took skin from my leg and put it on my face.
But my looks are of no importance.
"They are to others, but not to me."
I don't care if people stare at me.
"I'm not the same anymore, and I never will be."
It happened in the Pacific.
There was an explosion and a fire.
Many were killed.
My best friend was a ship's cook.
He died.
The Filipinos couldn't swim.
They died.
I didn't die.
I don't like to talk about it.
"I dived for as long as I could, but finally I had to get some air."
Come on.
Come on.
Ten blade.
Retractor.
"Carter, start compressions while I cross-clamp the aorta."
"Yeah, I got it."
- She's clamped.
- What happened?
- Abdominal bleed.
She coded.
- Start an atrial line.
- I need two 15 French cannulas.
"- Mark, little girl's coding in 2."
"Hit-and-run, recent onset of abdominal pain."
Crashed and went into asystole.
We've infused four units of O-neg and epi and cross-clamped her.
- Mesenteric rupture?
- Probably.
Nothing you could've done.
"Peter, I'll take over."
Hypothermic kid in Trauma 1.
Needs femoral lines for a bypass.
Infuse another unit.
"- Peter, it's about damn time!"
- Cut down!
We're trying internal paddles.

- Charging.
Clear.
- Charge 20.
- Charging.
Clear.
That's rough. I better go.
- ls Sharon here?
"- Yes, and so is dad."
"But he's upstairs lying down, he said not to disturb him."
"He said we should send out for some pizza, right?"
"But of course he didn't give me any money, he's trying to starve us."
Danielle!
"He's just upset, you know, about M r."
Cherski and everything.
- Go get your money box.
- No way!
"J ust lay it out, dad will pay you back later."
- You lay it out.
- l don't have any money!
is there anything to eat?
We're sending out for pizza.
"So, how's your dad doing?"
- How much money do you have?
- None. I'm seriously hungry.
"H i, is Sharon still here?"
"Oh, good. I mean, hi."
- l don't believe this.
- Believe it.
"- Hey, let Brian pay!"
- l don't mind.
- Pay for what?
"- Yes, why not?"
"I mean, maybe he doesn't mind paying for it."
We were going to send for pizza.
"I mean, good. I do have plenty of cash on me, it's no problem."
- What's no problem?
- We were going to send for pizza!
-Thomas!
"How you, pal?"
How are you?
-Super.
We met in detention.
You have to help me.
What you need?
-Weapons.
-Good.
Explosives.
We will fix it.
Here you are.
Writings from all Garnierovih hearing.

"Maybe gonna sounded pretentious, but I think that the criminal zapisnièar Court weak to me."
-You bet!

Excellent!
A country that is so held to archive is not completely lost.
Hello!
Remember me?
What do you want?
-Shut up!
-You are wrong!
I talked Jorkalom.

Now you will awaken as Lucy.
"Now tell me, Lucy, is the night's ritual a dream or a reality?"
I...
I don't...
Ugh!
A dream?
Are you trying to fail?
Are you doing this on purpose?
Are you trying to spite me?
The men and women have seemed very pleased with my performance.
They've been pleased.
They've been pleased with your performance?
This isn't a performance.
I don't want you to act.
I want you to become.
"Ah, you mean Monsieur Chopin."
How clever.
"It's very rare to hear him play, you know."
The Duchess d'Antan is having him for a whole fortnight at her house in Angers.
I couId only wish I were a fly on the wall.
Except that they already have crowds of files down there.
I do find the provinces beastIy.
- (applause)
- Monsieur Liszt will play next.
"- Ah, George."
I read your...
- In a minute.
George!
"You'II want to sit over here, my dear."
The respectable people are over there.
- could you point out Monsieur Chopin?
- Chopin?
But he left.
Don't you know him?
He's frail as a holy wafer.
Look at those hypocrites.
They've shunned me all evening.
I'm thrilled not to be one of them any more.
Their lives are so boring.
You see?
Every single one is throbbing for him.
They know perfectly well why I ran off with him.
For his teeth.

charles!
The half you don't need.
What's the matter?
You look like you haven't slept in a month.
I'm alright!
"I just found it easy when it was every night, at least you know what's coming."
"Well, never having known the joys of married love myself."
The bombing!
Ah!
I thought perhaps it was the long treks with the husband in the provinces.
Not really...it's difficult you know.
The trains.
Oh!
What is...?
What's that?
"It's France, uncle Frank!"
It's Hitler!
Bloody what!
?
Meeting now with Mr.Swain.
We were about to issue this shooting script.
They want all of you.
"Oh, no!"
Oh!
Don't worry.
With all that studded buried.
It will be some Rear Admiral than lather with the wind speed.
Wrong for the day in question.
Ah...when did I mention.
It's at Whitehall.
The Ministry of War.
"We few, we happy few, we band of brothers."
"For he today that sheds his blood with me, shall be my brother."
"Actually, I'm not sure what they do."
They just sort of gormegan from sale to sale.
"- Excuse me, Antoinette?"
- Bob.
No.
I'm Jocelyn.
"- No, you need a bob."
"- Everybody, there's been a tragedy."
Chi Chi Chemise's fainted.
- Messages?
"- No, let's go take at that."
"- ""C'est quis pas""?"
"- Perspective, Vogue just came out."
There's an article on it just like we'll have on our next issue.
- Of course there's been a leak.
- Another leak?
Can you believe it?
It's the third issue in a row this's happened.
That is no coincidence.
There must be Yuri.
"- What's a ""Yuri""?"
"- A spy, you idiot... like Mata Hari, James Bond..."
When was the last time she ate?
"She had an apple 2 days ago, she should be fine."
Just the trauma from the article?
Maybe we should take her shoes off or something.
"Oh, my God!"
- Where are my shoes?
- Here.
We should get out of here.
"Many years of pointing, you know... ballet."
"- Oh, my God!"
But he is a responsible police officer.
I can't interfere in this matter.
And what do you think?
Will he let you go scot-free if I tell him?
"That I am his friend, doesn't mean that I have bought him out."
"Ifyou haven't done it yet, do it now. I am with you."
Meaning?
"Here's 1 ,OOO,OOO in this bag."
Tell me ifyou think the price is less.
There is no price for Vijay.
My friend is priceless.
You can't buy his honesty.
Not even for 10 million.
My friend is a man of principles.
Amazing!
He is the first lawyer I have seen in my life whose hobby is to fly an airplane.
Flying isn'tjust an hobby for Ravi.
It is his life's first romance.
His first love.
Tell me something.
- Go ahead.
"Even you must have had a first love, hadn't you?"
Yes. I did have a girlfriend.
But why do you ask?
Just nothing.
Was she in your college?
-Oh yes.
In college...in my class.
What was her name?
The name was...
Meenakshi.
Meenakshi Chatterjee.
'
And I'm killing Rambo thanks to you.
You are welcome.
Hang on...so who's guarding the grain store now?
"Oh, yeah, no... no one."
"Oh, shit!"
Stop!
Stop!
Stop it!
Oi!
Oi!
"Well, well, well."
The Professor.
"What brings you out here, then?"
"Oh, just concluding..."
"you know, a big sale."
Pleasure doing business with you!
Uh-huh?
How much did they steal?
Not much.
"A bit, yeah."
"Quite a lot, actually."
"It's fine, though."
I can handle it.
Of course you can.
"If you'll excuse me, I've just bought darling little Rex."
I've got a busy day of stroking ahead of me.
"Out of interest, what would you do if you were me?"
"Some kind of nose job, I imagine."
About the burglary.
"That's easy - make a few cutbacks, fire some of the fat ones."
"And if you're very low on grain, you're gonna have to raise the price."
Just a thought.
I think it's time you take this to a higher power.
You got nothing to say?
Nope.
All good.
Father Bardini says he hasn't seen you in months.
So much for the seal of confession.
That's only inside the box.
Good to know.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.
You had your reasons.
I didn't want you in the middle.
"Oh, honey, when it comes to you kids and your father,"
I'm always in the middle.
How bad is it gonna be?
Do you remember the time you and Stevie painted Richie purple?
"Oh, damn it!"
You didn't ask his advice.
You joined Internal Affairs.
And don't swear in the Lord's house.
I didn't think I had to ask his permission.
How long have you known your father?
It was my decision.
Do you want him to forgive you or not?
For becoming a detective?
For living my life?
Sorry.
What do I do?
Bake him a cake.
Chocolate.
A cake?
Seriously?
I don't have time to wait for a giant to fall asleep.
The powder Mulan gave us...
we need to use it.
We gotta knock him out.
"Well, that's riskier."
Than waiting for a giant to fall asleep when we need him to?
Point taken.
"Ooh, you're a tough lass."
You'd make a hell of a pirate.
Who's Milah on the tattoo?
Someone from long ago.
Where is she?
She's gone.
Gold.
Rumplestiltskin.
"He took more than your hand from you, didn't he?"
That's why you want to kill him.
"For someone who's never been in love, you're quite perceptive, aren't you?"
Maybe I was once.
I got doughnuts.
I got jelly.
(Chuckles)
What's wrong?
Nothing.
"No, no."
Hey.
What's wrong?
This was on the wall at the post office.
I didn't even know they did that still.
When did this happen?
I was a janitor in Phoenix... this high-end jewelry place.
The manager was a drunk.
"Make that two epitaphs, because I'II kill you if I find..."
"Oh, my God, you're hurt!"
You're bleeding.
Yes.
Be a dear.
Ask UrsuIa if she's got something for a bandage.
Of course.
Don't move.
No.
(lock clicks)
Bastard!
(gentle piano music)
(dog barking)
(gasps)
(yells)
"Oh, don't stop!"
"Monsieur Chopin, you were in the middle of a miracle."
I'm not quite yet cured.
How did you get in?
Who are you?
I am your slave.
And you have summoned me with your music.
"Oh, yes."
I think I know who you are.
I have heard you described.
"Madame Sand, rumour has it you are a woman, and so I must ask you to leave my private chambers."
Have I offended your modesty?
I apologise.
- play me one more piece and I'II go.
- This is ridiculously improper!
And frightening as well.
please leave now.
Hard-boiled types only have last names.
- Buckley.
- Taken.
And what were you before you became Cole?
Catherine Pugh.
- Catherine?
- Catrin's the Welsh version.
"It was his idea. ""A beautiful Welsh girl deserves a beautiful Welsh name."""
Where would you have drawn the line?
"""Cardiff Cole."
Caerphilly Cole.
"Coalmine Cole."""
- Hey!
Those were my chips!
"Right, Catherine Pugh, you're coming with me."
All right.
"- Brannigan, Johnnie, positions."
- No.
"Uh, no, thank you."
- Let...
Let me.
"Quiet, please."
"Quiet, please, everyone."
Thank you.
I'll give you a finger click for a sniper shot.
"Just a very quiet click, please."
"It's hard to explain to a non-actor, but I want to react to the sniper up there and not the click down here."
Do you see?
"In fact, there's no chance of firing a real gun up there, is there?"
- No.
- Right.
Going for a take.
You three are very punctual
"Jin Tianyun, the three of us... have nothing to do with you"
Why do you call us here?
Because I can't stand to see...
Murderers and rapists
So you want to be a hero?
I just want to give you a little punishment
T o chop off all your right hands
So that in future you'll behave properly
"T o the hero, I raise a toast!"
No!
Drink it first!
Stop!
Are you okay?
"Y es, yes!"
It's funny
"Huang, you're really something!"
Go!
Don't let him run away!
Chase
I'm coming!
Again!
You okay?
You jerk!
Big brother!
What happened?
It's him!
"Nothing, nothing, it's a mistake!"
Mistake?
I think you did intend to touch her
No wonder wet nurse said you're always hungry
Don't regard Sister as your wet nurse
It's our honor that Brother Y an invites us here
We'll do whatever you need us to do!
"Come, come!"
"Gentlemen, help yourself!"
"Don't be shy, feel free to eat!"
Who are you?
Where is that woman?
She is cooking in the kitchen
I'm the youngest apprentice of Thunderstorm
Youngest apprentice?
T ake that old fart here
And see if this kid is lying
Y es!
Lying?
I'm telling you the truth
My name is Gao Jian
How come I've never seen you before?
Master said that I didn't practice well
So he kicked me out.
I just came back to see how he is doing.
If you release me
I'll pour wine for you!
"Master, Master!"
How are you?
"Master, I'm Gao Jian!"
Gao Jian!
"Zhengzong, is this one of your apprentice?"
Y es!
"Master, so I can be your apprentice again?"
T ake him out.
He's not allowed here... without my permission!
"Dad, take the medicine!"
OLDER TED:
"There was no ""next time."""
Maggie's window never opened again.
Hey!
"Hey, I got it!"
"That country bar, Giddy-ups!"
The overalls have gotta work there.
Wingman me?
I don't want Giddy-ups.
I want that.
"I forgot what it feels like to chase the real thing, but I think I'm ready again."
Yeah.
Let me tell you where I'm at.
I wanna have sex with a girl so I can take off these overalls.
Come on.
Come on!
"Ted, you gotta help me!"
I gotta get these damn things off!
MRS. DOUGLAS:
Hey there.
I just love your overalls.
MARSHALL:
Dear 60-year-old Marshall.
By now you should be working somewhere that's making the world a better place.
Or at least trying to.
"No pressure, dude."
"I mean, sir."
"Also, if time travel is possible, maybe you could give me a little sign on Tuesday, December 8th, at 8:29 p.m."
"So, someone sent back these chicken wings, because they were too hot."
"And I'm like, ""Too hot?"
"Are you crazy?"""
"So, free wings."
We have a warrant to search the premises.
Thank you.
Hi.
Thank you for meeting me.
I didn't know I had a choice.
I want to take you somewhere.
"You know, you can't just take me out of class because you decided to just take a stab at being a mother today."
"You know, like, I could have tests and stuff."
Do you have a test today?
- No.
- Okay.
"Well, then, come on."
Come in!
Christ.
Did I order you?
No.
Mary did.
She hired me to help make sure that you stay clean.
Said you had somewhere to be later.
"I-I don't know if I'm hallucinating or dying, but either way, I like the view."
"Hello, Angel."
It's Annie.
And you look exactly like I thought you would.
Dashing.
Depraved.
"Okay, that's enough standing."
Come on.
"Now, sit."
Stay.
Drink this.
It's a protein shake.
I don't want it.
She's still extremely beautiful.
Cheers!
Cheers.
"Why was I at that wedding, Jørgen?"
You knew.
I didn't know.
I didn't know you were that Jacob.
- I don't believe that.
- Well I can't change anything now.
What do you want?
- The honest or the official answer?
- I'd like the honest answer.
I'm just a good person.
There's not much in this.
We better complain.
- I don't need any more.
- We need another bottle.
It's the best way to get to know people.
Another bottle.
- I don't think that would be wise.
- You're not paid to think.
Either bring another bottle or bring your boss.
Understand?
Or should I ask him to translate?
- I need to go.
- Why?
We'd like another drink.
- What's the problem?
- We need a bottle of schnapps.
We can't serve you when you're so drunk.
So drunk?
I've only just gotten started.
To find the man who ordered my father and little brother murdered.
I found him.
His name is Pham Son Ti.
And I will give him to you.
When?
"One week from tonight, at the old Costeau Plantation."
Colonel Cai knows where it is.
How much do you know about this girl?
Her father and General Ti's father grew up together.
Their families were very close.
Even before he moved to Hanoi he had more than a friendly interest in Lin.
Do you trust her?
Of course.
She's my brother's wife.
"Let's see, it's 0400."
That means we'll hit the drop zone around a little after sunrise.
Everything set?
Your gear's on board with Colonel Cai's.
KIRBY:
Thank you.
Let's get aboard.
MULDOON:
You heard the man.
Stick formation.
Let's go.
- Keep your head down.
- Don't worry.
"Colonel Cai, you haven't said a word all night."
You know why?
He's never jumped before.
First one's easy.
It's the second one that's hard to get them to make.
Seeing these people...
Nagasaki...
That day...
I can feel it.
Okay.
"Even if it's okay for you, it's still too short for Clark."
His feet will stick out.
He's the same size as John Wayne.
How about using this to add length?
We did make fools of ourselves.
Don't you think so?
I guess you're right.
I really feel ashamed.
Where's Clark?
He stepped out into the garden with Grandma.
I wonder if it's all right.
I wonder if they can communicate.
I think it's all right.
They seem to be talking just fine.
I am terribly sorry for not knowing about Uncle.
I'm really sorry.
That's all right.
You were born and live in Nagasaki.
And still... we didn't realize it.
That was wrong of us.
We were wrong.
That's all right.
My father told me...
"""Clark, go..."
"""and do whatever you can for your aunt. """
That's what he said.
That's all right.
And take this cucumber.
Nefedov gave it to me.
Eat!
"Ok, you'll have it later."
"OK, I'll go."
May I?
Katya!
Thanks.
It is so good to be a lieutenant.
The comm girls wash your shirts.
That's right.
"Well, Malakhov, some people have bread on their butter and some - pains in their asses."
"-Actually, this line does not rhyme."
- But it is true in principle.
I do not know ifwe negotiate this hill or not...
But there will be no way out.
That's for sure.
"Thanks fortelling this, corporal."
I know.
The next one.
"The next one, please!"
Artillery lance corporal Averchenko reporting for service.
to adjust the fire of our guns.
Why are you so young?
Are you the most experienced one?
"No, thejolliest one."
The company is packed up with jolly people.
Take Malakhov for example.
Come here!
They couldn't have picked an older soldier!
Idiots!
Gretchen!
I wiIIjust come back.
Dont hang up.
Good morning!
Here are the papers and here are your90 Iakhs!
Come in!
"please, come in!"
Come in!
"please, come in!"
"Man, how did you know that I will.."
..definitely make a deal on 90 lakhs?
"Dhanraj, I know how much each man is worth!"
I know pressure points for everyone!
Take this.
You know there is a saying in our Gujrati.
Dont make a deal with a man to..
..whom you dont understand!
But I am making this deal because..
..I can get you guys!
Because its profitable for me!
Take this.
Just tell me one thing.
Does your boss want to start a price war?
"No, he is planning totally different!"
He wants to throw down those who are at the top!
Good day!
"And enjoy your self, please!"
The money has arrived!
The money has arrived!
Its tune is soothing!
Its tune is soothing!
The money has arrived!
Coming!
So you are.
Okay.
But I'm going to talk to her then.
"Danny, I could run away."
"After my party, I mean."
Maybe to San Francisco.
If you want to.
If I want to?
"Oh, little one, I'd run off to Anywhereland with you."
But I don't have any money.
That's easy.
I can't really have any of my money until they say I'm ready for it or something.
But I can get tickets on a plane.
I can charge them.
"After we're gone, she'll never know where to look for us."
"All right, Danny?"
"""All right, Danny?"""
"All right, Merle."
Who needs money?
"Anywhereland, here we come."
"No, silly."
I meant San Francisco.
I knew what you meant.
[chattering]
"Wait here for me, Corbett."
I'll only be a minute.
"Whatever you say, Miss."
[no audible dialogue]
Your conduct is absolutely disgraceful.
"If there is one thing I can't stand, it's a sneak."
Who told you?
"That's quite beside the point, Merle."
(LAUGHS)
(CLEARS THROAT)
Blood of the Jabberwocky.
You have our everlasting gratitude.
And for your efforts on our behalf...
-Will this take me home?
-If that is what you choose.
You could stay.
What an idea.
"A crazy, mad, wonderful idea."
But I can't.
"There are questions I have to answer, things I have to do."
Be back again before you know it.
You won't remember me.
Of course I will.
How could I forget?
"Hatter, why is a raven like a writing desk?"
I haven't the slightest idea.
"Fairfarren, Alice."
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)
She left me standing there without an answer.
"A case of nerves, no doubt."
-Alice.
-LORD ASCOT:
Good Lord.
-Are you all right?
-What happened to you?
I fell down a hole and hit my head.
"I'm sorry, Hamish."
I can't marry you.
You're not the right man for me.
And there's that trouble with your digestion.
"Do you swear to tell the truth... the whole truth, nothing but the truth, so help you God?"
-Yes.
-Be seated.
"-State your name, please."
-Allison MacKenzie.
"Miss MacKenzie, how long have you known Selena Cross?"
Ever since I was a child.
We went all through school together.
Miss Cross is my best friend.
"Ms. MacKenzie, you've testified that when you saw Lucas beating Selena... you thought that your presence prevented things from going further."
-I know it did.
"-You don't know, you assume."
"Well, he was embarrassed to find me watching."
How many times did Lucas hit Selena?
-Once.
-Once?
"Now, did he hit her with his fist or a weapon?"
"-Well, it was kind of a slap."
-A slap?
"Have you ever been slapped, Miss Mackenzie?"
-Yes.
-By a stranger?
-No.
-By a member of the family?
-Do I have to answer this?
"-I'm sorry, but you do."
By my mother.
As hard a blow as Selena Cross' stepfather gave her?
-No.
-How could you tell?
I don't think so.
"You don't really know what happened inside that house, do you?"
"- No, you're right, and I don't."
"That doesn't mean I feel that way now, though."
"No, now you feel guilty."
You're still scared.
You're just scared of what I'll do to you.
"Well, that's true."
- You were really terrified?
"- Jenna, I am terrified."
"So am I, you idiot."
"I'm scared I'm gonna be a bad mother, and you won't love me, and you'll ignore me, and..."
"I won't want you, and the whole thing will fall apart and I won't know what to do."
"- Baby, that's not gonna happen."
- How do you know?
Because I know.
"- You know now, you didn't know before?"
- Yes.
I know now.
Were you telling me the truth last night?
You didn't sleep with her?
I was telling you the truth.
But then I went back.
Fuck you!
Jenna.
Calm down!
Listen to me.
I'm telling you the truth.
- Get the fuck out!
- I'm telling you the truth!
Get out!
Get out!
Get out!
Get out!
"Give him a firm foundation, and he won't disappoint us."
Sure!
Pervading bright future!
We'll call you Ming-kai.
You'll be our Wu-tang priest.
Everlasting Buddha!
Everlasting Buddha!
Thanks for your teaching!
"Cheng-ching, you'll practice with Ming-kai."
Yes!
Stick!
Use your wrist!
Yes!
Don't let him hurt you at all.
Yes!
Ming-kai!
Please excuse me!
Your 8-divine Sword is superb now.
I think you can beat Shaolin.
Tat-chi!
Monk Ming-dun!
"Tat-chi, your Chin Kang Fist has progressed remarkably."
"And if you can improve your physical strength as well, nobody can beat you."
Thanks for your kind teaching.
You never practice.
Sir?
You always act as if it's for real.
You must be hiding something.
"Actually, the real reason why I wanted to join the Shaolin was purely to get revenge."
"Amida Buddha, who is your enemy?"
Wu-tang!
Wu-tang?
"Hi, sweetie."
"See, why did you just call me ""sweetie""?"
- We always call each other that.
- Why?
"All right, look, I wanna say something, okay?"
"We call each other ""sweetie"" all the time."
And we fall asleep on the phone after talking for hours.
I washed your hair for you after you had shoulder surgery and everything.
And it's like we're together.
- I know that I've been...
"- No, hold on a second."
Let me finish.
I think maybe this is my fault because maybe I wasn't clear about exactly what I want.
So let me...
Let me be clear.
I love hanging out.
But I'm so attracted to you.
I just...
I want both.
I don't know what happened or why we stopped.
I don't care.
Okay.
- What?
- Okay.
"No, I'm talking about really doing this."
Like a full-on relationship.
Right.
With me.
Yeah.
A bunch of gay people put you up to this?
Stop talking.
DEVON:
We'll crawl in.
It's probably time I was gettin' home.
"No, but it's still early."
"All right, then."
It's only a block away.
"Well, it feels like you're runnin' away."
No.
Just walkin'.
"'Night, John Sellers."
"Goodnight, Zelda Sayre."
♫♫
"It's the damnedest thing, Townsend."
"Zelda writes how much she misses me, and then she says that she's going off to Cotillion with Peyton, Patton, Perry..."
A girl has to keep her options open.
[scoffs]
What do you write back?
"Frankly, I think it's extremely inconsiderate of her to even expect me to."
"I mean, she's the one that's insisting that"
I rewrite my novel before she'll marry me.
Which you've done.
And I'm doing again.
"Once I get off to a good start, that is."
Hm.
I just need to show her that I can do it.
[clears throat]
"Hell, she knows I can."
I know I can.
But until then... why not send her a note?
"She's quite aware of how I feel, Townsend."
- In my experience...
- [chuckles]
Women like to be reminded.
I'm so thirsty.
Life is so wonderful!
"Ah, Reinhold!"
"I'd like to introduce my friend, Count Casanova."
Let the count sit down.
"Count, these are three prize-winning beauties of Pankow."
Let me talk to my friend a minute.
"My dear Reinhold, I'm always so happy to see you."
You need another man?
You'd need a radiator to thaw that one out!
"- Shall I tickle you, darling?"
- Give us a smile!
- Pay no attention to them.
- You're quite the ladies' man.
"Scram for a while, girls."
These dames mean nothing to me.
"But at home I have a real pearl, a treasure, a jewel."
Why don't you bring her along?
"No, better to leave her home."
No need to drag women everywhere.
Of course!
What do you think?
Those crooks steal and cheat.
- Crooks?
And Franz frightens me too.
Franz?
He's done time too.
Tegel.
Four years.
Prison.
That's right ― Franz.
"I tell you, she's wonderful."
Let me help you.
Funk the groovin' thang whistlin'
As I rip my rhymes
Time and time again struttin' and in the summertime
"So screw it, strip down and be generic"
Strip down and be a passenger Strip down and be a messenger
In asking' why I'm born I come up blank in the winter
In asking' why I'm born I come up on when I'm on her
- It's time to find the kind
"- My summer, his summer"
I'm Kumar.
Vanessa.
You're still not reading that poem.
And then I kiss my stoney baby
"My stoney, my stoney"
My stoney baby
My stoney
My stoney baby
Kumar.
My stoney baby
Kumar.
Kumar.
Kumar.
- Kumar.
- Yeah.
What's going on?
"We're in Birmingham, Alabama."
Are we supposed to be here?
What's going on?
"- Why did you bring us here, dude?"
"- What do you mean, why did l--"
"You were supposed to be following the directions, asshole."
It never occurred to me to get married.
You know I've never been in love in my life?
Is something wrong with me?
There must have been something wrong with your husband.
"Oh, he was alright."
I just didn't love him.
Love is a very unsatisfactory thing anyway.
Life is a regular battle.
There.
Chuck!
Chuck!
What's the matter?
"Chuck, he stole my money."
"Wait, I'll get him."
Chuck!
"Alright, get back."
Back on the curb.
"Watch out, let me through!"
Get out of my way!
Chuck!
Chuck!
"Oh, no..."
The man suddenly darted out in front of the truck.
I couldn't miss him.
Is he dead?
"Yes, well, I'm due at the hospital in the next thirty minutes."
"Yes, I've tried the drug out."
It's nothing short of miraculous.
You know they're going to announce it at the Medical Convention in Atlantic City.
"Oh, by the way, what's the stock selling at?"
Two dollars?
I think I'll have my broker tomorrow morning buy me about three hundred shares.
"Dude, rule number one; we will stop calling her ""girl."""
Really?
Why is that?
"We used to say it before, what happened?"
Things have changed.
Watch your mouth if you don't want to mess up our mood.
What are you saying?
"Dude, we barely convinced him."
Take it easy.
"Okay, fine."
I won't say anything.
We're blessed.
What's up with your hair?
Tie it up.
Hey 3012 Mert.
"Sir, I give up."
"I've forgotten the way of the school, but... you haven't forgotten my school number."
Do you really know all of our numbers?
"Shut up, you ill-mannered wretch."
Sure I do.
"This is 6024 Sinan, 5947 Kaan, 6813 Gamze, 5018 Uluc."
Fix your tie.
Well done!
"Let's hope for the best, sir."
You were a businessman; what happened?
What happened with your job?
"I took a medical report, sir."
I'm on holiday.
"We'd better go to our class, sir."
"As you know, the bell has rung."
Really?
Are you serious?
Your friend has a powerful enemy.
It's open season on her and I wanted to be the one to do it.
"VICKI, IT'S ME!"
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN HEAR THIS!
IT'S WINTER!
SHE'S SOME KIND OF DEMON.
WATCH OUT!
You're too late to save your friend.
I'm over here!
Nope!
Here!
- What are you?
- What I am.
- You know.
- Demon.
"There are all kinds of us, with all kinds of hungers."
What are you doing slumming it down here?
Nothing is without purpose.
"You want me, right?"
Why'd you kill the kids?
"I hook them on the bottle, then move them up to the spike."
That's when I feed all their sweet juices.
I had to sacrifice a few to get your attention.
"If your kind get too much of the bug in them, my little ones go crazy and they feed, too."
"That's kind of a win-win, right?"
That tickled.
Darkness is waiting.
Let it wait.
"It'll take a lot more than that to beat me, bitch!"
Henry?
Sorry I'm late.
Sweet ride.
A truck will be coming by this afternoon.
If you're just going to give it away...
"If you'll excuse me, Mrs. Shrike."
I'm in a bit of a hurry.
I like to report a hit-and-run.
I'm still gonna need to record your statement.
"Later, right now I just want to..."
Just want to sleep.
Who are you?
You okay?
Don't I look okay?
If you were any thinner you wouldn't exist.
No!
Trevor?
You still got a half-hour.
I could fix you some eggs.
I'm tired.
But thanks.
"Let's go, monkeys."
"Watch your work, not your ass."
"Come on, guys."
Keep it moving.
"Yessuh, Mistah Tucker!"
Mutha-Fucker.
Why's this machine down?
Maintenance.
Takes seven minutes to power-up that mill.
"Where am I gonna make up that seven minutes, Miller?"
- From your paycheck?
"- Back off, Tucker."
You know it's against regulations.
- Was this where you got carsick?
- I think it was.
- What do you mean?
- Pete got really bad...
"Well, on this night we were towing the Yugo, and I was facing the Yugo."
So I was driving backwards outside.
It was about 15 degrees.
And you had some bad food.
It smelled like gasoline.
And I think I ate some bad flan.
- Yeah.
- Bad what?
"You know, it's the old bad flan."
- Flan?
- Yeah.
You never had flan?
Flan like the pannacotta kind of flan?
It's like the Mexican dessert.
It's just like lard.
- It's just like caramel flavored lard.
"- No, it's not."
- It's like custard.
- It's cream.
"- Yeah, it's delicious."
- It's a damn flan.
- I'm not saying that it's not good.
"- Okay, so did you get all...?"
"I threw up on the process trailer, is what happened."
- You did.
- And I didn't finish the day.
"Christo Morse, our AD, saved me."
He directed the last quarter of the day.
You don't have to be pushed by no foreigners.
There are a lot of guys in this town.
Americans who feel like you and me.
They've been giving this a lot of thought.
They can show you how to protect yourself.
Would you like to meet them?
Sure.
"But, Mr. Osgood, the stay-on lasts so much longer."
Heh-heh.
"Yeah, so I've heard."
- Anything else?
- No.
That'll be 50 cents.
Fifty cents?
For Ajax Shaving Cream?
I can buy it for 37 down the street at Molyneux's Cut Rate.
"Well, you better trade there then."
We don't cut nobody's prices or throats.
Molyneux's Cut Rate store.
"If you haven't got the stay-on kind, Mr. Osgood, I'll take this."
Milady Beautiful.
"Anything else, Mrs. Danvers?"
"Oh, a package of henna."
The good kind.
"How do you do, Mr. Taylor?"
- Hello.
"- Seen our friend, Eddie, these days?"
Yeah.
"You ain't gonna let him marry, are you?"
And why not?
"It's still a free country, ain't it?"
- That will be a dollar 39.
- Someone's desperate for a diet coke!
"- No, Simon's been attacked by a kid..."
Here?
"What did he do, headbutt him in the knee?"
No.
"Kicked him in the cock, actually, but listen..."
Please say you aren't asking me to protect you from children?
"Hmm, a bit."
"All right, Cholmondley-Warner?"
Is this your bird?
Nice to meet you.
You're just like Will said you was.
- Right.
I hope that's a compliment.
"- Oh, yeah it is."
"You wouldn't mind having a quick word with our boss Jim on the old blower, OK?"
- Please don't.
- New friend?
- From work experience.
A colleague.
- Jim for ya.
"Ignore everything he says, it's bollocks, I promise."
Hello.
Right.
"No, I'm not his girlfriend, no."
"No, we didn't have sex."
"He did, did he?"
"No, that didn't happen."
"No, I'm not a porn star."
"Charlotte, listen..."

You do this and...
Hey!
Look who's here?
We just saw your stupid little girl friend.
Had to tell about herself.
You should see her face.
Just this mornin' we got to whack a couple of clowns.
"Yea, we took our time doin' it too."
Your stupid little girlfriend looks scared than both those faggots put together.
Even when things are getting up before them.
Step aside jail-bait!
Or don't!
If you wanna be a tough guy and see what happens to you.
"Do it, do what they say, Daisy."
Can I ask you fellas something?
"- Nah, forget it."
- Come on.
Excuse me?
Please.
- Everybody!
- Please.
Very good!
But I won't get into it until you holster the hardware!
- Why would we do that?
- So you don't get tired.
"Hi, Riley."
ASHLEY:
I think the tie is a bit much.
I'm invited to his home.
I don't wanna look like a schmo.
Then maybe lose the jacket.
"You know, it's 80 degrees out."
It looks like you don't own a more seasonally-appropriate jacket.
"I don't know, I think it looks nice."
Yeah.
"Nice, just kind of sweaty."
- Philip Lewis Friedman.
- Go get 'em.
"- OK, bye."
- Bye.
- Pleasure.
- Good luck.
- Thank you.
- Fix your collar.
- Huh?
- Your collar.
Oh.
Thank you.
I'd seriously consider having a better answer to that question if I were you.
"I'm filling up notebooks, but it's nothing but worthless garbage."
Don't tell people that.
Makes you look lazy and stupid.
Got it.
That probably came out a lot crueller than I intended.
But don't make being lackadaisical and disorganised your thing.
- It sends out a message that you'll regret.
- I see.

I wanna see that.

The kind Tót family.
Oh finally.
"Tót lord,right?"
Mariska.
And she:
Ági.
"We welcome it with affection the kind major lord and we desire it, feel well in our modest home."
Very kind.
"Says Tót,it is not possible to silence this uproar?"
!
Stop it!
Yeah.
This is the good air.
This silence.
Believe it.
In constant noises and smelliness of 9 monthly a service working...
- What did I talk about?
- That in constant noise and smelliness...
That's right.
I cannot believe in the fact that I am at home
I know everything as your kind son wrote the things though.
"That Bábony... this the valley of Bartalapos kind Tót, we behind my back?"

Good.
"I ask it from you, live so, as if I would not be here."
"- Relax, man!"
"Gary, Gary, can we please just get out of here?"
Please?
What the hell?
Sorry I lost my temper back there.
"No, it's okay."
You were just defending my honor.
I don't feel so good.
Get you a glass of water.
"I know people say you're a jerk, but... they just don't know the real you."
I'm just gonna put this here.
You're gonna need that.
And a truckload of aspirin.
Get some sleep.
Hello?
So this barbecue on Saturday...
- Yes?
- I was just wondering if there was gonna be a smoked brisket involved.
Wait.
So you'll come based on the meat?
Yes.
"Yes, that's the deciding factor."
Done.
So what's up for tonight?
Not much.
Just a quiet evening at home.
You?
Not a lot... just getting my daily dose of jazz.
You hear it?
Love that one.
Crank it up.
You've got something right here on your...
She here?
She's not with me anymore.
You miss her?
Very much.
The mantle's quite pronounced now.
You're almost home.
"Hey, Mom."
Why did you come here?
I needed to see you... in person.
"You didn't ask to see me before,"
- when you were with Musa.
"- I wanted to, but I was afraid."
Of your own mother?
"I thought you would reject me, send me away."
"And yet you ran away from the Hunt, from Abby and the others."
It was too much too fast.
"When I saw Jules, I couldn't handle it, but Musa was right."
I don't belong at the ETU.
"I'm tired of hating myself, of fighting what I really am."
You can help me.
"You didn't raise me as a Hunter, but you can now."
I want you to be my mom again.
Why should I believe you?
"I'm here, aren't I?"
Love does swing the hammer.
"I'm not gonna hurt you, Mom."
Then show me.
Come closer.
It's been ten years since we've seen each other.
The least you can do is give me a hug.
You think I'm gonna hurt you?
You would if Musa told you to.
Are you serious?
Seriously.
Seriously.
I'm glad you think it's funny. making money.
We want you to throw a fight.
I said no.
One thing led to another.
It ended up with me smashing the guy's head in. offered me a deal. they'd set me up with a new life somewhere.
this is somewhere all right.
I fight once in a while.
It stops me going out of my mind and gives me a bit of spare cash.
the Feds don't give you any money?
man.
the fucking assholes-- they literally give me just enough to survive.
That's why I took your deal.
sweetheart.
I'll be right back.
Well... it's good.
We are on.
And the money?
Open book.
Who knows?
000.
But there is one thing.
what's that?
You're fighting Victor.
Do you really have to do this?
Yeah.
I don't want any part of it.
Forget about that shit.
Focus on the job at hand.
Come on.
Because they're more...
There are not so many cliques and...
- Why are you telling me?
- Would you like a glass of water?
"Helene, come here."
- Why are you telling me this?
- Because we have to decide.
"You don't need me any more, Helene."
"Everything is taken care of now, right?"
Anna and the boys...
I'll just slow you all down.
- Stop.
- No.
I'm the only one stopping for now.
I just mean...
Do you think you and Jacob will get together?
Do you?
Stop it.
I would like to know.
I just didn't want you to see me...
like this.
"This is only the beginning, Helene."
It will get worse from now on.
- Can you manage?
- Yes.
I'm so damned pathetic...
I don't want to...
I don't want to die!
"I don't, Helene."
"I don't want to, damn it!"
I don't want to die!
I don't!

I can't just leave.
He doesn't let me do anything.
"Yeah, well, it's-"
"- That's easy for you to say, Abby, all right?"
I will come and see you tomorrow.
"And we'll talk about it, okay?"
Wha-
- Why?
"Becau-- Yeah, because he's my husband."
That is my fault and I can't do anything about that.
"No, do not come here, I'm telling you, that's gonna make things worse."
"Yeah, I know, I know."
"I know, I know."
I-
- I don't know what to do.
I don't know--
"I don't know what to do, can't do this anymore."
I just want to die every day.
I can't.
"No, do not-- I can't, I can't, Abby."
Don't do that.
"I'm telling you, don't come here."
Just tell me that--
That you love me and that it's gonna be okay.
"I know, but just say it anyway, will you, honey, please?"
"Iâm dying over here, I need you."
I don't need you like that.
Why can't I?
Why can't I?
"Put it down, put it down."
- Let it go.
Put it down.
- I'm taking care of it.
I got it.
Put it down!
- What the hell are you doing?
- I can't work with this guy.
You can't work with me?
"Who do you think you are, lady?"
"I've been here for eight years, and you're just another untalented pretty face."
"- Billy, calm down."
- Untalented?
The ratings keep going up every night.
How do you explain that?
The ratings go up when the jackpot goes up!
"It has nothing to do with you, you moron!"
"Billy, I've warned you before about your attitude."
That's it.
You're out of here.
You're fired.
Somebody call security!
What?
"No, no, fired?"
"Wait, no, don't fire him."
"Look, see, I'm moving it."
I'm moving the cable.
Get him out of here.
"- Stan, don't do this."
"Please, not now?"
"- Come on, I'm sorry."
"- It's too late, Billy."
"Now, who'd be stupid enough to break into an ogre's house?"
- Aah!
- Aah!
Booo!
"Oh, wow..."
Terrifying.
I don't know how I'm gonna sleep now.
"Happy Halloween, everyone."
"Oh, man."
You said this was gonna scare 'em!
Hey!
I worked hard on this costume!
Oops.
Heh heh!
"Admit it, Shrek."
Weren't you even a little bit scared?
"Donkey, ogres don't get scared."
We do the scaring.
And that's why we're the kings of Halloween.
I bet we can find something that will scare the pants off of you!
- Which would scare me.
"- Oh, really?"
And what do you have in mind?
All of us telling scary stories all night long.
There ain't no way you won't be scared!
Yes!
Stories to make your blood run cold!
- Yeah!
- Stories to terrify you.
- Yeah!
- And whoever shall last through the night shall be named the king of Halloween!
- I accept.
"Or did your father send you to detain us, while he flees to Russia?"
- Ha ha!
It was a joke!
Put that thing away!
Where is my father?
I could go take a look.
It's best if we all go together.
"No, we're all staying here!"
I've been preparing this evening for weeks.
"- I won't allow you to ruin my event, just because you've gone crazy."
- What do you want?
Just tell me exactly what it is!
What?
Yes!
What!
?
To go to Sweden.
To Sweden?
He wants to go to Sweden.
Why didn't you say that earlier?
Give Bulle a call.
He drives up there tonight.
He could pick him up.
"And get Angie, she can take over from here."
You will allow me to let someone take over.
I have to take care of my bar.
Tell me...
Couldn't we break off the pieces and move them?
We can't.
That's how the world champions would do it.
Fine then.
The knight goes from G5 to E6.
What's wrong?
You okay?
- Yeah.
Everything's fine.
- All right.
I don't want to hear about it 'cause it isn't true.
That isn't Artie.
"I don't want to believe it either, Pete,"
But it's true.
"Yeah, well, you shouldn't even be reading that."
Pete.
We should be out doing something.
"Pete, his real name isn't even Artie Nielsen."
It's Artie Weisfelt.
He used to work for the NSA.
He was a cryptographer--a code breaker--
When he was in his 20s.
They recruited him right out of school.
They had him decoding soviet communications.
"He intercepted letters, phone transcripts."
Then they think he turned.
He contacted one of the people they were spying on
And he started selling secrets to the Russians.
"And his file, it just ends."
He was never prosecuted.
It's like he just disappeared.
"But it's him, Pete."
What?
It's definitely him.
You're under arrest.
"No, no, no. listen to me."
I have to take this.
"Oh, I help women, too."
You call me if he needs anything.

That's not so bad.

And her little brother.

That's their style.
Besides being one of our top models she could be most helpful to our government.

He's a double agent.
He works for us and for General Pham Son Ti.

"And as the late Dr. King proved, even an ape can win a prize with good press."
"Jesus, I'd like to book him into a psychiatrist's office."
"He comes in here ranting and raving,"
- dumping his crap all overthe place.
- [Laughing]
"Could you prove it, Edgar?"
"Mr. President, I always getmy man."
"Yeah, you do."
This damn tie.
- Could you help me?
- Yeah.
"See, I'd be bugging myself."
Who'd getthe tapes?
No one.
Your property.
And itwould prove your case.
Why do you think Kissinger is taping allyour calls?
For history.
Hmm?
His word againstyours.
And right now...
Empty.
Empty?
- [exhales] - [horns honking]
It was all that waiting I had to do for youse.
I'll run down the street to the gas station and get some gas.
"Boy, oh, boy."
You guys are costing me a lot of dough.
I sure hope you make the tip worth it.
Something's going to happen to someone near here.
We've got to help.
"No, I think you'd better stay here and wait for the driver."
I'll go.
I think it came from back that way.
Be careful.
And remember what Uncle Bene said.
That is enough.
Bring him down!
"[victor] sickle, turn to your right."
Balance yourself
And walk along the ledge.
"[Letha] Victor, no."
Stop.
I'll bring him down myself.
Give that to me.
[wires crackling]
Look what you've done.
[exhales sharply]
"Sickle, stop."
"Sickle, I'm commanding you to stop."
"Sickle, this is Dr. Victor Gannon commanding you to stop!"
- He's out of control.
- [Letha] sickle!
Chris makes me happy.
That's it.
I'm not taking it.
Okay.
All right.
"Nice, y'all!"
That's the way!
That's the way!
Good teamwork!
You all need to call it!
"Watch that hole in the center, okay?"
You all need to pick that up.
"Hey, time out!"
Time out.
"It's looking great, girls."
They're double blocking me every time.
That's okay.
"No, they've figured out our move."
"No, they did not."
"Now, don't you act like this is luck."
This is not luck.
You all are doing a great job.
We are kind of lucky 'cause their star hitter's out sick.
TAMl:
"No, you all are playing a great game."
You're playing a great game.
I want you to keep it up.
"I want you to keep it simple and remember, you are playing this game and you are winning this game because of your teamwork."
You are a team.
You work together.
"And you, you just focus on that Riggins."
You slam it down his throat.
"A little too friendly for me, apparently."
"Uh, never mind."
Her name is Audrey.
All right.
Audrey.
Got it.
- You good?
- I need a favor.
My father isn't sick.
He's been faking his illness.
Why would he do that?
That's what I want to find out.
Why not just ask him?
He left the country.
With Emma.
"Look, there must be someone else that knows about this."
"His... his bodyguard, Donnie, I've left him messages."
"So far, nothing."
I'll see what I can do.
All right.
Hang in there.
How often do you see an escort?
Once a month or so.
I just started doing this.
"Uh, I got a raise at work."
The dating pool is depressing.
It's full of boys in skinny jeans and baseball caps.
"It's hard to find, like, men."
Women are like wild horses.
"You stroke 'em, put 'em at ease."
Whisper in their ear.
"In my experience, the more high society they are, the more they like to be manhandled."
Your hair is diff--
- Doesn't she look amazing?
- Yeah.
"Yeah, you look great."
You look awesome.
Sorry.
What am I even saying?
You look different and--
"- Kumar Patel, you're flustered."
- Little bit.
"So, what's up with you?"
You still dating the Abercrombie-wearing douchebag?
"Actually, it's Brooks Brothers."
Colton!
"How are you, buddy?"
- Good to see ya.
- Good to see you.
And we're not dating anymore.
No.
We...are getting married.
"Congratulations, you guys."
- You're fucking getting married?
- Yeah.
- When?
- Next week.
It's going to be a perfect day.
"I mean, that's assuming we get those Stargazer lilies for the bouquets."
This florist has been a complete nightmare.
Fucking assholes.
Colton's practically planning the whole wedding all by himself.
"So, Rold, Brewster Keegan letting you off the leash for a little vay-cay?"
"I own that place now, Colton."
Sounds like a great idea to me.
"Spencer, let's go."
I've done my part.
"As much as she hates to admit it,"
"The magazine really needs you, regina."
- oh.
"- Oh come on, spencer, please."
I am not gonna keep apologizing
- To someone who wants to keep an attitude with me.
- Okay.
- Let's go sit down.
- Thank you.
"Oh, i'm sorry."
There's nothing to sit on.
- Georgia: yes.
- Please consider it.
- Good night.
- Good night.
"Oh god, what a mess."
"Now what are you gonna do, gina?"
"I'm gonna think about it, mama."
That's what i'm gonna do.
She's not thinking about getting me back.
She's just trying to impress spencer.
She doesn't want me working with her.
"Oh, what do you care about whether she cares or not?"
She's offering your job back
And you haven't worked in six months.
We're in trouble here.
Where are you going?
I gotta go take a walk.
I gotta go clear my head.
We've already begun to evacuate the plant.
"Tony's here, all right."
Get me down.
"Thank you, thank you."
"Now, where are you going?"
In there.
"Oh, no."
You can't go beyond this point without IDs.
Tony!
- Tia!
- I knew it.
She'll spoil everything.
I can just taste that money.
We cannot let her take it away from us.
Tony!
"Tony, from this moment you will no longer hear Tia."
She cannot break through my power of control.
- Acknowledge.
"- Tony, what's wrong?"
"It's me, your sister."
Try to remember me.
Acknowledge.
Tony?
"- Yes, sir."
- Get those kids.
She'll use some of those molecules on us.
"I'll take care of her before she gets a chance, you get them."
I can't get through.
I don't know what they've done to his mind.
We've got to find the emergency cooling system ourselves.
How do you spell cooling?
Come on.
He never went anywhere without it.
It's missing.
[Camera shutter clicks]
[Phone ringing]
Man:
"Hey, Duval."
[Sighs]
_
[Cellphone rings]
[Sighs]
What?
James:
Question.
Remember that promise you made to Kevin Whitfield's parents?
You want to make good on it?
What do you know about Kevin Whitfield?
Just what you told me back then.
I've been going over it.
"You know, uh, the backpack that was missing."
You thought it was connected to the killing.
Are you reading my notes?
"I, uh, I took a picture of it, and I sent it to my friends."
They did some kind of search.
"You know, like the dents and scratches on the backpack make it like a fingerprint?"
Did you know that?
[Beeping]
They looked at 5 million pictures and finally came up with the perfect match.
"One double-bacon BLT sandwich, nice and hot."
Thank you.
Duval:
Where are you?
Are you at my house?
Julie-Ann's bra.
She was moved in the van.
I thought dragging her all that way on crutches was unlikely.
We need to find the hole he's hiding in and visit the known associates in the area.
Right.
We're gonna start with addresses nearest the Pembridge and then fan out.
"Hudson, Edwards."
Your list.
"Harris, your list."
"Tennison, with me."
- Hello.
"Have you seen this man, David Bentley?"
- No.
Never seen him.
- Positive?
- Quite sure.
Sorry to... bother you.
My name's DC Edwards.
I'm from Hackney Police.
Do you recognise this man at all?
"Er... no, sorry."
No.
We'd have a better chance getting Clifford's mates to tap-dance than co-operate.
Here.
You can drive.
I nearly bust a stitch going down those stairs.
- I haven't done the job driving course yet.
- But you can drive.
"Well, thank you, sir."
It's a bloody wild-goose chase.
Where next?
Next one's on Fairview Avenue.
I have something you might wanna know before you go.
- I hope it doesn't have to do with Blair.
- It has to do with you.
"About Santorini, what you were looking for."
While I was on the trip you so graciously gave me I found it again.
"Only it's not in Santorini anymore, it's in Fiji."
At least he was last week.
You found my father?
Get in.
Let's go.
Why aren't you in Europe?
I was in Paris but only to get your favorite macaroons from Pierre Hermé.
And Germany?
To pick up your favorite Falke stockings.
You know how I adore them.
"- What are you doing here, then?"
- You were right.
"I was a coward, running away again."
But everywhere I went you caught up with me.
So I had to come back.
I wanna believe you.
But I can't.
- You've hurt me too many times.
- You can believe me this time.
That's it?
I love you too.
But can you say it twice?
[LAUGHING]
"No, I'm serious, say it twice."
CHUCK:
I love you.
I love you.
Cash or charge?
- Cash.
- [Woman] Cash is $54.
- Right.
Okay.
Please print your name on both tickets before you board the plane.
Yeah.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Have a nice flight.
"- Yes, sir?"
"- Round trip to Washington, please."
[Car Door Closes]
So?
"So everything's going great, terrific, beautiful."
I'll need a few more days though.
The boys think we oughta cool it for a while... just to make sure there's no heat.
You must take me for an imbecile.
Why do you think I asked you to meet me in Washington?
I haven't spent five minutes in New York City... without the company of a policeman.
"Look, I'm leveling with you."
I need a little more time.
It's just that my people think we oughta find a better time to make the switch.
- That's all.
- It has to be by the end of this week.
"Look, Charnier."
You got to be reasonable.
It's your problem.
"Well, it's your problem too."
It's so nice to have seen you again.
[Speaking French]
[French]
Where have I been?
I've been trying to get here!
"Look, we'll never be able to find her."
If...
"If I walk over there, she's gonna walk over here."
"If I'm on this side, she's probably gonna be on that side!"
"All right, panicking's not gonna help, Shane."
"Hey, want to dance, tough guy?"
"No, I'd step on your feet, I'd hurt you."
"Thank you, though."
"All right, now, everybody up, everybody up!"
This is Eden East!
This place is amazing!
I can't believe they kept this from us!
I knew you would love it.
This is why I brought you here.
Vitality!
"Oh, it is so nice to be out with lots of people!"
Everyone's smiling and laughing.
Don't you guys love this?
It's great.
"In a couple more minutes, I'll just roofie myself."
"I will go get my special Salvadore drink, yes?"
"Oh, yes."
"""Guess I am on my way."""
"""Mighty glad you stayed!"""
Yes!
Yes!
He is so much fun!
"Oh, God, don't even start."
I'm just having fun.
"No, it's just..."
Take a look over there.
They're having all this light come right through that.
Do you have to go now?
"Can you come back, or no?"
"- No, no, I'm going to go."
"- Okay, well, did you know why"
I came to see you today?
"Well, I'm making a film about Lou."
"- Well, I knew that."
- You knew that.
- I knew that.
- But...
I'm Lou's son.
God.
I saw you when you were six years old.
I saw you at the wake.
I saw you with your mother.
You remember that day?
What a crazy world.
You are Lou.
Have a nice concert.
- Where's Nathaniel?
- Why'd you get so upset?
"Gosh, you love a man..."
"and I knew Lou had a son, and I was told never to tell that Lou had a son."
I don't know.
"Lou was... didn't talk about his family much, except about his daughter."
He didn't talk about that.
Men don't talk about those things.
"That was his, that was his very personal thing."
We all have those personal things.
Thanks.
"Oh, you're Watt."
I'm the manager!
- What?
- I'm the manager!
"Yes, I know."
You've just told me.
What's the matter with you?
"Now, listen to me."
I booked a room with a bath.
"When I book a room with a bath, I expect to get a bath."
You've got a bath.
"I'm not paying £7.20p per night, plus V.A.T., for a room without a bath!"
Here is your bath.
You call that a bath?
It's not big enough to drown a mouse.
It's disgraceful!
I wish you were a mouse.
I'd show you.
And another thing.
I asked for a room with a view.
"Deaf, mad, and blind."
"This is the view as far as I can remember, madam."
"Yes, yes, this is it."
"When I pay for a view,"
I expect something more interesting than that.
"That is Torquay, madam."
That is not good enough.
"Well, may I ask what you were expecting to see out of a Torquay hotel bedroom window?"
"Sydney Opera House, perhaps?"
The Hanging Gardens of Babylon?
Herds of wildebeest sweeping majestically...
Don't be silly.
- Totally you.
"Hey, guys, check it out."
"The deluxe limited edition ""Wild West and Witches"""
expansion pack in the signed and numbered collector's tin.
LEONARD:
"Come on, no!"
We just bought the regular pack.
"Ooh, a sheriff's badge."
(chuckles)
"Yeah, it's also a wand."
With a hologram?
Nice!
"Hey, do you see this?"
"I'm in the matrix, Leonard;"
I see everything.
You got to be kidding me.
You friended Stuart on Facebook?
I thought you didn't like Facebook anymore.
Don't be silly.
I'm a fan of anything that tries to replace actual human contact.
KOOTHRAPPALI:
Please.
You're looking at Facebook to find out how their date went.
Really?
"You think I care if a man, what,"
"""shared a pumpkin latte with a dynamite lady""?"
You're so full of it.
You are free to believe whatever you like.
And unfriend Rajesh Koothrappali.
You unfriended me?
Seriously?
"Oh, yeah."
I think I'm in love already.
Gah!
That would have been a clean 50 from the both of you.
Excuse me.
Which one of you is Dr. William Blunt?
I am.
Is there a problem?
I'm afraid there is.
I need to talk to you about my father.
Arthur Waverly.
You might have noticed we're playing a round of golf here.
"You have a question, call my office."
I'm sure...
That's not how this is gonna work.
We're gonna talk about my father.
We're gonna do it right now.
"Hey, buddy."
This isn't the time.
Maybe you should tell your friends to take a walk.
"It's okay, guys."
Just give us a minute.
I'll see you at the clubhouse.
"Look, I don't know what you think that I could tell you, but..."
How sick is my father?
He has stage four.
It doesn't look good.
That's one.
One what?
I understand that you sent him to Argentina.
I'd like to know why.
I can't discuss private medical records.
That's two.
"I'm taking this, okay?"
Just for a while.
The poor thing.
We hit the deer and his paw.
What do you call it?
The paw.
-The hoof.
-Got caught in the grill.
I got to hack it off.
"Ma, it's a sin to leave it there."
I'll bring the knife back.
Delicious.
Why don't you get yourself a nice girl?
"I get a nice one almost every night, Ma."
But get yourself a girl so you could settle down.
I settle down almost every night.
But then in the morning I'm free.
I love you!
I want to be with you.
Why don't you settle down?
"How's your friend, Henry?"
What's the matter?
You don't talk too much.
Talk.
What are you quiet for?
"You don't eat much, you don't talk much."
-l'm just listening.
"-What's the matter, something wrong with you?"
"When we were kids, the compares used to visit each other."
There was this man.
He would never talk.
He'd just sit there all night.
A nice profit they'll make.
"America will fight, you'll see."
They'll fight.
Fight to the last Englishman.
Last Welshman too.
"They're all right when it comes to talking war, when do they start fighting it?"
What about right now?
You sound like a bloody Yank yourself.
"Stop it, stop it, all of you!"
"And what's going on in here, may I ask?"
You horrible little man!
You're all in close arrest.
Sergeant.
"Left, right, left, right, left, right, march."
Halt!
Next lad.
Quick march!
"Left, right, left, right..."
Next man take your place.
Anybody got a razor blade?
What do you want it for?
Think he's going to cut his throat?
"I like, Private Dawes."
You're lucky to get busted.
"Look at that bloke, Hitler."
He was a corporal ain't doing him much good.
You've got something there.
"Is that correct, McKendrick?"
"No, Sir."
I started it.
Anything to add?
"No, Sir."
I'll see you around.
"Now, just come on in."
Let's count it first.
Make sure it's all here.
"If you got the money, we're good."
It's all there.
"Just bring it in, man."
Okay?
"I wanna make sure I got my money, so come on in and count it."
"One hundred, two, three, four five, six, seven, eight, nine, we're up to a thousand?"
Yeah.
There's one.
"Twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, two thousand."
Getting closer.
"What's wrong, Tim?"
You look a little depressed.
"Okay, can we just get this over with, man?"
Just count the money and let us get out of here.
Hey!
"You wanna calm down, man?"
You would think I wasn't the one that got ripped off here.
"Yeah, why don't you call the cops then, Guy?"
"Ooh, good one, Billy."
Three...
Six...
Twenty-nine.
What do you know?
It's all there.
All right.
"It's taken care of and it's all paid up and he don't owe you a dime extra, all right?"
"Billy, let's go."
It's over with now.
- Here.
"- God, that stinks."
"Yeah, but it's gonna keep your face from swelling up like a pumpkin."
Hold it.
Here.
Hold it on there.
"So, whatcha gonna do ?"
It's payback time.
Either you down or you not.
Either you my boy or you ain't.
Simple as that.
"Oh, ha !"
"Hey, baby, we lit it up out there."
I am serious.
"Did you see us, ""D"" man ?"
Do you see us ?
We're talking.
Anyway.
"Hey, baby, we lit it up."
"- Oh, man, come on, man !"
"- That shit ain't funny, man."
- You damn right it ain't funny.
- l thought you liked it down there.
"That's your specialty, ain't it ?"
Crawling on the floor like a bitch.
That was a reflex action in the heat ofthe moment.
You're just plain rude and wrong to bring that shit up in mixed company.
- l'm gonna go home.
Are you ready ?
"- No, he's not ready."
He's talking to me.
"It's an ""A"" and ""B"" conversation."
You don't understand.
Store's closed.
Henry got pinched.
Where?
By the factory.
Henry Hill.
The People of the State of New York vs. Henry Hill.
Docket #704162.

That's me.
Just stand there.
Now stay there.

Congratulations.
Here's your graduation present.
but you did it right.
You told them nothing.
I thought you'd be mad.
I'm proud of you.
You took your first pinch like a man and learned the two greatest things in life.
Look at me.
Never rat on your friends and always keep your mouth shut.
Here he is!
You broke your cherry!
Congratulations!
there was 30 billion a year in cargo and we tried to steal every bit of it.
we grew up near the airport.
It belonged to Paulie.
We had friends and relatives who worked all over it.
They would tip us off about what was coming in and moving out.
If any truckers or airlines gave us trouble
Paulie'sunionpeoplescaredthem  with a strike.
That was amazing.

"No you never did, nice to meet you."
Same.
Oh this is my girlfriend Dominique.
So um when are you practicing tomorrow I want to hear the new song.
Cece works in AR for our tour manager.
So everything's got the thumbs up from her.
I'm easy.
I mean not that kind of easy you know.
But with a voice like his you can't do much wrong.
"She's cute, I say go for it."
I did not say anything.
"No, we are not allowed to say."
He said not to talk assignment.
Thi What did he say?
"No, no ..."
Nonsense!
I do not believe it.
- To think about how to get out of here ..
- Thi-thin mouth!
Damn.
He told me to ...
I can not do what I asked.
You must stop this.
"No, no, please!"
"- Room, microphone ..."
Move!
- Are you sick!
If you do not see us or hear us ...
This will end the game.
Do not trust anyone but yourself.
"Sitting or hit you, you fool!"
Duties ...
I can not do.
You know what to say to me?
To kill anyone when you ask me.
Do not you understand?
"Do not want to kill us, want to punish us"
Do you think it will be a loved membiarakan If you follow the rules?
- Are you an idiot Dave.
- Are you crazy?
We can not do anything with it.
We must do what we were told.
Two suns... no seasons.
It's a constant temperature.
-Are there any oceans?
-There is one.
"Our water's of a different consistency, different color, it contains all the nutrients that we require."
There is no need for food.
"Though we're at war, we will live in a safe zone."
Our child will be shielded from the dangers coming near.
Time is different there.
your lifespan will be three times what it is here on Earth.
-Really?
-We're free of all diseases and all the illnesses.
-It's starting to sound like paradise.
"-With you there, it will be."
-Get out of the vehicle now!
"Cross your legs, put your hands on your head."
Cross your legs!
-Chayton!
Chayton!
Robert...
"Robert, can you hear me?"
"Robert, are you there?"
-Jaelen.
-I'm speaking to you with my thoughts.
-Where are you?
-They have me in captivity.
And Robert... they killed Chayton.
There was nothing I could do.
I'm inside the base.
I'm where I need to be.
-Yeah.
"Yeah, it's me."
"You go to Sanchun with Jaesa, Mugol and Mukguh."
(Sanchun)
Do you know who Buwiyum is?
Do you know who Buwiyum is?
(Magok)
See what's going on.
"Yes, sir."
Commander.
Oi.
What's going on?
Okjuh soldiers are gathering young men to wipe out the pirates.
Then the pirates will be well-hidden.
We've got our work cut out.
Let's go into town for now.
OK.
Stop there!
Let's go.
Aren't they Sachooldo's Jega?
They wouldn't be here unless it's something important.
I heard Prince Daeso summoned them.
Prime Minister.
Do you have any idea what it's about?
How have you been?
I heard you're doing a good job in place of the late Maga.
Thank you.
I trust you will all help Puyo overcome this crisis.
We will serve you with all our heart.
Thank you.
I'll give you a chance to do just that.
I've summoned you all here to tell you to prepare for a war.
A war?
What war?
"What are you thinking, Walter?"
"Hey, guys."
The footage from the abduction has been downloaded.
"Also, the police found a book on a bench by the museum..."
- ...with some kind of weird writing in it.
- They think it was his?
"Well, they don't know, but Agent Broyles is sending it over."
OLIVIA:
Have we ID'd the victim?
ASTRID:
"No, not yet."
OLIVIA:
"Wait a minute, Astrid."
Can you zoom it?
Now freeze it.
"Peter, that isn't him."
That's a different guy.
There's more than one Observer.
Stop.
Hold on.
What just happened right there?
Was he hit?
Who are these people?
- Please don't hurt me.
- Please don't hurt me.
- Why are you doing this?
- Why are you doing this?
- Please let me go.
- Please let me go.
- I promise I won't tell anyone.
- I promise I won't tell anyone.
- You don't have to do this to me.
"Hey, mi amor!"
"When you're finished playing with the kids, come play with me."
Where is the car?
I got a guy tuning her up in Yonkers.
Going out to the track next weekend.
I'm ready for Le Mans.
You ready to come with me?
Take a chance?
- I can't leave the kid by himself.
"- Excuses, excuses."
You're just fooling around with that register.
"- I have to pay you back, right?"
- That's right.
Good morning!
"The light, Mag."
I'm trying to finish this.
"- Good morning to you, too."
"- Hey, hey, muñeca."
Buen día.
What is it with these space chicks and the hugest tetas I've ever seen in my life?
What happened to the eggs?
The eggs I asked you to bring home last night?
Those eggs?
- I guess they're at the bodega.
- I guess so.
Why don't we go out for breakfast?
We haven't done that in a month.
- I've got to work.
- I thought you were hungry.
"I am, but-- hey, why don't you get the eggs?"
I've got to pick up beads for the dress.
You can't do me a favor?
Any place that has this turf needs to be closed and searched.
"Yes, mom."
We're all over it.
Watch your step out there.
"Yeah, you too, Tanner."
Hauser was so sure of himself.
He was even more of a jerk than usual.
You gonna rub it in?
Tell me that you're still at the park.
"Oh, yeah, I am, but Petty's not."
Stay there.
He could still show up.
Where the hell are you?
"Till you hear back from me, do not move."
Petty.
You know me?
A friend of mine did.
Give me your hands.
You probably won't want to move now.
Now give me your gun and your phone.
I've never been on a stakeout before.
This isn't a stakeout.
It's a waste of time.
Hauser say why he thought Petty was coming here?
"Well, transparency isn't one of Hauser's strong suits."
I just pictured him in a transparent suit.
It's pretty gross.
Shh.
Drop the knife.
"Get on the ground, face down."
You with the guy in the suit?
You are.
"Go, go, go!"
Everything ok in there?
I thought I heard something.
It's fine...
Dolores.
- How you've been?
- I thought I heard somethin'.
"You know, I did too."
Sound it's like coming from the upstairs again.
I was sure it was coming from here.
- Did you try next door?
- Are you sure everything's okay in there?
Yes.
"I really should go now, Dolores."
You take care.
- Well ain't...
- Dolores!
Dolores...
Take care.
- Couldn't get it right... go!
- Go!
"115th precinct, Officer Minocha speaking."
There's something wrong in the apartment down the hall from me.
"We're going to take care of him too, you know."
I know.
- I think we should do it now.
- Why?
He's sleeping...
it will be merciful.
"Oh I thought, we're out of bullets again."
"We are, but I can run out and go get some more somewhere real quick."
We couldn't even do it now even if we had the bullets.
- Ah!
Treat this with care.
It's loaded with live crabs.
Shh.
I told 'em I was taking 'em to the circus.
Why'd you take your footlocker?
What's a beach party without beach?
[ Chuckling ]
- ?
[ Lively ] - [ All Chattering ]
What a terrific idea!
These crabs are delicious.
Sure are.
And the best part's right here... inside the little first baseman's mitt.
You two are lucky Klinger came through... or you'd be skinny-dipping in that kettle.
"Oh, you're right."
Underestimating Klinger's become a national pastime.
"Thank you, sirs."
Hate to eat and run.
But I've got to pack for three days... and a fun-filled trip in Seoul.
"Okay, I've had some fresh air."
Can we go back now?
"No, not quite yet."
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
"What are we doing here, Doctor?"
I don't want a drink.
Good.
Because you're not gonna get one.
What the hell is this all about?
"Please, David."
- I'm sure you've heard of these.
He was part of the warning.
"Stop, stop, stop."
I didn't want to scare you.
He said...
He said the messages are real.
Something terrible is gonna happen.
"Connie, please."
We have to leave here now.
I will not live my life like that.
I will not make decisions based on messages from Indrid Cold.
He may be real to you.
He's not real to me.
"Okay, I'm going to Charleston."
I'll be at the Marriott.
Get yourself reassigned.
I don't want you anywhere near the plant today.
What if nothing happens?
What if there's no great tragedy?
What'll you do then?
- That's not the point.
"- Well, I think it is the point."
- Gordon believed what he heard too.
- I am not Gordon!
I know what's gonna happen.
You have to leave now.
I have to report to work.
We can talk about this later.
- Governor?
"- Good to see you, John."
I need to speak with you.
It's urgent.
"- What's this about, John?"
"Okay, I'm coming."
I'm...
Here I am.
I'm coming.
I'm coming.
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?
I'm here.
And the reason I chose my mother as the hero of this college essay?
She faces her battles every day even though she may never win the war.
She's helped me see... that I didn't cause her disease.
I can't control it.
And I can't cure it.
This is my mom.
And that is her story.
And now...
I'm ready to leave home... and claim my own.

Allison.
- Sorry.
What?
- We have to get your mom something.
She doesn't care about stuff like that.
She's just dying to meet you.
They both are.
"In the Midwest, you don't go to a person's house, let alone your girlfriend's parents', without bringing something."
Vuitton Gellys.
I loved it.
Did you see Fendi broche bag?
- I've got to have it!
- It's gonna be a success.
I'll make 4 pages on it.
What's that deal with that Vogue stealing on your stories?
I heard there was a curry.
"It's Yuri, dummy, we're talking Russians, not Indians."
It's not me.
I won't work for Vogue anymore.
They didn't airbrush me properly.
- The designers are butchers.
- Butchers?
Now I have my own private airbrusher over here at Skirt.
Paul is such a sweetie!
- The duke with the Macintosh.
- I love working with royalty.
I love sleeping with royalty.
"Who are you, the fourth Mallard sister?"
"Not quite, Olivier."
I don't do exiles.
I like my men underfed and overbred.
Can you give me a tiara?
"Anyway, this one has got polo fields... and the largest private estate in all of England."
Whores!
All of you.
"Hey, man!"
Do you know where Jocelyn is?
"French fries, yeah!"
"- See'ya, Alex."
- Peace.
Okay.
"Al this hour, we'd have to add the daytime fee, too."
What do you mean?
If checking in before 11 PM we charge both the daytime and overnight fee.
What a rip off.
What're you doing?
It's my first bed in so long!
Feels nice and soft.
You stink.
I haven't bathed in over a week.
Huh?
Are you homeless or something?
"When I have money, I get a room."
When you don't?
Shall I pay first?
"It's okay, you already paid for food and hotel."
But that doesn't include sex.
Are you a saint?
Most guys usually expect sex.
"One time, a guy expected sex for buying me lunch."
Bunch of assholes.
"Right, bunch of assholes."
"Anyway, you should take a bath."
Okay.
"Wow, a jacuzzi!"
Hello?
How is it?
Nabbed a high schooler.
Underage fetches top money.
Make her fall for you.
"Leave it to me, I'll reel her in."
You better.
It's like Jake with Chinatown.
Anybody named Beers would be sick to death of a joke like that.
That guy acted like he never heard it before.
"In strictly legal terms, Tony, someone having no sense of humor won't get you probable cause."
"Until we hear back from McGee, that's cause enough for me."
Mind if I get Abby in the loop?
Do it.
Beers.
Beers.
"Hey, Beers."
"Hey, come here, Beers."
Beers Palmer.
Huh?
That's different.
Do you want your kid to like you?
Anything on the air marshal?
Whoa.
You know about this guy?
"McGee's got the name, you got the picture-- what's the big secret?"
I think that Bishop and Tony didn't want you to know that they blew his cover.
And why did I just tell you that?
- And why do you know that?
"- Because he's very, very nosy."
"So far, no hits on facial recognition."
"Abby, hey..."
Whoa.
Boss.
McGee?
"He knows, Tim."
I talk too much.
That your guy's info?
Come here.
- I don't know Daze.
"Hey, girls."
There's stuff in the kitchen if you're hungry.
- Do you know why we're here?
"- Yes, I've been expecting you."
I think there's must be some sort of misunderstanding.
We're not here to clean your bathtub up.
Organize your closet or make you happy.
Really?
Yeah.
We're here to kill you.
Then there's no misunderstanding at all.
Do you mind if I have a word with my partner?
Wait a sec.
"Search him, Daze."
"He's clean, Vi."
Come on then.
"- This isn't go much like we pictured it, Vi."
"- Yeah, I know."
I just wish it more like a normal job.
Now it's weird.
I never really talked to a job before.
This might be some kind of test.
"Everything's a test, when you're a career woman."
Damn right.
And those dresses aren't gonna buy themselves.
- I got it!
- What?
- I know we could do!
- What?
Why don't we just go in there?
Blasting without thinking about it.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Do you want me to stay?
I can sleep on the couch.
I've done it before.
"No, I have to learn to be alone."
Hello.
"- Hello, everyone."
- Good morning.
Washing her hair?
What do you think?
- How was the night?
- Normal.
"Give me that, I'll do it."
I'm off.
- So long.
"- Bye, Matilde."
It's so hot!
We should cut her hair.
Cut it short.
It's more practical and comfortable.
We'll leave it like it was when she arrived here.
So it won't look different if she awakes.
"After four years in a coma, it would be a miracle."
I believe in miracles.
And so should you.
- Why me?
- Because you really need them.
"One could happen to you, and you wouldn't even realize."
"God, it's so hot!"
I bought something in the drugstore to help stop the perspiration stains on my uniform.
Your armpits don't sweat but the rest...
Never heard that.
"Look at me, I'm not the greatest looking fellow, so...."
"I'm not beautiful at all, really."
"I seen them the other night, they're not the best."
I think they're crap.
Why do you Iike One Direction?
They're perfect.
They're perfect?
"Far from it, love."
I tell you what they're not great at all.
I don't know why you even like One Direction!
They're crap!
AII go home!
I quit this job it's crap!
I'm going back to glasgow.
That is absolutely nuts.
Mak es me a bit uncomfortable.
I'm actually scared of you.
You look like a fat russell Brand.
I want to look like you when I'm older because I think you look quite interesting.

-Set up tent here.

That's positive thinking.

"- No, but it's fun."
There's Jarmusch.
"All right, let's go."
All right?
Look at that hair.
This is...
"I'm sorry, I forgot your name."
We just met.
Miriam.
Nice to meet you.
George Christopher.
And this is Jonathan ames.
- The man I want to meet.
- It's very nice to meet you.
Could you excuse us?
We have some business to talk over.
- Sure.
- Thanks.
Are those hummingbirds?
They're dipping their beaks into flowers.
I love them.
- What was your name again?
- Miriam.
"So I really loved your novel... dark, funny, perverted, beautiful."
- What's going on?
A meeting to appoint a new principal.
- How do you know it'll be Ms. Thornton?
- Nobody else deserves it.
I'll drop by the store after school.
"Goodbye, Dad."
I wish you'd stop that ridiculous performance every day.
What?
Saying goodbye or hello to my father?
Saying it to a photograph.
"I suppose it's silly, but it makes me feel that he's here."
You scarcely knew him.
It's not my fault he died when I was two.
"I can't remember him, I admit, but I miss him."
"You mean, you miss a father."
"Yes, Mother."
"Wouldn't it be nice if you had men friends, or dates, or even marry again?"
"Stop talking about fathers, husbands and marriage."
You miss him more than I ever realized.
"I'm sorry, Mother."
I'll be late.
Forgot the speech.
"- Goodbye, Mom."
- Bye.
"- Good morning, Ms. Lancie."
"- Good Morning, Allison."
"Hi, David."
"- Good morning, Mr. Herman."
"- Morning, Miss Allison."
"Go on home, Buffy."
"- Hi, Dr. Swain."
"- Morning, Allison."
"[Carlos] Oh, Federico."
You're not Buffy La Caza Vampiros!
[loud pounding]
You're the Tlacamelli Teplani.
The Peacekeeper.
"Yeah, that's what people keep tellin' me."
[grunting]
[Carlos] Gonzalez...
- ... you are a man of justice.
- [groans]
"[Carlos] Yeah, a man like you understands."
"Oh, you understand that this santa sangre could keep culebras from preying on innocents."
You understand what that means?
"Less exposure for us, and more peace for you."
I'm starting to think peace is overrated.
I'm starving.
Why couldn't we stop to feed?
Because we are here for a higher purpose!
[shouting]
[Richie] What the hell is he up to?
I still don't feel right about this.
"You will, once you have the plans."
"Okay, remember, you just need to distract him while I switch out the cases."
I've got it.
"Okay, Richard?"
Relax.
[Eddie] So what is all this?
"I told you, I got about a hundred VHS tapes in here."
From Fellini to Capra.
- You want some or not?
"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
Put 'em over there somewhere.
Let me give you your coat.
That's all right.
It's OK.
Thanks a lot.
Ralphie.
"Hello, boy."
How you been?
What a good boy.
Can I buy you breakfast?
I know this great little diner.
Sure.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
"Well, seeing as you caught the killer..."
I figured the least I could do... was write you some lyrics.
So...
There once was a dick from The Windy City
"Who met this great mick who was, oh, so pretty"
He told her goodbye...
But he had no reason why...
That's all I got so far.
"Well, I was soaked to the marrow"
I was chilled to the heart
I took shelter in her room
She called me from the corner
Of a song I never liked
For the occasion that was in there
If I let you inside me
Will you stay for long?
The one and only
While the gray wall crumbles
Whatever you are
Go back to sleep.
"It's all right, Bobby."
It's all right.
Go back to sleep.
We're here together.
I think we could all use one of those.
Mr. Gordon?
Shall we go into the other room?
Let's go.
Get started on the clock.
"Stan and I had a brother, Bobby."
He was younger than either of us.
Not quite 7 when he died.
Stan and I were 12 and 14.
We lived in a big house with grounds that bordered a river.
"That particular day, our mother asked us to stay at home and look after Bobby."
We wanted to go swimming.
"What we wanted to do, Bobby wanted to do, naturally."
He idolised his big brothers.
"So we told him to stay in the house, and off we went."
He followed us.
We were pretty far out when we spotted him.
He was trying to...
To get to us.
He still is.
- You mean it's his...?
- Spirit?
Ghost?
"I don't know, Mr. Gordon."
"I do know that often, when Stan and I are together, this happens."
And you believe?
"It happens, Mr. Gordon."
Is that a big thing out here?
"Oh, yeah."
You betcha.
Folks take it real seriously -- train for months.
"Eat all sorts of wackadoo stuff, you know, like, uh..."
"Baked beans, buff wings, butter."
Butter?
Yeah.
Sometimes deep-fried.
Hm.
"This year alone, Wayne won the Butter Bowl, the Wing Ding, and Shrimptasia."
"Anyhoo, point being, Wayne McNut was the only one Slim Jim couldn't beat in the whole Great Lakes region."
So is he a suspect?
"We checked him out, but Slim Jim was in the Hot Doggery at the time of Wayne's death, and we got 15 witnesses to prove it."
Really?
Yeah.
Training.
"When I gear up for a competition, I eat lettuce -- stretches the stomach."
Yet another reason to stay away from salads.
How well did you know Wayne McNut?
"Well, well enough to know he was a weasel and a cheat."
"I hate to say it, but, uh, karma's a bitch."
This is interesting.
Mala's good-luck charms.
And Mala is...?
My old lady.
Is your old lady superstitious?
Yeah.
She's Romanichal.
Romanichal?
Gypsy.
But don't call her that.
I could give it up for the right guy.
"Oh, that came out wrong."
What I mean is...
"I would, you know, stop hooking if you wanted me to."
"I mean, there is lots of pans with pancakes out there, right?"
I think I'd like that.
Mr. Reznik.
"I am sorry, I thought it was somebody else."
You gave me such a scare.
What are you doing in my apartment?
There is a leak in my ceiling.
It's coming from your apartment.
That's impossible.
I was going to leave a note.
A note?
What kind of note?
About the leak.
What's that terrible smell?
There's no leak in this apartment.
Now if you will excuse me...
"- You're sure you're alright, Mr. Reznik?"
"- Yeah, I'm sure."
"If you need anything, please call first."
Miller.
Miller!
"Hey, Reznik."
It's a pleasant surprise.
We need to talk.
"Take a look at this, huh?"
"Picked it up at Grossens, top of the line."
"Hey, let's not trim anything for a while."
I need to be doing something.
You call me a bear?
!
Relax...
See that he doesn't move.
Sit down there!
"What's up, sir?"
Do you know him?
Who is he?
I could tell you.
But you won't believe me.
"Of course, I will!"
He's Laxmi's husband.
Her husband?
!
No!
I can't believe that!
But you just said you would!
He says his name is Banwari.
And you said her husband's name was Durgaprasad!
"Have I told you that, too?"
Are there two husbands then?
Not two husbands.
The husband has two names.
Laxmi fondly addresses Durgaprasad as Banwarilal.
I wouldn't know where to begin.
All right.
Brother's in deep shit.
"He's down, he's bleeding, and you gotta get there."
"But there's lights, right?"
"All over the city, red lights."
You go through the red lights.
"Sure, you fire up the roof, you wail, you go through the red lights."
Mr. Gold?
Hi.
Peter said you were here.
Shouldn't you be in synagogue?
Uh... no.
How are you feeling?
- Better.
- Good.
Then I won't feel bad about saying this.
Your son is going to lose.
"Without Alicia, he will lose the governorship."
"Uh, I-I don't know..."
"She was on our side, Jackie."
"Alicia was offering to help Peter, then you got involved."
How did I get involved?
This friggin' house!
Good job.
God bless you son.
When do you think you'll be here?
"Dad, please."
"I beg you, don't..."
We're going to introduce you to a nice girl.
"Dad, what could I possibly do there?"
"Apply for your military service, and come back to Urfa."
"Your past, your future, your destiny..."
It's all here...
He doesn't care.
Why couldn't you ask about the police station?
Why didn't you make him come back?
I'll find a way.
He's got little left to finish.
While we eat shit there?
U.S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE IS ALL OVER IT.
"I LEFT A MESSAGE, HAVEN'T HEARD BACK, AND THAT'S ABOUT IT."
I SHOULD GO TALK TO EVELYN.
"YOU JUST TALKED TO HER, MIKE."
"YEAH, BUT SHE WAS A LITTLE FLUSTERED THE LAST TIME."
SHE MIGHT HAVE FORGOTTEN SOMETHING.
I THOUGHT YOU HAD TO GET THOSE DOCUMENTS
TO LUCY FOR YOUR FAKE I.D.
"YEAH, I'LL DO IT LATER."
"SOMETHING I SHOULD KNOW, SAM?"
"ABOUT WHAT, FI?"
ABOUT WHY MICHAEL'S ACTING THIS WAY.
WHAT WAY?
HE SEEMS FINE TO ME.
TELL ME ABOUT THIS NEW CLIENT.
"YOU KNOW, I JUST REMEMBERED."
"I'VE GOT TO GET MIKE SOME YOGURT,"
"'CAUSE IF I DON'T DO THAT, BOY, YOU KNOW HOW HE IS."
HE NEVER MENTIONED TROUBLE AT WORK.
DO YOU THINK THERE COULD BE A CONNECTION?
COULD BE.
"YOU HEAR ATF INVESTIGATION, IT RAISES FLAGS."
I WISH I COULD BE MORE HELPFUL.
SORRY.
I THINK YOU SHOULD JUST FOCUS ON GETTING YOUR SON BACK.
THAT'S THE BEST WAY TO DEAL WITH IT.
"EVELYN, I THINK YOU'RE STRONGER THAN YOU REALIZE."
THEN MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE JUST STUCK WITH IT.
"YOU KNOW, WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED"
IF I HAD PRETENDED THAT EVERYTHING WAS ALL RIGHT?
"BUT I DIDN'T WANT MY FAMILY TO BE A LIE,"
NOT FOR JASPER AND NOT FOR ME.
LEE:
"This is about the cartel case, I hope?"
Gotta go.
Bye.
Whoa.
I hope we didn't get her in trouble.
"Uh, not ""we,"" you."
It was just an e-mail.
"Anyway, it got us a lead, didn't it?"
"Yeah, and possibly Gregorio fired."
"I know how we all feel about Gregorio, but we gotta learn to work without her again, okay?"
Okay.
"Starting with figuring out how, exactly, Jared's connected to the bank robbery."
"Well, it may be what his father and girlfriend were hiding."
"I mean, Dana seemed really nervous."
Let's have another chat with them.
Only separately this time.
Looks like Sebastian's found something on the car.
I'll check it out.
Is he okay?
Don't know.
SEBASTIAN (grunts):
"Little help, please?"
"Ah, thank you."
"Man, I am sore."
"It's gotta be all that ab work I've been doing prepping for NCIS training, you know?"
Whoa.
"You care to turn that off, please?"
What?
"Oh, right."
Sorry.
So what about this beauty?
That's S.L.
Hello.
"Yes, I'm Babette."
So are we going?
Are we staying?
"No, we have to go."
"Fine, okay."
Good.
If you're looking for me.
I'll be here.
Bye.
Where did you pick up the little one?
Blonde angel.
She just appeared.
How come that doesn't happen to me?
You are too pretty.
Should I make myself ugly or what?
Disguise yourself.
Take a look at this.
You know what this looked like before?
No idea.
I do.
What do we do now?
Do you want me to retrieve the file?
"If you ask me, It was a Halloween prank by a couple of kids from the tattoo shop."
"From earth, the sun and the moon appear to be the same size."
Is it coincidental or physical necessity?
This is good.
"So tell me, what kind of quiz show is this?"
Sauerbruch...
Who would be interested in that?
I don't want to discuss it with you now.
Hello?
Something wrong?
Carter?
What are you doing?
"We really can't help you anymore, sir."
I'm not a junkie.
"The stuff just finds me, you know?"
How convenient.
I need another room for Mr. Hudlin.
He says Exam 3 is full of ectoplasm.
- Did you cut yourself shaving?
- What?
Never mind.
Lipstick.
- Dr. Carter...
"- Mrs. Breeland, you need to stay in bed."
"Otherwise, we might be tempted to put somebody else in it."
"Okay, I think we're getting there."
Hardly.
Board number two is for the patients in the halls.
"We have heat exhaustion, barbecue-smoke inhalation, and boils."
All up for grabs.
- I love my job.
"- No, you don't."
Why are you dressed like that if you can't prescribe nothing?
The smell of fresh med students in the morning.
What is it about them?
They all seem so...
- Gullible?
Immature?
Vapid?
- I was going to say sweet.
"The pants, $285.99, minus 10% for both."
"Unfortunately, the shirt's not on sale, but I can knock off 5% from the $69.99."
"The shoes were just marked down from $155, so you're looking at $1,042.68."
I'm pretty good with numbers.
- Yeah.
- I guess so.
"Yeah, so let me know when I can ring that up for you guys."
- Yes.
Thank you.
- Thanks.
Hey.
Hey.
- Could you help me?
"- Oh, yeah."
"Yeah, sure."
I'm looking for a tie.
"Oh, well, we're having a 15% sale on the ties."
"And if you want, I could probably get you an additional 10% with my employee discount."
- This one's nice.
- Yeah.
"Oh, yeah."
"This one has actually been treated with our patented Nano-Tex fabric protection, you know, to repel liquids and stains."
"- Well, that's really functional."
- Yeah.
Yeah.
"Yeah, it's pretty functional."
Face me.
Stay still.
"Despite being tempted by the Nano-Tex repellant,"
"I'm actually not here for a tie, Ben."
I came to see you.
You did?

"They gamble because, secretly, they want to lose but with you... (LAUGHS) it's not even a secret."
"That's very poetic, Freddie."
You should write it down.
I don't want someone like you to owe me this much money.

BRYANT:
IT'S AN EXAMPLE OF ONE OF ROBINSON'S GREAT MISSTEPS.
THE GOVERNMENT WAS USING HIM
TO DESTROY ANOTHER AFRICAN AMERICAN.
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN A GREAT STRATEGY TO HAVE
ONE BLACK PERSON CRITICIZE ANOTHER
TO DRIVE A WEDGE BETWEEN THE BLACK COMMUNITY.
AND IT WAS VERY EFFECTIVE.
NARRATOR:
THE INVESTIGATION RUINED ROBESON'S CAREER.
THE SINGER HIMSELF DECLINED TO CRITICIZE ROBINSON
AND INSTEAD DENOUNCED THE HEARING
AS AN INSULT TO ALL NEGRO PEOPLE.
"MEANWHILE, ROBINSON CONTINUED TO EXCEL ON THE FIELD."
"ON THE FINAL DAY OF THE SEASON,"
BROOKLYN CLINCHED THE NATIONAL LEAGUE PENNANT
FOR THE SECOND TIME IN THREE SEASONS.
"BUT IN THE WORLD SERIES, JACKIE STRUGGLED AT THE PLATE."
THE DODGERS AGAIN LOST TO THE NEW YORK YANKEES.

"""Make a wish, man!"
"Make a wish."""
I'm sorry.
It's about an authoritative tone.
That's how I know that Jay-Z is not gonna be able to control Blue Ivy when she gets older.
His voice is too light.
"And first of all, Jay-Z's voice, man, it's just so fun."
"If he was outside of a haunted house, it would be hilarious."
"He'd be trying to warn people about what's going on in the haunted house, he'd be..."
"""Yo, don't go in there."
"There's a ghost in there."""
"""Jeah, eh, eh, eh."""
"¶ Jeah, gather 'round hustlers ¶"
¶ That's if you still living.
"¶ And get on down to that oh, eh, eh, HOV ¶"
"""Look."
"""Okay, you wanna go in there?"
"""You serious?"
"""Okay, you're dead."
Bye-bye.
"""Fuck you."
"Ha ha ha ha, yep."""
"""Yep!"""
"""Solange is in there."
"Be careful."""
"Blue Ivy, man."
That don't even sound like a real name.
"That sound like stripper lotion, don't it?"
"""Girl, I don't never go down the pole"
"Now here I am, and here I'm gonna stay!"
So think it over.
What are you doing here?
"Franz, come home!"
Why that look?
What's wrong?
- It's not a woman's business.
Things will get better.
You think so?
"I've starved and frozen many a time, but things always turned out fine."
So you're Mieze.
I was Franz's girlfriend before.
I'm Cilly.
I don't know a thing about Franz.
"Oh, don't you look smart!"
- What do you want to know?
- Everything!
A guy with one arm ― out of the question!
Buy him a barrel organ or give him a couple marks.
We've got to watch out for him.
You know why.
What good's a guy with no arm?
- Or a guy with no brain!
- Huh?
You can't see he's come to his senses.
He just wants to spy on us!
Rubbish!
I know what he wants.
"I'll try him out, and I'll be responsible."
"Mieze, you've got to watch out for him."
They make him do anything they want.
"I'll get a job, if I have to be an organ grinder."
Made right.
- Made right?
- Orders from the fleet.
Take your hands off me.
You mutinous filth!
Don't think you can soon be forgiven.
- It's not easy.
- Mr. Scott-Padget.
I would advise you to say no more.
You're compounding the offence!
You're in it with them!
Your friends will be dealt with.
"When their lordships hear what I have to say, you're done."
You're under arrest.
You've done for us all.
What's it matter?
You all wanted him dead.
You're as bad as him.
"And between you, you've finished all of us."
Give me a knife!
Get back!
"We had everything, and he took it from us!"
- Let's go.
- While the fog's thick.
"They're right, Vizard."
I want no sound.
We're gonna weigh anchor and make sail.
- Weigh anchor.
- Quiet now.
Anchor aweigh!
Set the courses!
Course west-sou'west.
- Passports.
I left my jacket.
What did you say about passports?
- I had the jacket when I was at the table.
Did you leave passports there?
"I'm sorry, sire."
We left the passports.
- Thing?
"Christ, you will know now that we have lied."
You've been drinking all night.
- We have to get out of this way
And leave the Balkans.
Believe me when I say
"That it is best not to make him piss, that guy."
I can assure you that there will be heels.
"So, are we now pursued by a crazy Turkish and a crazy Serbian?"
The quickest way to go is to cross the sea to Italy.
But there is another border.
Montenegro.
Let's go.
I drive.
Sire?
Ludovic?
I am very ashamed.
I know.
I have to resign.
"No, Ludovic."
"He served me well, I count on her."
I failed completely.
"No, nothing at all."
Sire.
Here is the frontier.
(grunting) And here's baby boy number one.
I understand you've decided to name him Stewie.
One more to go.
And here he... oh.
"Oh, dear."
"Oh, no, did Dave not make it?"
"Okay, Meg, I've cleaned your room and I did your homework."
Can I be done now?
"Oh, no, there's a lot more things"
I need you to do for me.
There are?
Like what?
"Well, now you have to watch"
An Officer and a Gentlemen with me.
And that's it?
(laughs) No.
"At the end, when Richard Gere carries Debra Winger out of the paper mill, you have to read what's on this index card."

"That's going to be you some day, Meg."
I know it will.
I just know it will.
"Okay, Chris, I want to wear contacts, but I'm too squeamish to put them in myself, so you need to help me."
Really?
Is it that hard?
My eyes are too sensitive.
It's like they overreact or something.
Okay.
"Ah, what happened to your eye?"
!
Don't worry about it.
Just put the lens in.
"That's not the point, Cookie."
"The point is, what do you do with him?"
"You tip your mitt and the jerries pull him out of here and plant him in some place else, like Stalag 16 or 15."
Or you kill him off and the Krauts kill off the whole barracks.
Every one of us.
"So, what do you do?"
Who is it?
"If you don't want to tell me, why don't you tell Hoffy or Security?"
Yeah.
Security.
What's keeping Hoffy?
- Why don't we get any news about Dunbar?
-He'll be back.
They got no proof.
"Come on, boys."
Soft and sweet.
Beguile me.
Betty.
Betty.
Betty.

"May I have this dance, miss?"
"Why, sure."
"Pinch me, darling."
"Pinch me, so I'll know I'm not dreaming."
"Thank you, darling."

What the hell are you doing here?
Ahhh!
I just came to have my fortune told.
Also to apologize forthat night...
Whatever.
Take your ass downstairs and get yourfortune told there.
"Once the cup is lifted, it has to be read."
"Yourfortune is dark, complicated."
Some guy is after you.
And also a foreign guy.
What's this constant money talk?
You end up dancing at a bar.
C'mon really?
I don't like dancing.
What exactly do you see?
"I see your mom's pussy, right here."
"Sorry, here is someone to see you."
- Where's Ted Carter?
Right here.
Let's stop that corny music and do some serious dancing.
- Those are good records.
- These are new ones.
- I brought some mistletoe.
- Mistletoe?
"- Hang it high, will you?"
- Only if I can kiss Betty.
"Tonight, nobody is safe from me."
"- Hey, Christmas is eight months away."
- I do my Christmas kissing early.
- Hey!
- Where's the punch?
- It's over there.
"- Oh, good."
- Add the old family formula.
"- Now you're talking, Rod."
My mother wouldn't want me to...
- Don't tell me she's here.
"- No, she's at the movies."
Put the booze in the bowl.
That's the one thing she made me promise.
You want to have a party or not?
- You can't fight city hall.
- Put the liquor in.
Forget it.
I know 10 other ways to make a party successful.
"Now, first, we gotta make the atmosphere a little more intimate."
"Rodney, aren't you the one."
- Evening.
- Good evening.
- What is it?
- Tabasco.
I've never known Captain MacDaniel to run scared.
I'd kind of like to eyeball this situation.
Don't get killed.
I don't want anything upsetting my plans for going home.
L'll give you full cooperation.
Good night.
You didn't get a chance to give him the whole story.
L'll arrange another meeting.
MacDANIEL:
Kowalski!
Kill that light!
You better check the gun placements again.
I'm going to have a look-see.
Over there.
A heavy concentration to the south.
Let's see what Starlight-Starbright has to say.
That's a ruse.
"Kowalski, MacDaniel, pass the word."
Quietly.
Strengthen the north wall.
I repeat:
Strengthen the north wall.
Out.
KOWALSKI:
"Every third man, north wall, quietly."
"Every third man, north wall."
We had better inform the mortar crew.
- Pit one.
- Pit one.
- Pit two.
"Viljanen, goddammit."
Get up!
Show me...
A disgrace to the entire brigade.
Does he live here?
I'm too scared to sleep.
I can come and keep my finger in your navel.
Easy...
You're moving further down.
"Down, until I can feel your tongue... ah."
Don't turn it off or the neighbors will hear.
"No, I wasn't talking to you."
"He hung UP""-"
What happened to the smell?
-I threw Hakkarainen out.
Don't take any new idiots in.
-Of course not.
The red Batman has moved into building D.
"He's an old friend of mine, Jesse Viljanen."
He was just named firefighter of the year.
He was torching the garbage can!
"-He's a nice guy, really."
I think he's repulsive and nuts.
"What's eating you, Jemina?"
"Grow up, Mom."
Don't let your boy play with matches anymore!
Will you come and work at the office when you get better?
Are you sure?
Yes?
I see...
Goodbye.
You must not torch garbage cans.
"- I'm so frustrated, Claire."
"Give him an ""I want sex"" look."
He'll think something's in my eye.
You have to generate heat.
"Sometimes, I swear he feels it."
Men aren't that bright.
It's easy.
"Be subtle, mysterious, seductive."
"Subtle, mysterious, seductive?"
Why don't men come with instructions?
- More coffee?
- Thanks.
My tickets just arrived.
My first lecture is in Paris on the 24th.
I leave Saturday.
- Do you want an English muffin?
"- No, thanks."
- I'm off.
I have an early class.
- All right.
Have a nice day.
"- Oh, by the way..."
- Mmm?
Would saying now that I want sex tonight be enough of a warning?
Or should we wait till you come back from Europe?
"Yeah, that's better."
"No, no..."
That's fine.
All right.
I guess I'll see you tonight.
Have a nice day.
- Have you ever tried making love?
- do you understand?
- Right.
We're here to find out what Gene Hansen was doing the night he died.
I got it.
"If you suspect someone, don't accuse them."
Don't let on that you suspect.
Okay?
Do not pass go.
Do not collect $200.
You come directly to me.
- Do you understand?
"- Okay, okay, can we just go in now?"
All right.
"Wait, wait, wait."
Don't you think we should go in separately?
You don't think I fit in?
"Yeah, sure, narc."
"Okay, you take the customers."
Don't let on that we know each other.
What?
So what are you serving?
This is a private club.
"It's okay, Wynter."
This is Vicki Nelson.
She's doing some work for me.
She'll have some questions for you.
Please feel free to give her any assistance that she needs.
Taking a walk on the dark side are we?
"Unfortunately, I live there."
How long did you know Gene?
Since eighth grade.
Drama club.
Let me know when it is.
"- Bye, Parfitt."
- Mrs. Cole.
Shall we find the lady who'll do our makeup?
I suppose so.
It's coming over.
Mind your heads.
Cigarette?
That's it.
"Okay, line it up, please."
Line it up and keep it straight.
That's it.
I've never much seen the point in men.
"Still, I do hate to see you pining."
"Oh, I'm not pining."
Ellis moved out weeks ago.
I'm already used to it.
It wasn't Ellis I was thinking of.
Forgive me.
It's just that...
"When we were shooting in Devon, you always seemed so... vivid."
Perhaps I'm just in a sentimental mood.
My landlady was killed yesterday.
I could hear her husband crying through the wall all night long.
"It seems to me when life is so very precarious, it's an awful shame to waste it."
I was wondering.
"On page 76, I say..."
They're getting worried.
About the ending.
Turned Ministry spy now?
Is that it?
Could I...
Thank you for calling.
Lieutenant Barnhill received his posting.
He leaves in a few days.
"He was the airman who took your daughter to the movies, right?"
"Gosh, yes."
How did you know?
I figured.
The fight.
I thought there might be a connection.
"Perhaps retribution by the men of the parish, so I asked him."
Men?
Four to one.
He asked me to give you this to pass on to Emma if you felt it was...
Appropriate.
I have read it.
"I find I am camp censor, for my sins."
"It is a simple, rather sweet goodbye."
- I don't want to.
- Read it?
Read it or give it.
What if he is killed in action?
She is too young to know that a young man went to his death thinking of her.
"You may tell him I took it, but I reserve the right not to pass it on to her."
It would cast a shadow over her life.
I understand.
Mrs. Coyne.
You knew.
What?
What was being planned.
I didn't.
I swear.
Barney did.
Okay.
"Here... you can hold me if you want, mama."
"Oh, hell, no."
Try not to move.
"Can you pass me that, please?"
This?
Thank you.
What the fuck?
It is the fastest way.
Does it look good?
"You gonna look hot, mamita."
"Yo, wait till you see this place, E."
It's like an amusement park.
They got like a butcher shop in there.
They got a club in there.
"Yo, they got these like plush brand new seats, kid."
I don't even know how they play baseball in there.
It's like a hangout.
"What's up, bro?"
"What the fuck are the chances, bro?"
You should see the way this nigga walks around
Waving his arms and shit.
"That's wild, B, but come on don't worry about it."
"When Angie was pregnant, right,"
She had this...
"Um, they did the thing, you know where..."
Sonogram.
"Yeah, sonogram."
"They told me it was a boy, I was like wow."
I gave that nigga my name.
Enrique Michael Rodriguez.
"That's my name, son."
"Ain't no problem at all, Sheriff."
Anything I can do to help.
It's working.
Come on.
"Are you all right, hon?"
Did he hurt you?
"I'm sorry, look..."
"The sheriff's upstairs, all right."
We have to warn him.
I need you to help me open the door.
Can you do that?
Okay.
I'm gonna hook this out through the door.
Okay.
"Then you turn it on, all right."
"Catch you a cup of coffee, Sheriff?"
Homemade iced tea?
"No, thank you."
I'm sorry.
How long did you say you lived here?
I didn't.
"Well, how long?"
Long time.
And not a lot of decorations in this nice house.
"No, never had that for that kind of thing."
Is that right?
"Well, my wife Betty, she..."
She took care of all that stuff before she passed on.
"Nothing quite like a woman's touch, huh."
My wife died just last year.
"Well, my condolences, Sheriff."
Suppose it'll get better with time.
I really don't know how much longer
I can do this whole peace and love thing.
"It's the Amity way, all right?"
We're just trying to blend in.
Mus SCOFFS)
I'm trying to blend in.
It's just not working.
PETER:
Comin' through on your right.
"Okay, here we go."
"Hey, look, a rainbow."
- Oh.
-it's pretty.
WOMAN:
Go with happiness.
Virtual pathological friendliness with unquestioned passivism?
I love this place.
Thank you.
Go with happiness.
"Oops, excuse me."
"Hey, Tris, I really like your hair, by the way."
Did you try to cut it all short and weird like that?
"Peter, why don't you take your food and sit down, huh?"
Or what?
"Besides, I think we should all stick together now that we're"
-all officially fugitives.
-TRIS:
Shh.
"Wait, what do you mean, ""officially fugitives""?"
"- Oh, you don't know?"
"-Let's go, let's go."
You didn't tell Caleb?
Did you ever have a day when just everything went wrong?
Take your things and go in there and change.
Thank you.
"If you have any trouble with your buttons, just sing out."
(TRAIN HORN BLARING)
(THUNDER CRACKING)
Oh!
"Are you all right, Wilbur?"
"Yes, I'm fine."
There's nothing to be frightened of.
It's just the storm that woke you up.
You mustn't be afraid of thunder and lightning.
I'm not afraid.
"Oh, yes, you are."
All youngsters are.
"Why, I was terrified when I was your age."
I used to crawl in with my little brother.
"Remember, I'm only your nephew."
(THUNDER RUMBLING) This going to be a bad one.
"Just hang on to me tight, Willy."
I...
"I'm all right, really."
Just rest your head against my shoulder.
I can't do that.
Your husband wouldn't like that.
I have no husband.
"I'm not married, either."
I hope not.
And I'm glad you're not married.
Why?
Should I tell you?
Yes.
"You got a ""D"" on your math test?"
You don't get D's.
"Eh, what are you gonna do?"
"I'll tell you what you're gonna do, Brick."
You're gonna study.
Math is very important in life.
You use math in everything...
"Oh, even I can't say it like I believe it."
Hey.
Hey.
"Look at this... a ""D."""
"- Axl, get in here!"
- This is Brick.
Really?
"What happened, buddy?"
You don't get D's.
We're kinda counting' on you to pull up the family average.
I'm reading at an eighth grade level.
Why can't I please you people?
!
Just reading isn't gonna get you into college.
"Oh, I'm not going to college."
I've decided to live with you guys forever.
Forever.
"Well, mike, you know what this means, don't ya?"
"Oh, jeez."
We're gonna have to help Brick with his homework.
"In our house, helping with homework"
Is something that's never gone well.
Write it down.
Write it down.
Why aren't you writing it down?
Who am I kidding?
I'm in no condition to do this.
I'm sorry.
"I'm in no condition to do this, mate."
I'm in no condition.
I'm sorry.
I'm in no condition to do this.
"Oh, goodness."
"Oh, goodness, what have you done?"
"What have you done this time, Jimmy?"
Are you still conscious?
Yeah.
Hello.
You're gonna be okay.
Just gotta get a little bit of power into you.
"Ladies, could you give us a bit of space, please?"
Thank you.
"You're a big deal, you know?"
You're not the only one wronged by Akan.
You and I both want the same thing.
This might hurt a bit.
There we go.
That's wonderful.
Now I can take you back to my lab.
"I'm Jimmy, by the way."
I realize this is all very confusing for you.
"Um, but... it's better if I show you at the lab..."
Hello?
"Oh, spasiba."
They're here.
They must've followed you.
I can't let them see me like this.
"I know all about the new lag,the one who likes to blow things up."
Is that his voice on the tape?
"If you want to know what the song is, then you find out why I am in here all the time."
Deal.
The song?
It's a Korean lullaby.
The thing about land mines is...
You got to remember where you put 'em.
"Otherwise,you blow up your own men."
The lullaby was the enemy's way of communicating that information.
One word in each line indicated a different location.
We did the same thing.
Crosby and Sinatra.
"""Snow..."
Beard...
Grace.
"Snow... ""Beard..."
Grace.
Where are you putting them now?
"""Little brook..."
In the woods.
*****
There's more.
A second verse.
"""Among the pines you flow."
Pine street.It matches.
Broke the lock and put a new one on.
"Yeah,and the kicker is,it looks like he broke it from the inside."
"He broke out,not in?"
This is where he came back.
"Well,let's find out."
Looks like somebody was painting.
-I'm sorry sister.
-It's okay now.
Why are you soaked in rain?
Will you change your clothes!
They said Migs is not in their house.
I also called Ara but he isn't there either.
Where could he be?
I don't want to think he's with Bela.
You should've told me you were coming.
I could've prepared for your birthday.
What really happened to you?
And then you'll come here drenched in the rain.
I don't know.
I was disoriented.
"I can't remember, I didn't know where I live."
That's why I went to your house.
-It's good you didn't get lost--
"-Bela, I really wanted to be with you."
"Wait, wait!"
You have to go home.
-Joy might be looking for you.
-I don't give a damn about Joy.
What if he's not with Bela?
.
And he was picked on in the streets?
And something bad happened to him that I don't know.
"Sis, sister, just go to sleep."
Do you know that's what I wanted to hear from you when I came back from Canada?
But you chose Joy.
And you got married.
I know.
But I'm not happy with her.
Not too bad.
"It was like the Walt Disney version of the ho chi minh story, but other than that, it was terrific."
What have we got?
Anything exciting here?
"Also, you got an invitation."
What's this?
Dinner at the white house.
You're kidding me.
Is it a big party or something?
Just 5 or 6 people.
"Thursday, huh?"
Far out.
Girl:
"Hi, mom."
What did you do today?
Stuff.
"What's that mean, ""stuff""?"
"Well, me and Sharon played a game in the backyard, and we had a picnic down by the river."
That sounds fun.
You should have seen this man came along on this beautiful gray horse.
Really what kind?
"Was it a mare, a gelding, what?"
I think it was a gelding.
It was gray.
It was so beautiful.
The guy let me ride it all around.
"Oh, that's nice."
It was so nice.
"Oh, I loved it."
"Mom, can't we get a horse?"
Not while we're in Washington.
"We'll see when we get home, ok?"
We got a problem.
Why didn't you just radio me?
I wanted to radio but...
Looks like they decided to join the hunt.
"If they find Ellia, they'll kill her."
"Sheppard, this is McKay."
"What is it, Rodney?"
The villagers are on the move and it doesn't look like they're gonna a picnic.
Are they heading for the caves?
"Not at the moment, no."
"Alright, get back there and sit tight."
"We're losing time, guys."
Ellia?
Ellia?
She's not here.
Good Lord!
What?
She took the retrovirus.
- You said it wasn't ready.
- It's not!
Not by a long shot.
What'll it do?
"To be honest, I have no idea."
"Colonel Sheppard, come in."
Go ahead.
We'vegotanotherproblem.
Ellia's gone and she's injected herself with the retrovirus.
Why would she do that?
She must have overheard us talking about it.
I told Zaddik it might be the key to making her human.
Please.
You've got to find her before the villagers do.
Amy is a really nice girl and so are you.
I told her all about you.
"If you told her all about me,"
I doubt she'd want to meet me.
"No, she does, she does, promise."
All right.
What time?
She's usually home by seven.
Are you sure about this?
I don't feel like I can hang out in the coffee shop unless Amy's comfortable with our being friends.
She's my wife.
All right.
"But if it gets boring, I'm leaving."
It's not going to be boring.
I have someone I want you to meet.
Oh?
Why didn't you say so?
See you at seven.
You want another cup of coffee?
I'll get the waitress.
"Oh, I don't know."
I kind of like those scones.
I got it!
"So, you're not dating anyone?"
Kind of.
But you know what they say about relationships.
"""Sooner or later, they're all over."""
Even your relationship with Ricky.
And yours.
"Hey, Clementine,"
"Adrian needs another cup of coffee, do you mind?"
"No, I don't mind."
Switzerland?
Switzerland.
"So it's a sort of, appropriately enough, kind of neutral typeface."
What could you have got?
Do you know that typeface?
"Oh, yes!"
"I would have thought you would, actually."
Tell me?
I use it in day-to-day life.
You must do.
Invented by Microsoft for their Windows operating system.
"So, you got two out of a maximum five."
"Which means you're trailing the Lutrophiles, you're on six,"

"Team Lutrophiles, your turn again."
Which topic would you like?
We are left with...
Shall we go for Geography now?
I say go for Geography.
All right.
"I think we'll go for Geography, please."
"Geography, that was an easy decision."
You're looking for waterfalls.
You have ten seconds to confer.
"Dettifoss, Angel..."

"-Marianne, we're going to start with you."
Come to our house to eat.
She's right.
You ought to quit being such a stranger.
"Now, I'd like to propose a toast."
- To Vince Hardy.
- The best Captain of Homicide ever.
Vince Hardy.
How about we drink to my mother?
"She was a Hardy, too."
"And Jimmy, let's drink to him."
It'd be fitting here by the river.
Uncle Vince is dead.
"They're dead, too."
Drink to Jimmy!
- That's enough!
"- No, It's not enough, damn it!"
- Let go of me.
I'm all right.
- You don't belong here.
"- Me and you, Eddie."
- Anytime.
The best day of the year.
Better than Christmas!
- Are these policemen all relatives?
"- No, they're just criminals."
How did they end up on the force?
"Part of some nationwide negative gene pool, I guess."
"- Don't do that, okay?"
- What?
That thing where you're not really talking to me.
- That's not the answer.
- It'll do till the answer turns up.
You know what I like about rich kids?
"Bam, nothing."
"Hey, Ryan, you wouldn't consider me rich, would you?"
I'd be more upper middle class?
"What's up, fool?"
"You know, you didn't have to hit him."
Sorry.
"You know, the cashier called the cops."
"Look, I don't know why Luke does that."
Did that.
He's just...
An ass?
Protective.
God.
It's my mom.
And... your dad.
It's been awhile.
Figure out what kind of shape this place is in.
Wow.
Oh.
That's what...those contractors have been doing.
This place is fantastic!
You think so?
You don't think it's too much?
Too much?
You're talking to the guy whose wife just imported ceramic shower-curtain rings from Morocco.
This is gorgeous.
The high ceilings and the molding.
It reminds me of...
Your parent's house.
On Elm Grove.
"Yeah, with the vaulted ceilings and those great beams."
"- Yes, please."
"Er, forgive me. it's been a long time since I've seen anything like that."
"Oh, I wear this to hide it."
"It's so ugly, you know."
- And may I ask which camp?
"- Jadwiga, Poland."
It was long ago.
I am sorry.
Don't be sorry for me.
"Because Saul and I, we survived."
But it never ends.
Now they got Saul again.
"Now, Lena, we'll get him."
Don't worry.
When are your people coming in?
I'm not sure.
"Tonight, tomorrow."
They don't give you a schedule.
But they will try to contact us at my house.
Rick's working on that.
Calls to your number will be switched here.
- How does he do that?
"- Illegally, I'll wager."
He has connections.
"Tommy, you still have to take me to my home."
"Lena, we have been all through that."
I don't have any clothes.
"Nothing, not even a toothbrush."
- I'll get whatever you need.
- You don't know what to get.
I'll bring a little bit of everything.
"Tommy, my personal stuff."
"I'll bet you $50,000 i can put it up to 200."
"I'll take you... because if you do that, money won't mean anything."
There won't be any wall street.
"You've lost your reason, jim."
You're getting drunk- drunk with power.
"10,000 at 140."
I'll take it.
"25,000 at 140."
I'll take that.
I'm taking all the gold that's being offered.
"Now, name your price."
"50,000 at 140."
I'll take it.
"100,000 at 140."
I'll buy it!
A million at 140.
And i'll buy that!
"The trading is closed for the day, gentlemen."
"I've found him, josie."
"Well, josie, here i am."
What do you want?
"Nick, is it true- what jim told me?"
That i'm fighting him?
Yes.
"Look, josie, do you think i'd have walked out on him if i didn't have to?"
I'm trying to save him from himself.
He can't win.
"He'll not only be hated, he'll be ruined."
And you'll make millions.
Yes... and it'll all be his if he wants it.
"Josie, we've both got to help him because he's after something that no human being can have."
Are you sure?
Spare me!
Spare me!
Get off the horse.
Move it!
These are the few we just caught?
What do they have with them?
Silk and red jade.
"Compared to those,"
I think these scums here are worth more.
They look tough.
-Take them away.
-Yes.
Hey hey hey.
Watch it.
What's on your mind?
Eh?
Nothing.
What Prince Ju-Mong has found out... don't you wish to know?
I don't place high hopes on that.
"Now, it seems no one can come up with something good."
The reason I gave him two days is because I know this expedition means a lot to him.
"For us,"
We can always leave it to next time.
"But for Prince Ju-Mong, he can't do the same."
"Compared to the acknowledgement I want from Father,"
Prince Ju-Mong's need of King Geum-Wa's acknowedgement far outweighs mine.
Looks like the scale has tipped.
What do you mean by that?
You used to treat Prince Dae-So and Ju-Mong equally.
Now it seems you're leaning closer to Prince Ju-Mong.
"What you've said, I can't deny."
How should I put it?
Hallucination brought on by over-tiredness say what?
"Do not ""say what"" me."
I invented that.
Oh please that was so me.
Do you really want to have this argument?
No.
'Cause I know it was me.
Now my friends are not gonna hate me.
So just poof right back in my head where you belong.
They're gonna hate you they're gonna hate you.
-Oh real mature.
-Oh real mature.
[Both muttering]
[Mimicking Miley]
I cannot believe I'm having this argument with myself.

Let me ask you something son.
You ever thought about medical school?
Law school?
Any school?
[Clicks tongue]
Of course not.
Sorry I took so long.
Sometimes it takes a while to shake off Hannah.
It's cool.
No worries.
"Oh, I get it, I get it!"

You ready to go?
"Yeah, right."

Why don't we just paint the floor Eggshell

It's fourth grade.
We're all just treading water.

No!
She's... smart.

Are you sure it's not for Lily Rosen?
You were at that science fair.
She brought that frog back to life!
This is for our Lily.
T-they're suggesting that she skip fifth grade and go right into middle school next year.

Do you realize that everybody but us rounds up to the nearest five minutes?
"Today made me realize something, Mitchell."
"No, I don't want to be a 4:17 kind of person."
- Do you?
"- Yes, I do."
'Cause that phone call needs to be done by 4:23 so that I am not a dead man by 4:41.
Give me my phone.
- Nope.
Nope.
No.

We're gonna do something together.
"Yes, take the rest of the day off."

Yeah.
This is definitely the place.
Andrew:
Two for lunch?
[Shouting in Korean]
The watch.
Richard.
What's going on?
You were here 18 months ago.
"Uh, yeah."
It's my place.
So?
Do you recognize him?
"No, should I?"
"Uh, I was here about, um..."
[Speaks Korean]
I was here about a year and a half ago.
Something happened.
You yelled at me.
"Oh, you're the guy with the watch."
What watch?
You...
You couldn't pay.
And then I was gonna call the cops on you.
"And then, uh, you..."
you gave me your watch to hold onto.
"Said you were gonna come back for it, but you never came."
Mm.
"Well, you're on medical suspension, so if this shit's in California, it's shady as hell."

I'm so tired I can barely move.
What did the doctor say?
"Apparently, feeling like shit is perfectly normal."

"You know, if I could carry this child for you, I would."
Really?
Yeah.
You're amazing.
How did I ever find you?
The universe fucking loves you.

You see me work with your girl?
I did.
What do you think?
Honestly?
She doesn't know what the fuck she's doing.
She got some talent.
What's her story?
She's had a few fights.
She's got a shitty record.
"She's bounced around a bunch of gyms, and she had a falling out with Marco over at team elite."
"He doesn""t have anything to say."
"You, sir, do you have anything to say on your brother""s desire to speak to me?"
- You did it!
- No!
"See, with cheating comes lying."
And lying and lying some more.

I thought that maybe you could go there and spy on him.
"You are hopeless, child."
You know that?

Any sign of them?
"No, Your Majesty."

We've found no trace of your daughter or Sebastian.

Where have you been?
I was just out looking at the stars.
You were stargazing...

How about the truth now.
I've been sneaking out.

We'll talk about it further in the morning.
Okay.

WHO IS THIS
Amanda.
What happened?
"They let him off the hook, but it wasn't easy, let me tell you."
That's great news!
I guess.
You guess?
"Leo, come on."
Ben didn't burn down the school and he didn't get kicked out of school or get anyone else kicked out.
That's the best possible outcome.
It's over!
Congratulations!
"Oh, it's far from over."
He has to get through the rest of the school year without getting in trouble.
He won't get in anymore trouble.
He's not a bad kid.
Dylan's still circling around.
"Oh, another girl will come along and he'll forget all about her."
"(KNOCKING) No, I won't."
Ben!
I heard the good news.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Congratulations!
We should all go out and celebrate.
He can't go out.
He's on restriction.
"Oh, Leo."
Wait.
"I'm on restriction from seeing Dylan, but I can still go out."
"I'm going out with Alice, uh, we're going to go catch a movie or something."
"Oh, are you?"
"Yeah, she's coming over."
I will just be in the kitchen.
"That's okay, isn't it?"
- this is wonderful.
- Cilantro.
So what do we do?
Do we confront her?
"Oh God, no."
"Geez, I don't want to know if it's true."
What sort of attitude are we supposed to have?
Are we suppose to have an attitude?
I already have an attitude.
But it may be my mother's attitude.
I don't want to get hysterical about this.
Why shouldn't I be hysterical?
She's fifteen. I should be hysterical.
"Danlelle, lf you have on my sweats I'm going to kill you,"
Do you understand me?
- Can I taste whatever it is?
- Sure.
"- Cilantro, I love that."
- Very good.
I thought with the tomato it would sharpen it a bit-- l think it's great.
is that the fillo stuff?
Honey?
Who's Jordan?
No one.
- You mean Jordan Catalano?
- ls that his last name?
I don't know.
You brought it up.
I met Rayanne's mom tonight...
"and she was all excited about your new boyfriend, Jordan."
Boyfriend?
That's a laugh.
I'm getting on that train.
What are you going to do to him?
Shut him up for good after I get the diamond.
"Now go on home, wait for my call."
"All right, but be careful."

"My uncle won't buy me a ticket, and I got the money."
I hate goofs who pick on kids.
Goofs?
Goofs!
"I hate goofs, too."
Then buy the kid a ticket.
Lengthen the crew's mission.
I promised them...
"No, probably not."
Don't worry.
Good-bye.
Isn't that ditch finished yet?
I've hit a rock.
Good luck.
"I can see, in fact. I can hear."
We've reached a dead-end too.
"You're lucky, you have a pickaxe."
We don't have one.
We can't do anything.
I can provide you with a pickaxe.
Our problem can't be solved by a pickaxe.
"If it could, things would be easier."
One blow of a pickaxe would do.
"Instead of a pickaxe, you can offer me some tea."
"Please, help yourself."
"If you give me your Juliet's address, I'll ask her to provide us with milk."
"In the village, knock on any door and they'll give you milk."
I didn't find any.
"Even at the sea, there's no water for me!"
Can't I ask her for some?
No problem.
She's at Kakrahman's.
Go to the village...
You'll find her there.
Kakrahman's house...
"Ask anyone, they'll know where it is."
Get in.
I'm not disturbing you?
"Come, let's sleep."
"No, I'll not come."
"Come Prakash, it'll be warm."
"You mean, are you that type?"
Yuck!
Our 'friendship' is broken.
Oh broken!
"What type are you, man?"
My patient likes to undress himself and I like to undress others.
Don't you wear brief?
Door is locked!
How come I got stuck here?
"Prakash, come."
Your cheeks are like sausages.

I'll not leave you.
Mother Jejamma!
You've to save me!

Did you show him stars?
"I didn't show him anything, in fact he showed me everything."
They are not ordinary people.
What happened?
Asking me what had happened?
One sleeps without any clothes and another doesn't like others wearing clothes.
"I beg you dear, please shift me from that room."
- Why?

Where's Donaghy?
I want to talk to him right now.
"Last time I saw him, he was riding the crane camera."
"Oh, I have Pete for you."
"Pete, oh, my God, I didn't know."
"No, hey, listen, it will give me a chance to spend more time with my kids."
I'm quitting.
I'm quitting right now.
"No, no, no, no, no."
You have the best job in New York.
Don't quit over this.
"Don't buy all the hot dogs, okay?"
I don't want to do this without you.
"Hey, I thought we cut the cat-lady sketch."
We're two minutes short!

Why don't you come on down here!
I'll show you!
"Thank you, my friend, but I think we are all very comfortable up here."
"That's right, isn't it?"
"Yes, we are very comfortable up here."
"So, once again, Jones, what was briefly yours is now mine."
What a fitting end to your life's pursuits.
You're about to become a permanent addition to this archaeological find.
Who knows?
"In a thousand years, even you may be worth something."
Son of a bitch.
"I'm afraid we must be going now, Dr. Jones."
Our prize is awaited in Berlin.
But I do not wish to leave you down in that awful place all alone.
"Slimy pig, you let me go!"
Stop it!

Hang on.
Don't...
-Indy!
-Don't fall!
"Marion, I got you!"
I got you!
- What about you?
- That's okay.
- We'll just stay for one night.
- No vacancies on the weekend.
I think he's fooling us.
It wasn't so expensive before.
I agree.
It's a rip off.
The rooms seem pretty much empty.
- See?
No one's here.
- You're right.
He was trying to make you stay longer.
"We'll stay here the night, and I'll look for some place cheaper."
- Let's look for one after we eat.
- Sure.
There's a lighthouse.
The sandstorm is not so bad.
How fortunate.
"Oh yeah, I enjoyed the music."
- Wasn't it nice?
- Yeah.
- Did you really like it?
- Yes.
The melody is soothing.
Nothing exaggerated.
You sung how an average person would.
I liked that amateur feel to it.
I admire your good taste in music.
"Changwook, I admire you as well."
How?
It's hard for a married man to openly bring along his girlfriend like you.
Hey...
And you just left?
Yup.
So it's over?
I don't know.
She says that every time and then she goes back to him.
Well maybe I'm just being paranoid?
It was time for the bi-monthly...
breakup post modern.
Who said what...
did I handle it well etc.
Can I ask you something JP?
What baby?
Come back to bed.
How many girls are you sleeping with?
Baby why you so drama?
So what?
So drama.
"I mean why would he hang out with me for six months, and text and call... everyday?"
Last night I was trying to make this really good point.
We just had sex JP.
It's good.
I just had your penis inside of me.
But that sounded...
a lot better in my head.
Ouch...
- Sorry.

Come.

- And no one will catch us.
"And whatever has happened, I don't want to know."
Come.

So.
Who tells you where to find us?
Never mind that.
"Axel, as your attorney--"
You stay out of this.
"Well, they can't have her."

Well the thing is I've been living a lie.
Just one?
"I'm living, like, 20."
What's yours?
"Well, I..."
I never actually had cancer.
I'll see you.
So he refused to tell you where he got the glasses?
Flat out refused.
"Yeah, isn't that just like him?"
"You know, he has to be the only one who has them."
"Yeah, tell me about it, soul sister."
"- Anyway, I told Jake that you said hi."
- What?
- You told Jake I said hi?
- Yeah.
I can't believe you did that.
Why did you tell him I said hi?
I never said hi.
When did I say hi?
- I never heard her say hi.
- It's common courtesy.
"No, no, Kramer."
You don't understand.
He made the last contact between us.
I had the upper hand in the post-breakup relationship.
"If he thinks that I said hi, then I lose the upper hand."
It's like a game of tag.
- Where are you going?
- Nowhere.
You're going to the bookstore to see Jake.
- So what if I do?
"Honey, our friend is asking for our help."
"She's 20 years old, for God's sake."
"She's probably with a bunch of dudes, like, sweating, drinking and dancing it out of her system."
What's the problem?
Let her spend the night on Hump Island!
"I promise, she's gonna come back here first thing in the morning!"
"Dave, firstly..."
I don't want her to spend a night on Hump Island.
"No, I..."
I'm just trying to say it's not like she's kidnapped or something.
"Now she's dead, Dave?"
Huh?
Now she's dead?
"She's dead, now?"
She's not dead.
She's dead on Hump Island!
I'm just trying to put it in perspective for you!
You know what?
"I don't even know why I'm blowing up at you, because it..."
It's...
"Once again, it's my fault."
This is a Shane thing.
I've been dealing with this all my life.
"First Jennifer, and now Trudy."
"We're gonna find her, okay?"
I got a plan.
I know how to get there.
You do?
"Yeah, I do."
"I just can't tell you now ""cause we got Mr. Belvedere clocking us."
Now everybody take it real casual.
Just drink your drinks and smile.
"... congregateinparks, free from fear..."

Don't you have anything to say?
Why you ask him?
"I'm asking you, he's not your dad."
I'm asking you.
Why look away?
Why do you bother?
He came between us when we'd problems.
Lisa...
"Lisa, aren't I good to you?"
"Exactly, aren't I good to you?"
"It has been 3 years, don't you like me?"
What're you saying?
You knew him before me?
Why didn't you tell me?
Then why go after her now?
That makes me the third party.
The air is great here.
"I can smell the grass and flowers,"
Nice smell...
Trying to sound poetic.
I like him this way.
What?
I can change if you like that.
How?
I've been observing him.
He expects nothing back for his money.
A direct and righteous man.
Bad-tempered but has a good heart.
The world needs people like him.
Don't change.
I've never heard anyone praise him.
Bad-tempered but a good heart.
"It's late, why do you come?"
"Miss Shui, Chan Mon-gut is a real creep."
"I've followed him for decades, he treats me badly too."
Don't you think he will be nice to you instead?
Any other thing else?
Miss Shui...
You are old enough to get married.
Take this piece ofjade.
Come on.
Go in and get some clothes.
"Follow me to Hong Kong, will you?"
You...
No?
"It's a long road to Hong Kong, take this piece ofjade with you."
"If you meet the bandits, you still have something valuable, thus they won't kill you."
"It's late, better go now."
Take care.
Master.
Where is the guy who sold this piece ofjade?
"None of my business, I don't know shooting."
I didn't kill!
I didn't kill...
I didn't kill!
Go!
I am innocent!
Go in.
Foreigner?
You murderer!
"Uncle, what did he scold me?"
No...
Help!
Are you going to torture me?
~ Sorry.
~ Dawson pawnbroker.
"A chance to get yourself a decent suit, John."
She died of leukaemia.
Left me her watch.
"~ I'll be with you in a tick, gents."
~ Thank you.
"What was your gran's name, son?"
Er...
I just called her Grannie.
I would've called her Glamorous Grannie.
This is a Rolex.
"Look, I-I just need the money."
"I'm sorry, son."
Mr Dawson has very strict rules about these things.
"I'm not sure that this really belonged to your gran, may she rest in peace."
"~ What are you trying to accuse us of, like?"
~ Being stupid.
~ How are you today?
~ Champion.
I'm sorry about the smell.
"The working stiff normally has all my sympathy, but this set of work-shy bastards, I could crucify."
I've got rats.
"We'd like to speak to Mr Dawson, please."
He's not in at the moment.
Perhaps I can help you?
Are you buying or selling?
Ah.
There is no Mr Dawson.
It's just a name I can blame when I have to say no.
"People can get, erm..."
What's the technical word?
"I was doing it in her sleep, but you woke her up."
I did wrap the blade in silk.
She's not hurting too much.
Come!
Do you want to finish the job?
Mary...
I love her.
And me.
- Do you love me?
"- Léo, yes!"
"Speaking of which, she told me again that I made love to her like nobody else."
Then she told me that it wasn't important.
"My father, my mother, you."
Love.
"The same feet, the same toes,"
the same footprints.
Footprints change with the sole of your shoes.
"The mud without marks, that's me."
You're cold.
You're warm.
You're hot.
You burn.
You kill.
Do you want to finish me?
Don't piss about!
"Take off your sneakers, so they think we aren't here."
I won't give her up to anybody.
No.
She belongs to me.
"If God made us, he would have made us different."
The rats have made off.
I'm offering you quiet on the Western front!
Get the fuck out of my way!
- Ma'am!
Ma'am!
- Let's go.
Tom James!
Tom James!
Tom James!
Thank you.
"Okay, I admit, this isn't boring."
Why make the total of electoral votes an even number?
- Insanity?
"- Listen, I know this is a long night."
You're tired and you're cold and your legs ache and you need the bathroom.
"Boy, do you need the bathroom."
That fucking guy with his fucking charm and his fucking son and his fucking wheelchair with his spine all fucked up.
My grandmother survived the Dust Bowl.
"And before she died at the age of 89, she told me a secret that she kept for almost 50 years."
The story concerns...
"Ladies and gentlemen, Tom James."
How about it?
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Wow.
Do I know how to pick 'em?
Yep.
"Well, thank you so much for being here."
I know it's been a wait.
And we really do appreciate your presence.
"What a night, right?"
It's the night of nights.
"Um, you know what I want to do?"
I don't know what the problem is.
"Okay, sweet, yes."
Best?
I don't think so.
It's 1 0 after 7. I have to go to work.
Just give me one good reason why we shouldn't.
"God, it's a hundred degrees in here, and I'm about to die."
You're trying to change the subject.
I can't breathe.
"Listen, you can be honest with me."
"No, I am being honest, I can't breathe."
Michael.
I'm not budging till you give me a good reason why we shouldn't.
-Because you've gone completely mad.
"-Come on, no muss, no fuss?"
No family... .
"Yeah, okay, they might be a little surprised."
"You think? "" Hi, Mom, hi, Dad, guess what I did today?"""
-They'd get over it.
"-No, actually, I don't think mine would."
"-Well, they'll have to, because I love you."
-Michael.
It's a great story for our grandchildren.
They'll think we're crazy.
-We would be crazy.
-Do you love me?
"Yes, I do."
"See, you already said, I do."
"That settles it, that settles it."
-We're getting hitched today.
"-Wait, wait, not so fast."
Will I have a bouquet?
"Yes, sir, Sir Charles."
I'd...
"Well, show her you're happy about it."
"Do something, man."
"Just another work of art, madam."
It's not in your catalog.
"We're feeling rather gay, are we, sir?"
"Poole, old friend, I'm going to be married very soon."
"Sir, you don't know how happy that makes me."
"I knew it would, Poole."
Thank you.
"Sir, there's a patient in the consulting room, a Miss Ivy Peterson."
She's without an appointment.
"If you've no time, I can..."
"No, no, that's all right."
I'll see her.
"So it's you, sir."
So you are the famous Dr. Jekyll.
Well...
I'm the one you and your friend took home that night.
- Remember?
"- Well, what what brings you here, Miss Peterson?"
- I think...
- Are you ill?
There.
That's what.
Look at that.
"Pretty, ain't it?"
Did you ever see a thing like that before?
I'll get you some lotion.
Lotion?
"It won't be lotion that will do the trick, sir."
"Their family thinks he was forced by the perpetrator, who is considered dangerous."
"Take this, Beto."
Do you want to go to the hospital?
"- No, I just want to go home."
"Look at my eyes, Beto."
Bye.
May I offer you a drink?
A friend of mine was driving a Tsuru thinking that nobody knew him.
"He was kidnapped, I don't know how much he paid."
Now he drives an armoured Hummer with bodyguards.
"The dinner is ready, everybody to the table!"
"Mom, what's going to happen to Beto?"
Do you know where I can find a job?
Merry Christmas!
"Kids, before you open them, give the gifts to Beto and the maids."
"Here, Beto."
- Thank you.
"That's nice, what do we have here?"
A shirt and a watch.
- Terrific.
Are they from you or from your mom?
From Santa Claus.
- Santa Claus!
They're very nice.
Thank you for giving them to me and to Santa because he sent them.
What did he say?
"Here, give this gift to Beto?"
Yes.
"- Well, thank you."
For Celi...
"Thanks, madam."
Elvira...
"When it comes to eating, you're always first."
Come on.
A little soppressata.
You even have to try the mussels 'mpepata.
Atrumpet!
We've mixed you up.
Know what they say when someone's really mixed up?
That he mistook one thing for another.
A dick for a spigot.
"It's not hard to talk like us, just take off the Iast vowel."
"For exampIe, banana becomes ""bana-n""."
"- Sofa becomes ""so-f""."
- Then it's easy.
"plate becomes ""pIa-t"", this would be ""for-k"","
"""kni-f""."
"- male, ""ma-I""."
- You wiped us out!
But these letters don't get lost.
- We neverthrow anything out.
- We recycle.
A simple vowel becomes a word.
"An ""E"" becomes affirmative."
"An ""O"" is a warning."
A guy says...
"An ""I"" means go away."
"And a ""U""?"
"The ""U"" and ""A"" are together, it's amazement."
Like when you see a beautiful woman.
You strike it lucky?
Orthe new director shows up from milan unexpectedly...
- Try ordering a dish.
"- Between us sure, but..."
You're home early.
Evan was my rebound guy.
But of course.
I feel in love again because he seemed so perfect.
But... he was perfect for Steven and Smiley Pete as well.
No no no no...
And Phil was my rebound of the rebound.
Bad!
You bad baby!
Uh...
That's when I decided to move to Los Angeles.
"What better city to replace perfect boyfriends, long term commitment... and heartache, with short term happiness and superficiality..."
At least it seemed like a good idea at the time.
"Well, fast forward a few years."
I forgot to introduce myself.
I'm Dale.
That's me a few years later.
Sucking face with my kinda sorta boyfriend JP.
He's a fashion photographer.
Remember that cover of Charlize in the green evening gown?
JP took that.
God I'm already name dropping...
That's so lame.
"Baby, give me your foot."
My foot?
You ever had your toe suck before?
"No, J. P..."
I...
Ok...
Delicious...
"What, no good experience?"
Bye baby.
That's platinum.
"Oh, no wonder it looks so different."
"Well, there's nothing wrong with your watch, sir."
"You have 11:00, too."
"Yeah, but it should be five minutes past eleven."
"I always set my watch, you know, five minutes fast."
"You know, you're always racing against time 24 hours a day."
"Excuse me, sir, are those men members of your crew?"
"Oh, yeah."
Yeah.
They're with us all the time.
Good.
I think I'll have a word with them.
Thank you very much for everything.
"Excuse me, sir."
"Lieutenant Columbo, LAPD."
I wonder if I can have a word with you?
MAN 1:
"We're gonna have the hotel in the shot, right?"
MAN 2:
Everything.
"On the master, right?"
"In the master, right."
Okay.
This is where...
He comes up right here.
Can I ask you this?
What now?
This is just the way we discussed it.
This we do on stage...
"This is on stage three, right?"
Right.
"I know you don't know much about time,"
But for us it's a big deal.
"But you don't have to worry about time, 'cause no matter what time it is,"
I'll be here to feed you.
- Ms. Levin?
"- Yes, this is Mrs. Levin."
Hi.
I'm Shawn Gilder.
I'm a teacher here in Arizona.
I'm calling to inquire about a former student of yours.
"His name is Mikey Trenton, and he's in the fourth grade."
Mikey Trenton?
I don't remember a Trenton.
Yeah.
"He had a different last name, but he won the spelling been last year."
"Oh, my God."
You must mean Michael Kelvin.
Why do you say that?
You haven't heard about the tragedy?
"No, I haven't."
"Oh, I'm sorry."
I don't know if I should say.
Please tell me.
"It was his whole family, and..."
What happened to his family?
They were murdered.
"We never found out how because the police are still looking for the killer, and--"
I'm going to the market.
You got any requests?
A six pack?
"Just kidding, Mom."
"- Good-bye, sweetie."
I'm Eric Stoltz.
Alex is Watts.
Watts helps Eric Stoltz go on a date with Amanda Jones.
"Really, she's in love with Eric Stoltz."
So Amanda Jones is Conor?
I guess.
At first.
"Now men in general, but that's not the point."
The point is he's into me.
I knew there had to be some reason why he was spending that time with you.
I know.
It's so obvious now.
There are so many signs.
Signs.
Love signs.
You gotta tell me about the signs.
I love signs.
First they were small.
"At first when I called, he said, ""Good to hear from you."""
- Totally good sign.
- Right?
And then the next time I called he was with a woman but he took the call and we talked for a while.
- You know it was a woman?
"- Called her ""babe."""
"Okay, a guy doesn't leave a woman to go talk to another woman unless he's..."
And it gets more obvious.
"I mean, please."
There was no guy he was gonna fix me up with.
The fix-up was him.
No.
Yes.
He shows up without this fictitious Bill character.
I was flattered to hear we looked alike.
But do we?
So I thought about it.
And I think I know why he said that.
"Can't really explain in words, but somehow we are a bit alike."
"The way we talk, for example."
Really?
You're nicer than I thought.
Thanks.
So why did you ask to meet?
Don't you have a real reason?
No.
"You're just so pretty, and very close with Director Kim."
So I just wanted to know more about you.
What do you fear most in your life?
Obsession.
Obsession?
I'm afraid of betrayal.
Did your husband betray you?
Is that why you're getting a divorce?
"Director Kim told you that, too?"
Yeah.
"Yes, my husband betrayed me."
That's nothing to cry about.
Just divorce him.
And live right when you can forget him.
And what about you?
Why do you cling on to him?
I did?
Two nights ago.
Don't lie to me.
"Oh, I get it."
- Yes.
Thank God.
I'm meeting Frank Anselmo for breakfast.
"- Oh, good."
Where?
- Woerner's.
Woerner's?
- The hangout at Borough Hall?
- That's it.
"When you go to Brooklyn, you're Frank Anselmo's guest."
Don't piss up his leg.
Just get him off this infrastructure thing.
Nothing wrong with it just unaffordable right now.
Good work tonight.
Mrs. Marquand couldn't stop talking about the cover of Time.
I think she collects them.
"National ink, the mother's milk of politics."
"Did I hear right, or did we get the convention?"
It's not signed and sealed but it is delivered.
And you were the closer.
I thought I had him with the second city stuff.
Of course you did.
You know why?
It belongs here.
New York City.
This is the place.
Excuse me.
"All right, the story's on the 10:00 news."
A little slow.
A bullet took the life of an innocent 6-year-old  on his way to school during a police action.
They're all over it like a cheap suit.
It's going to stick to us like one too.
I can't see anything.
It must be catching.
Don't tell me you're going blind and all!
Sometimes if you bring your top down and waggle the bottom.
"Who do you think I am, Gypsy Rose Lee?"
Oh!
"Hey, it works."
"It's gone, Granville!"
"Oh, it's gone."
What a relief!
"Oh, that's wonderful."
"Now, what can we give this young man to show our appreciation?"
-
- Give?
-
- You don't have to give me anything.
-
- You'd do the same for me.
-
"- Too proud to accept charity, Granville."
"Well, put it this way."
What bargains can we put him onto to show our appreciation?
"Th--There we are, sir."
-
- Compliments of the management.
-
- You've been very good.
There's someone up there that sees everything we do.
"I know, I know."
It's that Mrs Harris -
- I saw her peering out of her bedroom window.
'Ey up.
"You just got out of juvee, and now you're talking about... going out there trying to start some more shit ?"
- [ Laughs ]
- That shit ain't funny.
"You act like you don't know who you are anymore, Derek."
And what's up out there for anybody who ain't you ?
"I'm still from this neighborhood, but you ?"
I guess that's what happens when a white girl goes to your head.
- Or gives you some.
"- Shut up, Lip."
Sorry.
I know what's out there.
"Ain't like you can't get past it, but you're too busy getting in your own way to see that."
"I had some help getting in my own way, didn't I ?"
[ Chattering ]
[Cheering]
"Hey, wassup ?"
What the hell was that ?
I was trying to block the ball.
Stupid bitch !
[Girls Yelling]
"Good going, Sara !"
Get off !
That's it !
"Nikki, back off !"
[ Chattering ]
"Oh, yeah !"
"Oh, yeah !"
"- Yeah, yeah !"
- l like that !
- [ indistinct Yelling ] - [Gunshots]
- [ indistinct Yelling ]
- What is this shit ?
Rough day?
Y-yeah.
Were you -- were you saving this?
"No, no."
It's fine.
"But you don't usually drink, Clark."
What's wrong?
"Martha, you know how much I love you, don't you?"
Of course.
But with this job...
I can't always be as...
honest as I would like.
"Well, I know that."
"Thing is, you don't know."
"You don't know, so stop saying that you know."
Okay.
"It's okay that you have moods, Clark."
I'm not afraid of the different sides of you.
I love all of you.
"The world is an ugly place, Martha."
"And it is full of brutish, cruel, nasty people."
I heard something on the recording from Gaad's office.
Is he in more trouble?
He's probably gonna lose his pension -- maybe even go to jail.
- You shouldn't feel sorry for him.
"- Well, how can I not?"
- Martha.
- This is tearing him apart.
Martha...
Gaad is not your friend.
"Oh, come on, guys."
Martha's ugly.
That's the end of the day.
Thank you very much.
Your graded papers are down here at the end.
You can pick them up on your way out.
I am invincible.
"Guys, Jill Taylor, 10 o'clock."
Man.
That's brutal.
"You know, you should just ask her out, man."
It's not like she's a rocket scientist or anything.
"Oh, wait, she is."
"Well, why don't you ask her?"
Because I'm already dating someone.
"Yeah, your right hand doesn't count, Miles."
It does the way I use it.
It does the way I use it.
"Hey, you know what?"
Maybe I don't even want to go out with her.
"Yeah, that's funny."
"You know, you say you want a life experience, right?"
"Well, I'd say getting down with that would definitely qualify."
Cam!
Boy genius.
You have to follow me now.
- Excuse me?
- You have to follow me now.
Come on.
- Where are we going?
- You'll see.
Our honored guest.
"- How you doing, Ben?"
- I'm okay.
He did it.
"Hurry up, we only have 20 seconds."
Here it is.
All right.
What would have happened if he hadn't given himself away?
This is a dangerous game.
That's a passenger plane!
Now the myth of Carrasco is finished.
"Damn it, Enrique, they're simply cleverer than us."
They should have got them by now.
Let's go.
- We can't get through there in the Jeep.
- I want Carrasco!
Don't you dare come back without him!
Over there!
Find him!
Find him!
Enrique!
We'll get you out of here.
- Did you shoot the bastard down?
- No.
It wasn't him.
- We were set up.
- I knew it would go wrong.
I sensed it from the start.
"Come on, we must get away."
Help me.
"Hurry up, but be careful."
They'll remember us for a while.
Bastards!
I've always wished for something like this.
The bloody bastards!
one after another.
right?
I would not say it's something.
Bills-sama is a God.
There needs to be a God to build
And a God who destroys to maintain balance is it not?
he is someone who can destroy anything in the universe.
You can not do anything against him.
That seems to be exciting!
Goku!
do not try anything stupid.
You heard right?
Understood?
Yes I understood!
I will do nothing unless he does something bad!
What happened suddenly?
Heaven...
What happened?
Bills-sama...
So that's the God of Destruction...
Hello I am Goku!
Kaio-sama was very nervous.
Well that guy is strong?
with a monstrous Ki.
Kaio-sama!
I want to see how I can fight him!
In the next episode of Super Dragon Ball:
Decisive Battle on Planet Kaio-sama!
Bills.
This is the incredible power of Super Saiyan 3! {\blur1.5}I see little kids hurrying off
{\blur1.5}Colourful backpacks on their backs
{\blur1.5}If I was a kid like them... {\blur1.5}What colour would I choose?
Sounds good.
Wait.
That's it?
What do you want me to say?
I get it.
Man has a satellite.
Doesn't want anyone to know.
"Yeah, but..."
"I am about to go to war with New Bern, Kansas, the home of the nearest Costco."
Today is already just about as weird as I can handle.
I'm not asking any more questions.
"Mom, Dad, there's a chance we may have to leave here today,"
"and we might not be able to make it back, so I just wanted to..."
We just wanted to pay our respects.
Remember I told you about that witch from the IRS?
The one that wanted to take everything you've ever worked for?
"Mom, Dad, this is Mimi."
Hello.
It's nice to finally meet you.
I really love your son.
"And,of course, Bonnie is... she's just wonderful."
And I've really enjoyed living with them and...
"Oh, great."
What?
I didn't say we were living together.
We're not married.
Oh.
Oh.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I certainly...
I...
You see this button?
She controls her own dosage.
"Friends, family, career, future..."
None of these things matter to her now.
This is the face of 21st-century drug addiction.
Satisfied?
$25 million.
$30 million. $35 million.
"Ladies, you're off my grid."
I've lost visual of you.
You were right.
It is a cabal of evil florists.
We found Finch's flower patch.
If we connect this to the sprinkler system with the rest of the greenhouse...
We can wipe out every damn flower in here.
Go get Amanda.
I got this covered.
Got it.
"Guys, I got eyes on Bosley, but audio contact is dead."
I'll lead you in.
Something's wrong.
I'm losing power.
Who the hell are you?
No sign of Amanda.
Abby?
Eve?
Don't move.
Turn around.
Turn around!
The last offer I heard was $35 million.
Who wants to get real?
$50 million.
"They don't make gum or a patch for this, Ted."
"But, hey, billion-dollar idea alert."
That's okay.
I'll just buy a new dream journal.
What-What-What...
What are you looking for?
Your phone.
There's gotta be some pictures of her in here.
Damn it.
No!
Those are all worthless.
"I need some one-night stand material, Ted."
"Oh, oh, here's your mom."
"Hello, Virginia."
"Um, my mother's not one-night stand material."
"Yeah, you're right."
"It wasn't night, and we weren't standing."
Hey-oh.
- That didn't happen.
- You're right.
It didn't.
- You just winked.
"- No, I didn't."
- You just did it again!
"- Look, bottom line."
I need you to proxy-bang this girl for me.
Be my stand-in and put your gland in.
"Hey, wow."
That'd be good on a hat.
"Barney, she's just using me for my gracefully aging body."
You're picking now to get some self-respect?
- You once banged a blind girl by pretending to be Sean Connery.
It just seems surreal.
Like maybe we weren't meant to get to the normal part.
That's exactly why we're gonna do it.
"We're gonna go out, have some fun and try to remember that we don't have to be so serious."
"Listen, when I decided to stay here and to get to know you it was so that I could do things like this."
"I could bring my girlfriend flowers, take her out on a date try to be normal."
Have you ever even been on a double date before?
"Oh, absolutely."
"Uh, '72."
Hef and the twins.
- What?
- Yeah.
Playmates.
I got Miss June.
- Are you serious?
- Mm.
Miss Sommers?
Yes.
"Hi, Pearl."
Hi.
This is my daughter Annabelle.
"Of course, Jeremy's friend."
"- Nice to see you, Miss Sommers."
- Oh.
Jenna.
This property was in my brother-in-law's family for generations.
It's one of the original structures in Mystic Falls.
Used to be one of those old-fashioned drugstore thingies.
- An apothecary?
- Yeah.
You don't say.
Sorry if it's musty.
It's a...
It's the famous line from...
I'll be right back with your order.
"Belinda, I hope you don't mind, but I'm gonna head home."
- We can just hang out another time.
"- Oh, no, don't."
"I know this is weird for you but if you just help me out, we'll get out of here quickly."
- I don't think I can...
"- Christine, please."
Marly is just...
She's looking for an excuse to fire me.
"And I really need this job, so please, please help me out."
- Ugh.
"Okay, I'll help you out."
- Thank you.
Uh-oh.
Who let the hens out?
[WOMEN LAUGHING]
"Charles, honey, what are you doing here?"
"I have my book club meeting, remember?"
"Oh, don't worry, I'll clear out."
Let you ladies do your reading and drinking.
[LAUGHING]
"Thank you, darling."
"So, what did everybody think about the book?"
- Lindsay?
"- Oh, yeah."
It was amazing.
"- You didn't read it, did you?"
- I had a rough week.
Jackson was sick and Kelsey came home crying.
"There's another Kelsey in her class and now they call my daughter ""Big Kelsey."""
I didn't mean to do this.
She suddenly attacked me.
I'm the victim here.
Wipe your mouth.
So you didn't mean to?
Who took off your pants?
I didn't go near her at all!
- Please believe me!
- Shut up!
Have a good time.
Sorry?
Am I allowed?
Sure.
You can even have her for a month.
Hurry on.
Wait!
Make him feel at home.
- Yes!
"- Hey, hey!"
Sir!
A month?
What am I supposed to do for a month?
What the hell's this?
What the?
Is she crazy to get married?
What the hell's going on today?
Excuse me?
Hello?
She's so good.
She takes after her mom for making men go crazy.
"While citizens are in a state of fear, policed discovered the identity of the axed woman found near Nam Mountain yesterday."
"Police said the 25 year-old victim worked at a drinking establishment, and presumed that the brutal murder was enacted out of revenge."
Beautifully put.
"So, given your dad's age, I'm guessing your condition isn't a new thing?"
- Where's your mother?
- She's dead.
"Right, sorry."
"So, is somebody else looking after you?"
Just Dad.
He's not doing a top job.
- Great.
- Oh.
"Nina, no."
We are not getting involved.
We can't let a teenage vampire
- loose on the street.
- Er...
I'm 46.
"- There you go, he's 46..."
Really?
"Not emotionally, he isn't."
"Like he said, he's still effectively being breast-fed."
"Well, if you're offering."
"Oh, can you not ask my girlfriend to suckle you, please?"
"Look, you're just gonna have to pull a sickie and take him back to the house."
- Why?
"- Look, this is Mitchell's territory."
He'll know what to do.
This is not our problem.
But it's only till his dad recovers and then we can leave them both to it.
All right?
- Oh!
"- Right, you're going home with George."
"- What, to your kennel?"
Let's go after him.
"No, you stay here."
Put your hands up!
Put 'em up!
I only got one arm.
What do you want?
Put that down.
What do you want from me?
I want to let bygones be bygones.
I'm not falling for that.
"I lost an arm, but otherwise I'm fine."
And?
And nothing.
Tell me what you want!
I want to let bygones be bygones.
Maybe you don't believe me.
My arm's gone.
It ain't gonna grow back.
But here I am.
So it's money you want?
Money?
"Yeah, I want to make money with you guys, work with you guys."
"I thought I could take the respectable route, but I was a real dope."
So here I am.
What else can I do?
Be an organ grinder?
"No, I'd rather steal."
I did everything I could.
"But that's over and done with, even if it costs me my neck."
- So this is your latest idea?
"- No, no, no!"
I did everything I could!
Ah!
That's it!
That's it!
A loudspeaker in the shop!
Just like they have in supermarkets.
-
- Where are you going?
-
- With regular announcements to customers.
A speaker pointing that way so it'll reach the people in the street.
Where's he going?
Come back.
Don't leave me here.
"Look, don't..."
Will you...
Don't!
Aghh!
Don't leave me!
"Granville, get me that yellow screwdriver."
Don't worry about it.
It's only been two or three days.
You'll be walking fine in a couple of years.
Don't know what took you so long to get me out.
I've got a business to run.
I can't afford to spend time opening errand boys!
(GRANVILLE GROANS)
There you are.
Think where your trendiness has got you.
I brought you up to be a normal lad and suddenly you go bent.
I know you're trying to talk me out of it.
I'm not going to be talked...
Ow!
"If it was true, everybody'd be looking for somebody to run down."
"You didn't believe us, did ya?"
No.
Course not.
You know what?
Maybe it wasn't him what let that mouse out.

Driver 208.
Animal on track.

Proceeding now.

I traded him a Montagnard crossbow a number one address on Chu Do Street and a pair of Ho Chi Minh sandals.
And where did you get a pair of Ho Chi Minh sandals?
I made them.
I work hard.
I've gone to church.
I was a Boy Scout.
I was an Eagle Scout!
He's funny!
How did you get in here?
Where do you sleep?
Where's...?
Anywhere.
"All right, come here."
JAMISON:
Colonel Kirby?
KIRBY:
Affirmative!
"Lt. Jamison, 91 st Navy Seabee detachment out of Cho Min."
This is Captain MacDaniel.
"We'd have come sooner, but the Marines wanted a strip up north."
"It's going to get a little hairy around here, Lieutenant so we're glad to see you, late or not."
The rest of my outfit will be coming with the heavy equipment.
They set it down right where the work is.
"- How's that, sir?"
- Could you move that jungle back for us?
"Just say the word, and I'll move it to China."
We don't need that much.
Just a clear killing zone.
"- Will do, sir."
- Watson!
Arrange pads.
How many men?
Keep your paperwork clean.
"Jade, uh ..."
- There was one thing I want to talk to you.
- Tell me.
I do not want to do this anymore.
- What does that mean?
- I want out.
- What will you do for me does not work?
- I do not know.
I work in construction or something perhaps?
- Was funny.
"- Yes, people could not figure out exactly."
Now ...
So what about your little sister?
What about him?
Well ...
He can not look the same again now.
You know what?
"May look nice, but the right way to go Mike how much money you will earn?"
"Saatliği 15, 20 dollars?"
"Do not forget where you come from, Mike."
I'm very easy for your life.
But much more zorlaştırabilirim.
Become a smart boy.
Destroying a beautiful thing.
"Jump in, little sister, get new clothes."
And Mike ...
I have you with us and says otherwise.
I take good care of his nose.
"Angel, finished all the homework and dinner seven."
A very good girl.
"See you tomorrow, Mike."
"Oh, that jail had a particular smell."
- Like lilacs dipped in urine.
- Nice.
- Yeah!
"- Oh, no."
This is the best day of my life.
Who knew you were the black sheep of the family?
- Can we talk?
- Sure.
- I'm proud.
- Shut up.
"- Give me a high-five, Mom."
- No!
God.
"- So, what's up?"
- I just wanted to give you a heads-up.
Holly's going to the board to try to overturn your decision
- not to counter on the vineyard.
- That woman is a nut job.
I'm backing her play.
You're what?
"I think the opportunity's right, the investment is right and I think it's what Dad wanted."
I'm voting with Holly.
- What happens now?
- We go downstairs.
Then what?
"I'm going to my office, check my e-mail."
Do whatever you want.
- About you and me.
- I just covered that.
"Office, e-mail..."
"I mean, if you don't think that this is going to work, then I understand."
- My mum.
"She can't keep a single secret, the pissed, old cow."
She's in SPAT with Suzie and all.
"To begin with, I feel terrible about it now, but I was like:"
"""Why shouldn't she kill herself if she wants to?"""
- She's got me.
"- But I didn't know that then, did I?"
- I know.
I made a complete ass of myself.
"- Yes, you did."
I enjoyed it.
"You know, I sort of tried to draw fire."
"Obviously, I thought the worse I looked, the better Marcus would look."
"In that case, Marcus looked fantastic."
Okay.
Can I come in?
Maybe.
- I'm a bit busy.
"- Oh, yeah?"
Doing what?
"Watching ""Countdown""."
Let me ask you something.
What would you rather do?
"Watch ""Countdown"" or have sex with me?"
Stuart's track record here.
Very good performance last week.
"He came in with a 44 and came out on Friday with a 72, which is the second..."
Every man is an island.
I stand by that.
I deliver perfection...
and don't brag about it!
:
"Prisoners are taken out on work detail one block at a time, right?"
- Same time every day.
- An ambush?
When guards are vulnerable.
It's not like we're liberating the whole camp anyway.
"Assuming we can get them out, there'll be search parties."
They're not in any condition to run for long.
I'll need to find a place to hide them.
"I'll do more recon, map out a route."
Gather all the guns
- we have.
- What can I do?
You've been through a lot.
Just stay out of trouble.
"What, am I grounded?"
I do something wrong?
I didn't say you did.
- I want to help.
- And you can.
Someone needs to hold the fort.
He'll be all right.
We'll look after him.
I'll be fine.

"And, uh, jake's... (chris) all right, guys, first contestant is walking out,"
So the challenge has begun.
Please remain facing forward.
"Your first question is, ""who are you the least attracted to?"""
(gia) I need this rose really badly
Because I don't have a group that I belong to.
"I'm kind of, like, solo,"
So this rose is really important for me
To keep myself safe and to keep jake safe.
"That is a direct hit, and a point for you, contestant."
(bell dings)
Here comes the next contestant.
Who are you least attracted to?
That one did not miss.

Who are you least attracted to?

Da-hye's own cafe latte.
It's so pretty.
You're now a real barista.
Right?

Was it hard burying your father?
Your dark circles are hanging low.
Are they?
Cover them up.
"Hello, all."
Da-hye.
Nana.
Hello.
Call 911!

Mary was so right about you Ben!
What's going on?
"Ben's been telling me the funniest story, about the bus, and the girl, and the.."
Call 911!
You've heard this one before!
"I'm telling you, Ben's heart stopping temporarily was the best thing that ever happened to me."
"He's getting some much-needed bed rest, and I'm emceeing the fundraiser tomorrow night."
How did you manage that?
I promised Dr. Albright I'd stick to Ben's script.
Are you gonna?
- No.
"All right, next up on open- mike night, very funny man, put your hands together for Dick Solomon."
Thank you!
Thank you!
Thanks a lot!
Thank you so much!
"Now,"
I'm gonna tell you some jokes.
Joke one:
I went fishing last week.
My permit said I could only catch five.
"Oh, I caught five, all right, as in 35."
Was that funny?
"- No, no, no, no, no, no."
But you know..
"pot-stickers, what are they all about?"
Haa-haa!
"Okay, joke number two:"
Some termites..
"I mean, huge termites.."
Thanks!
We might have a chance at winning now!

"Dad, I was just messing around."
I drove by the school and saw kids on the playground doing a music number and you weren't there!
You're here in the sports gym shooting basket hoops!
"Hey, your kid is really good at this."
"Don't talk to me, stupid jock asshole!"
"Just go easy on him, huh?"
You know what this means?
!
It means you're about to get slapped.
So you better shut up!
"If he wants to play ball, you should let him."
I'll do it!
I'll slap the shit outta you!
He's just a kid.
You don't tell me how to raise my son!
I'll slap it again.
"Dad, stop!"
You're trying to turn my son into a little asshole sports person like yourself!
"There, there's another slap."
Maybe you'll think next time you act you---
"Slap it, I slap it!"
"Ow, Dad!"
"Dad, you're hurting me!"
"Shut up, Bridon!"
"Uh, what's going on here, Mr. Gueermo?"
"Get outta my way, Mackey!"
Is-is Harriet.
"Look, I'm sorry."
- I lost my head out there.
- Look.
There.
"- No, no."
- I was just... but you can't go...
"I mean, we need you."
Harriet would never stand for it.
"Please, won't you reconsider?"
"You know, it's not about what happened outside tonight."
It really isn't.
But Golly...
"I just... no, I think it's time."
I really do.
"Harriet can take care of herself now, so she should."
But Harriet's just...
She's just a little girl.
"You know, it's the right thing."
"It's the right thing for all of us... for me, for you and for Harriet."
Are you sure?
"Yeah, I am."
"""'The time has come,"" the Walrus said,"""
"""To talk of many things..."
"""Of shoes and ships and sealing wax..."""
"""Of cabbages and kings..."
"""And why the sea is boiling hot..."
"And whether pigs have wings."""
Where you going to go?
"Well, I don't really know."
I'm thinking I may travel.
Are you going to go be some other kid's nanny now?
Then what?
- Who is he?
- I thought he was you.
Especially when we couldn't find you.
Then one of my men told me you were at Major Lescourt's funeral.
I thought it was a sick joke.
I almost fired him.
- But who is he?
- A good question.
Come on.
We are talking to witnesses.
Apparently he was being chased.
There's evidence he had been tortured.
His death was not an easy one.
"Here's the bag, sir."
This was found in the victim's pockets.
These matches are from the Hotel Chevre d'Or.
- Our men are there now.
- Let's go.
"Alain, walt."
This is not your case.
I'm not sure I want you involved at this point.
I am involved!
Did you see his face?
Are you coming or what?
"Monsieur Suverov, thank God!"
This man told me you were killed in a car accident.
"- Good morning, sir."
- You only had your hair cut!
Yes.
Mikhail Suverov.
Now If you want access to his room... why don't you ask Monsieur Suverov?
All checked?
We've interviewed eight.
We're on to the other two.
We've searched from Cape Wrath to Carlisle.
He hasn't got a roof over his head.
You're on Storm Island.
- Storm Island?
- Now you know how it got its name.
You were swept into the bay.
Everything always is.
"Please, don't get up."
- I've frightened your little girl.
- He's a boy.
- I'm sorry.
- No.
I must cut his hair.
Was anyone else on board with you?
"David, we really must put the poor man to bed."
"No, I was alone."
Didn't you bother to get a weather report before you left?
No.
- Did you notify the coastguard?
"- David, what does it matter?"
"Because if he did, there may be men out there risking their lives looking for him."
- And we can let them know that he's safe.
- No.
I...
I...
I did not notify the coastguard.
I'll just turn the bed down.
- I've never seen anybody so exhausted.
"- But, Mummy..."
I certainly didn't lay a hand on her.
Ok.
Sorry.
Ok.
Step together.
*** together.
"Right, left, and turn!"
And pose.
I know what you're doing.
What?
Hanging out with my brothers and sisters?
Listening to a little live music?
"Look, I think it's nice and all, but I don't..."
Where were those dance moves when we were up there playing?
- Great show.
- You were awesome!
"It was amazing, really."
But we have to go.
We do?
We do.
"Good job, man."
- What'd you think?
- It was really good.
"Come on, you're a musician."
You actually know what you're talking about.
- Bring it.
- Uh... ok.
"Um, your energy was really good."
"The songs are good, but, um, I don't know."
"I don't think they were being articulated as well as they could be, I guess."
I know we're not as tight as middle school honors band.
You guys used to play together?
"Now, I'm asking you for the last time."
Who were they?
"Now, you're not going to eat until you talk, so you may as well talk now."
"Now listen, Johnny, here."
Listen to me.
"Now, you tell me who those other fellows were and I'll let you go, see?"
"Come on, who were they, huh?"
Who were they?
- Lock him up.
- Mighty cold for this kid in there.
"Well, maybe it'll freeze him into talking."
Okay.
Come on.
I'm gonna find out who those other kids were if it's the last thing I do.
"All right, kid."
Come on.
Get out of there.
You got enough.
Go get your chart and report to work detail.
- I'll try and get you some grub later on.
- Thank you.
Wrap this around you.
I know you don't squeal.
Skinny didn't squeal.
Skinny didn't squeal.
Skinny didn't squeal.
Skinny didn't squeal.
Skinny didn't squeal.
Skinny didn't squeal.

"Here you are, kid."
- Hide me.
- What?
How?
Rick Castle.
"Oh, hi, Courtney."
Hey.
I'm Courtney.
Hayley.
"So, what's going on?"
You guys have a beef or something?
- Me and Rick?
- Yeah.
No.
No way.
We're buds.
- Oh.
- Buds?
"Last time I saw you, you tried to run me down with a golf cart 'cause I wouldn't let you get cast in the Nikki Heat movie."
"But what I didn't know then, which I do now, was that your movie was gonna be quite possibly the worst movie ever made."
Not being cast in your movie was the best thing that could have happened to my career.
[Sighs]
So thanks.
Let's do lunch some time.
- Nice meeting you.
- Yeah.
Say hi to Brandon.
Can you believe her?
Worst movie ever made?
"Yeah, I can believe her."
It was a terrible film.
"Well, that was all thanks to this really obtuse studio executive."
What the hell was his name?
They love him.
"Sorry, I have to go into the garden."
"We don't have anything important to discuss, do we?"
Why don't you come back tonight at 8.
They'll be asleep then.
Don't I get to wear a hat?
You look way too healthy for a 60 year old.
I bet you still exercise.
-Yes.
I think you're afraid of getting old.
-That's nonsense.
You still live in the past.
"-Not at all, I look ahead."
To tomorrow.
-Tomorrow doesn't exist.
"For you, tomorrow is a repetition of yesterday."
That's nonsense.
I take my responsibility.
Because I've not forgotten everything that's happened.
I'm prepared for what's coming.
What's that?
The next war?
It will always be different from the previous one.
Useless.
"We're simply getting old, you and I."
But I accept it and you don't.
The war was your heyday.
And you want that back.
I'm out.
Then I'll do it alone.
Your son?
-Yes.
And you felt as if they were coming after you?
- And I started to run...
- But?
And then...
I don't know what happened.
You did something.
I think so.
GUARD:
"This way, folks."
Come down this way as quickly as you can.
SECOND GUARD:
"All right, folks, calmly."
This way.
"Quickly as you can, please move down."
Just follow them.
Thank you.
Right through the barricades there.
That's right.
Do you wanna know what I'm worried about?
I wanna know who's gonna feed my cats.
We'll all be out of here soon.
You'll be home to feed them yourself.
And what if that doesn't happen?
"Relax, Dorothy."
The aliens'll feed 'em.
"Yeah, they're old friends of your cats, right?"
What?
What are you looking at?
"You really think if you're cruel enough to other people, all your own misery will go away?"
No.
Just keeps my mind off it for a while.
RAY:
"Look, since we're not gonna partner..."

I don't wanna have anything to do with you.
SlPOWlCZ:

-Hey.
KELLY:

-How's it going?

-You did.
You got three documents of spousal abuse.
A woman confesses...

Why more statements?
Something isn't right.

That's the worst she'd do.

I don't agree.
"Before the trial, I'll reinterview like I do on every case."
-l don't think there'll be a trial.
-Tell your boss you want to go to bat.
I think he'll deal anyway.
"Girls, I'll meet you outside."
Get her.
Okay.
"Just the littlest bit snug, aren't they?"
There we go.
"Cute, though, huh?"
How much?
- 700.
- 700?
"Yes, well, I'll tell you what."
You pay for quality 'cause there's so much crap out there these days.
"Man, I am excited to bust my dogs out in these tonight."
We're going to a French restaurant...
Le Bistro.
"It's five stars, so..."
I don't know if you've been to it.
"That sounds great, but this has been declined."
Declined?
You're kidding me!
Oh!
Makes me so mad.
"Like, the credit card companies..."
the way they waste your time.
Probably protecting me.
I spent a lot of money today.
Try that one.
Excuse me.
"Oh, God."
Did it not go through?
What motive could a man possibly have for pooping where he sleeps?
- I love that bed.
- Don't buy this act.
"My friend Carl, his brain!"
Behind you.
Is that Carl's Brain?
Over there?
On the expressway?
"Beware, for it will immediately seize you upon my, command, and your mind will be enslaved to forever..."
Polish the chrome at this wash -- car wash.
This is retarded.
"Oh, he called you retarded, Daddy."
Stop him at once.
From calling me retarded.
"Too late, he did it."
He got away.
"Go eat your brain now, Carl."
"Dinner time, isn't it?"
"Oh, look at that."
It's dinner time.
"Oh, no, you don't."
Where do you think you're going?
"Home, now get out of here."
We are closed.
We open at 10:00 tomorrow.
I think what Mac's trying to say... is that it's probably the greatest movie of all time.
That's 'cause it is.
Rocky IV is not the greatest movie of all time.
"Dee, what do you consider to be a good movie?"
"- I don't know, like, Million Dollar Baby..."
"- Oh, come on."
- Are you kidding me?
That is ridiculous.
- Come on.
Let's see what frightened you.
It's okay.
Come.
"Dr. Lemelle, allow me to introduce Miss Porter, our new patient."
Isabel is new to her medication and she had a bit of a fright watching you work.
- It was the noise.
- It was still alive.
"It's distasteful, yes, but it's the only way to procure a fresh specimen."
- Poor thing.
- Perhaps.
"But I cannot sally forth and saw at the skulls of dainty, melancholic humans for my research, can I?"
- No.
"- Come, Isabel."
Let's leave the good doctor to his work.
Here we are.
- Thank you.
- Safe and sound.
Do not wonder the halls in a place like this.
Yes?
- Yes.
"- Good night, Miss Porter."
Scream and I will slit your throat!
Please don't hurt me!
- Hurt?
"No, no."
I need you to help me.
I need to escape.
There's no leaving.
They will find me.
"The wolves, they will find me."
- Let me try to find Dr. Cairn for you.
- I have failed him!
Mineral water?
"-Yes, I'm trying to stay fit."
Sports and stuff.
You're quite comfortable here.
Yes.
"I'm not an ambulant patient, but a drinking patient."
Keep it that way.
Thank you.
-There's nothing wrong with me.
I came her on my own initiative.
I worked hard lately.
No holiday in three years.
That's how it goes when you own a big business.
Cheers.
-Cheers.
My wife and I were going to go on a cruise.
For our 25th wedding anniversary.
"I was at your wedding, remember?"
-Yes.
But I didn't feel well.
My wife told me to see a specialist before we went on the cruise.
A ship's doctor only knows about sailors' dicks.
"Yes, indeed."
I'll add something after all.
-Of course.
What did they say here?
All good.
A young God with pure blood in his jenever vessels.
I can go home in an hour if I want.
It was a false alarm.
They just told me.
My wife will be so happy.
"See the heights they reach, ladies and gentlemen."
"Please, be absolutely silent."
"Tonight, they will perform without a safety net."
I want to leave!
"Let me out, please!"
Let me out!
No!
"Dear Barbuda,"
"I received your letter, and loved the invitation."
I wish I could go with you to stay with your brother in Bahia.
Isn't he the fisherman who lives by the sea in the middle of a palmfield?
But I can't go now.
"School is back, and grandma won't let me."
"But on my vacations,"
"I want to see you, and Foguinho as well."
Can you write me back?
Can you tell me where the circus will be?
"Barbuda, I have something to tell you."
I remembered everything.
Everything.
At least I know now.
"And as the days go by, I get more used to it."
"Kisses, Maria."
"Come on Maria, you don't want to spend your life on a tightrope..."
"I like it, grandma."

"Hello, partner."
'Thanks.
I'll wait out here.'
Would you mind passing me out a chair?
Hello.
Will you tell the manager that one of those fresh college boys is annoying me?
I'm the manager.
Get away from that door!
I never fathered an heir.
Now I have no one... to leave my enormous fortune to.
- No one.

- What are the two E's?
And don't worry.
We totally redo the paint.
In a color of our own choosing.
"Yeah, whatever."
I'm easy.
"Hello, Carl."
"I too, am Carl."
"And this is my son, Carl Jr."
We are all Carls.
Neat.
"Yes, yes."
Remove his brain!
I wonder if you can get the whole thing in your mouth.
"Hey Meatwad, how's the job going?"
"Um, just okay."
"Carl washed his car there, didn't he?"
"Yeah, but..."
But what?
I'm having some reservations about this work.
And some nightmares.
Nightmares?
"There was a time in my life when I thought dancing in front of the car wash would be the only thing I'd ever want to do, but the way these people wash cars..."
I just don't know anymore.
"Well, Carl seems happy with it."
Is he licking it?
"Yeah, he's been doing that all morning, I'm afraid."
"You know, snakes -- in the wild, of course -- have to unhinge their jaw to eat a car."
I think the trouble with you is that you have all that skin around your mouth.
Shake!
What?
He's doing it!
Carl?
And you wouldn't consider this an emergency?
"Just give us 2 hours, and the notebook will be recovered by then."
Perhaps less than two hours.
Just one and a half.
"- Give me Academician Filip, please."
- Is it OK?
Filip speaking.
"Following a thorough evaluation of the situation the crew of the Adam 84 Expedition has decided, that..."
This is CWB.
This is the Central World Brain.
The connection is lost.
CWB is powerless in the matter.
"Well, what do you say?"
Where did she go now?
Eh?
Poochie!
Stupid Bernau!
Give it to him!
Are you scared?
You'll get some more tomorrow at school!
Just wait!
"What've they done to you, Adam?"
"Oh, it's just my shirt."
But they couldn't take the notebook from me.
What's so important to them about it?
Secret calculations.
It's not suitable for girls.
- Unless...
- Why are you so secretive?
Perhaps some girls could...
Adam!
Stop messing about!
"Yeah, something about dildos and then I felt..."
- The vibrating egg.
- What is that?
- A large vibrating egg.
- Yeah.
- What?
- What's that?
- Annie Hall.
"- Yes, of course."
- Devendra Banhart.
"- ""We used a large vibrating egg."""
"Look, I'm just afraid that if he gets with you and nothing happens his self-esteem could really go through the crapper, you know?"
This is Tris.
Devendra was so sick this day.
"He showed up, walked off the plane from Barcelona and he couldn't swallow."
- Look at how tense he is.
- Look at him.
He is dying.
I fanned him with a paper plate and we've been friends ever since.
That's the way great friendships are formed.
It's good at breaking down walls.
I did...
Yeah.

"This is exciting, we got to be to be on film together."
- You ever work together?
- We met doing a play.
This is the first time we've been on-screen together.
- That's the best cigarette flip too.
It was beautiful.
It was a bigger moneymaker than numbers and Jimmy was in charge.
we'd rob the airport.
it was better than Citibank.
You got a phone?
Come on!
Two niggers just stole my truck.
Can you fucking believe that shit?
There was Jimmy and Tommy andme.
And there was Anthony Stabile.
Frankie Carbone.
Fat Andy.
Frankie the Wop andFreddyNo Nose.

Then you had Nickey Eyes andMikeyFranzese.

not coats.
Suits are up on Thursday.
But it's the middle of summer.
What'll I do with fur coats?
You don't want furs?
I'll take them away.
I want them.
We'll hang them in the freezer with the meat.
to live any other way was nuts.
those goody-good people who worked shitty jobs for bum paychecks were dead.
They were suckers.
They had no balls.
we just took it.
they got hit so bad they never complained again.
It was all just routine.
- What are you doing?
- What?
"Well, the point of this was to show him how much you care about Stefan."
"You know, not to hopscotch down memory lane."
- I was just trying to make conversation.
- Try less.
Caroline.
Katherine.
"I'm sorry, you have the wrong person."
"Elena, come on."
My mistake.
- How's everything going?
- Matt's cheating.
"No need, I'm awesome."
Stefan Salvatore.
- Is everything okay?
- Everything's great.
So you haven't seen him before?
"No, there was nothing familiar about him at all."
Let's call it a night.
Send Matt and Caroline home?
"No, the whole point of tonight was to not have to deal with this stuff."
We need to get through one night.
One normal night.
You sure?
"No, I'm not sure."
But I don't know what else to do.
"Look, if there's another vampire in town, he'll still be here tomorrow."
We'll deal with it tomorrow.
Okay.
That's them.
Come here.
It's over.
Then why are you here?
This is not my wife.
This is Trudy.
I met her a couple weeks ago.
Can we go boogie boarding now?
"And once people knew what we were going through,"
I think my cortisol levels just shot up through the roof.
Because it's difficult to go through a very private struggle publicly.
"I heard what you think, but you know what I'm really interested in is hearing about how you feel."
Just tell her how you feel.
"Well, I think if you looked at everything that..."
"No, no, no, no."
Just...
Don't explain intellectually how you feel.
"You know, just tell her how you feel."
In one word.
Sure.
Angry.
Cynthia?
Judged.
Very good.
Yes?
Progress.
Excited.
Relieved.
That is it.
Yeah.
We're awesome at feelings!
Okay.
"Nice job today, guys."
That's all for today?
Bless you.
Don't be afraid.
He's a friend.
I need you to take them to the treehouse.
But he's a savage!
"Far from it, madam."
He's my best friend and he's your salvation.
And where are you going?
I've got to find a way onto that boat.
You'll be fine.
"Come on and get this boat out to sea, you lazy lot!"
"All right, all right!"
You'll be kissing the daughter before too long!
We're off to sea while the tide's still with us!
"One, two, heave!"
"Come on, boys!"
"One, two, heave!"
"One, two, heave!"
Secure the camp.
I've got a score to settle.
- We've all had our fill of jacob moore.
- I know.
So I'm ceasing this ship and taking command.
Stow the prisoners below!
Prepare to set sail.
You're abandoning moore?
That I am.
Weigh anchor!
Hub sheets!
Hands to the jeers!
- Stow the prisoners!
"- Aye-aye, sir!"
It's true!
- Skinny dudes...
- My sister married down.
Seriously.
"Oh, ""married down""?"
We were just having this conversation.
"""Married down""?"
"No, chunky is like marrying...sideways!"
"[ Laughing ] ""Sideways."""
Ferrara:
"Like, ""drag race"" to me means something totally different to you guys, I'm guessing."
It's true.
"And I'm guessing ""tranny"" means something different to me than it does to you."
"What does ""tranny"" mean to you?"
"""Tranny"" means the transmission."
Really?
I think we need to get you a drag name.
"Oh, no."
You're in San Francisco.
"I mean, everybody has a drag name here."
Ready?
Wait.
We're naming her miss Tess Tosterone.
"""Miss Tess tosterone."""
You know what?
That's pretty funny.
You know what?
You should come in and check out the view.
I really...
I got so many other calls.
"I really can't, but you guys have been great."
"Yeah, whatever."
Of course I've thought about it.
It's all I think about!
- Really?
- Yeah.
Or have you just thought about yourself?
Do you think that this is good for him?
That kid is gonna hate us if he has to grow up listening to us fight all day long.
"So that's it, then."
What about me?
- Am I just so easy to walk away from?
"- Lisa, I love you."
Don't you fucking say that to me!
"You have no idea what love is, Chris!"
Lisa.
Listen.
We have a problem and we have to face it.
"Oh, you're right, Chris."
You are absolutely right.
"Get the fuck out, you fucking asshole!"
You know what?
"If you want to go, go."
I release you.
Go be free.
"But don't you ever expect to see me or your child ever again, ever!"
"Lisa, stop it."
"Jesus, stop it."
Just go.
Please.
Go.
- You're staying at a motel?
"- No, it's a hotel."
And it's really very nice.
I can still race!
What do you think?
A thing of beauty.
- McQueen made it!
- What?
He's not pitting!
You gotta get me out there!
Let's go!
Get me back out there!
McQueen's not going into the pits!
The rookie fired his crew chief.
The third this season!
- Says he likes working alone.
"- Go, go!"
Looks like Chick got caught up in the pits.
"Yeah, after a stop like that, he's got a lot of ground to make up."
"Get ready, boys, we're coming to the restart!"
"Come on, come on, come on!"
We need tires now!
"Come on, let's go!"
"- No, no, no, no!"
"No tires, just gas!"
- What?
"You need tires, you idiot!"
Looks like it's gas-and-go's for McQueen today.
Right.
No tires again.
"That's a short-term gain, long-term loss, but it's workin' for him."
He obviously knows somethin' we don't know.
"This is it, Darrell."
One lap to go and Lightning McQueen has a huge lead.
He's got it in the bag.
We will film our return journey for people.
And that's that.
What do we do at Atomium?
Mr. Lloyd?
"Come on, let's go."
"To tell the truth, I did not expect the king to endorse my plan."
But we had to leave Turkey and return to the EU.
"Here we are, with a woman dressed as a king who reflected on the concept of freedom."
"Please, do you have to do it right now?"
"Yeah I have to, I'm itchy."
It's unbearable.
I'm almost done.
But what is it?
Maybe it's the shock of the news.
The secession of Wallonia.
Think about how it feels.
Do you know that we have many French words in Bulgarian?
Really?
"- Yes, how..."
Lift.
Bidet.
"I want to show her Mascia, Ivana and Pavlina."
My three daughters.
Three daddy.
"- Stay silent, Ana."
Do you have children?
No.
All right.
"He still has time, he's a man."

It's better than the Bulgarian ones.
I keep it.
"Ah, lookie here."

Happy Thanksgiving.
"How we doing, McGee?"
"Good, boss."
Bishop and Jake made their flight.
And I actually got a text from Tony.
"Apparently, Senior... missed his flight from London and neglected to tell him."
So Tony didn't have to be there?
Nope.
But he's gonna go back tomorrow.
Senior-- he never disappoints.
"And as for our giving thanks, would anyone care to join me for a celebratory cocktail?"
"On me, of course."
"Oh, then I'm in."
"Me, too."
Me three!

"No, wait."
Before that...
I have a better idea.

I'll give you one.

"Mom, lie down for a while."

"That's more like it, Mrs. Slocum."

I'll be back.
"Really, Sergeant."

"Give me a break, Max."
"Maddie, I want to make something very clear."
This job happens to be of special interest to the Doctor.
Max is just freaking out 'cause I had coffee and talked to some guy at a coffee shop.

"But if we hurry, maybe there'll be something left."
Good heavens.
I had no idea it was so late.
How's the new line going?
"Oh, fine, fine."
Where would you like to go to lunch?
How about the Royalty Room?
I'm afraid I have to be back by 2:00.
I have an appointment with the manager at Tilfords.

Why would she come back without telling us?

"- Yeah, I guess."

"Well Danny felt... and we all felt that since you were there that day, you know, you had a.... you had a right to know."

Well... we're waiting on Drew.
"Ah, so typical."
Drew left no explanation with anyone.
I guess he felt he didn't need to since he never actually asked Jill to marry him in the first place.
"But as difficult and embarrassing as the day was for Jill, deep down,"
I don't think she was surprised.
You can't push a guy into marriage like that and then expect a happy outcome.
Perhaps at one point Drew did love her.
He just forgot why.
What now?
Do you want to go get some pepperoni pizza?
"Honey, I think she needs something a little bit stiffer than a pizza."
"How about a double Jack on the rocks, huh?"
"Uh, excuse me, Jill, I..."
I can't rememberthe last time I walked on the beach.
"You're in Izmir, the beaches are only minutes away from here..."
How can I leave your brother on his own?
Let me go.
Let go.
I wish we were easier kids.
I wouldn't exchange either of you forthe entire world.
Let the world see what a true son is.
Mom...
Leave me.
Please excuse the drama.
Say hi to yourparents.
"Mom, come here."
"We leave and you stay here, OK?"
Promise to write!
Promise me.
"Call them to come back, right away."
"Kezban, what are you angry for?"
Aren't you the one who had Ahmet followed?
There is something fishy about the whole thing.
He said Ahmet is clean but I am sure he isn't...
Call the girl to come back.
There is no point keeping herthere.
Mom.
Someone's at the door!
Is Can Ozturk here?
Hold on.
You asshole.
Amoustache?
My lover likes it.
You ruined a good job for a fuck?
Something could have happened to you.
"Ten, nine , eight, seven , six , five , four three , two"
One!
What happened over there?
Well...
"I was just thinking that, since how you're 18 and all, you can be charged as an adult now, for all felonies."
"Kid's meal, ferris wheels..."
God knows what else.
I know.
"But hey, this should turn that around."
I've invited the Boss to our party.
"""Dear Daisy,"
I'm sorry I couldn't be at your birthday party but I hope you have a wonderful day.
"Chet . """
it was swell of you to invite him.
Hello?
"Oh, hey Russ."
Is that Russ calling us to wish us a happy vacation?
"Because if it's not, he has got the wrong number."
Oh ...
Ur...
I don't know.
I'll have to check with Violet .
Vi ?
No fucking way!
Violet says no.
"Violet says "" Fuck NO !"""
I thought you said we had some down time ahead.
"No, Violet told me you would pull something like this."
"Oh, yea , no kidding."
She said you'll do that too.
Up the money and call it an easy gig!
"That's textbook, Russ!"
I've ordered an MRI.
"Don't be silly, Christine."
Only the Chief of Neuro can order an MRI.
You know that.
"That's not true, actually."
What do you mean?
I did it.
At 7:10 this morning.
I signed off on the paperwork.
Surely not in Steg's name?
How do I know what it looked like to the tech on duty?
"Come on, Brenda."
Kingdom Hospital Neuro can't grind to a halt because Steg oversleeps.
Don't look at him.
"Hey, Doc, you're losing it."
"What's up, Doc?"
You should be sterilized.
At least then you couldn't breed.
"Hey, you forgot something, Doc."
Maintenance.
This is where I work.
"Will you try to remember that, Mama?"
"Yes, Bobby."
"You're a bit of a crackpot, I guess."
But I'm very fond of you.
"- I have some work to do up here, so..."
"- Honey, don't worry about me."
I'll be fine.
I know my way around this place like the back of my hand.
"- Mr. Goode, I'd like to report..."
- Johnny's not here.
- I'm just holding down the seat for him.
"Your satellite is on, by the way."
That screen is badass.
I just think it's asking a lot.
He knows it.
He's done nothing but apologise.
Is this gonna be every weekend now?
No.
It's just the end of the quarter.
You remember how that was.
"But I am earning double time, so there's a bright side."
So when the laziest boy in the world wakes up tell him he better wash those sneakers.
And I said bye.
And tell him to let them air-dry this time.
I don't want him banging the hell out of my dryer.
What?
"What, you don't even get casual Saturday?"
I mean...
"No, it's just you..."
You look nice is all.
"It's work, Walt."
And everybody is gonna be there.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Maybe we'll order a pizza tonight?
Okay.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Hi.
"You've reached Walt, Skyler and Walter, Jr."
"Please leave a message, and we'll get back to you."
Skyler?
Are you there?
Okay.

"Oh, honey, look."
Back when everyone was just going to camp at the Y you borrowed my New York Times found some arts camp in the Berkshires wrote away for information and got accepted on your own.
You never did things like everyone else.
Why not?
Because that's you.
That's why you're my favorite daughter.
You're not supposed to say that.
I don't give a shit.
"I'm retired, I'll say what I want to."
I'll say it to the whole room if you want.
"Wait, wait, wait!"
Come here.
Stop.
KEN:
"It's true, though."
Hey.
- What are you doing?
- Waiting for you.
Come on.
Sorry I'm late.
"No, it's okay."
I like a little time before a blind date.
"Prepare myself mentally, remind myself not to tell the story about my molars..."
This is a dream come true for me.
- Yes.
- Blue balls.
They also cut out the cucumbers in there.
I was thinking that.
There was the biggest cucumber you've ever seen.
They cut that out?
"- I mean, you guys cut that out?"
"- Oh, yeah."
You know how you popped out of that tree and said a dozen different things?
- We have all those on the DVD.
"- Oh, there you go."
- My favorite...
- And they're terrific.
- he came to rescue me.
You look like you have the little Charlie Brown tree on your head.
You look like you have the little Charlie Brown tree on your head.

"I love when you say, ""This tree is drunk."""

"He eats shit all night, he doesn't get anywhere with Tris."
He's a sympathetic character.
But it's incredible because he hangs in.
That's Sunshine Theater.

Exactly.
"In a few weeks, he'll be going through what Nick's going through."
That...
Maggie?
"Oh, no."
"I mean, yes."
"Yes, when you are designing a bridge, always remember,"
"""Make adjustments,"
"""go get it energized."""
"That's good advice for life, too."
"So, Professor Mosby, is this Maggie someone special?"
No.
I...
"She's just this girl I've been into for a really long time, and, well, tonight could be the one chance I have to go out with her, so..."
- Is she a hottie?
"- Yes, Jamie."
She's very attractive.
And if we can just end class right now...
- Betty?
"- Maggie may finally be available, but what about you, Professor Mosby?"
Are you ready for a serious relationship?
Totally.
"I mean, I think so."
Maybe.
I don't know.
What do you guys think?
"- Oh, my gosh."
I totally forgot about this.
- What is it?
It's a homework assignment from when I was 15.

Puttin' me name on the sleeve!
Telling King Gob here I gave you the hand!
"Why not take an advert out in ""Loot""?"
"""Moz supplies body parts""!"
"- Shit, man!"
Where'd you get it from?
- I found it in the kitchen.
End of story.
How can it be end of story?
"I mean, whose hand is it?"
The one a bloke killed over the road.
Mrs Slocombe dragged the hand in.
OK?
"Three little words, Moz?"

Three more.
"Fuck off, Kuldip."
"I didn't want the police here, so I gave it to Sonny and Cher."

There's gonna be big posters of it everywhere.
The record company's giving us a big push.
"I'll give you an even bigger one in a minute, knob-head!"
We could all go to prison for this.
Not me!
I'm not involved.
I've got me records to think of.
"- Hey, d'you need any remixes done?"
"- hey, can we get out of here?"
this party blows.

i didn't do nothing.

"- [scoffs] hey, everybody fails, okay?"
that's life.

you're hopeless!
"ohh. oh, god."
i need a bathroom.

everybody fails.
"- mom, come on. wake up, mom."
- what?
"- mom, there's someone here -- - harley?"
look at you all grown up.
- mom?
- hi.
whoa.
[clears throat] whoa.
i need to slow my roll.
i was just dreaming up a storm last night.
- there's someone here from social services.
you got to talk to her and make her think you're a fit mother.
- a fit mother?
you don't think i'm a fit mother?
- well...
- come here.
"i know i might not always act right, but you know i'm always gonna be there for you no matter what, right?"
- right.
That's it.
Give me that.
You can have it.
There you go.
Thank you.
"Well, we should probably go to the bedroom and..."
start clearing stuff out of there.
Right.
Yes.
This is weird.
And this is really weird.
Who's this?
- I don't know.
- How could there be a photo of my dad with his arm around this woman... on his nightstand and I don't even know who she is.
Maybe she's an old friend.
"Nah, she's gotta be a new friend."
This was taken at the Wynn.
The Wynn didn't open until just before he died.
Then maybe she's a new friend.
Why wouldn't he tell me about her?
I know.
It's because I didn't call him often enough.
I wasn't gonna say that.
All right.
Let's hit the closet.
Yeah.
We did it.
What did we do?
It took a lot of people.
"It took a lot of man-hours, but we checked everyone that came into the casino between noon and 3:00."
You want to guess how many people that is?
No.
I was.
"(SHE SCOFFS) Exactly - ""was""."
How long?
(SIGHS) 18 years.
And how many times did you do the dirty on her?
Never.
"Well, it's my life, and actually, I really like it."
"Oh, yeah, so what about the drugs?"
The meth?
"See, I think you've got one... maybe two months before your teeth start falling out."
"Come on, Jenny."
Eh?
"See, the thing is, I don't think you're doing this by choice."
Not really.
That's just a cuddly thought so you can sleep at night.
Nah.
"Need the coinage, rent to pay."
What do you want?
All right.
"Well, I can tell I'm not gonna change your mind, so why don't you just call your mum, let her hear your voice?"
It's not my voice she wants to hear.
She's no different from the freaks that get off on these films.
It's not who I actually am that matters.
It's who they wish I was.
Jen!
- I...
- Tell her I'm fine.
"All right, that's it, the show's over!"
"Come on, show's over."
"Oi, oi, oi."
Jenny Jones...
- Get off me!
"Iwas so thrilled, Alicia, to see you coming in alone today, just with canes, on your own."
Did you see?
Howwas rehab today?
Very good.
Are you tired?
"Yes, very."
Doesn't matter.
We'll do some additional exercices.
We'll do some leg stretches.
I've done 100 today already.
We'll do just a few more.
Good morning.
I'm here to see Mr. Sanz.
Come in.
Thank you.
The fetus was born dead.
It was a boy.
But Alicia woke up.
Benigno should be told.
"Given his mental state, I think not."
He could do something crazy.
But Icant lie to him.
"I'm his only friend, he trusts me."
I'll do it.
It's not a dilemma for me.
I'll tell him that Alicia is still in a coma and the baby is dead.
But you must promise me that you'll say nothing.
What about bail?
"It'll be very difficult, and expensive."
But we can try.
Number eight.
You got wet.
- Three.
- Okay.
"Sorry to ask this right after we ate, but did you sleep with that girl, Sunhee?"
No.
Then why'd she stare me down?
Did you two talk?
That's none of your business.
Did you have sex?
Just tell me the truth.
Tell me.
I'm just curious.
I didn't.
I told you I saw everything.
She really just came in and left.
"Plus, she's married."
And I really do not see her as a woman at all.
I'm serious.
So stop talking this nonsense.
"- Ouch, it hurts."
- Why are you lying to me?
Why are you being like this?
I interviewed her because she resembled you.
"I was missing you so much, but you weren't here."
So I just interviewed anyone.
We don't look alike.
And you know how she looks at me?
She got this contempt in her eyes.
Why would she?
She means nothing to me.
She's just nice.
"Actually, I feel sorry for her."
"Go on, and what else?"
I couldn't never understand why you don't want to introduce us to each other.
Why won't you invite him to our house?
What does Garik have to do with it?
Don't interrupt me!
I'm fed up with it!
I got interested.
"I started gathering information about Garik, his family and work."
I found some data.
Come and look.
He's gone.
He died the next year after your graduation.
He died almost 30 years ago.
Your best friend died.
You could have invented something more convincing and not use such cruel lie.
I'm leaving.
I can't live like this any longer.
I'm so scared with you!
- Hello?
- Hello?
"Hi, old man!"
Garik!
Is that you?
It's me.
Who else could it be?
What's wrong with your voice?
- Aren't you dead?
- What?
Who is dead?
Are you drunk again?
You're dead.
Well...
You died and I went crazy.
"Well, yeah, you know."
"I wanna be a doctor, but I gotta get into college fiirst."
What kind of doctor ?
Pediatrician.
I like kids.
- Do you have any ?
- No.
Do you ?
"Oh, I didn't-- l wasn't trying to be smart, Derek."
Wouldn't be the fiirst time.
"Screw you, I'm brilliant and cool."
"- Oh, yeah."
- Yeah.
Wow.
"That was cute, that little thing you did."
Can you show me again ?
- What was that shit you just did ?
- Rond dejambe attitude.
- Ballet. I used to dance.
- You used to dance ?
"Used to, as in don't anymore and no, I don't want to talk about it."
"So, is that why you brought up that rond dejambe attitude shit... because you don't want to talk about it ?"
It's really not a big deal.
I think it is.
"This club was so slamming, Lindsay, the dancing. I'm gonna go again."
You are ?
"Well, have you seen anybody get shot yet ?"
What ?
"No, I didn't see anyone get shot yet."
"God, I didn't move to Bosnia."
"Well, I'm still going to pray foryou."
"Jesus, Sara, you're in the freaking ghetto."
- Why are you following me?
- EMMA:
It's Dad.
He's back.
"- What up, my Lakewood Sixers?"
"Though, technically, there are only five of us at the moment."
What?
"No one's talked to him since we, like, broke up?"
Talking about Jake Fitzgerald.
"That's your boyfriend, right?"
- (SCREAMING)
- STAVO:
"Finally answered, huh?"
He must really love you.
"All you people who think you know everything about the Lakewood Six, you don't know us."

The fault is in the dimensioning routine.

"Well, can I help?"
Perhaps you can.

This place is great!
"I mean, it's got Irene, it's got soup, it's got pie, why would I ever leave?"
"Eric, it's not your home."
"That's right, it's not."
"At home, I'm a loser."
"Here, I find happiness."
You're trying to take it from me.
"No, Eric."
You didn't find happiness.
You just pulled off the road.
"I mean, you can't stay here for the rest of your life."
You just pulled off the road.
Maybe this is my exit.
"Look, Eric, we've been gone two months, all right?"
Mom and Dad are waiting.
I think we owe it to them at least one of us shows up.
Yeah.
How long do you think we can go on like this?
"Still at this, are we?"
"So, you told me she was dead."
"Look, tell me."
"Burnt down, a man's worth $4.40."
- Excuse me?
- That's what you said.
- When?
- In the car.
"When all's said and done, you know, carbon and minerals."
A human being's worth less than five bucks.
I said that?
"Well, you know me, I talk a lot of shit."
"But if you say I said it, then I suppose I should believe you."
What about it?
We walk.
Both of us.
"Well, you might walk but her..."
That's impossible.
She knows too much.
She's got the codes.
She's got the cypher.
She's compromised.
It's gotta stop.
I'll get you a prescription for Ativan.
That will stop your conscience bothering you.
Yeah.
"Well, take a look at that."
It's a copy of the broadcasts.
The ones she stopped.
Number 14 might be of interest.
I've heard every single word of it.
"Her body was mangled, still wearing her cute school uniform."
"I heard she was pretty tough though, and she didn't beg for her life."
"Her last words were ""I'm sorry."""
I wonder who they were meant for?
It brings tears to my eyes!
Y-You're lying!
It's true!
"I wanted to show you a picture of her body so I could see the despair on your face, but I think I'm going to resist."
"'Cause you know what, the damage is written all over your face, Kashim!"
My woman in Tokyo!
I'm already too late!
"Aww, poor Kaname- chan!"
"She was such a nice girl, too!"
Gauron!
"That's right, I killed her."
Now hate me.
"Go on, hate me, Kashim!"

Dear Max
I'm thinking of you.
And I'm writing you some things that I can't tell you.
Can't you still?
Did you realize that it's not the same now?
We don't love each other anymore.
That's what the letter said?
Nothing else?
Did it say something about me?
Yes.
Tell me.
Tell me!
Can't you say those things about me?
You've never wanted to know them.
Well now I do.
What do they matter now?
!
To me they do!
Tell me!
Stop it!
You're hurting me!
Then tell me!
You're nuts!
That's what you think about me?
No.
That would be so easy!
"Besides, you'd take that as a compliment!"
I don't want to say what I think of you because it doesn't matter anymore!
Would you like to live in the countryside?
Always.
I'd stay here.
I couldn't get used to it.
"I'm coming, Anna"
Brother!
Wake up
"I'm Nikki, not Anna"
"Get up now oh, what's the problem that you had to wake me so early!"
I'd be married if only you had waited
"Married, did you say!"
It's nothing... nothing at all.
What's the time anyway?
8 O' clock
If I'm late today too Imran'll give me hell...
And I must be at the station by 12 as well!
My goodness!
So many pictures of Anna!
She's in English literature.
In Economics...
In Psychology too!
I've only one favorite subject...
Anna...
Anna...
And Anna!
She doesn't love you though
"But she likes me, doesn't she?"
She'll love me too
I mean the way people talk.
"I mean, people think we did it."
I know.
It's like we might as well done it anyway at this point.
"I mean, you know, if everybody is talking about it already..."
maybe we...
"I mean, not to make a big deal of it or anything."
Out of what?
Take him.
"Dad, I am fine..."
You forgot these in the car.
We'll take care of that.
I have to be honest.
I don't need these anymore.
Shove them up your ass.
How about shoving them up your girlfriend's ass.
Stick them up your mother's cunt.
"Pick on someone your own size, asshole."
"Dad, I will go faraway."
Forgive me.
I am a faggot.
It's all my fault.
What's your show tonight?
"Here, this is for making a Zenne out of me."
You're a natural.
"Take this, idiot."
Go to my apartment and take whatever you want.
I don't need your filthy stuff.
Ah OK then...
Don't you ever wear colourless clothes again.
I don't want to see you in white ever again.
I'll miss you too.
Answer the phone.
Please.
You sneaky little cunt.
"You faggot's daughter, you!"
My brother is saving himself from you.
Your God left you a cripple.
You're gonna die here all alone.
Dad.
"To save you from making a terrible mistake try, Mike."
"Just come to the hut, and talk to me."
- Prepare for the money.
"- Mike, give me Bella!"
Wait a second.
- Why are we going?
It came to the new.
- It's about right.
I did not love.
- So why do we are going back?
- Just in case he.
- How did that happen?
- Sculpture Mike'ta.
I have no doubt.
- Do you have any idea where that is?
Diamond had left outside his home to watch.
This morning I was riding in a taxi with his sister.
- Diamond followed them to the hotel.
"- So, Do you have any idea about the statue where you placed?"
- Who knows?
Can be anywhere!
"- Jade, tell me, hell no!"
Bringing me there!
Why not?
Been a long time.
Do not worry.
I take care of him.
I trust to do.

"Who, Who knows better given bribe?"
Drinks on the house.
"No, have the drink with me."
The drinks are on...the house.
I fucked kids like that in the can.
In the ass.
Fucking break up my party.
You been away for six years.
Everything is different now.
"I did my fucking time, Jimmy."
I came home and I want what I got to get.
I got fuckin' mouths to feed.
-You're gonna get it.
-You understand?
Get the door!
"Let me shoot him in his big, fucking mouth!"
Let's shoot him.
Fucking mutt dented my shoes.
His whole crews gonna be looking for him.
This is fuckin' bad.
What do we do with him?
We can't just dump him on the street.
Don't worry. I know a place upstate.
They'll never find him.
"Come on, let's get some more tablecloths."
I didn't want to get blood on your floor.
"Henry, go open your trunk."
We'll pick up a shovel at my mother's house.
She keeps a shovel lying' around here somewhere.
"Just keep quiet though, I don't want to wake her up."
Look who's here.
What are you doing?
What happened?
- We're closing forIunch.
- Want to come with us?
- Where do you go?
"Home, we all live nearby."
- When will you be back?
- At 3.
- Imagine that!
- But we stay open until 6.
- Coming?
"- No, thank you, I'm not hungry."
I'II stay here and work.
Enjoy yourIunch.
The time will pass quickly.
It's just two years.
"- CostabiIe, is this yours?"
"- No, Mr. Director."
- would you Iike a coffee?
- Excuse me?
- What is it?
- I have to get by.
You're here to listen to the critical issues I've noticed and want to talk about with you.
Where's VoIpe?
You'II refer.
There are two urgent points:
safety and working hours.
I'd Iike a steel door and cameras inside and out.
"Start time: 8 am, lunch break from 1 pm to 2, work ends at 5 pm."
I wish to remind you that this is italy too.
Objections?
I told you he'd make us sweat blood.
Where's Mattia?
Maybe you don't understand how it works.
"A moment, please."
I'd like to bring your attention... to the next item on our menu.
Fish cooked in mayonaisse.
We owe Coronel Eliot our gratitude for this repast... and the good Colonel tells us that this dish is called...
Siren.
"- Do you know it, Captain?"
"- Yes, I know it very well."
"Siren, the mermaid of Naples."
Extremely rare.
But I've seen it several times...
- Where?
- At the aquarium.
"You can't be referring to Siren, the seductress in Homer's Odyssey."
Wretches.
It's just an ordinary fish.
Mermaids don't exist.
"My god, it's a baby!"
A cooked baby!
We have to bury it!
Cover her up!
Cover her up!
"I swear, it's an edible fish, General."
"It's a fish, Mr. General..."
"It's a fish, I swear."
A fish!
It don't care what they say.
My god!
"- Well, in Philadelphia..."
"- Gentlemen, sit, please."
Please Mrs. Wyatt.
"Now, the good lord knows what Mark Cork thinks... of fish cooked in mayonaisse."
"I don't like war either, but someone has to lead."
Please don't make me do that.
"Come on, you're a guy."
You do this kind of thing all the time.
What do I do?
I don't know.
Just act sexy.
I can act sexy.
What the hell are you doing?
I'm acting sexy.
Looks like you're trying to get a cobra out of a basket.
"Hey, this move killed for me in the '80s."
That's great.
"If a Duran Duran concert suddenly breaks out, you'll be set."
"All right, I got it, I got it."
Here goes.
Hi.
My name is Christine Campbell.
"I'm divorced, but I get along great with my ex-husband."
We're just better as friends.
"Anyway, I'm not crazy."
I'm very stable.
"In fact, I own my own gym."
It's one of those 30-minute workout places for women.
"I make decent money, though."
But most of it goes to my son's private school.
But I'm not a snob.
I'm very down to earth.
I just want what's best for my son.
"His name is Ritchie, we live in Mar Vista."
Excuse me.
Sorry.
Way to play it cool.
An investment to be clear.
Not a fucking handout!
That said...
I did remind him... of the night we shared together.
"And how it would be a tad embarrassing if, uh... well, if anyone found out about it."
"Which is technically blackmail, I suppose, but whatever."
I filmed it.
You see?
Suck it.
I think we can all agree.
That the truth hurts.
Here.
This will help with the pain.
"Thanks for the party, guys."
She's dead.
"Get lost, you bloody queer!"
Oops.
We're done here.
May I invite you all to join me in a toast?
"Yes, you can."
One year's out and in the end we're all still breathing.
Gin - fucking gin!
Gin - fucking gin!
Yeah.
"We'll be celebrating later, aren't you?"
"Uh, Jesus Christ!"
"Oh, we're going to be right at the end of that--"
Get off me.
"Chris, I've seen you in the shower you were to be in heaven!"
- It's the old lad.
"- Oh, bad to be on that!"
"My Sultana, with your permission"
Let's feed the kids
Good
Nilüfer?
The most favourite of the Sultanas
Did you check?
"Yes, I did my Sultana"
İbrahim Paşa is not in his room
I knocked the door but the door is locked
"If you want to say something important, you can say it to me and I'll have it delivered to him"
No.
I need to go to his palace
To İbrahim Paşa's palace?
Shall Icome with you my Sultana?
No.
I'll handle it
Is Gülfem Hatun still in the park?
Yes.
She is with Mahidevran Sultana
Good
Give me that box
Did Yakup Efendi say something bad my Sultana?
Did he annoy you?
"No, the opposide"
I'm cheered up
He'll come tomorrow
Oh Mashallah.
"Whenever you want to see Yakup Efendi, just tell me."
I'll bring him to your knees
"Anything to make you smile, my Sultana"
We have been riding for long days.
Won't you rest my Bey?
Addons Do we look at how you are protected?
"Addons Dave, two days ago You visit a site in Japan"
Addons Video streaming content from a humiliating

"Addons ""Two girls and a horse."""
"Addons ""It is very young to be running"""

Addons can I continue?
Addons Please answer verbally.
Addons Will I continue?
- No!
I do not ...
"Addons Do you consider the age girl in the video, Dave?"
Addons Do you think that?
Or who look for it?
Addons Can you tell us the title of the 4 times a night in watching it?
I do not remember.
"Of course not, it may then you have come to mind."
Is striking.
This is a global network.
And I have the right to see which I like.
I was not obscene.
"- Max, you look at porn, right?"
- Do not put me in this regard.
God ...
- Sure you do.
- I do not even know.
Lie!
We have all done it should not be.
All!
And who says no.
He is a liar.
You heard him.
"Thank you, sir."
"Hey, Em!"
You wanna take a ride?
Come on.
Can I go?
"Yeah, of course."
Go with your father.
She's an amazing girl.
This way!
Move this way!
Welcome aboard.
"Thank you, sir."
You sure you're all right?
I'm all right now.
"Good job, special agent."
"Thank you, general."
"If you ever want a private tour of the White House, just let me know."
I can hook it up like that.
"I mean, maybe in a few weeks.."

That's good to know.
You wanna give him the news?
Calls have been coming in from all over the globe for the last hour.
"The presidents of Iran, Russia, Israel and France have all agreed to your terms."
It looks like your peace plan is a go.
"You keep this up, I just might have to vote for you."
You wanna see something really special?
Yeah.
Carol.
"Henry, the president wants to do the thing."
Hold on tight.
"- My Jordans, nigga!"
"- Shit, this isn't good."

This is not good.
No.
No.
No.
They're coming over here.

Why did you do that?
"- Yeah, I hit a fire hydrant on purpose."
"They're getting weapons, man."
"All right, what do we do?"
What do we do?
"Run, run, run."
"Run, run."
The men are still very jumpy.
A night on the grog will straighten them out.
Nature calls.
What do you think?
I think they started the party without us.
Who are you?
You do realize you only have one shot.
Which means you'll only be able to kill one of us.
And that whoever you do not shoot will have to cut your throat before the other hits the ground.
Ready?
Let the show begin.
Stand your ground.
Stand your ground!
Stand your ground!
Gather around me here!
Captain Taylor.
- Lucy Coleson.

Me either.
"Look at our son over there, eh?"

Plums out of her damn orchard.
"Come on, call her up."
"Well, I guess I should get back."
Unless you want me to take the rest of the day off.
"No, go ahead."
I'm doing much better.
It was a big help getting out of the house.
"I really should have taken the day off,"
"Too, it wasn't for... what do they say?"
... pressing business.
"I know, Jeff."
I don't mind.
"As a matter of fact, I think I'm going"
Back to work myself tomorrow.
Are you sure you're not pushing it?
"No, it'll be better at work."
"Now, hurry up, 'cause you're late."
I'll finish my coffee.
Come on by tonight?
JEFF:
Yeah.
OK.

Wood:
"I did such a good job setting the mood for this guy, he was too busy getting busy to give me a tip."
"So I still only had $20, and I hoped Adam hadn't been doing any better."
Andrew #2:
I'm gonna throw this out to you right now.

That was fun.
That was really fun.
That was [Bleep] Fun.
"All right, dude."

Where else can you drive cool cars and get paid for doing a burnout?
"$40 richer, I headed back into the city for my next pick-up."
"- You have to go, Carlos."
"You can ruin your life with your muñequita, but you're not gonna ruin my bodega!"
"- You have to go, take the keys."
So I worked on a new color for this guy.
That's a great color.
I've got to show you something.
"I just finished these panels,"
I wanted to know what you thought.
"Jenny, go work on this."
"We'll talk about this, okay?"
You all right?
How you've been?
"Hey, Carlos?"
How have you been?
- You all right?
- I'm fine.
Fine.
"All right, what do you got here?"
"So, what do you think?"
It's good!
Good.
Good.
- I based that one on the old man.
- How is he?
He's fine.
Listen... can you show these to your friend at Gotham Comics?
"Who, Raquel?"
- Yeah.
- Are you sure you're ready?
"'Cause you only get one chance with her, you know that."
These are good.
Raquel:...which I assume is how you got the idea for this.
And we needed to find us some shelter!
This is my turn to tell a story.
"Hey, hey."
Shh!
The kindly innkeeper was warm and friendly.
She made me feel all bubbly inside.
My trusty sidekick here would love to freshen up.
- Sidekick?
- And I would love some waffles!
But we are equals.
"Oh, man."
Of course we are...
The noble donkey reassured his clearly inferior sidekick.
I'm getting a little tired of this...
"But before Puss could finish his thought, he decided to take a well-deserved tongue bath."
Wh... wh... wha... wha...
"Well, as long as I am here."
"But right then, danger came from behind."
"♪ Da-dum, da-dum ♪"
"♪ Da-dum, da-dum ♪"
And Puss was never seen again.
Ha ha.
The End.
No!
That's not how the story goes.
I was well aware of the approaching danger and went for my steel.
"Don't worry, little buddy."
I'm here to save you!
Ohh.
You're killing me.
It was Prince Charming!
"He was packing heat, and he wanted revenge!"
Could you keep Mrs. Riblet's valuables while she gets a CT?
"- Help yourself, honey."
- Sure thing.

- Fantasy of the Opera?
The Magic Flute?
- No.
The charity ball.
You promised you'd go.
- That's tonight?
- Yeah.
The tickets cost my company 300 bucks.
"- Here's your costume, Don Giovanni."
"- No, no, no...."
- That's tights.
I'll just wear a tux.
- No.
Pick me up at 7.
That'll give you an hour to change.
"Yeah, well...."
- What are you going as?
- Carmen.
- Don't be late.
- Yeah.
I think you're gonna need this.
Mrs. Wilson has been admitted with coffee-ground emesis 14 times with the same symptoms.
Order all her charts and write a summary of all her discharge notes by tomorrow.
- You got the computer fixed?
- Yeah.
I do not really like the sun.
Hah!
Dear friend...
I do not wish you to be burned.
(coughs)
(knocking)
Excuse me.
"I'm sorry, my friend."
May I speak with you?
Something very terrible has happened.
- Oh!
- Ah!
Again.
- George seems more cheerful.
- Mm.
She has a crush on Chopin.
The polish corpse?
- They couldn't be more different.
- Then they will definitely fall in love.
I suppose as friends we should help them along.
absolutely not!
"Franz, you and I must put ourselves between them at every opportunity."
- Marie!
Your turn.
- Yes.
"He is so frail, darling."
You know George will finish him off.
- The countess made advances to you?
- She is my friend's mistress.
- She has borne his child.
- He wouldn't mind if she changed hands.
"really, I don't understand the attitude of you people."
Why did you lie before?
- I was afraid.
But you must avenge my death.
There...
In that trunk.
"I wrote everything down, in case something happened."
"Give it to the judge, so Beatrice will be saved... and they'll hang them, him, and that whore of a mistress."
Lucrezia?
"- In there, hurry."
Take this letter to Judge Ranieri.
It's important.
Judge Ranieri's office?
- Up there.
What's going on?
"Forgive me, sir, but it's very important..."
It concerns the death of Francesco Cenci.
Who gave you this?
- A wounded man heading for the city.
Who was he?
- I don't know; he died soon after.
Watch the doors.
Don't let anyone out.

Really?
"Then, take a rest."
"Yeah,I don't-- I don't want to be unconscious on a hospital bed forever, and"
"I don't want to be unconscious on a hospital bed forever, and if I leave the decision up to on a hospital bed forever, and if I leave the decision up to Murph, you know, no matter what"
"if I leave the decision up to Murph, you know, no matter what he chooses, he'll never feel"
"Murph, you know, no matter what he chooses, he'll never feel like he made the right choice."
I-
"-I don'tknow,Em."
It'sokay.
I'm okay.
It'sokay.
I'm okay.
This is right.
"It's been fun, Adam."
Yeah?
MorethanIliketoadmit .
Okay.
Okay.
ItlookslikeEmily decided for you.
I'm sorry.
decided for you.
I'm sorry.
"Oh,God."
I'm sorry.
"Oh,God."
Tonight I was gonna surprise her
"Oh,God."
Tonight I was gonna surprise her and take her to a Ronda Rousey
Tonight I was gonna surprise her and take her to a Ronda Rousey meet-and-greet.
and take her to a Ronda Rousey meet-and-greet.
"Wait,what?"
meet-and-greet.
"Wait,what?"
Ronda Rousey meet-and-greet?
Listen!
Listen!
Dad!
"She's making you fool,"
"Try it once, It's fun,"
Laila Jee!
"Laxminarayan you're here, Please come, please come,"
"So nice to see you, Complete 900,000."
"Count them, Now where is my car?"
"It's just between polishing, You people just make it fast,"
"Shri Narayn's here, It's complete cash, count them."
What's this?
"I got the bundle of 10, what to do?"
Is this the bundle of 10-10?
"It's just a underwear,"
"She calls bundle to underwear, It's underwear."
"I keep the bundle inside, Where this underwear come from?"
"These are my designs, Where you get it from?"
"Hey, Hi!"
Jia!
"You, How dare you come at my front?"
"You told Laxminarayan that take my samples and shoot me,"
Dad!
Did you say her like that?
"First tell me, who is she?"
"Dad, she's Jia, whose designs you came here to take, But I didn't meet her,"
Namaste!
Namaste!
Who is he?
"I am Laxminarayan,"
Then who was he?
"One minute, One minute, Who was who?"
You get anything?
Yeah.
The cell that led us to Cutler?
Yeah.
Found something interesting on it.
What?
"All right, so according to Abby,"
Cutler used this phone exclusively to contact her.
Right.
But... look at this.
The last number Cutler dialed was to a different number.
Right.
And check out the time.
10:51.
"That's two minutes after the shooting started, which means that not only did Cutler not die instantly..."
He was alive long enough to place a phone call.
Let me see that.
Exactly.
(phone speed dialing)
(automated tones)
AUTOMATED VOICE:
We're sorry...
Disconnected?
Yeah.
Probably a burner.
"Okay, so this guy, he takes two at close range, he's bleeding out."
"He doesn't call 911, he calls some mystery number."
We need to find out who was on the other end.
(phone ringing)
Chin.
On the way.
JOE:
This is Max and he isn't the groom.
"No, no, no."
He's single and gay.
Yes.
"So gay, he got kicked out of One Direction."
Why don't you two walk off somewhere and share poignant coming-out stories.
Go.
- But Max--
"- Oh, you heard the women, go."
Can do.
"Ladies, look around, we'll be back... in about a month."
Tahiti anyone?
I'm just Crazy Carl.
The ladies love it.
Bridesmaid's dresses should be called what they are.
Really expensive donations to Goodwill.
Is this one bad?
No.
That's a Vera Wang.
But this is a very wrong.
Hide it.
Ew.
And it's evil twin.
"Oh, I didn't know hazmat suits came with feathers."
Oh my God.
This the worst thing I've ever seen.
And I've seen a prostitute change her tampon on the sidewalk.
Who are you calling a prostitute?
"This, we've got to hide."
I can't get this dress off.
Just tell it you work at Google and you're thinking of settling down.
Lift it up.
Get Inspector Robin to protect me tomorrow.
Yes Sir!
"Darling, go buy me an ice-cream!"
I want you to apologize to this lady.
"None of your business, I like it when he hits me!"
I still want you to apologize to this bitch.
I know you'd be checking the view here.
I've got a great scheme for us.
Hang on. I want his apology.
"Just say 'sorry', out of pity for him."
I never have to say sorry!
That's true!
"Come on, let's go...!"
No way.
He has to apologize!
He's lnspector Robin!
Inspector Robin.
"Oh, I'm sorry!"
Don't bother with me.
Apologize to the bitch.
Sure thing.
"Sorry, bitch!"
I beg your pardon?
Let's go!
Who the hell's lnspector Robin?
Great...
Shame on you...
What do you want from me?
"This scheme will benefit the human race, lt will benefit the entire world."
But how will it benefit me?
"You can be the greatest unknown hero,"
But how will it benefit me?
"- Just take it easy, take-take it easy."
"- Justin, don't!"
- Don't what?
Do this?
This is what happens when people don't follow orders.
"Luke, chairs, bring them."
Do it!
"Justin, I don't know what it is you think we've done but really, you've got this wrong, all wrong."
We haven't done anything.
- You need to stop this.
"- Gemma, quiet."
Eleanor!
Gemma!
Take a seat.
"This is it, isn't it?"
This is why we're here?
I said take a seat.
Luke!
Their hands.
Bind them.
"No phone calls, people."
Use some bloody common sense.
"Luke, bring over the other chairs."
Snap to it!
Then collect up their car keys and their mobile phones.
There's a lock box on the workbench.
Chris...
"I know you're waiting, mate."
Picking the right moment.
This is not that moment.
I'm quicker than you and I've got a gun.
"And, uh, I absolutely won't miss."
Bullshit!
He can arrest you!
"I'm gonna tell you something, but you have to promise never to repeat it, especially to Shane."
- Tell me what?
"- Swear to me, never to Shane."
Fine.
Peter and I are technically...
We're...
What?
We're married.
I know it sounds crazy.
"It kind of is crazy, but sometimes you do crazy things when you have no choice, and I had no choice."
"It's a business arrangement, pure and simple."
I know what you're thinking.
I loved your father.
I still love him.
"This has nothing to do with Judah or marriage, really."
It's business.
You married him.
"Silas, I know how strange this all sounds."
- It's Dad's birthday!
- I know.
"But he's dead, so what difference does it make?"
Stop playing the dead-dad card!
The wrong parent died!
And you know what?
Tough shit.
Get your ass back there and watch Willy fucking Wonka!
"Go, go, go!"
- Clear.
- Clear.
"Derek, go to your room."
"Man, you""re fantastic."
"Mama, I""m getting married."
"Doesn""t Cassie look beautiful?"
Mom?
"Sweetheart, we could not be happier."
"Isn""t that right, Bobbi?"
"I told you she wouldn""t like it."
"I figured since it was your first wedding dress, it""d be perfect."
That dress is jinxed.
- Figures.
"- Cassie, wait."
"She""s gonna ruin this."
"She""s just dying to ruin this!"
"Mom""s got three kids and we all got different dads."
What did you expect?
- Tim would never cheat.
"- Cassie, your own dad""s a cheater."
"I know you love him, and Rick""s a great guy and all that... but he still cheated on Mom."
"Just like every other jerk she""s been with."
"Don""t worry, you can still call it off."
"You know Mom""s right."
You know in your heart it will never last.
There are still some people in this world that believe in marriage.
Whatever.
But I love him.
Does anybody in this family even care that I love him?
- You want a double-chocolate muffin?
- And how much is that?
May I have one to go?
I thought he was happy.
"L""m happy."
Ferrara:
Coming up...
We did call Zingo!
...Things just keep getting weirder as we continue our competition for tips in San Francisco.
Wow.
Get a room.
"It's our 25th episode, and to celebrate, they've given me control of the show."
"Now, okay, admittedly, started out with a bang with the crash, but now you're driving around San Francisco on a pink scooter."
What's up with that?
"It's not a pink scooter, and what could be better?"
You get to drive around in these amazing cars and get paid for it.
Amazing cars?
You're in a beetle.
At least Adam got to drive a Bentley.
"Yeah, but, I mean, the whole goal was to make money, and I was 20 bucks up, and the night was still young."
"[ Rock version of ""When the Saints go marching in"" plays ]"
Wood:
Oh!
Yeah!
"- What's up, baby?"
"- What's up, guys?"
"- Hey, I'm Rutledge."
Rutledge.
How are you guys?
Hi.
Barrette.
How are you?
Barrette.
"Nick, right?"
Here are the keys.
Great.
Don't [Bleep] It up.
"- dang. jake ain't nothing but a paintballer -- no future and currently dead, by the way."
"kind of sad, though."
he didn't shoot blanks.
- [gasps] you're useless!
"- geez, i was just having fun."
i'm gonna get a refill.
[door creaks]
- you guys seen randy?
[toilet flushing] excuse me.
"oh, my god!"
ohh!
what is that?
- it's pizza with a hint of hard-boiled egg.
- that's disgusting.
- i don't know whether to be grossed out or hungry again.
"- okay, you have serious problems."
"look, have you seen randy?"
me and him are supposed to hook up.
- no.
- have you seen randy?
- excuse me.
y-you can see me?
"- well, yes."
"if you're standing right there, i can see you."
- what?
no. no.
how did that happen?
- have you seen him or not?
"- i, um -- no, i haven't."
"- have another drink, why don't you?"
- i think i will.
[knock on door]
DAN:
Ha-ha-ha.
I'm just kidding.
It was just her engagement ring.
So why all the long faces?
-We miss Bull.
HARRY:
Yeah.
Nobody to carry the heavy files.
Or walk us to our car at night.
Hey. wait a minute.
Listen to the way we're talking.
All we care about is how this affects us.
We're supposed to be his friends.
Let's back him up.
"I mean, maybe he's made the right decision."
That's a lot of buffalo chips.
"No, Selma, I think Harry's right."
We've gotta support Bull.
We can't let him know how we feel.
I will not participate in this charade.
The man is making a fool of himself.
Somebody should tell him.
"All you have to do is have the guts to stand up to him and say, ""Bu||...."""
I'm behind you all the way.
"you big Greco-Roman nut, you."
Heh-heh.
Thanks.
I knew you'd come crawling back here where you belong.
-I just came back to clean out my locker.
-You should clean out your head.
-You know--
They're forgotten in an hour.
Come on.
"Hey, Norman, you know what?"
"There's a place I know that I'd like to show you, that no one knows about."
Not even you.
It's my secret place.
I know every spot within three miles of Peyton Place.
Not this one.
Come on.
You were right.
I never knew this place was here.
I don't think anybody does but me.
And maybe God.
And now you.
It's beautiful.
I've just decided.
This is the last time I'm ever going to come here.
Why?
"Oh, I'm gonna leave it for somebody else to find."
Maybe your children will discover it.
I'm never going to marry.
I'm just going to have lovers.
"Oh, Allison."
What's wrong with that?
"No children to grow up unhappy, nobody gets hurt except maybe me."
That's the worst kind of emotional maladjustment.
Who said so?
- A book I read.
- What book?
I sent for a book.
"It was $ 1.98, in a plain wrapper."
- A plain wrapper?
There's three.
Four.
I love you.
GOSSIP GIRL:
"XOXO, Gossip Girl."

Into the scandalous lives of manhattan's elite.
Georgina?
where are you?
You can tell jesus that the bitch is back.
- Emma.
- Got a credit card fake i.d.
And i want bacardi and a boy.
That beautiful dinner you made--
You were gonna propose weren't you?
I just don't know where we stand right now.
Tell me if what you feel for me is real.
It's just a game.
- Chuck why did you just do that?
- Because i love her.
I can't believe blair won!
"Yeah, who even voted for her?"
- Me. about 150 times.
- That was really sweet.
I just wanted to make sure she had the perfect night.
- Where's the prom king?
- We broke up.
But everything was so perfect.
Turns out fairy tales end when they do for a reason.
Like everything on the upper east side
If you stay by my side...
I'll stretch my hand out
Towards the soaring skies of our oath
I want to be the light that protects
"Your fleeting dreams, your tears"
Break free from your cruelty-stained destiny
I believe in it
The other truth of my destiny
To another world
"It really sucks, working hard, struggling."
"If I just sleep, nothing will happen."
I was satisfied with that.
But... see...

"Dango, obviously."
I don't know no Paula.
What's this?
What's this thing here?
"You're ill, Mr. Biberkopf."
Your head and arm were injured.
I want outta here.
I have my work!
I have things to do!
Soon.
What's going on here?
What's wrong with me?
I have to get your particulars.
"You don't mind, do you?"
Let's see.
You were run over on May 12 on the Eberswalderstrasse.
Name:
Franz Biberkopf.
Auto accident.
"Did you step in front of the car, or what?"
"No, no."
Watch closely.
I'll demonstrate once more.
Here's the perfect rubber band for a gentleman.
"It won't snap, split or break."
Made from the very best materials.
The whole family could hang from this rubber band.
"Pull that end, young man."
Harder!
It won't bounce back like a bad check!
So you're not married.
No children either?
Sorry ― dumb question.
"- Well, I didn't get that much."
It all kind of went sideways after lunch.
Why?
What happened?
Francine knows about Lorna and Jim.
- How'd she find that out?
- She knew.
"She asked me about it, I lied, said it was a one night thing, but she knows."
I'm gonna have to let Jim know.
Shit!
Please don't put me in this.
I promised I wouldn't say anything.
This is gonna get ugly.
What did she say?
"Is she gonna freak on him, or what?"
She just seems really depressed.
I'll handle it.
"I'll look at these later, OK?"
Do me a favour.
Will you go downstairs and make me a cold glass of lemonade?
And ask Ronnie if he can make me a sandwich from the kitchen.
- I'm gonna make Mom a sandwich.
- All right.
Is she upstairs?
Are you feeling all right?
"Sure, everything's fine."
What's wrong with you?
Maybe you want to tell me something.
What are you doing with that?
"Don't do that, Frankie."
"Jesus, don't do that."
Are you fucking Lorna?
"Okay, ma'am, I need you back here too."
RAY:
"Hey, why don't you just tell us what we did, all right?"
BILL:
Keep your hands on the car!
All right.
"Okay, now, ma'am... (GUNSHOT)"
"Damn, goddamn right!"
"Yes, baby, yes, you motherfucker!"
Let's go.
Get into the car.
"Come on, now."
You motherfucker!
(TIRES SQUEALING)
"Hey Pluto, man, we're going the wrong goddamn way, man."
We're going back toward town.
Turn the goddamn car around.
Did I kill that man back there?
"Yes, baby, but you did a good job, don't worry about it."
I think I killed that man.
"Pluto, what the fuck are you doing, man?"
We're going the wrong goddamn way.
Turn the fucking car around.
PLUTO:
The car's been ID'd.
"The car's been ID'd, right?"
So we got to get rid of it.
"Yes, you killed him, goddamn it!"
You killed him.
Would you fucking turn the car around?
It will be stolen before the cops know.
We're going the wrong fucking way.
- Hello!
- See you down in the ring!
I've seen that party!
Everything's under control!
Much action around here?
Even money now!
Nelson by a knockout!
How about putting up a double sawbuck for me?
- I better get going!
"- See you after a while, Little Boy!"
All the fight news and pictures!
All the fight news and pictures here!
"Hi, Stoke!"
"You'll take him, Stoke!"
You'll take him!
All the fight news and pictures!
All the fight news and pictures!
Get your Knockout here!
"Now, remember, stay away from him!"
- Slug with him and he'll murder you!
- I know what to do!
"That's right, Stoke, relax!"
Fight your own fight!
"Remember, take it easy for two heats!"
Then you can finish him!
- That's the set-up!
"- Okay, Danny!"
Okay!
Ladies and gentlemen!
"The next and final bout of the evening, four rounds!"
"In this corner, at 194 pounds!"
!
- I am good.
I am at home.
But I am going out after some time.
Where are you?
"What do you mean, where are you?"
I am busy arranging for your party.
What rubbish!
When did I say to throw a bash for me?
- You didn't say.
But I thought I should give you a farewell party before you leave.
I don't know when we will meet again.
"Karan, you are trying to entice me?"
"Sweetheart, I am not enticing you."
I like you.
I love you.
And you know?
It's not a crime to love.
"Karan, you know it very well that I don't have time.."
..for useless things like love.
"I am focused on my career, man."
That's why I am leaving Jaipur and going to Mumbai.
Okay.
Be focused.
Make your career.
But reach the party by 9 o'clock.
I have called all our friends.
"I am not too sure, Karan."
I will ask my mom and inform you.
Okay?
No asking.
I don't care.
You have to come.
Like every day of my life.
So why haven't you?
I don't know.
Come on.
I don't know.
I don't know.
It's-- I'm scared.
- Scared?
- Yeah.
You?
You're like the most confident person I've ever met.
It's very scary.
where would I go?
What would I do?
Anything you wanted to.
close your eyes.
Trust me.
They're closed. do anything.
Where would you go?
What would you do?
I'm right where l want to be.
You know what's funny?
When I was a kid I used to have the map of the world above my bed.
l would just point at various places-- close my eyes and just point.
And I promised myself that I would go visit those places.
And now I'm older and I'm still here in this small little town and I've never visited those places.
the funny thing is you actually got out. you followed a dream.
I really admire that.
You make it sound romantic.
It is.
Isn't it?
My dad-- he's a real son of a bitch.
Come here.
Hey.
Don't worry about this.
Okay?
Everyone's gonna get over it eventually.
When?
"Nate, high school is over."
If I don't fix this tonight
Some of these people will never talk to me again.
And--and what happens next year?
What... she does this to the next
Serena and Nate and Dan and Blair?
Well.
What else can you do?
It is too easy for her to sit behind a computer
And not face the damage she's done.
No.
But she doesn't know that.
You didn't get to use your gossip.
Well here's something new--
I told chuck I loved him... again
And he didn't say it back... again.
Blair.
I'm not gonna tell people that.
Why not?
I'm giving you what you need to be queen.
I don't want to be queen.
I just wanted a chance to have a life in school
And look what it almost made me do.
That's the thing....
You need to be cold to be queen.

The man who owned the field was very kind.
He let me take all that I wanted.
And then he invited me to eat with him.
I think the others were very surprised.
Who was it?
What was his name?
Boaz.
Boaz?
You know him?
he is my nearest kinsman.
then... then he must marry you.
Get up for the Rams.!
"In the second half, Arthur tries to pick up where he left off."

Slapped out of there by Manual.

"Ooh, and a nice fake and a score."
But it's the Rams who don't miss a beat... pressing the tempo against the tired Commandos.
You're not in the offense at all.

How do I perform flawlessly and make your heart flutter?
"No matter how many times I've suffered defeat,"
I still won't turn back.
Because you have the smile I want to possess every time we meet.
Sometimes I doubt myself.
I blame myself for not being lucky enough.
"I'm scared I'll spoil you with too much affection, but I'd still rather believe..."
Baby.
Love is an extravagant solo show.
I'm not afraid of ridicule.
"Eventually, you'll be moved."
Love is solo.
"Oh, S - o - l - o"
"Love is a cruel solo show, up on the stage."
Your glance is overflowing with sparks.
"Love is solo, the most beautiful extravagance."
Love is a solo show.
Solo Solo.
"For you, I want to..."
Solo Solo.
Love is a solo show.
Solo Solo.
"For you, I want to..."
Solo Solo.
Love is like a battle arena.
Solo Solo.
S - o - l - o
Love is a solo show.
Solo Solo.
Love is a solo show.
- Where are you you?
- I wanted to urinate.
"Addons I say, without confrontation, Dave."
"Addons, however, they talk all the time."
I did everything you asked me.
I have a passport.
The identity and details.
"It's not Max, is another."
"Addons A mysterious visitor,"
Addons at stake now.
I got her passport ..
Do not touch.
Do not touch it.
They take a hell damn life.
"Addons you have demonstrated your competence in action,"
Addons but not surprising.
Strength and the description is your point.
All right.
"So ... then .. and in peace, right?"
"Addons I'm sorry, Dave."
I'm afraid I can not do that.
Addons I have an additional task for you.
"Addons I want you, to kill one of the passengers."
Addons not have much time.
Addons I offer you three minutes.
tick .. tock Addons ...
Okay.
Who would you kill?
- What happened?
- He spent more than 6 minutes.
Dave ...
"- No, no."
"--Please, like I'd bother with that"
Pavel Ivanovich!
It was Vladimir Nikolaevich's order
I just came from his office.
Wish I never did.
Know what he said to me?
--That it doesn't fit the place --Fine.
Let's see if he's in the right place!
Don't get into it!
"--Raya, please connect me with the birdie --Sorry, with whom?"
"Forgive me, my head is all confused."
With my wife.
--Bobylev!
"--Pavel Ivanovich, it's my lunch hour now..."
--Drive me to the city council --Of course.
With pleasure.
I thought I'd run out and find a bumper during lunch
It's in my garage.
"I came there, but I forgot my key"
"--It was in my coat --Hey there, Pavel!"
--I need to see you --Hi.
"Bad timing, come by later"
"Listen, what did you say to my dad?"
That I stole some bar of soap from you...?
Forgot?
I'll remind you.
"May 1943, Boys Village in Amur Region"
My soap vanished in the morning.
In the evening you brought a bottle of booze.
"--What ""Boys""?"
--Where we were demoted together
That girl Manja gave it to me.
Get back!
"Move, move, get out of the way!"
What's going on?
They're under the ground!
Look out!
They're under the ground!
"All units, all units, be advised."
Air support en route to Pine Street Park.
Multiple explosions reported with severe casualties.
Bomb squad on scene.
"Oh, this does not look good."
You were actually near where...
"Yeah, no, it was just right there."
Was it over here?
- The south side.
- Okay.
It was just huge.
- You saw it yourself?
- Yes.
What kind of explosive makes a crater like this?
Something small.
An I.E.D. maybe.
Looks like he used the grass to hide them.
Land mines.
Holy crap...
It's Paxton Petty.
He did this before in the early '60s.
"In the past, there were multiple occasions."
He's not finished yet.
So you know this case?
Three bombs went off.
"He claimed there was a fourth, but it was never found."
Politics took care of that.
Same goes for flags.
He doesn't even weave them.
"Still, he designs them."
"He's part of the process as geopolitics, seamtresses."
"No more, no less."
So artists are vessels?
He asked me to be his assistant.
- Doing it?
- I don't know.
It's a tough decision.
Afghanistan is far.
Make it to Nepal?
Kabul was the end of that trip.
We had to get back.
Why?
Is it a secret?
"I brought my drawings... to the editors of ""Parapluie. """
"They have a band called ""Fille Qui Mousse""."
They want collages for their light show.
Waste of time.
Isn't there better to do?
Like what?
Like your paintings.
"You're starting out, like me."
You have progress to make.
I don't have much time.
I prefer to draw.
You're wrong.
I preferred your paintings.
Will you show them to me?
I'd rather not.
"Die, asshole."
"Oh, Ilia, that feels good."
Then I'll make you feel even better.
"Ilia, can't we have sex today?"
You know it's against the rules.
"If we do it, I'd be fired."
Then I wouldn't be able to see you anymore.
"I don't want that, but..."
Are you ready?
I'm ready.
Feel good?
Feel good?
Feel good?
I'm gonna come!
"Come, I'm coming too!"
I'm coming!
Ilia.
It's perfume.
I hope you like it.
"I've been with lots of delivery girls, but no one's been as genuine as you."
Service tells you a lot about a girl.
"If you don't mind, will you go out with me?"
I'm sorry.
Of course...
"I'm an idiot, what was I thinking?"
I'm going home to Korea.
I can't take this.
"No, please take it."
"It's my first gift to a girl, ever."
"I talked with the clerk, wondering what you'd like."
"That itself was fun, my heart was bouncing."
My heart was bouncing.
Thank you...
for your help.
Your dinner is getting cold.
"I know you're not very happy with me right now, but I am only looking out for your best interests."
I made that noodle casserole you like so much.
"Oh, Amanda."
"Hey, hon?"
Where the hell are they?
"This could be the biggest move you bust all night, so we just wanna make sure you have it down."
Meet her at the door.
Compliment her.
Walk her over to the table.
Offer her a seat.
Yes.
Care to demonstrate?
Would you like a seat?
No.
"No, no."
You have to pull the chair out for her.
Oh.
And then just slip it underneath her as she sits.
Not too fast or you'll take her out at the knees.
Right.
Not too fast.
Why am I even worried?
You'll be fine.
Does it look okay?
?
I love this.
"The lights, the table, everything."
And the window in my room.
How'd you even get the idea for that?
Sarah and Tommy and Kevin.
- But understand...
- Justin and Kitty?
- They don't know.
"- Oh, God."
I didn't want this to be like the affair.
"I didn't want it to fester under the surface, haunting us."
Come on.
"- Oh, my God."
- What?
Where are you going?
- What are you doing?
- To find Kitty and Justin.
- Wait.
Please.
- No.
"There will be no more lies, Saul."
No more.
I won't stand for it.
"Nora, wait."
Are you sure?
How do we know Holly's telling the truth?
"As much as I'd like to, I don't think we can ignore the obvious."
"So, what are we supposed to say?"
"""Wow, we have a sister now""?"
"Justin, you don't have to say or do anything you don't want to."
This is just going to take time for us all.
So what?
Dad made Holly a beneficiary of the land because of Rebecca?
I don't know.
But I suspect that's part of it.
- Did he know that he was her father?
- What?
- Where am I?
With me.
In my world.
What do you mean?
How could you bring me here?
I asked...
But you didn't reply.
"Obviously, I was drunk, right?"
Just a second.
What did you mix in my drink?
It took me 25 years to find you.
What?
What if I tell you that we've met before?
What if I tell you there was a time when we loved each other like crazy?
And then someone separated us.
What would you say to that?
Then I'd say that you have gone crazy and you need help.
No.
No.
I am not crazy.
Doctors too used to say the same.
They were treating me.
They were trying to erase the image from my mind.
But how could I forget you?
I found you.
All the questions became meaningless.
My existence is for you.
- This is what the universe wants.
- Just leave me.
Let me go.
"- Wait Saira, wait!"
"I ought to pay your fee, oughtn't I?"
I haven't presented you with a bill yet.
How about this to begin with?
Not that it's enough.
It's fine.
It's fine.
It's much more than most people pay.
It doesn't seem near enough to me.
"Harry, listen..."
"Oh, sorry."
"Come along, will you?"
It's getting late.
Well...
But...
But you aren't really going just because he says?
"No, no, no."
But I have to go now.
But look here.
Don't you understand?
I ain't no...
I ain't no...
"No, I know you're not."
You're a girl with her heart just where it ought to be.
Maybe a little too generous.
"Because you're a nice, pretty girl, next time be more careful about the company you pick, huh?"
"Well, but..."
"But you are here, ain't you?"
"Yes, but I shouldn't be."
"And if you really knew me, you'd know I don't wanna be."
"Well, I..."
I picks only them as wants my company.
- I'm sorry.
"Thanks, Mum, but it's okay."
"No, really."
I want to go to McDonald's.
"You know, I'm not really hungry."
Come on.
Are you telling me you couldn't murder a Big Mac?
Mum!
"Okay, another time."
Any time.
"I'll be around a while, you know."
By the following Christmas things were back to normal.
Before you came...
Every man is an island.
And I stand by that.
"But clearly, some men are part of island chains."
Below the surface of the ocean they're actually connected.
"So you're going to marry my mum, then?"
Don't know.
Why?
You think she's up for it?
- I used to want him to marry my mum.
- You serious?
Yeah.
But that was when she was depressed and I was desperate.
"Thanks, mate."
Cheers.
How do you use this blender-thing?
You don't.
I used to think two wasn't enough.
Christ.
Now there were loads of people.
And that was great.
The dogs had got it!
One of the bitches had bitten off its head.
- Feathers were flying everywhere...
- Charles!
(VIOLENT COUGHING)
Now see what you've done!
What the devil's the matter with him?
He has trouble with his lungs.
Makes a misery of his life.
He should be bled.
We have an excellent physician.
He's developed a special variety of leeches.
"Painless, and they leave very little mark."
"Better yet, send in George to Monsieur Chopin."
She leaves no mark at all.
"Hungarian humour, George."
(CRASH)
- You are too familiar.
Apologise.
"- Sit down, you ass!"
- You think I don't know what's going on?
- She has made love with Monsieur Liszt?
Apologise or I'll rip your throat out!
Apologise!
- Agh!
Alfred!
- St George!
- What are you doing here?
- I'm the dragoon.
I was invited.
"Duchess, I've only just arrived."
Thank God I was in time to defend Madame Sand's honour.
"We just told you we,re not!"
Not unhappy at all?
"I mean, it,s not always easy, but -"
"So you,re not unhappy."
Sometimes.
What do I check?
"I don,t know."
"Put ,slightly unhappy, if you want."
"I don,t want anything."
"It,s up to you."
What do you want?
"She doesn,t know and neither do I!"
"Don,t check anything!"
Fine.
"Then we,re done."
"Good, we,re done."
"Let,s have a drink."
How about having a drink with us?
Lights!
Are you allowed during work hours?
"It,s not that."
"We,re way behind schedule."
Whatever you Iike.
Our door is always open.
Thanks.
Another time.
"Listen, we were wondering:"
How did you end up working here?
"- You think it,s weird?"
"- I,m not criticizing."
"It,s just... you dissect people, examine them, manipulate them."
"We don,t manipulate anyone."
Huge.
I'm the most wanted man on this planet.
Bounty hunters of all types are after me skin.
My face is plastered on wanted posters in every town on seven countries.
"Oh, yeah."
I'm infamous.
No.
I don't believe it.
Got it!
I think they're gone.
Are you sure?
"Aye, it's quiet."
Jump now!
- This might not work.
- Of course it works.
We're a lethal pair.
Behind you!
The arrow relies on the bow.
"The bow, on the arrow."
But they are not tied together.
"That would be pointless now, wouldn't it?"
Exactly.
"Together we are formidable but shackled, our power is pointless."
- We must be free.
"- Aye, free."
And we'll take them together!
Is that the best you can do?
I'd say we've wiped out our bounty-hunter problem.
- For now.
- Aye.
For now.
I was wrong about you.
I'm quitting right now.
"No, no."
You have the best job in New York.
Don't quit over this.
"- Don't buy all the hot dogs, OK?"
- I don't want to do this without you.
"Hey, I thought we cut the cat-lady sketch,"
We're two minutes short!
"So, let me introduce myself."
My name is Lurlene Katz.
And these are my cats.
She's using a real cat?
I cast that cat myself.
"Why, they are my..."
"No, no, no, he's OK!"
- I need you to talk for two minutes.
- About what?
- Anything.
- All right.
"These cats are more than just pets, sir."
Excuse me.
Where's the manager?
"I'm from the government, and I'm hereto inspect your chicken nuggets."
Look at Shorty.
This honky grandma be trippin'!
"What's up, America?"
I'm coming into your house live!
"Let me hear you say, ""We love you, Tracy!"""
"We love you, Tracy!"
I am the third heat!
He's brilliant.
- Are you drunk?
"- Oh, great, now I'm all nervous."
- Don't be.
No man would invite you on his motorcycle unless he's ready to make a commitment.
You expect me to believe that?
"No, but you made lying look like so much fun, I thought I'd give it a whack."
"So, um,"
I'm going upstairs to throw out all my booze and not eat these donuts.
"Yeah, it is fun."
Morning.
"Oh, my God, I got flowers."
They're on my desk and you assume they're for you?
"Oh, I'm so sorry."
They're for you.
Hmm...
I wonder who they're from.
I wasn't even going to ask.
I know how much you value your privacy.
It's not signed.
"It just says, ""Had a great time."""
- Molly.
- What?
Are you seeing someone?
Someone I don't know about?
How am I going to help you cover it up if I don't know what you're hiding?
I've got nothing to hide.
But let's not mention these to my father.
"Or anyone who might tell my father, like... him."
"- Hey, Alex."
"- Hey, Stephen."
Alex?
One second.
Um... oh.
"When I woke up, I was on the floor."
-And I don't know how it happened.
-You can't remember?
I passed out.
Just a game.
Jesus.
"Jesus, Jesus!"
Jesus God!
God!
"I don't know, and I don't understand why I can't remember."
"Doesn't matter, just do as I say."
Put in a call to your office.
Explain that you'll be there tomorrow.
You decided to spend the night at Michael Corleone's house in Tahoe.
-As his guest.
-I do remember that she was laughing.
"We'd done it before, and I know that I could not have hurt that girl."
This girl has no family.
Nobody knows that she worked here.
It'll be as though she never existed.
All that's left is our friendship.
-Yes?
"-Sorry, but we're not to let you through."
-I'm just going to the market.
-We'll pick up anything you want.
-Whose orders are these?
-Mr.
Hagen's.
He's coming.
I'll speak to him.
"I wanted to explain, but I had business in Carson City."
It's Michael's request for your safety.
I think he was probably just thrown out of the building.
He's got a lovely face.
"Well, he's quite stout, which I actually like."
"Oh, his name's Mr Baker."
I don't know what his Christian name is.
She's gone.
She gave me her hand cream.
She loves you!
"""A good name is rather to be chosen than great riches."""
"Genesis, 32, verse 28."
His name is James.
I imagine you would remember him as Jimmy.
Jimmy?
Jimmy Baker?
Tubby Baker is Jimmy Baker!
Of course he's Jimmy Baker!
The one that jumped down from the the day of the you don't know where he went?
Up there.
"Then I said, ""Catch him up"", so she's run out, looking for you."
Jimmy!
# Enid Sutcliffe come away Come away...

Why?
I guess there were some complaints that your eyes were more interesting to watch than the lead performance.
Ohh.
"I'm really sorry, honey."
"Oh, it stinks."
"(Sighs) Oh, my God."
I can't believe we're not in the play.
"Uh, yeah, well..."
That's not exactly true.
So we are doing the play?
"No, we're not."
So we're off the play.
"No, no."
That's not it.
So we're on the play.
- We're not.
- We're not?
Right.
We're not.
What?
Your mom's in.
You're out.
Just say it.
"Thank you, Mike."
I was getting there!
What?
"But you're gonna quit, right?"
"Well, quitting is certainly something that I could do, although I am the strongest voice of all the Ozians... (Sighs) And it is for charity, but if you really want me to quit, then I--"
I want you to quit.
"Okay, well, let's not jump into any rash decisions."
"Just sleep on it, and if you still want me to quit in the morning, I will."
I want you to quit.
"- Wait, do--"
"If anyone comes in, just act like you're working or something."
"Wait, mike."
"Mikey, where are you?"
"- Hey, what's up?"
"- Get over here, will you?"
I got too many irons.
"Go right over there, give the ceiling a pull, will you?"
Basic business principles went right down the drain on this thing.
You're fired!
Subtitles by Red Bee Media Ltd
Keep doing the exercises and take three of the supplements a day.
It really should help your back.
"Yeah, I'm gonna be back in the office today."
"Okay, great."
Bye.
You're going back to work?
"Well, we talked about this."
It's been a month.
You said you were ready.
But if...
"oh, no, no."
"Right, right."
You're right.
You're right.
You should go back to work.
"Hey, I put down the new rug."
"Oh, good."
Do you like it?
'Cause I can get something else.
It's fine.
"Ah, monsieur."
Vive la gloire.
Vive Napoleon.
"You know, I admire your Napoleon very much."
"This is Mr. DeSalle, our navigator..."
"Dr. McCoy, our medical officer,"
"Mr. Sulu, our helmsman, and Carl Jaeger, meteorologist."
"Welcome, good physicianer and honorable sir."
Is he kidding?
Und...
Officer Jaeger.
"Ein deutsch soldat, nein?"
"Ein, zwei, drei, wirgehen vermittels schiessgewehr."
"I'm a scientist, not a military man."
"Oh, come now."
We're all military men under the skin.
And how we do love our uniforms.
What an interesting weapon you've got there.
Do let me see it.
Oh... yes.
"Now, let me see."
How does this work?
"Ah, yes."
"This won't kill, and this will."
Oh.
"Oh, how marvelous!"
Devastating!
"Why, this could kill millions."
"Who will you start with, my crew?"
Are we your next targets?
"Oh, how absolutely typical of your species."
"You don't understand some things, so you become fearful."
No.
I'm here.
Guess Daddy doesn't love you after all.
We got the president.
Bring him on down.
"Back to your office, sir."
"I have John Cale on the line, sir."
Cale?
You put her on the goddamn phone right now.
"Hi, John."
They have the president.
"John, I want you to listen to me."
Help is not coming.
I said they have the president.
They called a strike on the White House.
The vice president is dead.
You need to get out.
They cannot do that.
"They still have hostages, they still have Emily."
"I'm so, so sorry."
I was wrong about you..
"but there's nothing you can do, John."
"If you stay, you're gonna die."
I need you to listen to me.
My little girl is counting on me..
and I am not gonna disappear on her.
So you tell me how much time I have.
You only have eight minutes left to get them out.
"Goodbye, Carol."
Clear out!
We're moving back now!
Everybody's gotta move back!
It opens up the room.
It can breathe.
Does it get you money?
You want it?
"Here, I'll give you the fucking money."
"If you want more, you can go down and tear some off the wall."
No.
I don't want your money.
I don't need it.
But I do need a door.
So I could close it behind me.
I thought you'd like it.
I do like it.
In some way I do like it.
It's dreary.
Of course.
"Arise, you wretched of the earth!"
"Arise, you wretched of the earth!"
"Arise, you prisoners of starvation!"
"Forjustice thunders condemnation,"
It is the eruption of the end!
Is this what you were thinking?
"- Okay, that's enough!"
You'll sing for me.
I'm not finished yet.
You're still singing for me.
- I have to ask Franz first.
You need written permission?
I'll think about it.
Don't take so long.
He found some chicks that aren't too bad either.
They're taller than you too.
He must've gotten the message.
Christine.
"Uh, I think the guy that you... you know, the other night when you and he... dirty."
All right.
I know.
"Just let him in, okay?"
I'll get this over with.
Thanks.
"Hey, lover."
Hey.
"Mmm, that was nice."
Yeah.
"So, have a seat."
Wow.
I haven't been in a gym in a long time.
Not since my wife left me for her trainer.
"It's okay, though."
It's been great for my daughter.
"She loves her new dad, and... she's in the best shape of her life."
"Look, uh, Stan... the other night, I was in a particularly vulnerable place, and, um, I think what happened between us was a little quick."
"Oh, I know."
Sorry again.
"Oh, no, no, no!"
I-I-I mean that I think we should go back to being friends.
"Yeah, but we were never friends."
"Well... maybe we should go back to being pre-friends, you know, like the way we were last week."
But we-we didn't know each other last week.
Perfect.
Are you breaking up with me?
In a gym?
I can't believe this is happening again!
"Stan, I'm so sorry, I really am."
[music continues]

* You're an angel

- Like it?
- You're amazing.
"Produce plays, direct, write songs, even sing them."
"Well, think of my an inspiration."
"Regan, where's Mr. Ganz?"
"He and Mr. Grady are in Atlantic City, Judge arranging for the opening."
"Don't worry, my pet."
If Chowsky won't rehearse you today
I shall have him discharged.
[whistling]
Can't you see I'm busy?
The Judge wants to talk to you.
And you were right.
The strudel was excellent.
"Damn, we should have grabbed a couple of those crescents to go."
Oh well.
"Jacob, what happened to me after my father died?"
"Honestly, I don't know."
You hated me.
You left Berlin and I left the business.
And we never spoke again?
"Oh, I'd phone, you wouldn't take my calls."
I have no idea where you went or what you did.
"Started a new life, thought I could leave the past behind."
"So much for that, huh?"
"We don't just ring the doorbell, right?"
"Look, why don't you, uh, stay here."
I'm gonna go look around.
(speaking German)
Marta.
Don't move.
Hi.
Hi.
How did you?
Dog seems to know you.
Maybe.
Do I live here?
It doesn't look familiar.
"Huh, no labels."
"Well, someone's got expensive taste."
"Men's clothing, no women's."
I must not live here.
Gotta be something to identify whoever does.
You definitely know whoever lives here.
I don't know.
But we can't go back.
I need to um see my guests.
Can we talk?
Always.
Is something wrong?
I know you have high aspirations for me
So in the spirit of full disclosure
There's something you need to know
Something that may... it may come out.
I'm intrigued.
Last summer...
I had an affair
With an older woman.
Oh my boy.
Welcome to washington.
She was married at the time.
Go on.
And she...
Well she paid me.
Well...
Whatever happens i'll protect you.
Let's hope it doesn't come out.
Yeah.
Have you seen your girlfriend?
- You don't know?
- What?
Blair and i broke up.
This party is not so hot.
There's a killer doughnut place around the corner.
Can you guys believe gossip girl?
"""the--the insider""?"
You done?
Go home.
Did I mention my development will double your property value?
"Nice try, kiddo."
- Hey.
- Hey.
Dad told me about the home.
That woman gives me the creeps.
She's like Darth Vader with lipstick.
She is with the dark side.
Clever we must be to defeat her.
"Oh, God."
Okay.
"So as was just clearly evidenced, your relative maturity level is about half mine most days."
"But seriously, if I have to say, ""No, we're just friends,"" one more time,"
I'm gonna totally drug you and dry shave your entire body.
- Wow!
"- Okay, maybe just your arms and legs."
Did you just ask me out?
"Okay, look, my dad is going to a Flyers game on Saturday."
"So, you know, he'll be gone most of the night."
You should come over.
Okay.
But I'm bringing Band-Aids and aloe vera just in case.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Later.
- Not sure we'll be able to stop the...
- Pass the sugar.
I know women.
- You already have too many shirts.
- Serious?
All right.
"Hey, I was right."
This is the living room.
This is where we live.
And this is the couch where much of the sitting takes place.
"Aren't you gonna show me the, uh, upstairs?"
"Yeah, boy, yeah, boy, yeah, boy."
The upstairs.
I love the upstairs.
"You know, we weren't even gonna have an upstairs, but I made 'em put it in because I knew you were coming."
"Nobody told me about this girl thing, Shawn."
"I mean, no one warned me."
I thought they were just there.
I didn't know they were interactive.
You'll get the hang of it.
Sure.
It's easy for you.
Your hair moves.
- There's other techniques.
- Like what?
I don't know.
I just do hair.
"Yeah, but where do I get my technique?"
Ask your brother.
He's got the boom.
You know what?
Let's just forget this whole subject.
There are a million other things to do in the world.
"I mean, we're too young to worry about finding mates."
- You're right.
See ya.
- Where are you going?
Hey!
Sam.
What's going on?
Divorce papers?
"Wait, Josh is asking for a divorce?"
"Not just a divorce, Erica."
He wants to wipe me out.
"Claire and Josh, separated at birth."
"He wants you to pay him $80,000?"
Yup.
Yup.
"Because, according to him, he ""put me through med school."""
That's ridiculous.
He didn't.
"You know, all of the signs were there, even from the beginning."
I--I just didn't even wanna see them.
Like what?
Like...
We just never talked--
"Never about anything important, never about how I felt."
"So, of course, after a while we become like strangers..."
It was like he had this made-up idea in his mind of who I was... and now here we are.
"You know what's really, really pathetic?"
"I just wanna run away from this whole thing,"
"So I go to Goblins like some desperate loser, looking for Kai."
Kai.
Really?
"And, uh, how was that?"
He wasn't there.
"He quit, actually."
What?
!
We'll get Toxie coming out of--
Who's Toxie?
He's not doing stunts or anything.
"No, no."
"We just-- we got to have some stuff with Toxie, man."
We can't wait around.
"It's been like five hours since his call time,"
"And he's still not here yet, you know."
--[inaudible] close-up when they were coming out
"Oh, is he here now?"
I see the van.
"That's our van, right?"
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
"I don't see him, though."
Let him see.
"We got our Toxie, right?"
Instill the fear of God into Toxie.
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
I think it's time to-
- I'm
Not too happy with this.
I'm happy to use this guy.
It's 10 o'clock.
This is ridiculous.
"We shot with the stand-in, who was inconspicuously"
"Tito's height, when Dave, our really Toxie,"
Is at least a foot taller.
"And he normally carries both of us, which is the humor in it."
He carries Tito and Sweetie Honey.
"It's kind of funny, 'Cause Dave's a strong guy,"
And he can do that.
"Ah, there you are, sir."
That was a board decision about an entire department.
Griff is one person who slipped.
- We're calling it a slip?
- Work is structure.
"It's a support system, Frank."
"- Employees, when they stumble, desperately need..."
"- Oh, now it's a stumble?"
I'm not running a rehab program.
"Relapse is inevitable, if that's what happened."
"Oh, that's what happened."
"Griff had one, two bad weeks."
"Before then, a year where he wasn't a problem."
"Hey, I warned him, Allen!"
Think about the stress that he was under
"- the explosion, the suicide..."
- It's still no.
- He just needs another chance.
"- Allen, stop!"
It's no.
One for the road?
- You hungry?
- I could eat.
I heard you got fired.
Yeah?
"Whatever,"
"I couldn't stand it there, to be honest."
Yeah.
My whole family works there.
- Nightmare.
- Total nightmare.
To freedom.
"So you and Zoe, huh?"
And I tell you what would cure them.
"Agood, old-fashioned trip to my ohio father's woodshed."
"- Right, Julie?"
"- Right, Dad."
That's what these bums need.
"Well, Kurt, thanks and congratulations."
"- Thank you, sir."
- Yeah.
Okay.
"Thanks, everybody."
Bye.

"[Newscaster] Less than 24 hours after president Nixon called them bums, fourstudents were shot dead at Kent State University in Ohio."
Enraged student groups across the country... are calling fora general strike tomorrowto shut down-
"I tellyou, the soldiers were provoked."
"Now, stop this pussyfooting around."
"I mean, dead kids."
Howthe hell did we give the Democrats a weapon like this?
"Well, one way orthe other, KentState is not good."
We have to getout in frontofthis thing.
- Followthe money.
Followthe money.
- [Haldeman] Sir?
"These kids are being manipulated by the Communists, like Chambers and Hiss."
- What's the matterwith you?
- This isn't'48.They'll never buy it.
"How do you knowthat, John?"
"What's Hooverfound, for God's sake?"
I've got to find a good accountant.
Hey!
I can buy a good accountant.
I can buy 20 good accountants!
I hit the jackpot!
Captain just won the lottery!
Hey.
"Next time you call me Captain, it's because you're on my boat!"
Yes!
"Oh, my goodness!"
I'm a rich man.
Everybody leaves.
- Look at this.
Natalie.
"Mr. Monk, I'm sorry."
I didn't know where else to go.
What happened?
Are you okay?
You haven't heard?
What?
What time is it?
5:00.
One minute after.
Turn on the news.
What...
What channel?
Any channel.
A major scandal involving the Gold Rush lottery.
"As we told you this morning, there were two winners in last night's jackpot giveaway."
"Eugene Maddox, a truck driver from Rockaway Township and Leland Stottlemeyer, a highly decorated officer with the San Francisco police."
"Now, according to the rules, these two men would split the $212 million grand prize."
"Mr. Maddox, what do you do for a living?"
- This thing is kinda peppy.
You got a turbo on this thing?
You fellas spread out.
What's going on?
I have no idea.
I want you guys to check down here.
I've noticed a lot of foot traffic down these stairs tonight.
Foot traffic?
There's been no foot traffic.
Let's go.
"""Involuntarily, I glanced seaward."
"""and distingued nothing,"
"""except the single green light."
"""Minute,"

"Probably ""my nute""."
"""My nute,"
"""and far away"
"""that might have been the end of the dock."
"""When I looked once more for Gatsby,"
"""he had vanished"
"""and I was alone again,"
"""in the unquiet darkness."""
What the hell is this?
It's like a... a literacy thing.
A literacy thing?
"Yes, many of these poor boys have trouble reading."
"Nice work, Beaver."
I can read.
You're doing a great job.
The ZBZ sisters have been helping them learn a little.
"Secret philantropy, if you will."
Yeah.
"I mean, no."
"No, things aren't weird, or no to the sex?"
- Maybe we should just...
- You're right.
"Just concentrate on Figgis, and we'll figure this out later."
"No, I was gonna say maybe we should talk, but yeah, it can wait till after Figgis."
Ah.
We have the rest of our lives to talk.
"Yeah, unless he kills us first."
What a weird joke.
Regret saying that one.
"Wow, things are clickin'."
I'm gonna go make sure there's enough balls in...
in the ball pit.
Yup.
Important to get on them balls.
What is wrong with me?
"So then Trevor sends me a text, and he's like,"
"""At this point, I hate you."""
"I'm like, ""Oh, really?"
"'Cause you didn't hate me last week."""
Trevor sounds like a dog.
Right?
"God, I missed our daily dishes."
Me too.
"I'm sorry I'm not reciprocating with ""hot goss"" of my own."
I'm just worried about the Nine-Nine.
"Sir, they're gonna be fine."
They're my squad.
I should be there with them.
This is killing me.
"- Well, that's..."
- l'll get my stuff.
Okay.
Should I?
Do we have...
You take a second.
You go ahead and eat.
I'm still trying to find where everything is in this house.
"Oh, congratulations, by the way."
Thank you.
"Have you guys set, or maybe you haven't..."
"- Oh, May 1 2th."
"- Well, that will be beautiful then."
Thank you.
"I need to get ready myself, actually."
"You don't need any more, do you, Jessie?"
"- Oh, no."
- Here you go.
"- Hey, you."
- l'll be down in a couple of minutes.
"Jess, you almost ready?"
"Yeah, I just have to get my things."
I can't get him to tell me what's going on.
- He's hiding something?
"- l think he's terrified, ashamed, and he doesn't want me to worry."
But he's not hiding something.
I don't know.
You're the one who thinks he's been a criminal the whole time.
- You said you didn't trust him.
- l didn't trust him emotionally.
You don't get sent to prison for that.
"Oh, God."
"- Oh, we must go and see them."
"No other news, ma'am."
All gossip.
"Oh, there was one piece of news..."
Mr Ferrars is married.
"Who told you that Mr Ferrars was married, Tom?"
"I seen Mr Ferrars myself, ma'am."
"This morning in Exeter, and his lady too, Miss Lucy Steele as was."
"Oh, Miss Lucy Steele?"
"Yes, ma'am."
They was at the door of the New London Inn.
"I took my hat off, and she knew me."
"Bade me give her best compliments, and Mr Ferrars' as well, to you all."
That is Lucy Steele.
- But did she tell you they were married?
"- Yes, ma'am."
I made free to wish her joy.
"Mr Ferrars was in the carriage, but he just looked out the other window."
- And well he might.
- They were going to her folk in Plymouth.
Miss Lucy seemed vastly pleased.
"Well, I..."
I'll put that lot away.
"Oh, poor Elinor."
"Oh, I cannot bear this."
"And I too, my child."
Through all her troubles I never thought of you once.
We all knew they were to be married.
Marianne had all my tenderness.
"I never thought once that you suffered as much, but unlike her were brave."
E-Excuse me.
I had better make sure that Colonel Brandon's room is ready.
"Tío Eduardo, I hear you make a great coffee."
"Well, as a matter of fact, I do, Miss..."
- Santanico.
"- Ah, Santanico Pandemonium."
"That's right, you told me."
Santanico Pandemonium.
- Would you care for a cup?
- Please.
- [coffee pouring] - [Eddie] Santanico.
Where do I know that name from?
"[Santanico] Oh, I used to be in a famous show in Mexico."
And now you wanna kill the CEO of the Browns.
"- Jesus, Eddie."
- Take it easy.
It ain't my lingo.
"Amancio Malvado, the head of the ""Browns,"" as you call him, he deserves to die."
Mm.
"Whatever you say, San..."
That's where I know you from.
"Jesus Christ, you... you got the same name as that chick in that famous Mexican horror flick."
I even got a copy.
You're gonna love it.
What are you doin' over there?
- What?
- What are you doin'?
"Nothing, I'm just lookin', uh, lookin' for a place to put those tapes."
- What's this?
This ain't mine.
- It's nothin'.
"You little shit, you were gonna switch the cases!"
"All right, who are you, sweetheart?"
"- [Richie] Eddie, put that down."
Stop!
It's none of your business!
You'll get hurt!
I told you!
You'll get hurt.
You traitors mixed the two factions.
"No, we haven't."
"Actually, they're the same style."
"Yes, you just haven't realized it."
Kung-fu is no fixed motion!
It's endless!
Go!
Stop!
Stand back!
They're geniuses to have mixed the two factions.
I must kill the two traitors!
"Brother, they set a good example."
We shouldn't kill them.
Fung-wu's master and Jun-kit's sister were killed by us so that we could learn their styles.
"They taught us, so they're our masters now."
Release them!
- Brother!
- Your Highness!
- He's a monk now!
- He's a monk now!
Master!
"Yan-ling, behave like a girl!"
"Master, I wish to go to the restaurant with you."
Go then!
What are you talking about?
Nothing!
What did you say?
Vomit!
I am telling you to turn down the car.
Which one?
This one or that one?
"I am sick of his question answers,"
How are you?
"Give me two batteries, Which ones, Big, Medium or small?"
Remote batteries?
Which remote batteries?
"VCD, DVD or TV, To explode a bomb remote's battery."
Khade chand!
Yes!
Madam!
"Did you hear, what I hear?"
"I've seen it photo, today this diamond is mine, Papa"
"One, Two, Three."
"And say one, two, three."
"It exploded, papa?"
It didn't explode!
It didn't explode!
It didn't explode!
It didn't explode!
Since morning you have been humiliating me!
You humiliated me in the car!
You've humiliated me a lot.
You humiliated me in front of these girls!
I will..
Hey!
Rangeela's Jackie Shroff!
Quiet!
You are beating me in front of everybody.
What can I do if the battery is not functioning!
But I want you to know that I love you very much.
You want to stop filming yourself and help me with these many items I'm carrying?
"Sorry, I was making a video for my son."
"You know, in case I never see him again."
Do you not do that for your kids?
Of course I do.
I make those kind of videos all the time.
"You know, in fact, I was about to do one right now."
"Hey... hey, girls."
"It's me, Daddy."
"If you're seeing this, I'm dead."
But I want you to know that I love you now and forever.
"Okay, time for a lullaby, sung in your native Latvian."
Ligo!
Ligo!
Ligo!
"Yeah, yeah, lullaby time."
Look.
"Go to sleep, Daddy's dead"
But his ghost's always watching
What the hell are you guys doing?
Good call.
Blocking the door.
"Keep it up, smorty-pants."
- Oh...
- Uh...
Mwah.
"One of our classic forehead smooches, just like I planned."
- This is weird.
- Should we have sex?
- What?
- Huh?
- Yes.
- You must be working part-time.
- Yeah.
Would you like some stew before you go?
I'm buying.
Hey...
How much could you make?
Hey!
How much do you make right now?
"- 6,030 won."
"- 6,030 won."
Please eat.
"But, you said... he was going around bragging about stabbing a man?"
"Oh, I think that was a lie."
But I think it's someone Han Gyul knows.
"It's Han Gyul, the kid that I fought last time?"
Not fought.
The one who beat you up.
"Hey, I didn't get beat up."
I fought...
I fought...
- Let's just say that then.
- Let's just say that.
But the suspect that Detective Im saw wasn't a young kid.
"He said that there were two men, in their late 30s."
Yes... yes.
So... you're saying that there's a young kid involved too?
"Then, Chan Gyu."
It could be... that Park Seon Woo committed this crime in two parts.
One stabbed him first.
Then the guys cleaned up after.
"And anyway, since it's true that he held that knife..."
- That's enough.
- I thought you quit smoking.
- The gum didn't work.
Who's she?
- That's my new partner.
- Not bad.
- You didn't know about that?
"- No, why should I?"
Coming back to the force?
See what you're missing?
Tommy!
- You want to get some dinner?
- What did I say?
- I just invited him to dinner.
- Go up there!
- He hasn't changed a bit.
"- Yeah, that's the problem."
- What do you know?
- We just fished out the body.
Don't play games with me.
I want to know what you know.
You don't want to hear it.
It's the same guy.
- The same guy?
As in Polish Hill?
- Fair hair.
Good bodies.
"These women were shot, not strangled."
They had neck bruises and were bound wrist and ankle.
- Eiler told me you know this girl.
- A lot of guys knew her.
"If I didn't know better, I'd think you didn't want to solve this case."
"You know, ever since I was 16, I crushed exams."
I took on extracurriculars.
I showed up early.
I even sat up at the front and I stayed late.
"Man, I gave up everything."
"You know, I gave up fun."
I gave up sex.
I don't think you gave up sex.
- Okay.
Maybe not sex.
"- Yeah, you didn't give up sex."
"All right, all right."
"Not sex, but..."
It just annoys me that the one thing that is stopping me from going to Harvard Med is money.
"You know, tuition fees and living expenses alone cost over $300,000."
"$300,000."
It's outrageous.
It's astronomically high.
I get that.
"You know, I just thought there was more to life than just money."
"Well, look at the bright side,"
I just saved a bunch of money on my car insurance.
Thank you.
"- Happy birthday, honey."
"- Thanks, Mom."
"Thank you, love."
Kisses.
Make a wish.
- Make a wish.
- Okay.
Bravo.
"Congratulations, Benjamin."
"No, we gotta have a Negro."
This guy right here.
"Negro, front row."
"- Mr. Nixon, sir."
- Yeah.
We-We all knowthatyou have builtyour career... on smearing people as Communists.
"And nowyou are building your campaign on the divisions in this country, stirring up hatred and turning people against each other."
Whatthe fuck's he doing?
He's making a speech!
- Cut him off.
- I can't.
This isn't Russia.
He sounds like a negro.
He's saying all these negro things!
- What's he doing?
- He sounded white when we screened him.
He doesn'tsound white now.
He sounds like Angela Davis.
When are you going to tell us whatyou really stand for?
- Puton a commercial.
- There are no commercials.
- Go to commercial!
"- You boughtthe whole half hour, baby."
- Are you going to take offthat mask...
- Shit!
And show us who you really are?
- [Man] Shut up and sit down.
I - okay.
Okay.
"- It's a high hard one, Chief."
"- Okay, okay."
- Park it.
"Thank you, Bobby."
- You working for us tonight?
- I'm filling in for Sweet.
- I guess she's starting to show.
- What do you know?
- What's new?
- Nothing much.
Same as usual.
"You not working at The Vanya, anymore?"
There's been shootings in the bar.
I'm happy not to be working there.
It's way too intense.
That's Disciples turf.
What's going on over there?
There's an American crew moving in.
Trying to shove out the Disciples and grab the street game.
"- American crew, huh?"
- That's what I heard.
- See you later.
I'll buy you a drink.
- For sure.
I saw the news about the shooting in Seattle.
It's so crazy in the States with the guns and everything.
I know.
I'll talk to you later.
I wanna know if you've talked to this guy.
Is he still in town?
I'm supposed to be meeting him any time.
"I wanna know who he is, who he's working for and what his plan is."
"This is happening now, so I'm gonna talk to you later."
It's Rene.
What happened with Reardon the other night?
Didn't you get my letter?
Yes.
Your message was clear indeed...
between the lines.
- I will defend my position.
"- Oh, balls!"
You're not in the army any more.
"You had an affair, not a pitched battle."
"Oh, Mallefille."
Poor boy.
It won't hurt for long.
- I know it must seem unfair.
- George.
- You promised to love me.
- I didn't promise to succeed.
- Whom did you come here to meet?
- No-one.
Help me off with my boots.
He should write his epitaph because I'm going to kill him!
Your rival is imaginary!
"If you're not going to help, go and find somewhere to sleep and leave me!"
"Make that two epitaphs, because I'll kill you if I find..."
"Oh, my God, you're hurt!"
You're bleeding.
Yes.
Be a dear.
Ask Ursula if she's got something for a bandage.
Of course.
Don't move.
No.
(LOCK CLICKS)
Bastard!
I like her.
"I like her, too."
She likes me.
I guess you didn't have your eyes peeled.
It was me she was flipping her frills and furbelows at.
"Just a minute, jim- here, here... if the lady comes up, i go backstage."
"If the eagle shines, the pass-through's all yours."
All right.
Uh- let me flip it.
Where did it go?
"I don't know, but you better hurry and find it."
The show's over.
She'll be going out with someone else.
"Nick, you go back to her dressing room and ask her if she'll go to a lobster party."
"Soon as i find this lucky piece, i'll join you."
Luke?
Yeah.
You go over to the astor house and reserve the best table in the place.
Yeah.
And send somebody here with a lantern.
Idiot!
Imbecile!
"You want to be an actress, eh?"
"Well, here is good luck!"
I've had just about enough of this!
Someone is at the door!
See who it is!
Yes?
"Oh, good evening, mademoiselle."
I see my flowers have arrived.
"Oh, you are mr."
Fisk.

"Three praccys a week in Senior-A whale shit, buddy."
Half these guys wheel their fuckin' bags into the rink.
The day I fuckin' wheel my bag into the rink is the day I stop playing hockey.
"A-fuckin'-men, buddy."
"Why do we even praccy, buddy?"
Should be rippin' sandos.

"- Just tossing' rocket sauce straight into the blades, boys."
I don't even know what a tape-to-taper is anymore.
"Not sure what a tape-to-taper is anymore, buddy."
"- Fuck tape-to-tapers, buddy."
- Fuck tapers.
I fired a point-blank clap bomb directly into Barts's chest tonight.
Fired a point-blank point bomb straight in Yorkie's junk.
And what if it does?
That means you're in contact with God or the Angel of Death.
Who are you in contact with?
We can't stay here like this.
Who's to say that within a week... I have a feeling it'll happen in the next three days.
You keep repeating the same thing!
"Look, Keyvan, you know what?"
Give me three days.
Just three.
Perhaps it will happen.
- And what if it doesn't?
- let's say it will.
We're wasting time.
Can't you plan things?
Plan things?
"No, I can't do that."
We say the same thing.
"If you can't do it, who can?"
Only God can.
"If it happens, we shoot our report and return to Tehran."
All right.
We just need to know what to do.
Say it takes three months...
- Behzad.
- Yes.
I've brought you bread.
Put it over there.
"Listen, kid, can't you hold your tongue?"
I can.
Who told you to talk about her son leaving?
I can't lie.
It's not a matter of lying.
What?
No.
Don't ask that.
Please.
Henry.
Keeping our business alive...
..that will be... keeping us alive.
Thank you.
You are the best thing... that ever happened... ..in my life.
"Oh, Henry."
Edie.
"""The stream will cease to flow."
"""The wind will cease to blow."
"""The clouds will cease to fleet."
"""The heart will cease to beat."
"""For all things must die."""
Henry chose hemlock.
He wanted to say a proper goodbye to Edie.
"Come on, Sid, we've got a competition to win for Edie."
The flower show!
I forgot all about that.
Lady Felicia?
"Yes, Mrs M?"
I was wondering if you might like one or two suggestions from me as to which flowers might catch Father Brown's eye?
I thought you wanted to win the trophy for yourself?
"Yes, well, I've had a change of heart."
Thank you.
The winner!
For Edie Lee.
The grower of the best flowers in the whole of the Cotswolds!
"And next Monday,"
I will be hiring Edie as the florist for the Websters' wedding.
- Never heard of her.
- You will.
She's in trouble.
Impossible.
It must be a mistake.
(Sighs)
A bomb...
"Yes, a bomb would do it."
"A bomb would blow him and his records and the barge to kingdom come, yet it wouldn't hurt anyone else."
Yes.
But where do we get a bomb from?
"Well, if you only want a little one you'd have to go to Ireland."
Honestly!
"Bomb, indeed."
Get the whole mad idea out of your head.
Ireland...
That's it!
(Irish accent) Ireland!
You remember that old villain at the Dublin show.
He was still at it.
Get me a sprig of that stuff they wear in the buttonhole.
What is it?
- Shillelagh.
"- No, shamrock, you twit."
"And book me on the first plane to Dublin in the morning, right?"
(Sniffles and sneezes)
Henry?
Henry?
Please don't ask any more questions about that storm.
An orphan of the storm has just arrived.
- What?
- Your girl.
- You got it.
We picked up a paramedic call.
What happened?
- He saved my brother.
He's a doctor.
"- Here, let's roll on this."
We're at the scene of an incredible rescue.
It appears that a doctor has saved a little boy from drowning.
"We got it, doc."
Call Mercy.
- Mercy's not a Level 1trauma center.
- It's the nearest treatment facility.
This boy needs a surgeon.
Probably an ICU.
We gotta follow station protocol.
- What's your transport time?
"- In this weather, maybe 12 minutes."
- Where's your pilot?
"- Hey, Jimmy!"
Over here!
"- Sorry, doc."
We got to move.
"- Wait, wait."
We're losing time.
- What's your flight time to County ER?
-15 minutes.
- Will you take us?
- We're not medically equipped.
"- He's hypothermic, needs special care."
- Mercy is closer.
- Then he dies because there's no ICU.
- Or else he dies in a news chopper.
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
"Oh, it's you."
Yes.
What is it?
"I'm supposed to command a ""human"" team."
"Even if you aren't human anymore, do you still crave a man at night?"
Has the new commander arrived at his post?
We transferred him from SAS.
He seems capable.
"May God and Her Majesty, the Queen, bless you."
- Amen.
- Amen.
"Walter, what is this about?"
"You've made Hamchunk's ""A"" Club."
You funny!
You not.
This is Hamchunk.
He's become a permanent fixture here.
He's an orphan.
Lived with some missionaries about 10 clicks south of here till they were assassinated.
Maybe you could use an interpreter.
- Missionaries taught him English.
- I don't want an interpreter.
You number one.
I choose you.
I don't want to be chosen.
- I don't think you have much choice.
"- Choice, Mr. Hobson?"
I haven't had a choice since I was selected for this outfit.
but I was part of something.
I belonged.
I was treated like a grown-up.
Tell him 519.
Every day I was learning to score.
a dollar there.
I was living in a fantasy.
Did you have a good day at school?
My father was always pissed off.
he was pissed that my kid brother Michael wasinawheelchair.
He was pissed that there were seven of us living in such a tiny house.
Tell me what's this.
It's a letter from school.
It says you haven't been there in months.
In months!
You're a bum!
Want to grow up to be a bum?
he was mostly pissed because I hung around the cabstand.
He knew what went on there.
I didn't care.
The way I saw it everybodytakesabeatingsometime.
I can't make any more deliveries.
What?
You'll fuck everything up.
My dad says he'll kill me.
Look.
Come with me.
Is that him there?
No.
How about him?
No.
That's the guy Get him.
So Maurice isn't Jewish?
I don't know.
"I said to him, ""What do you care?"
"""I'm not asking you to pray on Yom Kippur,"
"""just say you're Jewish even if you aren't."""
But he refused.
Next year in Jerusalem.
Bye.
Where is he now?
He lives in the Le Panier district.
"Don't ask me where, he didn't say-."
"But there's a woman he took care of, maybe his mother or sister-."
We sent food there sometimes.
I can give you the address.
- Are you sure this is the address?
- I'm positive.
Now what?
There's no mother and no grandmother!
"This is Le Panier, right?"
You want to wander around aimlessly?
- Why not?
- We don't even have an address.
So what do you suggest?
- Why don't you check the phone book?
"- We did, when you were asleep."
Then look again.
I'm going to look around.
And ask people if they're Maurice Leon?
- Knock on their doors?
"- Yeah, okay?"
Why didn't Mom tell us anything?
"Get down from there, it's dangerous."
We'll make you a winner right here.
"You're not a New Yorker, are you?"
"Ferriday, Louisiana."
Huey Long country.
"""Every man a king,"" but no one wears a crown."
I love this guy.
Thank you so much.
Lovely evening.
"Kevin, give me a call in the morning."
I need some stuff for the New York Times.
An editorial lauding our choice of convention city.
The President loves a good Times editorial.
- Let me assure you...
- The vote's in.
We got it.
Let them catch their shuttle.
I'm sure they're running late.
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.
"MacNeil-Lehrer, Friday night."
Zapatti's bullet killed the child.
It wasn't the cop.
That's it!
That's what passes for good news these days.
I'll take it.
I saw Tino Zapatti's probation report.
"Exemplary, but an odd thing:"
It's front-loaded.
- With who?
- With supervisory personnel.
But it's signed off on by an honest judge.
- Judge Walter Stern?
"Nothing can be done now, Kaabir."
I belong to him.
But Saiba belongs to me.
Maybe in another life.
Maybe this was destiny.
Father has asked me to get Jilaan's head.
Then take mine along as well.
My heart shall always beat with Saiba's name.
Have you ever heard your name in that Muraaki's heart?
"Muraakis only have courage, they don't have a heart."
Jilaan is a Muraaki.
He has as many wives as the wars he has won.
He must have done this hundreds of times.
He must be having hundred more Saibas.
- I have only one.
- Jilaan loves only me.
Is Saiba happy?
Then I shall learn to live.
Only Paathar will feel lonely.
"Don't forget me, Saiba."
[PRAYER]
Jilaan-Saiba.
Celestial lovers.
Muraaki!
Muraaki!
I am no ordinary thing.
Then what are you?
"I am something you should forever and forever, keep with you."
Isn't one forever enough?
No.
For you it will be another victory tomorrow.
You are my victory.
I don't know lt was a kind of illness
Even when he was a child?
- Was he unhappy?
- Yes
"When he died, did he know I was going to be born?"
Yes
Do you think it was my fault?
I know it wasn't
Come here
He was very happy when he heard I was pregnant lf he comes back can we ask him why he died?
"Yes, maybe"
Come with me
- Anyone here?
- Yeah
This place looks like a bomb site
What happened?
This morning the bastards took all my food
- And since you're doing nothing...
"- Yeah, OK"
- Were there many of them?
- l don't know
Have you ever seen him?
I didn't see anyone
Does he look familiar?
He looks like Toni's brother
Do you know him?
Sort of.
He's a nutter
He used to live above the dam
But I mean that was ten years ago
- Thanks
- Stop by the station
"Addons When the plane will collapse and headquarters of the ""all2gethr. com""."
Addons We will die all know ... together with who was in the building.
This can not be true.
It's a joke.
You must be a joke.
"Listen to me, stupid."
The joke is over now.
Addons
- Must ...
"- Conversely, Dave"
Addons I started a joke now!
Addons Are we having fun yet?
.
"- Max, please, listen ..."
- Leave me alone ..
Please!
Do not harm my child.
Addons

- No one can save you now.
Addons But you have the opportunity to let you rescue his daughter.

What have I done?
Thi told what to do?
Please know that I can not tell you.
I've never once thought of you as a monster!
Then why didn't you tell me about your family?
!
I hear your family was murdered by a Methuselah.
And that you dirtied your own hands exacting revenge on him!
It's not like that!
That was-
That was...
"Back then, I..."
So it's true...
Your Lordship...
Your Lordship!
Your Lordship!
How did things turn out this way?
Your Lordship!
Your Lordship!
What do I do?
Your Lordship!
Your Lordship!
Is that-
Your-
What a dilemma.
I never expected you to come all the way out here...
"Stay quiet, okay?"
I'll let go.
Seth-chan!
"What on earth are you doing, dressed like that?"
!
Shh!
This is the Moldova family mausoleum.
The Duchess of Moldova's funeral is about to take place.
In the presence of the empress.
- If you need anything else...
Yeah.
"Actually, um, is there any reason why people would be uncomfortable with me being here?"
No reason.
It's great.
But I'm swamped.
I should go.
"No, no, please."
"Really, I feel like I have spinach in my teeth and nobody is telling me."
We all just really care about the senator.
"Personally, I think you make a really cute couple."
Couple!
C...
Couple?
No.
"No, no, no, no, no."
We are...
That...
No.
There's no couple.
I'm just part of his communications staff.
- There's no coupling.
- I get it.
You want to keep it on the down low.
I don't want to keep it on the down or the low.
I don't want to keep it anywhere.
There's nothing to keep anyway.
- I arranged for you to go to his ranch.
- For the day.
For the day.
It was one day.
It turned into just a couple of hours.
-Think so?
-What happened to Tino Zapatti?
"-He's dead, isn't he?"
I'm talking about two years ago.
He got probation.
What sentence did you recommend?
Ten to 20.
I saw the rap sheet.
Tino was pushing drugs to kids.
"Not doing it himself, but having kids deal for him."
Weapon from a previous homicide?
Disappeared in the second report.
Who ordered it?
That I don't know.
Why didn't you ask?
Sudden urge to move to the country.
I forgot about it.
Now if you'll excuse me...
... you'dbettergetout ofhere .
My lumbago tells me that snow is coming.
You better hurry.
Buffalo gets socked in pretty fast.
Thank you for your time.
Watch your step. lt's slippery.
Thank you.
-How long?
-About an hour.
You don't want to suffocate in a tunnel.
They got to dig one out ahead.
"Meanwhile, enjoy the snow."
We can't eat snow.
-Try that diner over there.
"Sir, it's a powderforfireworks."
My nerves come from coffee.
How much do you drink?
"WhereverI deIivermaiI, they offer me some, by evening I'm a wreck."
"If it's just coffee, that's easy."
Everything can be fixed.
Except thatjerk's motorbike.
- Want to shoot some fireworks?
- Can I?
"No, that's dangerous, these here, at most."
"This is called crackling Fuse, the otheris called a sparkler, hold it like this..."
I'II come with you.
We can't ride double.
You have to Iearn to say no.
- But I'II drive.
- Do you know how?
I'm the Director!
How do you start it up?
Mr. Matarazzo.
hello.
- I'm the new director.
- It's kind of you to come.
- Let me offeryou coffee.
"- No thank you, we have to go."
I open my home and you refuse my coffee?
"Thank you, we don't drink coffee."
Some fruitjuice then.
This fruitjuice will give you new life.
Are you sure we can drink it?
- It's not coffee.
- You're sure?
Fruitjuice.
Come on.
We do all right.
Love In The Afternoon.
Eh?
"Well, it'll be a big photograph of the choir and the Halle."
"And will we be allowed to, like, buy one?"
We will.
"Did they say how much that photo's going to be, Mr Kirkby?"
"It's got to be four or five bob, hasn't it?"
A big cardboard job.
"Well, I wanted to get one for Mam."
She'll have your school photo.
"No, she didn't get it."
"See you Saturday, Mr Kirkby."
Oi!
Eccles cake.
The labourer is worthy of his hire.
"Thanks, sir."
Bye!
And...
How come?
Mr Kirkby give it me.
"For carrying all his hymn books, because you know he's religious, so he has to carry hymn books, but he can't because of his leg."
Carry them.
"If I only had one leg, I'd put a wheel where my leg was."
"Would you, Mam?"
Put a wheel where your leg was?
I'd put a motorbike.
Get me to work quicker.
# My Christian name is Enid
# My mother is to blame
# She wanted something nondescript
Good.
I'm sorry.
"- No, no."
We're about to get started.
Have a seat.
Please.
So we can get out of here.
"Anna and everyone, we are required to be here on time."
We have a lot of work to do and it's not fair to the others if we're late.
"Yes, it won't happen again."
I'm sorry.
Okay.
I thought it might be helpful today if we watch the confession again.
Why?
And I don't know how it happened.
I don't.
"Danny, come into my office, please."
I heard about what happened last night.
That was crazy.
Must've been a horrible thing to discover.
First time I've seen a dead body.
It was shocking.
I bet.
I bet.
Did the police give you any trouble?
"Because if they did, I can take care of it."
You know I've got you covered.
"Thank you, Henry."
"No, I think I'm good."
She'd been dead for a couple of hours.
Ruled me out as a suspect.
"And she had a history of abuse, so they're pretty confident it was an OD."
Yeah!
Snow day means a full day of snuggle time with mama!
- Yeah!
- Get in here!
Get it!
"I'm so happy, I don't have the will to fight her off!"

"It was snow day, 1980-something, and my sister was seizing the day... by sleeping through it."
Aah!
"- Oh, good."
You're finally up.
- God!
What the hell?
!
"Someone was snoring the day away, lazybones."
"Mom, today is a day that's been gifted to me by the universe."
Please don't ruin it by being you.
"You only have one more college essay left to write, and then you're done."
That has nothing to do with snow day.
Of course it does.
"You're physically trapped in the house with me, and all the roads and stores are closed."
Yay!
Let's get you into Penn State.
No!
Put away the word processor.
I am not writing my college essay.
"Listen, kalaya's mother, she was a prostitute."
Your sister?
Yeah.
She has a bunch of kids.
She try to get them out of Thailand.
She doesn't care how it happen.
So she sells them to drug dealers.
This isn't the first time something like this happen.
Can I see her?
Kalaya?
Kalaya?
Hey!
Kalaya?
Kalaya?
I need an ambulance.
Someone stole my palm pilot.
"Oh, well, welcome to the club."
Jake left his wallet in his suit coat.
300 bucks.
"Yeah, and one of the secretaries is missing her disc player."
"Can you excuse us for a second, Jake?"
You bet.
You gonna talk to Liz about this?
About what?
Jeremy.
Are you serious?
He was out there the whole time.
"Well, even if it's true, I'm not gonna call his mother and accuse her only child of stealing from us."
Agnes:
They found 4 small balloons of heroin in her stomach.
One of them leaked.
She gonna be ok?
You didn't go.
-You did the right thing.
"-No, I didn't!"
He had no business there without a ghost.
That should have been me plus backups.
But Eddie was such a hothead... .
I mean...
... thekindthatnevercoolsoff.
What do you want to tell me?
There was another probation report.
This one...
"... itsetTinoupforthemax, 1 0 to 20."
What happened to it?
I don't know.
Who wrote it?
That's all I got.
The probation officer... .
Name?
James Wakeley.
You won't find him on Leonard Street.
Where is he?
"Upstate, working parole."
I told you not to come up here.
You made a long trip for nothing.
Do you want to tell me the truth now or under oath?
"You looking to grow brass balls, miss?"
I'm doing well without them.
"Do you want a subpoena, or may we continue?"
What brought you here from Leonard Street?
New York State parole officer.
Better pay and pension.
-Nicer surroundings.
"She was just a bit lazy, you know?"
My mother was beautiful and I didn't want her to let herself go.
- What did your father say?
"- Nothing, what could he say?"
- Is he dead?
"- Heavens, no."
He's living in Sweden.
"I guess, because..."
I haven't heard from him in ages.
- Doesn't he come to see you?
- No.
"He formed another family a long time ago, when he left my mother."
We're not in touch.
Why have you come to see me?
Well...
What's your problem?
Me?
None.
You must have one if you've come to see a psychiatrist.
"Loneliness, I guess."
Have you had sexual relations with a woman?
Or with a man?
No.
I'd like to see you next week.
Am I not well?
"No, it isn't that, but..."
Your adolescence was what we might call special.
- It wasn't that special.
- It was.
Very special.
"Well, whatever you say."
And we should analyze it more deeply.

What the hell happened?

"He was trying to protect everybody, and lance was just ...."
"I got the boy off to the town hospital, he's gonna be fine."
You have any I'd where these boys might have gone?
I don't know.
The detectives out there want you both to come at the station.
Are you kidding me Walter?
"My kids are out there, scared and alone, I'm not going to any of your dam station."
"When they find them, they're bringing them in."
What's he doing?
-He's just staring at me.
Let's go.
[Hangs up the gas pipe]
"Hyder, hey, stop."
Stop.
"Hey, Hyder."
"Stop, where are Wes and Jacob?"
Uh?
Where are they?
The beach.

"Hey, how long?"
Has to be about at least 30mn before it gets back over here.
"Okay, we'll be back."
Let's go.
You remember when mom used to take us here to wait?
We start over in Galveston.
Just like she wanted.

He found out about Grandpa by reading that telegram.
"But Father, you said..."

It was because I was stupid.
Hello.

They're adorable.
I'm so happy to meet you.
After August 9... let's all go... to Hawaii with Aunty.
My uncle...
Right here?
And this is... the monument built for the children who died on that day.
With these children... my uncle died.
Just where did it happen?
That's something we just can't find.
You can't find?
That day... the whole town was in flames.
And this place was filled with people who came here to try and escape from it.
But the school had also been burned.
The people were burned.
"Iron, everything."
These people are the classmates of the children who died here.
These people...
"Somehow, they scare me."
It's because... those are the people who witnessed the worst fear.
Go.
Move.
Come on.
They went this way.
You sure?

Come on.
"Please, can we stop and have some water real quick?"
All right.
One sip and then we go.
"Come on, come on, come on."
They stopped here.
"No, don't do that."
Molokai's rainforest's got pathogenic microbes in the water that'll put a man down in an hour.

Excuse me.
"Ah, no worries, Mr T."
Hey Dad!
Welcome to 'Lindsay dealing with her grief through partying'.
"Not your idea, I hope."
"Well, she said she was having a few friends over after her exams, but then this happened."
Right.
I might just go see how she's doing.
Tragic.
"You've got to shut this down and kick her out, Dad."
Probably not the best idea right now.
"Yes, she's lost her Mum, but clearly it's not causing her much distress right now."
"Eugh, of all the awkward times."
Do something.
Please?
"OK, I'll have a chat to her."
Hi George!
Hope you don't mind this little post exam blow-out.
It's so cool to see all my friends.
"It might have been a good idea to ask me first, Lyndsay."
"Yeah, I know."
But once word got out
I think people just wanted to show me some love.
You are dissatisfied because your life constrains you.
- You say it so plainly.
I'm ashamed to seem ungrateful for what I have.
But I just... want...
- You just want to be free.
- Exactly.
- Hmm.
- Thank you.
- Isabel!
- Roderick.
- My darling sister.
You are a sight for sore eyes.
How are you?
Have you settled in nicely?
- I have.
It's everything that we hoped it would be.
- And how is the famous doctor?
- The medication is helping already.
I...
I already feel much more at ease.
"- Uh, little bird?"
Where'd you go?
- I'm sorry.
"Dr. Cairn says it's a part of the healing process, the side effect as I adjust to the medication."
"- Well, perhaps some, uh, fresh air will help."
Would you like to take a walk?
Let's enjoy the beautiful gardens.
You lead the way.
Who are you?

"Oh, sweetie."
"You'll be fine, sweetheart."

"- Hey, it's me."
- Hello.
- Is she there?
Anna?
I'm coming over.
Please don't tell her.
"I know I'm being such a pain in the ass right now, but I had to come and see you."
- Hi.
- Hi.
"I know you're like, ""This girl's a freak, get her away from me,"""
but I have something for you.
Don't you want to know what it is?
"I made you, like, the best mix CD ever."
"I mean, there's a ton of stuff on it."
Like some really cool Madison bands that I'm sure you've never heard of before.
"And, like, the first song that we danced to."
"And there's also, like, this song of me playing the flute which you're gonna think is totally God-awful."
But I thought it'd...
- Kim.
- What?
There's something I have to tell you.
There's something I have to tell you.
I'm here to give a contract to a gangster.
This is...
This is the picture of my son.
His life's in danger.
You've to save me.
I am so unfortunate and helpless.

I had to request a goon to save my son.
But I didn't come empty-handed.
That's not all.
This is just the advance.

"Just move her to an exam room, let her sleep it off."
"And then, a la casa."
"Okay, let me know when she's set up."
Sure.
"Right this way, Glenda."
What's with the stop sign?
She's a school crossing guard.
Doesn't that make you sick?
The idea that woman is getting drunk on the job.
"Small, innocent, helpless, possibly even frail children in her charge--"
What's happening in there?
"Hey, Frank."
I think they're talking about you.
-What?
-Weaver kicking their butts is my guess.
She's gonna kick their butts if they don't stop yapping at each other.

-My money ain't on the nosebleed.
-The nosebleed?

But he doesn't live in our world.
Right?
That's not true!
Are you saying that when you're dancing with me it's like dancing with Kayama-san?
That's crazy.
"Hey, should I wait for you?"
Wait?
That's...
Perhaps I shouldn't have mentioned it here and now.
I'm not thinking about getting married now.
You didn't like the way I said it?
"No, that's not it."
"It's just that when I see my mother and father,"
I feel nervous about marriage.
Can't you help your mother?
My mother's problems go beyond the problems in our family.
I'm my mother's unfulfilled dream.
I'll taking care of your dancing.
But marriage is frightening to me.
I have the feeling that I'll end up like my mother.
Oh!
"Shinako, when did you get here?"
"Hello there, NMzu-san."
Did you see Kayama-sensei?
No.
He got sick and went somewhere.
I met Tomoko.
Tomoko?
How is she?
- Did you bring back my photo?
"- Oh, no."
I'm not done with it yet.
I'm still in the brainstorming stage.
"Well, if you get stuck, you should enlist Michael."
He's got creativity just rolling off of him.
"Yeah, I always work alone."
I'm a solo artist.
Of course.
She's still brainstorming.
Yeah.
It's like this complicated process that-
"So, tell Ellen about the shoe guy."
Did you go back to the store?
Yeah.
And turns out he's a killer of children.
"So, oh, well."
What?
"Why does he say ""the tall one""?"
- Because he wants me to do it.
- He's crazy.
You'd leave teeth marks all over it.
You'd choke on it.
He could see that I have a sensuous mouth.
This is crazy.
Someone should call in the authorities.
"Obviously, I would do it better."
We need an impartial authority.
"Hey, Peter!"
Peter Swersey.
"We are going to giveyou a ""jimmy ha-ha."""

He didn't need them anymore.
I swear.
Touching.
"Anyway, he kept the backpack and, uh, this was inside."
Can you guys let me down now?
How did you convince Gracie to let you into my stuff?
- What is it?
At our 3 o'clock!
New enemy!
New enemy closing in from dead ahead!
They're attacking as a team?
"From overhead, too!"
Incoming!
A Landing Castle...
"All units, brace for impact!"
Multiple Landing Castles...
Multiple Kataphraktoi...
Simultaneously!
He's made his move!
It's him!
Right.
It's too late for doubts now.
There is no returning from this place I have come to.
It was an uneventful morning... quiet.

-Following.
How you are called?
-Mukendi Ngalula.
-Mukendi what?
-Mukendi Ngalula.
What do you want?
A skull.
In order to have dinner tonight.
Take care well.
"Doctor, is a call for you."
Following.
It says?
"Hello, Laura."
"Yes, you tell me, you tell me."
"I assure it to you, one is the Disease of Addison."
You do not worry.
"If it is cured in time, it does not pass anything."
"You hear, is a human case."
"That poor man is counted everything to me,"
"He does not have family, not even it has Social Security."
"In agreement, agreement."
"It hears, Laura, now I have class, already you understand to me..."
"Yes, I understand."
This one case does not interest to you.
"Well, I will do that they enter position to him."
"You do not worry, I will not take to the clinic of Ciotti."
"In agreement, yes."
Goodbye.
"-God mine, I am bad."
-What happens to you?
I am bad.
Mikhail.
Are you crazy?
What the hell are you thinking coming in here?
The key wasn't in the mailbox 'cause Darlene didn't show up tonight... so I don't get a break for another 20 minutes.
Here.
You might as well take it now.
You shouldn't have come!
You should've looked for the key later.
What's the matter?
You all right?
- Excuse me.
- Alex.
You probably gave half of those bent- nose guys up there a heart attack.
I'm surprised we weren't trampled on the way to the phone.
You better get outta here.
I'll see you soon as I get off.
Don't even think about going to sleep.
We got a lot of catching up to do.
Just tell me.
Is everything going to be okay?
Get outta here!
You need to go back inside.
Lvan wants to talk to you.
We were family!
You betrayed us.
Enough.
Enough!
This is your lucky day.
Get in!
That was dynamite.
Any of those guys Alex Bohemia?
Good.

Don't forget this!
I'll give you a ghost charm isn't it pretty?
I'll give you another leg I'll give you two fists

I...
He...
Where'd your crystal grapes come from?
Speak up!
Picked!
I picked them!
Nonsense!
Sure they didn't fall from the sky?
Speak up!
Where'd you pick them?
At...
At South...
At the South-hill plot?

A boat sailing before the wind carried it over with great difficulty!
How about you?
So far!
"Monkey somersaulted 18,000 miles I took the grapes and lifted my heels and walked 109,200 miles!"
I still think you got them from South-hill!
I'm warning you two
Those grapes belong to Clearwater Winery!
What!
?
"Say, Gloria..."
- Alvaro!
- Lella!
"So, this is your boyfriend?"
You mind your own business!
And what are you doing here?
I brought you some ice cream for your birthday.
Why are you dressed like that?
You look like a whore.
"Alvaro, I..."
What should I do with this?
I don't even like the stuff.
To hell with it...
Lella...
"- By the way, how much do you charge?"
- Fifty thousand.
So... fifty plus fifty makes a hundred...
Good...
let's do a threesome!
Guys!
"You look like the ""Night of the Living Dead""."
"Come on, cheer up!"
- Always with your jokes!

"Come on, Ciotti is starting his rounds."
We need to hurry!

"Guys, women being as they are, we don't mean to cause problems,   we're just having fun."
"Excuse me, Professor, have you seen Miss Italia?"
- Why?
- Because I'm supposed to have an injection.
"You're like me, it's all in front."
Be thankful you don't have to struggle into a roll-on.
I am!
Have you given up answering that intercom?
I didn't hear it.
It didn't buzz.

"Well, you can pop out."
She's busy.
Goodbye.

These need doing.
"Give me a knock in ten, and we'll make a move."
So...

Mr Tubby Baker.
Very nice.
Very gentlemanly.
He's a gentleman caller
Like in that play where she had the gammy leg and the glass animals.
Why did you give him the brush-off?
We have our site visits on a Tuesday.

You know exactly what Daddy wants.
And you know how to make him happy and how to make him miserable.
Every woman does.
"If you're bored, Mom, you know, that's your fault, not his."
Bored.
"You've always been your father's daughter, and if you want to side with him this time, that's fine."
"- This is not about sides, Mom."
- Don't!

"Yeah, I'm trying to picture it."
Where's your office?
It's Zander-Cohen.
It's a pretty big architecture firm.
Impressive.
Do you have a view?
Yeah.
It's a nice view.
We better pick out a nice fancy suit for you.
"Oh, I don't need anything fancy."
That's what you think.
We got to get rid of that square outfit.

"No man ever proposes unless he's pushed into it, isn't that right?"
It most certainly is.
And with that blond hussy chasing after Ed he's going to need a lot of help to shove him into proposing.
- That's what I keep telling her.
- Please.
"All right, but I know what I'm talking about."
You've got to make up Ed's mind for him just like I made up your father's.
Men being the simple-minded creatures they are.
There are the boys.
I've gotta run.
Much obliged for the butter.
"I'll return you the eggs and bluing, Mrs. Taylor."

"Hi, Ruth."
"Hello, sweet."
How's everything?
Couldn't be better.
I got to talking and almost forgot supper.
"I'm glad you said ""almost"" because I'm hungry."
- And I'm a man that really gets hungry.
"- Oh, no."
"What you got there, margarine?"
"No, butter."
I borrowed it.
"Butter, huh?"
"Hey, what is this, Christmas or something?"
"Hello, Pop."
"- Hey, get a load of this."
"- Buddy, look at yourself."
- What's the matter?
This is it.
Someone must have knocked this over.
No!
It's not here!
No!
It's not here!
My engine!
I've just completed it!
It's gone!
"Please stay back, Mr. Mac Bain."
It's too dangerous.
The engine was just completed?
No...
It can't be.
The efforts of a lifetime have been...
We understand how you feel.
"Mac, please get a hold of yourself."
"Chief, one of our fire trucks has disappeared!"
That's impossible!
Keep looking!
I made some hot soup.
"Please have some, it'll make you feel better."
You're welcome to stay here if you'd like.
Thank you very much for your kindness.
"Oh, dear, I don't think you should give up just because the engine..."
No!
There's no hope whatsoever.
It's all over!
Your wife is correct.
"I think it's too early to give up, Mac."
Spare me your empty words of comfort.
"I am giving you no such thing, sir."
- Promise me you'll be careful.
‭
"- Mom, I..."
I can't promise you anything.
I... have no idea what to expect.

I have to hear what he's going to say.

Yeah.
I didn't mean to scare you.
"No, uh, it's just early."
"Um, what's up?"
My dad's back.
I don't know.
You're the only one who knew him before he left.
And I haven't slept all night and I'm totally freaking out.
Wow.
He just shows up...
literally when you get back to town?
How long has he been here?
I don't know.
I didn't interrogate him.
Doesn't it seem a little suspicious?
"You know, like, the timing of it all?"
"What do you mean ""the timing of it""?"
"Um, I mean, like, where was he when all of our friends, everyone we knew, was getting slaughtered?"
When you were actually in danger?
B) Uluc's messenger will be on and I'll communicate with him through... a mobile device.
"Uluc will be like a telephone switchboard, giving me news about all of you."
C) Gamze and I don't have a phone with messenger.
How will we communicate?
By farting?
"Planning needs money, and we don't have that much."
What can we do?
"No, that can't be."
"If we're going to do this, let's do it right."
I'll take care of the phone business.
Super!
The operation will take 60 minutes.
Good luck everyone.
Everything is okay.
We can start.
"Guys, it's your turn."
What's going on?
- Hello?
Kaan?
"- Where are you, man?"
- I got cut off and can't connect.
"- Great, and I can't get in."
What happened?
What do you mean by what happened?
Yours is here.
I am talking about Professor Candan.
She is here.
What's she up to?
What's she doing?
I don't know.
She's playing the violin.
"Hold on, Mert is calling."

My cousin from Chernobyl had a dog this size.
He had three legs.
"My cousin, not the dog."
Something good did come out of Chernobyl.
Excuse me?
How much do you charge for pictures with him?
"Oh, it depends."
How nude do you want him?
Ew.
We mean for our kids... with the horse.
"I don't think the ""ew"" was necessary."
You don't know what you're missing.
"I mean, we're just walking him for our friend."
We'll give you $10 each.
Sold to the woman who...
"""Doesn't"" wanna see me naked."

ALEX:
I really genuinely love this person...
He had asked me to co-host this party  and I stayed after.
I was trying to help you out because there was this girl who would not leave...
- ... that tall girl.
- Right.
She was gross.
I was trying to...
She was...
Come on.

- Who is it?
- It's Lily!
"- What do you want, Lily?"
"- Scarlet told me to tell you, three o'clock canceled."
"- Oh, fuck."
Does that mean I have an hour to myself now?
"- Yeah, I guess, but"
I've also got your mail.
"- Slide it under the door, Lily."
"- Hello, Cindy, just a minute."
"Honey, I know Paris Hilton is in the habit of carting around a dog, but what did I tell you about bringing that baby here?"
"- I'm sorry, sorry Scarlet, but I have to work..."
- This better be the last time.
M.
M.
"M, M, M, M, M."
Hi!
- Hi.
I'm good.
All that wouldn't have happened if you didn't let her get under your skin.
You're right.
She's driving me crazy.
And I'm driving Anna-Kat crazy.
"Next thing you know, we've got a backpack full of cat heads."
- What?
- It's a medical term.
"No matter what my mother does,"
I'm going to ignore her and stay calm.
Or you can sit down and finally tell her how you feel.
"God, no."
I'm saving that stuff to say to her coffin.
"Angela, I really need you for Thanksgiving to be a buffer for my mom."
Mnh-mnh.
Too late.
I'm already Doris' buffer.
Ugh.
My parents are so grateful for all the money I give them on Thanksgiving.
- It's disgusting.
- I really need a buffer!
"Hi, everybody!"
- Hey.
"- Hi, Viv."
"Oh, my gosh!"
That cheeseburger is huge.
It's just the size that it comes as.
It's enormous.
"It's a normal-sized cheeseburger, Viv."
I love cheeseburgers.
I eat them all the time.
Sure you do.
Who was it?
Do you want me to sort him out for you?
"Sure, I already offered..."
"Grow up, will you?"
No bullets?
No.
"Well, what's the point of giving you a gun... if they don't give you Jesus bullets?"
So we wouldn't shoot anyone.
I thought that was the point.
How else you supposed to keep the bleedin' peace?
"That's crazy, that is."
"It was no joke, all right?"
You had to look straight at 'em.
- Who?
- The Arabs.
Straight at them.
Straight into their eyes.
Mesmerize them.
"Easier said than done, I'd say."
Who are you telling?
Thanks.
"Hit me, will you?"
Get out!
"Hey, Sharon."
You forgot your piss.
Urine.
Da!
"Next time you try that, you better watch it."
"For God's sake, are you daft?"
He's not only daft.
He's such a roving eye for everybody in this hospital.
Did you see him?
Run these prints.
Get me an I.D. Now.
I spoke to Shane.
He said you weren't with him for about an hour last night.
Yeah.
That's right.
"I was with a private eye named, uh, Gordie Liman."
- What's he got to do with Tio and Armadillo?
- Nothing.
It's a private matter.
I'd rather it stay that way.
I'm happy to help you if you're helping me.
- Are you?
- I have been.
But I'm just about through.
I guess I'll have to figure this out on my own.
What the hell was that all about?
Nothing.
Why didn't you just leave it here and call 911?
- This dog was sniffing around it.
- So?
It's a bone.
The arm probably fell out of the Dumpster when the truck picked it up.
Call city services.
Remand the truck.
Have some unis search it.
The rest of her might still be in that truck.
"Alive, even."
"Lowe, did we I.D. the fingerprints yet?"
- There's a backlog.
- Backlog?
I cant find her if I can't I.D. her.
How long will that take?
An hour.
Jesus.
You gotta be fucking kidding me.
are the keys in...
Sir!
You have the keys in it?
Sir!
Shit!
Charles.
Charles!
Argh!
{\i1\cH80ffff}Going up.
shit!
You all right?
We gotta get outta here.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
{\i1\cH80ffff}Emergency personnel are still on scene... {\i1\cH80ffff}...at Harrah's Casino Hotel in Oklahoma City... {\i1\cH80ffff}...where at least 400 guests were stricken...
{\i1\cH80ffff}...with temporary paralysis yesterday.
{\i1\cH80ffff}Many are noting a similarity... {\i1\cH80ffff}...to the Westchester incident over a year ago... {\i1\cH80ffff}...that left over 600 injured...
{\i1\cH80ffff}...including several of the X-Men.
Knock it off.
knock it off!
Logan.
she's your...
How long has it been since you took your meds?
how long has it been?
I don't know!
Two days.
You saw what happened yesterday. everyone in that casino...
I did what I had to do to save Laura.
"Agent Gibbs, follow me to the hospital."
"DiNozzo, you put him in a car back to headquarters."
I'll meet you there.
"Gentlemen, welcome to the party."
It's BYOS:
Bring Your Own Shooter.
I brought mine--
"Tyler Elliott, my lead investigator."
"Gibbs, Vance, NCIS."
"Agent Gibbs, bravo."
"Big doubts about you going in, but you were way better than expected."
Meryl Streep better.
Ah.
Take that as a compliment.
"This one tells it like it is, to a fault."
Been there for the real thing.
"Are you confirming that all our marks were hit, Doctor?"
(door opens)
"On the money, Leon."
Break out the champagne.
Opening night was a success.
Well done.
McGEE:
"Hey, where you been, we've been calling?"
What's going on?
"Man day is over, and he is still ignoring us."
I am not going to be ignored.
"Glenn Close, Fatal Attraction."
"Good one, Ziva."
"Your impression of ""hot lady with crazy eyes"""
"is dead on, by the way."
"You are a, uh, sphinx of a minx."
"Don't freak, all right?"
We didn't get ripped off.
But Badger hasn't kicked in his full amount.
I know he was planning on pulling an all-nighter so he's probably still in the sack.
Then wake him up.
He can sleep after we're paid.
Why you gotta be such a hard-on?
You're not his pal.
You're his boss.
"This only works when they're scared of you, remember?"
Jack-off.
It's going straight to voicemail.
Voicemail?
"Just chill, okay?"
Count your money.
- Combo.
"- Yo, what's up?"
You seen Badger?
"Don't you cover for him, bitch."
"I ask you a straight-up question, I expect a straight-up answer."
Well?
They were too scared to tell me.
Badger got busted.
He's in jail.
"Honey, I'm home!"
Too slow!
What's up?
Got more lives than a damn cat.
Now if I could only learn to lick myself.
"What's up, guys?"
Good to see you.
Good to see you.
"I believe this is yours, my friend."
Thank you for lending it to me.
"But I still came out ahead, which is more than Mace can say."
"I'm close, so close."
One more door.
Yes!
Just one more door.
(sobs) Just one more door and I'm home free!
Wow.
Just... tell me why.
Why did you keep me in the dark for so long?
It's not that I didn't trust you.
I guess...
I just didn't want to share them.
"As long as I was the only human they confided in, it made me feel... special."
I think I know what you mean.
That might be why I've chased the Illuminati for so long.
"People may have thought I was a nut case, but at least I stood out."
"So, you two finally found each other."
"Yeah, I guess you could say that."
"- See you tonight, Captain."
- Have a nice day.
Hacker!
What are you doing in this neck of the woods?
"Oh, passing through."
"Man, you look like you've been through the wringer."
- (laughs) You don't know the half of it.
- (laughs)
"I may know more than you think, partner."
A lot more.
An Illuminati pin?
You?
"You'll have to be patient, I'm afraid."
We have the situation under control... but there might be some damage to the skull and brain.
"We have to do a CT-scan, but we can't do it here."
And we can't get a helicopter in weather like this.
Can't you drive her there?
It's too much of a risk.
Her condition is critical.
We might lose her then.
Lose her?
A coma.
"What's a coma, Dad?"
Go home and get some sleep.
There's nothing you can do here.
It was...
It was like a snake.
Shaped like a snake.
Pardon?
Has he been treated yet?
"No, I'm OK."
It's nothing.
Come on.
"Hello, sweetheart."
I just can't get you out of my mind.
I miss you.
Really.
Do you actually love me?
Then come over here right now.
"I'll undress you, you'll undress me..."
- Why don't you answer?
- Hello?
- It's me.
What are you doing?
I always think of it as sleeping resting up from the pounding it takes during the day.
- Do you work at night?
"- Yes, quite often."
You don't realize the preparation it takes to be a teacher.
It's like... .
It's like all these kids were my own.
I love them.
I want so much for them.
"It's more than a job to you, isn't it?"
I didn't mean to sound like the dedicated idealist.
"Well, there's nothing wrong in that."
Connie.
- I did want to thank you for coming.
- You don't have to.
I enjoyed everything.
Including the dancing?
Including.
"You're wasting your time, Mike."
I had my love a long time ago.
"And when my husband died, I came back here."
And I've had no time for anything but Allison and the dress shop.
- You've got time now.
- It's too late.
"- Look, Connie."
If I were...
- I said it's too late.
I made my choice long ago.
Please take me home.
Sure.
"Selena, let's get married."
You mean now?
Sure.
"Can you tell him, again, that I am trying to reach him?"
Of course.
Goodbye.
"Hey, thanks for meeting me here."
"Well, I thought we better speak face to face."
"Why, what is it?"
I checked the Brandeis account.
And?
"The Manovich money, the 30 million..."
It was in the account until a few days ago.
What do you mean?
It's gone.
Gone!
But that means that someone had to take it.
After Constantine died.
All of it?
Yes.
"If Constantine didn't take it, then..."
Christos!
He's the only one who had access to it.
What do you want to do?
I'm going to get some answers.
"Ok, cash or card?"
Cash.
Wouldn't want my husband to find out.
"No, those are going in the back."
You take all of those in the back.
"This is good, good, good."
I like all this.
"You know bushes, it's here is the important part."
"It's like, here,we want them, this is what they see, the rest is..."
Who looks back here?
In a train.
What were you trafficking?
Myself.
You're a simpleton?
"Can you say ""virgin"" for a man?"
Not for long.
I'm hurting.
I'm bleeding!
"No, you're coming."
I'm the one who's bleeding.
"You're wet, when I want you!"
"Léo, don't wait for me."
"Forget the address, forget everything."
Mickey's okay.
Anyway.
I'd like...
I can't...
Yes?
We don't give handouts.
Autographs and postcards via mail exclusively.
Hungry?
The ladies are sleeping.
No noises please.
Come into the kitchen.
"Coffee, chocolate, tea?"
"From where I come from, we're force-fed all of your disasters."
"Floods, wars, famines, terrorist attacks, kid soldiers..."
"We shrug off propaganda, we want proof;"
"once we have it, we don't know who we are anymore."
But darling...
"In the Kingdom of the Blind, the one-eyed suffers."
So don't look.
That's for you.
"You, at least you don't kill."
My woman.
My cross.
My skin.
Anything else you want?
"Shoo, or do you want a bow on top too?"
"No, I'll go to her!"
"Don't sweat, she's here!"
It's done!
"Hold me against you, against him, against me."
"Stop me from running out, from drowning."
Plug me.
Whatever floats your boat...
Life is good.
Can you smell it?
Take a breath!
"They watered the street, to make us grow on the paving."
"Yes, I do love you."
We've got everything!
"Our weaknesses,"
"Ideas,"
History!
"But what's keeping us on our asses, waiting for the Cossacks to strike?"
The burden of Money?
The phantoms of Culture?
The Final Solution?
"If we don't turn to face the Cossacks, it might hurt a little, get me?"
In '44 we won the Battle of the Rails.
The Final Solution?
Stale bourgeoisie farts.
"We need to take the middle ground, the power of living people, the workers."
Serving drinks to the meanie moms or watching Marly's husband massage your gums with his tongue?
"I know, I'm sorry."
I should have locked the door.
Yeah.
That's pretty much the only thing that was wrong with it.
"You know, I'm not Marly's biggest fan, but she really doesn't deserve this."
"Yeah, I know."
"It's wrong, it's wrong."
But I hope that you and I can still be friends.
"Yeah, I don't think so."
Why?
Because I'm Portuguese?
Because I'm a maid?
"Uh, no."
"It's because, well you're kind of a whore."
"- So, what's up for tomorrow?"
"- Well, we should definitely get together."
"I could swing by, maybe we'll catch a movie."
Great.
- I don't want to.
"- Oh, thank God."
"When you were married, we spent about three and a half hours alone together."
- And that was over 15 years.
- That seemed about the right amount.
So I'll see you around.
Maybe we can do something next spring.
"- That would be great, Dad."
- What?
- Bye.
- Bye.
[ENGLISH SDH]
I will wait for you.
Some people are born to wait.
I will come.
But I will be late.
Okay?

"How are you, Vincent?"
You get my message?
I prefer to come for you than that we are waiting for you like a fool at home.
"Well I did, did not you?"
Is there for me?
Of course!
"Amin, can you..."
"-Here, we'll share."

Hello!
"-Back to work, guys!"
"You can not go on like that, Tintin."
"I give all of yourself, okay?"
Just what you did not shot.
-He threatened me.
This is the worst-case scenario legitimate defense.
-Get a grip.
Stop bothering me!
Nothing I did not ask!
Please follow me.
I swear with my sincerity.
"Sir, do you know the accused Ho Foon?"
No.
But he is like my concubine Yu-fa.
What?
You have had a son with your concubine?
"Yes, we have a son named Nim-sai."
But he is dead.
Why?
I don't know.
Why don't you know that?
We've lost each other for over 20 years.
Why did you say he's dead?
I saw his dead body.
How could you confirm that was your son?
From his ass.
Ass?
"Right,"
I saw a triangular birthmark on the body's ass.
That makes me believe that was my son's dead body.
"Sir, there are so many unexpected things happened on earth."
"For many things, you may not believe it."
"Foon, do you want me to teach you?"
Take off your pants!
Now!
Yes!
How about the one I saw?
"You just saw his ass, but not the face."
The birthmark may be drawn by someone.
It may be drawn by someone.
So you are my son?
[chuckles] make it snow!

Using the artifacts-- but that someone--that someone is Macpherson.
And I can prove it.
Remember?
"Artie, we've both seen you like this before."
"No, no, no, no."
He planted this on purpose.
He wanted me to find it.
Otherwise he would've been much too careful.
He's taunting me.
Would you listen to yourself?
You are leaping to wild conclusions
Based on nothing.
"And meanwhile, your team is falling apart around you."
"Oh, they're not falling apart."
Myka and Pete are fine.
Are they?
Did you know the tsuba's now under Dickinson's control?
Did you know Bering and Lattimer had been detained?
They're at the hotel.
I'm taking you all off this case.
- Wait.
Wait.
Wait.
Wh--what if I'm right?
What if it is Macpherson?
"Go home, Artie."
"- Artie, where are you?"
- It doesn't matter.
New orders.
You two stay in the hotel and you wait for me.
I will take it from here.
What's the matter?
ONE OF THE GUYS I ASKED TO KEEP AN EYE OUT
ON THIS BURN-NOTICE BUSINESS
TOLD ME YOU MIGHT WANT TO RETHINK YOUR TRIP TO D.C.
WHY?
WHAT DID HE SAY?
THE GUY WHO BURNED YOU --
IT TURNS OUT YOU DON'T NEED TO GO UP THERE TO SEE HIM
BECAUSE...
"WELL,HE'S COMING DOWN HERE TO SEE YOU."
SEE ME?
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
I DON'T KNOW.
JUST A HEADS-UP.
"WELL,IT LOOKS LIKE I'M GONNA HAVE TO GET"
?
My name is Michael Westen.
I used to be a spy until-
- We got a burn notice on you.
You're blacklisted.
"When you're burned, you've got nothing- no cash, no credit, no job history."
- You're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.
- Where am I?
Miami.
You do whatever work comes your way.
You rely on anyone who's still talking to you  a trigger-happy ex-girlfriend-
- Should we shoot them?
an old friend who's informing on you to the F.B.I.
You know spies.
Bunch of bitchy little girls.
- Family too-
"- Hey, is that your mom again?"
"'Kay, come back soon."
Okay.
What's up ?
Don't you think the boys were acting weird ?
"The shifty looks, finishing each other's sentences like they're composing a lie on the spot ?"
Yes.
Totally normal for them.
"I don't know, I feel like they're hiding something."
"If it's not the location of Pancakes, I'm not interested."
"Oh, no."
He was in his cage.
He's gone !
"Oh, no."
Pancakes ?
Pancakes ?
"Okay, I didn't want to worry Taylor."
"She's pretty upset, and she's got this thing about blood."
Blood ?
Yeah.
"Don't freak, okay ?"
I-I-I need you to not freak.
Okay.
Why would I freak out ?
"It's not that bad, is it ?"
"Dude, it's bad."
"Seth, the hospital is, like, a mile away."
"I know, which is why I'm taking the secret back roads way that's only a half mile."
That was sarcasm.
I'm pretty sure my shortcut got us lost.
I'm sure you'll figure it out.
"That was sarcasm, too."
Sorry.
- Shut up!
Be normal!
"Hi, Will and Mark."
- Marcus.
"- Right, Marcus."
Come on in.
## I felt all flushed with fever # # embarrassed by the crowd #
# I felt she found my letters # # and read each one out loud ##
"- What you singin', fuzzy?"
Mind if I borrow this?
Yes.
Jesus!
This is crap.
"Can I have that back, please?"
It was a Christmas present and...
You pathetic shitface.
Give him that back or you're gonna get a slap.
Tricked ya.
Now... off before I get really cross.
Slag!
Slag!
"Why does me hitting someone make me a slag, I wonder?"
Boys are peculiar creatures.
"Not you though, Marcus."
"Well, you are peculiar but in a different kind of way."
"Are you a little slow in the head, Marcus?"
No.
I'm just funny.
- That's what everyone tells me.
"- You are a funny one though, ain't ya?"
Is it because your mum tried to top herself?
- How do you know?
"Flat-coated retriever, possibly, but poodle, no!"
Professor Barkway merely...
Barkway doesn't have a leg to stand on and he knows it.
Mary left the work to me.
All of it.
"- What, she put that in her will?"
- Of course.
The funeral was four days ago.
We buried an empty coffin.
- Were you there?
- No.
"No, because you didn't know her."
Let alone spend 15 years of shared life with her.
"And yet here you are, demanding her work, demanding her papers, anything she left behind."
"""Come on, hand it over!"""
As if it's your right!
It isn't!
Is that clear?
Very clear.
"Miss Cramer, we've clearly got off on the wrong foot here."
"Poodle or no, all we wanted was a chat."
Maybe we could have one over a cup of tea.
With buns?
Cake?
Cream?
I know a place.
"Mr Matthews, thank you for bringing it round."
I'll be right with you.
- How come it looks like it's melted?
- It's a G-Wizz.
"Well, gee whizz."
It's an electric car.
- Two in the center?
- No.
Rules are different for cops.
- I'm losin' my shirt here with you guys.
- So what do I got to do?
- Five out of six in the star.
- Five out of six.
"- Hey, Freddy."
- You a cop too?
"Yeah, yeah, I heard ya."
Enjoy your trip to the big city?
You gotta hit the next five to win.
Shit!
"I just hope you're not trying to prove anything, Freddy."
I know some of them are real assholes.
They think they're high priests or somethin'.
I don't know.
But why would they do all this?
Maybe they're doin' the right thing.
"Liz, I saw these pictures of Ray meeting with these guys."
"You know, like mobsters."
Everyone's houses are financed by these mob banks.
Says who?
IA?
Even you said Joey's death was no accident.
"Joey fell off a building, Freddy!"
Okay?
I don't need this opened up.
Maybe you do.
I don't.
All Joey wanted was a place for us to live.
Who are you to judge that until you've walked in his shoes?
Why can't you just accept that?
Shut up!
[Siren wailing]
[Garner] I'm calling backup.
"If anybody moves, we're in trouble."
We need a shooter.
We're here.
Your man wants everyone to hold their position.
We need a single rifle.
"I say again, all units, hold your position."
[Morgan] Copy that.
This is the street.
Hotch is going inside.
And he's on his own.
[Reid] Hotch won't do anything to spin him.
It's not Kaman I'm worried about.
This isn't his first time at the dance.
We gotta trust him on this.
"Kaman, why are you doing this?"
We never did anything to you.
You kept Tracy away from me.
"Look what you've done, what you're about to do now."
I wasn't always like this.
"People don't change, Kaman."
No.
This is all your fault.
"Baby, you can't keep blaming the world for what happened to you."
"[Gasps, whimpers]"
"Baby, look at me."
Look at me.
[Whimpering continues]
[Woman] Kaman.
That's good then.
Excellent.
I'll stay for a few more weeks for the peace and quiet.
We'll take the next boat.
"If you'd been really ill, I wouldn't have told you anything."
This is why I'm here.
He's in Holland for a week.
"Good morning, Mr Haverman."
"Morning, sir."
Here you are.
Your morning portion.
The doctor says you'd better stay in bed.
"Yes, I understand, nurse."
Thank you.
"Later, after the visitor will have left."
Don't be too long.
You have to be fit for the cure.
Busybody.
That's what I'm ripping those assholes of the insurance company off for.
450 guilders a day.
-462.50.
What?
-I work in insurance.
"Oh, yes."
I know where he is.
And what he's doing this week.
It's Niels for sure.
I have to tell you something.
It's such an old case.
"Back then, you swore we'd liquidate him."
I'm not well.
It's been so long.
"If you feel hungry, you can take it out and eat."
That's a good idea!
Master.
Come on.
Good!
"Thank you, master."
"Come on, don't mention it."
"Shit, I've stuffed my ring too."
"Foon, can you get my ring back for me?"
"Sure, master."
"This is chicken leg, my ring is still inside."
Not this one?
"Oh, it's full!"
"Master, would you mind looking for it yourself?"
Alright.
He's taking my bag!
"As it's stipulated by court, although it's not his wish to be baptized, we still welcome him to join God's family."
Let him go.
Why a woman's baptismal time is so short...
But a man's baptismal time is so long?
Why did you fight?
Your nose bleeds!
I didn't beat him.
None of his business!
Look!
I hate blonde!
I think it's acceptable!
Damn you!
Put all the dominos back.
As well as my mahjong too.
"And the chair and table, all set!"
What?
- What a pro.
What a pro.
- I didn't ask him to do that.
- He's aces.
"- Yeah, I know."
I didn't ask him to do that.
He just did it.
Really thoughtful.
- He was hilarious.
- I didn't dislike smooching Jay.
It's hot.
I'm just gonna say it.
"- Just, you know, say it."
- Just gonna say it out loud.
- that gay band We're Gay.
It was great because...
- We're Gay.
- We're Gay.
We had been shooting for a while when he came in.
And we had all gotten pretty tight pretty fast and it was just cool.
He came in and was just so awesome.
"- Yeah, he jumped in."
- Just jumped right in.
"Oh, man, do you remember Rafi put a bunch of Babybel..."
"- You know, the Babybel cheese things?"
"- Oh, yeah."
They come wrapped in wax and Rafi got a bunch of those and balled them up and put them in the back of Jay's jacket as a joke.
"And Jay was okay, but the wardrobe lady was not pleased with it."
"Oh, man."
"I won't name names, but she was angry."
What happened?
Did they melt all over the place?
"his passions, his pursuits?"
- He has a smart little pointer...
- Where is Allenham?
Nice little estate three miles east.
He is to inherit it from a relative.
Lady Allen is the name.
It's Col. Brandon.
I should go out and keep watch.
You're looking out for Willoughby.
You'll not think of Brandon now.
Come in.
"Good morning, Brandon."
- How is the invalid?
"- Thank you so much, Colonel."
Why set your cap at Willoughby when you've already made such a conquest?
I'll not set my cap at anyone.
- Lady Allen's nephew?
- He visits.
For he's to inherit.
He has a pretty estate of his own.
Combe Magna in Somerset.
I'd not give him up to a younger sister for tumbling down hills.
The man himself.
Come.
Brandon.
We know when we are not wanted.
Thank you so much for calling.
Marianne.
The colonel and Sir John are leaving.
Goodbye.
Thank you for the flowers.
"- How do you do, Colonel?"
- Are you lonely?
- Yes.
I have no expectations.
Nothing.
We should earn the real thing without any help from others.
But I think I still want to get it through people.
I know I shouldn't expect it of them.
- A real pleasure meeting you.
- Same here.
"Me, too."
"You know my intentions were genuine earlier, right?"
"Yes, of course."
You never quit.
So strange.
I wonder what's so fun about it.
They're just enjoying themselves.
Why did Nature have to divide us into male and female?
I'm so sick of it.
"You're a male, yourself."
You know that.
"Yeah, yeah."
That's why I'm like this.
Want to drink some more?
"Yes, well, as you like."
As I like?
So you want to drink more or not?
"Really, do as you like."
"If you want to drink, then do so."
"Okay, I'll go buy some more."
"Moonsook, I need to ask you something."
Can you come over here?
Sure.
I thought you were sleeping.
What the hell?
Yanking up your daughter's skirt in the middle of the night?
"Speak, will you?"
"Tell me, asshole!"
"Tell me, you fucking shithead!"
Fuck you!
"Stop staring, motherfucker!"
Don't call your daddy that!
Don't you look at me!
Stop it!
Daddy said he was sorry.
I'm gonna kill all of you.
How could you?
I met the shaman today.
He thinks there's a spirit in the house.
Something's possessed Hyo-jin.
"And if we don't act, there'll be dead bodies."
He's supposed to be the best.
Why didn't you answer my calls?
"Come with me, and don't give me any crap."
Ask him where he stashed the stuff from in there.
The things in there... where are they now?
What things?
He asks what things.
The stuff we saw before.
Things we saw... before.
The photographs?
You mean the pictures?
"Yeah, the pictures."
And the other stuff.
Yes.
How do you contact her?
How did you know I'm here?
"I cannot reveal anything, for the sake of protection."
"If I kept the names of women I spent the night with, my phone would need more memory."
What?
"I won't be meeting her in the future, so why would I keep her phone number?"
Such a player.
"You really are the one, really unlucky."
Could it be that...
"You like that woman, don't you?"
Your tastes are very unique!
Kim Yeong...
My name is Kim Yeong Ju.
She's related to a case I'm working on involving Mr. Lee Kyeong Wan.
"You, really don't know?"
I don't know.
Okay.
Fine?
Work hard.
Where is this woman hiding?
Excuse me!
Where are you going?
I see you're limping.
"The clinic doesn't have X-Ray, so I'm going to the hospital."
"Wait for me a moment, I'll quckly bring my car."
Get in the car.
I don't want to.
I'll clean up the mess I made.
Hurry!
Get in the car.
"I will take her, just go."
"Her leg is like that, because of me."
But now you've grown selfish and unkind.
"What's happened to your heart, jim?"
"It belongs to you, josie, just like you're going to belong to me."
Stop being afraid.
We've climbed above right and wrong.
"They're trying to pull us down, but they can't."
We're going higher and higher and higher!
Offering 150 for any part of 2 million!
"500,000 at 150!"
I'll take it.
Any more bids?
"If it breaks 160, it'll hit 200!"
We're not gonna let it break 160!
Jim!
She's just broke 150.
150?
157!
Why aren't you in the gold room?
"Oh, i'm getting jumpy, boss."
"I tell you, wall street's gone plumb crazy."
This thing's out of control!
Because i got 'em cornered!
I got all the gold there is outside the treasury.
"But i'm still buying, luke."
We can't hold anymore!
We're done for!
Let's get out of here while we're still alive!
I can't stay with you!
It's going to hit 200!
Stick with me!
You can't lose!
1621/2!
[Sighs]
Do they always talk about me that way?
"Oh, my God."
I shouldn't have played it.
"[Gasps] No, i-it's better that I know... who they really are."
"Martha, I-I've never... been any good at seduction or romance."
But I love the way you look.
I love every part of you.
"And if I could, I would go in there, and I would..."
"[Sniffles] I know you would, Clark."
But I have a job.
- A very important job.
- [Sighs]
And things are a lot worse than you know.
What?
Uh... have you ever heard of Stealth?
No.
"It's a huge, complex military project."
I don't understand it all... but there are a lot of leaks coming out... we think... of your office.
We've found it very difficult to find a source.
What do you need?
I so appreciate that.
I really do.
"- Let me help you, Clark."
"- No, it's dangerous."
I'm not afraid.
Do I love you?
You know you're everything to me.
And you to me.
[Sniffles]
You are.
What?
He's on my neck like a vulture.
What do you want?
This guy didn't want to give you the check.
Could you take care of this?
No problem.
Tell him to put it on my tab.
That's what I want to talk to you about.
It ain't just this one.
It's seven big ones you owe me.
that ain't peanuts.
I don't mean to be out of order
Sonny.
like I'm a deadbeat.
You're a mutt.
You know the money we spend in this fucking
Don't be like that.
Like what?
Do you believe this prick?
You think this is funny?
What the fuck are you looking at?
You fucking moron!
You don't want to bring the check?
Do you believe this prick?
too.
You're a funny guy.
Henry!
You want to laugh?
This prick asked me to christen his kid.
000.
You really are a funny guy.
I'm worried.
I'm hearing bad things.
I'm scared.
There's no reason to be.
Everything's okay.
I could have been a better person.
I could have done more.
You did enough.
Stay with me.
It won't be much longer.
I'll stay right here.
- Let me see.
- I think I singed my eyebrow.
I need to see.
You thought it was a good idea to put kerosene in your barbecue?
- I thought it was lighter fluid.
- It doesn't look burnt.
I'll check for corneal burns with an ultraviolet light.
I need everything documented.
Worker's comp.
- You're a chef?
- It was my summer office party.
"Oh, I don't think that counts."
Any word on the air conditioning?
- Yeah.
They think it'll be fixed by winter.
- I can't work like this.
- You want a Big Stick?
- No.
- Why did I buy these shoes?
- Because they were cute.
- Some help here.
"- Yeah, what is it?"
Car rammed into a picnic at Lincoln Park.
"Yeah, I guess that's more fun."
You're still kind of weird though.
Whatever's on here might make that murderboard look like kiddie hour.
"Watch this. ‭Noah, we're gonna be late for school."
(LINE RINGING) Shh!
"Shh, shh, shh."
"Crescent Palms, your place to relax in Lakewood."
- This is Eddie.
How can...?
"- You think you're pretty smart, huh?"
I want to know who else you told about that storage unit.
- Who is this?
"- Oh, come on."
It's Noah Foster from The Morgue.
We talked last night.
"I told you already, I don't have anything else to say."
"(MUTTERING) Oh, that's nice."
Okay.
"Look, you're spinning out these conspiracy theories that just don't exist, man."
"Just wait for the camera to sync up, okay?"
And... we are syncing.
(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING)
We're almost a quarter synced.
What are you hiding?
We are almost there.
"Come on, come on, come on."
"Oh, damn it!"
It was just streaming only.
There's nothing on here.
"Uh, careful with that."
It's a bookend.
Very sturdy.
Yes.
Did you lie on his bed?
But I'm lying on your bed too.
"First you fool around with Fat Pig,"
"Then this over-aged virgin,"
And now you come for me.
You're worst than a bore.
You mean a whore?
Don't correct me.
I hate people who correct me.
- Yoyo!
- Shut up.
I don't want to see you again.
Get lost right away!
"Hello, handsome!"
- Don't touch me!
- Why not?
"Because I used to get 0 in my exams,"
So I'm allergic to anything that shape.
So long!
- Dumpling!
- Stop that!
You said you didn't like well-rounded people.
"You're different, you're unique."
How unique?
Because you're rounded in all the wrong places.
I have something to discuss with his Excellency.
"Your Excellency, this is the 'Beast'!"
Sir!
What's the matter?
Someone called Hiroshima wants to see you.
Hiroshima?
Take care.
Paul.
"Thank you, Lester."
"J, London's great, but I'm missing the New York skyline."
I hope you're well.
Paul.
Fax this to Galliano's buttmaker's boyfriend stylist... in Monaco.
You freak!
- What are those for?
- We're doing a strain... on say gal shalls and Roxanne gave it 6 pages.
Come in.
- I have to talk to you.
- You want another raise?
"I don't get paid, I'm an intern."
I think I might know who the Yuri is.
Let's continue with the pedicure later.
Privacy.
Let's talk.
Delicious!
Good morning!
"Good morning, boys!"
"Good morning, good morning, good morning."
"Wow, are we silent!"
- Did somebody die here?
- Yeah.
Every dog has his day...
"It's obvious that, the way you two are dressed, you're not here..."
- to talk to me about fashion.
- I'm afraid we're not.
"Lieutenant Pathmark, you're under arrest for the insider trading... code 327B, for industrial espionage."
I always knew you were the Yuri.
You have the right to remain silent...
What we're gonna do is we're gonna take them out to the ocean.
You can't set them free in the ocean.
They'll die.
They're freshwater fish.
Okay.
"I hear you, sweetheart."
You are so smart.
We'll come up with plan B. We'll come up with a really good idea.
It won't be sort of kind of good.
It'll be a perfect idea.
You'll love it.
"All right, so we're gonna look at lipstick, we're gonna look at jewelry."
"- Shoes, bags."
- We're gonna...
"Oh, shoes."
- You guys wanna look at shoes?
"- Let's look at shoes, please."
"- Yes, heels."
"- Oh, my God, wait a second."
Wait.
- Do you wanna go in here?
"- Can't let them overheat, right?"
"Oh, my gosh."
Are the goldfish coming with us?

Grace.
What...?
Am I as sexy and attractive to you as ever?
Huh?
Is this it for you?
Am I perfect?
"Well, ahem..."
I guess it wouldn't kill me if you lost a little weight.
Aha!
"Ok, and how much weight would it not kill ya for me to lose?"
I don't know.
50 pounds?
50?
All right!
Less!
Whatever.
You made me say it.
I can't believe you said 50!
"Doug, come on!"
You know I love you no matter-- ah...
This is-- this is unbelievable.
"You know, here I am walking around thinking everything's great."
"Meanwhile, you're smuggling in my clothes and hating the way I look!"
"No, I don't hate the way you look, ok?"
"But, yes, I admit it."
You could lose a little weight.
"But, Doug, come on."
I'm sure there are things about me you wish were different that you hold back on.
You?
"No, you're-- you're perfect."
"Yeah, right."
"Hey, look, when you start getting the old lady whiskers,"
"I'll let you know, but for now you're fine."
"Doug, come on."
Did you measure the closet?
- Yes.
Did you measure the door?
- Damn!
"Listen, if it's storage you're after, you can put it in the hall closet downstairs."
Let me go and get the door for you.
"All right,here, keep it sideways."
"Uh, Dubcek, hold it."
- What?
"I got it, I got it, no problem, no problem"
Hello?
Yeah just a second.
"Harry, for you."
Hello.
Wrong number.
She took it down herself.
"Ah, it's all right."
"You had the guts to get up there, you know?"
It takes time.
I have to be funny by tomorrow night!
You're not gonna make it.
I don't know what to do!
"Well, don't over-think it, you know, just, talk about things you know."
That's what I do.
Yeah.
You make fun of your poor mother's flabby arms.
"Hey, those flabby-arm jokes made her the most popular senior in Fort Meyers, Florida."
"You.. you mean, she doesn't hate you for it?"
Hate me?
No.
She loves me for it.
It's a joke.
"No, no."
No way.
I'm not gonna be a factor in that decision.
You know that there's no way for us to have a normal relationship.
"- You can forget about it, right?"
- OK.
There is a personal cost when you run for president.
"But as far as we're concerned, there's no reason why you and I can't be a normal couple."
How?
"Well, uh, for starters, we could try and sleep in a little bit."
- Is that what normal couples do?
- Mm-hmm.
What about this?
Yeah.
"Yeah, that's normal."
- That cannot be good thing.
"- No, no."
It's gearing up.
- Just give it a few minutes.
"- Wow, Holly."
It sounds like it's in its final death throes.
"No, no."
That's impossible.
It's brand new.
No.
My condolences.
Maybe we better read the manual.
- OK.
- How's your Italian?
L.A. Sucks.
I spent one hour on the 110 and I missed breakfast with Caitlin.
"Sorry, I didn't realize you had a guest."
Wait.
"Is that going in my file, too?"
"Now we're not going to recommend you leave the school,"
Because ms.
Rinsky would like to handle this directly.
"Dear, I blame myself."
"When you acted out,"
I should never have banned you.
"I mean, I'm an educator."
I believe in second chances.
"Therefore, you are now the opposite of banned."
You're gonna be the new room mommy.

Will do.
"Let's go, frankie."
"Oh, my god, aunt Edie."
I can't believe you just sprayed that guy right in the face.
That was nothing!
I've been teargassed in the face!
What?
!
Why?
"Oh, we were at a jazz club, and some of the white kids"
Wanted to dance with the black kids.
"Oh, my god."
"please, sir."
I've got a feeling about this one.
"That's lovely, Kent."
But let me try to explain how this works.
"If you told me you'd found, say, a giant footprint..."

Get me a photograph and I couId get some troops over there!
But you tell me you've got a feeling... ?
"AII right, fine."
You want evidence?
I'II get you evidence.
"And when I do, I'm gonna want a memo distributed."
That sounds swell.
I'll want that memo carbon-copied and redistributed--
Hi.
Thanks for the use of your phone.
"Thank you for the use of your phone, Mrs... ?"
Hughes.
Annie Hughes.
"And this is my son, Hogarth."
"Thank you, Annie."
Hobart.
That's Hogarth!
What an embarrassing name.
Might as well call him Zeppo.
What kind of a sick person would name a kid Hogar--?
Hog Hug.
Hogarth Hughes!
Kent MansIey.
You work for the government.
I wasn't gonna say that.
"I have something for you, Hogarth."
(TRAIN RATTLES BY)
Where is Cameron?
I haven't seen Cameron for two years.
I don't know what you expect me to tell you.
"No offence, but I think you do."
"So, you were at art school together?"
Well...
I was at art school.
He'd hang around the refectory.
"Sort of, you know talking art."
LUTHER:
Did he ever talk about this?
(LAUGHS)
Spring-Heeled jack?
Yeah.
About ten zillion times.
"Yes, it was his childhood obsession."
Spring-Heeled Jack's in the cupboard.
"Spring-Heeled Jack's waiting at the bottom of the garden, in the bushes."
He had to see somebody about it.
A psychologist or a psychoanalyst.
"Anyway, they teased him about it."
It made him feel like a freak.
"I suppose he was a freak, really."
Still is.
A freaky little freak.
Did Cameron ever hurt you?
No.
- Why did you hesitate?
- Because sometimes... he'd get this look in his eyes.
What look?
Like he wanted to.
Edgar.
Heard you got deported.
"Yeah, did Mexico stick its finger down its throat and send you back?"
That's very funny.
It's a shame
Mitch isn't around to hear how witty you two are.
"Man, I know you're still pissed."
I should've told you that--
"Told me what, Edgar?"
That you're a selfish asshole with no regard for anyone or anything but your sorry-ass self?
No.
You shouldn't have told me.
I should've already fucking known.
"Hey, man."
"We don't all feel that way, Edgar."
"As a matter of fact, I got you new headshots-- a little welcome home present."
[crowd laughing in the theater]
What do you think?
"- [laughing] Oh, man."
- Fuck you!
"Come on, man, we're just fucking with you."
Man!
Prison has changed you.
Yeah.
Baby.
Eat.
They seemed so nice.
"Yeah, get used to it."
We're gonna be fine without him.
Even you said they were pretty big.
"Yeah, I say all kinds of things."
Why do some people get so much?
"Should we take notes, or will there be handouts?"
There'll be handouts.
Now as I was saying...
"I'm gonna take notes anyway, just to be safe."
Brought a fresh notebook.
"Oh, boy."
What?
Is that who you were in school?
You were that person?
What person?
"""ms."
"Rinsky, should we take notes?"""
"You know, the suck-up, the goody-goody, the narc."
"Well, if we have to be here, mike,"
"I want to make the most of it,"
"And actually, I was very cool in school."
Okay.
I was.
Okay.
I was.
Am I gonna have to separate you two?
Please.

Uh-huh.

So that's why we have to leave
"It's a chicken, they're female."
Silly me.
What's that?
It's your surprise.
- We're having a party.
- What's the occasion?
"It's my son's birthday, and I want to celebrate it."
"OK, Naj, do the honours."
"Three, two, one..."
You'd better come.
There's a problem with the vaccine test.
"For God's sake, be careful."
- How long has he been like this?
- A few hours.
- I should have been told!
- BP is going through the roof.
Oedema presence.
"At first we thought the vaccine was working, but then he started showing symptoms of the virus."
His immune system has collapsed.
This is my fault.
We're losing him.
"Hold him, for God's sake."
"The risk of contamination is too great, there's nothing you can do."
"Come on, get out, all of you."
"You too, Sami."
I'm so sorry.
You do what you like.
I'm not leaving him to die on his own.
Cut my throat!
Drive!
Samantha Willis live here?
Abby Grant sent us.
We're supposed to have dinner with Judge Maynard and Timmy.
"Yeah, okay, as soon as I finish this level."
"No, get your coat on."
It's a three-hour drive to that cabin.
Can't you just cook something here?
Excuse me?
I am not going to cook you dinner while you sit here in your own mess playing your TV games.
"Oh-ho, and the martyr returns."
"Chris, I..."
I think it's time for you to go.
"Okay, I'll go."
"But I want you to know,"
I faked all my light-headedness.
"Mm, good Kool-Aid."
"Whoa, whoa."
Sound familiar?
"Oh, my God, Chris."
"Oh, there you are."
I've been looking all over for you.
Why?
You want to humiliate me with more slave work?
"No, I..."
I wanted to apologize.
I should've never blackmailed you.
I'm really sorry.
And I want you to come home.
I thought you said no one would miss me?
"I said a lot of stupid things I didn't mean, Chris."
But I miss you.
"Thanks, Meg."
"I miss you, too."
"You know, living in that family, we both have pretty crappy lives."
The parking lot was empty.
More lights wouldn't have made a difference.
"Thank you, Officer."
That's very nice of you to say.
"Oh, I'm not an officer."
I work with Mr. Monk.
Is that Adrian Monk?
I've heard of him.
He's a genius.
Right?
And you're his partner.
Partnerlbabysitterlassistant lbabysitter.
What's your name?
Natalie Teeger.
"Miss Teeger, I know this probably sounds callous, but have you ever done any acting?"
Me?
No.
"Well, here's my problem."
"We've got another show tomorrow night and I know it's terrible timing, but we need someone to pick the numbers."
You mean on TV?
I think you're a natural.
"No, I don't think so."
Here you go.
I was just talking to his nephew on the phone.
He couldn't even believe it was really me.
I felt like Fats Domino.
"Mr. Monk, this is Mr. Lawrence."
He's the station manager.
Hi.
He just asked me to be the new lotto girl.
"Oh, only for one night."
We can hold a regular audition over the weekend.
Fitzgerald?
"Whoa, easy."
Where did he go?
Who?
Fitzgerald.
Where did he go?
I have no idea.
Tell me or I'll take your head off.
I swear to God-- (GROANS)
Tell me.
Tell me!
Texas!
He said he was going to Texas.
He said he was gonna reenlist.
Then he started talking about property.
"""A decent piece of land."""
One.
One of the same people.
"Oh, one."
So one's okay.
We just let off one nuke at the Super Bowl.
"Oh, so now you want to micromanage something that you didn't even want to be involved in."
"I don't want to manage it, but don't you think we could maybe find someone competent who could?"
"Okay, whatever it is, I don't need to know."
I'll tell you what's going on.
"Jonah saw Moyes earlier today and Dan and Amy have, too."
And now Moyes is onto us.
Why did you just tell me that?
This is so much worse for me.
I was the field agent who gave Dan and Amy the mission.
I was the messenger.
I could be shot.
"- Bye, Mads."
- Why didn't he put on his trunks?
- What's he up to?
- What a nasty habit.
- You had his pecker in your face.
Swinging from side to side.
It almost hypnotised me.
- I always put on my trunks first.
- You owe it to your fellow man.
"Trunks, T-shirt, tie, socks..."
- I'm buying.
- Very well.
- It's good to see you happy again.
- I love being back at work.
It's done you a world of good.
Nursing Bodil was a full-time job.
- It runs you down.
- They take good care of her.
Gather all the retards in one place so we don't have to look at them.
"It's better to put them in a home, so we don't have to look at them."
- It's gross to watch cretins eat.
- Why do you say that?
Frank and I discussed it the other day.
What have we got here?
- Delicious.
- Congratulations on your new home.
- Is the bathroom finished?
- More or less.
Want to see it?
"Yes, please."
Casper keeps raving about it.
"- Very nice, Frank."
Mwah.
"One of our classic forehead smooches, just like I planned."
This is weird.
- Should we have sex?
- What?
- Huh?
- Yeah.
"I mean, no."
"- No, things aren't weird, or no to the sex?"
- Maybe we should just--
- You're right.
"Just concentrate on Figgis, and we'll figure this out later."
"- No, I was gonna say maybe we should talk, but yeah, it can wait till after Figgis."
- Ah.
- We have the rest of our lives to talk.
"- Yeah, unless he kills us first."
What a weird joke.
Regret saying that one.
"Wow, things are clickin'."
- I'm gonna go make sure there's enough balls in-- in the ball pit.
- Yup.
Important to get on them balls.
What is wrong with me?
"- So then Trevor sends me a text, and he's like,"
"""At this point, I hate you."""
"I'm like, ""Oh, really?"
"'Cause you didn't hate me last week."""
- Trevor sounds like a dog.
- Right?
"God, I missed our daily dishes."
- Me too.
"I'm sorry I'm not reciprocating with ""hot goss"" of my own."
All right.
If it's the truth.
It's all right.
She said... she had a dream she was pregnant.
I know this.
"Have you, um, have you seen the original?"
No.
It's in the National Galley.
"It's worth looking at, in the flesh so to speak."
It's very impressive.
Are you religious?
No.
"But, ah, I'm drawn to these images."
Why?
"Looking for reassurance, I suppose."
Have you found it?
No.
But I keep going back to look.
Just in case.
"So, um, what am I supposed to do about this Paul Fordyce?"
I'll let the police know and you should talk to them.
I can get them to pick you up from here if you like?
"Oh, no."
I'll be OK.
Silly boy.
I had a chat with the pathologist.
They're doing quite well.
What do you mean?
They're connecting you with three murders.
Don't get all hu_.
"It's the truth, isn't it?"
"We, or rather you, left a messier trail than I hoped we would."
I'm happy with you.
It's important for me to make his heart remember what his mind forgot.
But what matters the most to me is if he's safe.
Don't!
"Go ahead, Migs."
Take care.
It's already morning.
"Sorry, I got lost."
I even prepared food for you.
I'm sorry.
I couldn't understand what happened.
What?
You went to Bela?
.
Go ahead and explain your lies.
I'll make believe that nothing happened between the two of you.
I'd still listen!
Are we going to fight again?
.
"What, do you want me to be pleased?"
.
Don't I have the right to ask where you've been?
That Bela is really unbelievable.
"Because if I am the mistress, I would think of the wife waiting for you."
There.
Answer it!
And I want you to answer it in front of me.
Here!
Are you happy now?
.
Didn't you tell me that Bela is kind?
Maybe she's using her kindness to steal you from me.
- What's your name?
- Karen.
What?
"That's how you know a joke works, motherfucker."
"Oh, we're taking Karen."
"And, uh, we're leaving y'all with Nick Cannon."
So enjoy that shit.
I'm Jay Pharoah.
That's my time.
Thank y'all so much.
"¶ Big track up 'cause I'm about to go, cool ¶"
"Yeah, man!"
¶ I gotta get this together.
¶ But my wild side was like whatever ¶
"¶ My mom said, Jay, I'm worried ¶"
"Let me just--hey, you wanna give me some love."
Give me some.
Give me some love.
Give me some.

Get you some elbow.

¶ When you play a dark room
- I'm okay.
What a weirdo.
"You were scared, weren't you?"
The room's a bit cold.
Is it alright?
What about your friend?
Doesn't matter.
She likes me a lot.
And I don't like it too warm anyhow.
"Tomorrow, bean sprout soup."
Okay.
I'll make some delicious soup for you.
"Ah, what a day."
"Tired, huh?"
"Whenever you have time, you can stop by anytime."
Just come and rest in our room.
I'll play really nice songs for you.
"Oh, my!"
You've drunk so much all by yourself.
"I've come by myself, you see."
Why?
What about your companions?
I came alone.
That movie director came by today.
That man you came with last time.
Should I give him a ring?
He's probably too drunk.
"He came with another woman, you know."
"I began talking to him, and he said that woman resembled you very much."
- He said she looked like me?
"- Yes, that's what he said."
"I mean both of you are pretty tall, but you're far more beautiful."
- No.
No.
It ain't nothing.
- I just...
"- So that's your fine friend, is it?"
"The dirty, filthy brute!"
"If ever a man dared lay a hand to me like that, I'd..."
Well...
Aren't you going to introduce me to our charming visitor?
It's Marcia.
"This is my friend, Mr. Hyde."
"You've heard me speak about him, haven't you?"
"Oh, yes, Marcia."
I've heard a great deal about you.
I've never been interested.
Until now.
I've got to be toddling along now.
"- Toodle-loo, lvy."
"- Oh, no, no."
"Don't go now, Marcia."
"After all, this could be very interesting, the three of us in friendly discussion."
I can't keep my friend waiting.
"- I'll be dropping by, lvy."
"- Yes, yes, yes."
"Drop by sometime when I'm here, Marcia."
Your ideas differ from mine.
It would be a charming experience to change them.
Ivy found it that way.
"Didn't we, dear?"
Nice material.
Goodbye.
Very nice material.
See you later.
INTERVIEWER:
"So Joe, how's today going?"
JOE:
"Well, considering I just got here and I'm already tired,"
"Thirsty, and sweating like a pig,"
It's just another day at Tromaville.
[Set chatter]
INTERVIEWER:
So what's on the plate for today?
JOE:
"Well, today's my first appearance as Chester,"
The particle physicist.
"So there's going to be, you know,"
"What, my great love scene."
"There's going to be my first interactions with Toxie,"
A lot of mistaken identities.
INTERVIEWER:
So are you looking forward to all of this?
JOE:
I'm looking forward to getting it over with.
[Chatter] 10 minutes.
"I need Lloyd's approval, though."
[Chatter]
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
You should get the house
Of stupids here doing the sign.
You got eight people.
They can't get a sign up.
That's what you DVD.
This is the house of stupidity.
Can we do it now?
"You were expecting a package that day, some delivery?"
Not that I know of.
"Groceries, cleaning, uh, a package?"
I really wouldn't know.
"See, Karl takes care of all that."
I see.
Would you like to ask him?
"No, never mind, it's...."
It's very remote.
"No, never mind."
Yeah.
Would you like some more coffee?
Please.
That's cute.
"Your daughter, she's the artist?"
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.
"Incidentally, um you might ask your daughter if she remembers seeing Mr. Dennings in her room that night."
"Look, he wouldn't have any reason in the world to go up to her room."
"Oh, I know, I realize but if certain British doctors never asked, ""What is this fungus?"" we wouldn't today have penicillin."
Correct?
"Well, when she's better, I'll ask her."
"-Yeah, couldn't hurt."
-Okay.
"Uh, in the meantime...."
That's okay.
"-I really hate to ask you this, but--"
-What?
"For my daughter, could you please give an autograph?"
Of course.
"Uh, where's a pencil?"
Right here.
- No.
"Well, how do you know?"
Ronon is correct.
I can definitely sense it now.
A female.
Ellia?
Get out of the way.
"No, please."
Don't shoot.
She's not what you think.
"She is my daughter,"
she means you no harm.
She's a wraith.
"Maybe so, but she's different."
I swear to you.
Let me guess-- wraith with a heart of gold?
She doesn't feed.
She's never taken a human life.
How is that possible?
"Please, lower your weapons, and I'll explain it to you."
It's all right.
Father...
"No, I won't let them hurt you."
I raised her as my own.
"You live here, together?"
This was part of a mine before the last culling.
"It's not much to look at, I know, but we don't have much choice."
The people of the village would not understand.
"Gee, I wonder why."
The villagers told us there was a wraith in the forest.
It came here in a crashed ship 10 years ago.
10 years ago?
- It looks so good on you.
I've dreamed about this for so long.
- Do you wanna fire it up?
- I can't.
Blair and I have a meeting at Rouge Tomate.
That's cryptic.
Both.
So how are you today?
Miserable.
But at least college will be the fresh start it's supposed to be.
"No Chuck, no Nate."
"- No anybody, really."
- Except Gossip Girl.
- Forget I said that.
- It's okay.
I read them too.
"""Spotted:"
Chuck Bass in France.
Chuck Bass in Germany.
"Chuck Bass in Italy."""
I hope he has so much fun that they have to quarantine him.
- Open your present.
- What?
- It's to remind you of who you are.
- I love it.
I'm gonna put it up on my wall at Brown as soon as I get back from Europe.
Come with me.
I chased a guy for years who wasn't that into me.
And I'm going to a glorified state school.
My mother married an entertainment lawyer.
So I need to just stop moving and contemplate the failure of my life.
"When you're ready to start moving, you know I'll be here."
Oh.
"You made my favorite, mommy."
Alan?
I thought you were dead.
I am.
What's it like?
Lovely.
"Come with me, and I'll tell you all about it."
"Oh, wait."
Not yet.
There were lots of doors.
And... and...
Each door led to a different loved one from my life.
My mother.
Mom.
"And my brother, who died last year."
I-I moved easily from room to room.
"And I knew that there were many more rooms ahead that, in time, I would get to."
I wanted to go through those doors.
"Makes no sense, but..."
I feel that I will be going through them...
Soon.
And...
I'm looking forward to it.
Gosh.
"You have any more of that, uh... psilocybin lying around?"
- You serious?
- I want to see my mom.
You're just as likely to see zombies.
"- Well, I would love to see zombies."
- I knew you would.
"Don't you ever, you know, want to ha a spiritual experience?"
"Who are ""they,"" friend?"
"Marauders, maybe."
I don't know.
"The same ones that killed Silmser, huh?"
Maybe.
Now will you take these chains off?
Not yet.
That's Times' place?
That's right.
And it never runs dry?
So they say.
Get away from the rifle.
You are getting hasty.
You'll get yourself killed.
"I could die of thirst while you was being too careful, too."
- Anything in it?
- In what?
In the bucket!
"Well, it sure is heavy."
That was my shot foot you dragged me in here with!
- You gonna die on me?
- No.
- You still shoot?
- Yes!
"Friend, you wouldn't shoot me in the back?"
"Friend, if I was gonna shoot you, it wouldn't be in the back."
"Cover, please."
Just tell him to put that down on the floor.
That weapon gives him adult status.
Tommy... put it down.
Please.
"You hurt my sister, I'll kill you."
My mom is not sick.
She's not sick.
Okay.
Where you going?
Away.
With a man I met from est.
"What do you mean, ""Away""?"
Away.
I don't know.
"Uh, for a few days."
"We've, um had this emotional connection for some time, and we just want to see if there is something else there."
You're telling me you're going to have an affair?
Sandra?
I might.
I don't know.
At least I'm being honest.
Go ahead.
Tell me that you're not having an affair.
I'm --
You know what kills me about the whole thing?
"Is that you didn't have any idea anything was going on -- you, Mr. Counterintelligence Genius."
You just didn't see it?
So you either didn't want to know or you didn't care enough to pay attention.
Who is he?
"Oh, it doesn't matter, really."
"- Who is he, Sandra?"
Who is he?
- It doesn't matter who he is.
What are you gonna do -- go arrest him?
Sandra.
Sandra.
Are you leaving me?
That's quite good.
"Well, I don't know, it was very catty."
Hmm.
"Now if you want to ask me any questions, you can ask me through your animal."
Do I have to speak in the animal language?
That's what I said.
"""Why were you at Simon Cowell's house?"""
I went to see Simon Cowell.
"""What was it about?"""
"Can we stop asking the same question, please?"
"Yes, sorry."
This is a place of respite and I wish to meditate.
"Now, I will offer you guys the chance to join me if you'd so like to."
Would you like to?
"Yes, we'd love to."
Take a seat.
Of course.
Love to.
"Meditation, have you done it before, Dermot?"
Right.
Now I sense that you two are searching for answers on the outside.
Yes.
PHONE RINGS
Whose phone is that?
That's not my phone.
It's not my phone.
I gave Philip my phone.
It's coming from you.
Why can I hear it coming from this direction?
It's not my phone...
It's coming from here!
What's going...?
This is a smile.
"Yes, it is, 'cause you love your auntie Nai, don't you?"
Oh.
"Oh, isn't he beautiful?"
"When Maya was little, I used to just watch her breathe."
Isn't this the best?
Sure.
I am hogging the baby.
I'm sorry.
Who wants him?
It's Addison's turn.
"Oh, go, go, go."
Yes.
But you're coming back to me.
"Hello, Lucas."
He did just smile.
He smiled.
"Wow, this place looks different."
Pete...
I'm surprised to see you here.
"Unless you're my 2:15 appointment, in which case,"
I'm glad you're finally dealing with your kleptomania.
"Well, that's funny."
You're a funny guy.
"Look, I need to talk to you about Violet."
Are you sure this is a good time?
"Okay, I've been a little overprotective."
You mean territorial.
Whatever psychological term you want to use is fine.
I'm not here to argue with you.
"I told you when you brought her home from the hospital to her home, that was a mistake."
She wasn't ready to face the trauma.
I'm sorry to drag you into this mess.
"Tell me, who's behind all this?"
That's not my game.
I play by the rules.
I knew you would never tell me.
Take care ofJenny.
Weng won't stop until he kills you.
You'd better let me arrest you.
We'll stay here tonight.
"Sidney will bring me my money, and we'll leave tomorrow."
I'm scared those gangsters will find us here.
Don't worry.
This place isn't easy to find.
Why is it so dark?
I can hardly see anything.
"Jeffrey, turn on the lights."
Why don't you turn on the lights?
Jeffrey.
Please turn them on.
There's been a power failure.
Will your friend come back with the money?
I'm sure he will.
I'm sure he will.
Boss.
"Here's the $1 00,000."
Please check it.
You think he can kill Jeffrey?
"Boss, Sidney Fung is here."
What if he betrays you again?
I'd still consider him my friend.
He was so good to me.
- Where isJeffrey's money?
"Well, she's usually right."
She's been right about everyone else.
I lived a whole life with a woman I didn't even really like.
We traveled all over the world together.
And Ellen and I never even left the grounds.
"Well, actually I took you to the IMAX that one time."
"Yeah, but I wanted to take her to the Mayan ruins in Guatemala."
She really wanted to see those.
His picture's hanging here.
He got the license for this place.
Claire?
[Sighs] Gosh.
[Crying] Nobody told me anything.
- You just heard the news?
- When did he die?
- When did he die?
- He died a week ago.
- A week ago?
- A week ago.
My God.
[Crying]
"Claire, you were told."
You just don't remember.
- Pardon?
- You were told about it.
You just don't remember us telling you.
I wouldn't remember?
I must have been -
And we had a memorial for him here as well.
- When?
"- Uh, last week."
- Was I there?
"Like I said, an open book."
How would you know that?
"I spent many years in Neverland, home of the lost boys."
They all share the same look in their eyes... the look you get when you've been left alone.
"Yeah, well, my world ain't Neverland."
But an orphan's an orphan.
"Love has been all too rare in your life, hasn't it?"
You ever even been in love?
No.
I have never been in love.
I think this little guy is hungry.
(Laughs)
"Go ahead and get whatever you want, sweetie."
- I'm gonna get directions.
- I will.
"Hey, man."
How are you?
I've been better.
"Listen, my wife and I... are really lost."
"I'm trying to get to Eugene, and I think we've been going the wrong way."
Can you show me what's going on here?
"Where are we, first of all?"
"Okay, wait."
Do I look like a tour guide?
Why don't you buy the map?
Then I can help you.
Okay.
Okay.
Now your problem is... (Map rustles)
Is you're way up here.
You see that?
"(Door bell chimes) Oh, my God."
Good afternoon.
I'm Pedro Suarez.
- The manager is expecting me.
"- One moment, please."
ACCESS PROHIBITED TO NON-EMPLOYEES
It's this suitcase.
- Shall I open it?
"- Yes, open it."
The guy was really weird.
He had a problem with a guest.
What problem?
Something weird with a very young girl.
I think that's why he vanished all of a sudden.
Poof and he was gone.
"Rovira Galvez, Sebastian."
Sexual assault on a minor?
Whereabouts unknown...
A two-year-old warrant for his arrest...
Anything else?
Any friends who know him?
"No, he has no family."
Nobody in his town ever saw him again.
He didn't even go to his mother's funeral.
"Yeah, yeah."
Thank you very much.
The wages are nothing!
It's not enough to survive on!
You should know we're going through rough times.
Mr. Alfonso is offering 20% more than last year.
- 150 pesetas more per day.
- That's nothing!

Yes.

Rob?
Is it Anthony Joshua?
The boxing legend.
"You met him recently, didn't you?"
"Yeah, I did a documentary about him."
"I met Klitschko, the person he's fighting, as well."
They're such big man and it's so...
I feel pathetic.

Thank you so much for the hook-up.
"Hey, I ran into Todd, at Whitaker's, of course."
He told me you got a job working for the government.
Yeah!
"Yeah, President Bush and my dad were in the same fraternity."
"- Oh, that's right."
"- Oh, Jesus."
"Yeah, yeah, when he gave my dad that appointment at the Defense Department..."
- I became his right-hand man.
- Douche.
The President's supposed to be at our wedding...

- Yeah.
"Sounds like an incredible job, man."
"Hey, you really got some major connections to the top."
"If you ever need anything, I'm your man."

Sophie?
(Sophie) No.
Are you okay?
"(Sophie) It's not me, but I'm okay."
[sobbing continues]
"Sophie, why are you crying?"
When I heard what you said about the dresses...
It's just--
"It's almost, kind of like, you think I have bad taste or something."
No.
Caroline thinks you have great taste.
She does?
"Well, then she should say so."
Now.
"Well, Sophie, I think you have your own unique style."
"And I think... that I didn't hear the words ""great"" or ""taste."""
"Sophie, what do you even care what I think?"
Just say it!
"Sophie, I think you have great taste."
You do?
[Sophie laughs]
"Then, what are we doing sitting here?"
Let's go and get those dresses back!
I have aliens at home.
"So relax nicely, don't think about anything."
Life is beautiful.
You don't understand!
-I can't go any further.
-I know.
"-Life is beautiful, isn't it?"
-But I really have two aliens at home.
-A visit from another planet.
"-Well, great!"
"So you will rest at our place, and when you get out of here, you'll be as fit as a fiddle, won't you?"
-Doctor?
-Yes?
-We are full.
We are full.
So you won't rest at our place.
"But you'll go and rest in nature, and you'll be as fit as a squirell."
"Sister, write down."
Nature is the best doctor.
"Doctor, haven't you had enough of us yet?"
No?
-Don't you feel tired?
-Let me see.
You look bad.
Is there something wrong with you?
"No, I'm only a bit overworked."
"Cursed, fucking job!"
Where are you screwing around?
!
"-What's the matter, boss?"
-Watch your language!
Fuck watching my language!
- That's what I'm saying.
- His illness is your business.
"- Lf not mine, whose?"
"- Lf not now, when?"
Were you just talking about me?
"No, an old friend of ours, Gary."
"Oh, the guy with cancer?"
You told her?
She's not your wife.
"If I told you, you would've given it away."
- You don't think I can keep a secret?
"- No, but he would have read your face."
- You don't trust my poker face?
- Do you ever win at poker?
No.
Hey.
"Oh, I just saw your old boyfriend on TV."
- Jake Jarmel?
- Yeah.
I like those glasses he was wearing.
Where'd he get those?
- Why?
You don't wear glasses.
- I know.
But I need a new look.
I'm stagnating.
"I have to say, as a glasses- wearer, I take exception to that."
That's like me buying a wheelchair to cruise around in.
"Yeah, I've considered that."
"Look, how do I get in touch with this guy?"
He's having a two-day book signing at Walden's.
"You know, we had a really bad breakup."
Who the fuck asked ya anything?
I didn't even ask ya anything.
At least wait to hear what I'm going to say.
"All right, what?"
"Ok, what."
She won't go out with Italians alone.
She's prejudiced against Italians.
You fucking believe that?
In this day and age?
What the fuck is this world coming to?
I can't believe this.
"A Jew broad, prejudiced against Italians."
"Anyway, she won't go out with me alone without her girlfriend."
So you come along for her friend.
See?
I knew it. I knew it.
What the fuck is wrong with that?
-When is this?
-Tomorrow night.
"I can't tomorrow night, I gotta meet Tuddy."
You could meet Tuddy.
You could fuckin' come early and then still go.
-Why do you always do this?
-Don't give me that shit.
What did I ask you for?
A favor.
I do a lot of fucking favors for you.
I'm trying to bang this fuckin' broad.
You wanna help me out?
I don't understand you.
She's fuckin' beautiful!
Her fuckin' family they live in the Five Towns.
"Dale, it's Gig."
- His machine.
- Oh.
"Um, see, things have got a little bit sticky over here."
"Slight change of plans, nothing that your deft touch couldn't rectify."
So either swing by or call back.
That'd be marvelous.
- Thank you.
- Great.
- Slight snag though.
- What?
"Well, Dale - blesshim - has been doing favor after favor for us."
"If it's not one thing, it's the other."
So -
- So what's your point?
- [ Sighs ]
"If he's gets the ticket back for us, we'll have to give him more money."
- No.
No way.
NO.
- That would only be fair.
There is a limit to my classiness.
- Quite obviously.
- Shut up!
I'll handle this.
You just leave Dale out of it.
Bunch of morons.
I have to do everything myself!
- Hi.
"- Well, well, well."
Look who it is.
An old face from the past.
"Look,if I could provide you with the me from sevenrs ago,"
"I would say ""egg away,"" but it's been a while."
I'm a very different person.
Really?
"Dude,I was 26."
26-year-old women think they're the center of the universe.
I'm not...
I'm not like that anymore.
"I'm very,very different."
I'm more thougful and open and concerned about what's going on in other people's lives.
And you still have great timing.
# Happy birthday to you #
# Happy birthday to you #
"# Happy birthday,dear Johnny... #"
# Happy birthday to you #
# And many more. #
"Hey,that was fantastic."
It's Bella.
Um...
I'm at the shop.
I hope you're having a really nice party and a great birthday.
Okay.
Happy birthday.
Why aren't you at your party?
"Um,you sounded like you were choking when you called."
Thought I should come over and make sure you were all right.
You seem fine.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Happy birthday.
"So,you,uh... need some help?"
What are these?
I guess you could say I've had a romance with the West... since I was old enough to read.
- You miss that ocean?
- Sometimes.
"You know, I never learned how to ride."
Is that right?
Glendolene.
"It's a nice afternoon, John."
I enjoyed my lobster.
"And I know Mr. Horn did, too."
I'm glad you liked it.
"- Excellent afternoon, John."
- Joe.
Tom.
Giddap.
"The way I see this, you'll be a stock detective."
See that the rustling gets stopped.
You can stay here at the ranch... and I'll pay your wages as a cowhand.
$200 for every rustler that goes somewhere else... to ply his trade.
- Who do I report to?
- To me.
"And as far as you are concerned, you and Joe Belle never discussed this."
"And for that matter, neither have I."
Twenty-five.
Do I hear 25?
Would you bid 30?
Thank you.
Now a half.
Would you bid a half?
Would you bid 35?
40.
"Thank you, sir."
Now a half.
"Shh, shh, shh, shh."
[Cat purrs]
"Oh, you seem to have the touch."
[Cat yowls] Ow!
Majique!
I'm so sorry.
Are you okay?
"Yeah, it's an occupational hazard."
I'm sure she didn't mean it.
"She's a good kitty, aren't you, Majique?"
[Purrs]
[Trunk slams] Hey.
Where's the body?
"First floor, room at the back."
- It's a little messy.
"- Well, what do you we know?"
"Uh, male, mid-40s."
Looks like somebody took a weed wacker to this throat.
Checked in three weeks ago under the name Nathaniel Adams.
"Clerk says he kept to himself, paid his rent, listed his home as New York City."
There was no sign of forced entry.
Maid discovered the body about an hour ago.
You weren't kidding about the weed wacker.
Looks more like a hatchet.
Except his head's still here.
- Who rolled the body?
- Nobody.
That's the way the maid said she found him.
"Well, this body's been rolled."
The pattern on the carpet matches the blood on his shirt.
That could have been the killer.
"There's no wallet, nothing in his pockets."
"Hey, boss!"
Come
Must you wear such a big head on that small head of yours?
My old friend!
Mouna?
Seediqs from Toda
"You from Tnbarah Clan, over here!"
"Hey, young man, don't you make trouble here"
The tallest one is Mouna Rudo of Mehebu Clan from Tgdaya
You've come all the way here with so little meat for exchange?
Those of you from Toda are so shameless
Why don't you offer your hunting grounds to us for free?
"Mouna Rudo, don't be too proud"
I'm not afraid of you
"Mouna Rudo, I'm Temu Walis"
I'll cut your head off when I grow up
Temu Walis?
You won't have the chance to grow up
Is that Temu Cire?
"No, it's Temu Walis"
I mean that grown-up man
I don't know.
"Not someone famous, I guess"
"Gather up, young men!"
Come on!
Bring your weapons!
Come with us!
Quick!
Put these away!
Quick!
All young men come with us!
Run!
Good idea.
"May we search your room, sir?"
But of course.
I trust my map to the street you asked for was satisfactory?
It was.
Thank you.
- Did I get any messages?
"- Oh, yes."
A telephone message.
Alex Bohemia.
Did he leave a number?
Thank you.
You heard that woman.
This Suverov must have been looking for me.
"A stranger with your exact face... and according to the passport, your exact birth date... comes here and asks for directions to the very street where you live."
"A mystery, yes?"
An airline ticket from Nice to New York... and a New York driver's license.
Some U.S. cash.
He was born five minutes after you.
I kept both of you for three months.
But I was sick.
I couldn't nurse.
There wasn't even enough for one of you.
I needed the money.
I had to do It.
Tell me now.
Why did you choose me?
I didn't!
I didn't have the courage.
Somebody else did it for me.
- Somebody else?
- A lawyer from Paris.
That's so mean.
"Look, if you don't take this chocolate and leave me out here, then I can't work with you."
Please give me the chocolate so I can pull you up.
Fine.
"Okay, Gene."
You hold onto me.
Got it.
"Tina, you hold onto me."
Great.
And then I'll hold onto something in the bathroom.
And pretend it's a person holding onto me.
Like a boy or an 18-year-old boy.
Okay.
We're ready.
Ah... no.
"Bang-up job, everybody."
We got the chocolate in the caboose.
Like we planned.
The only problem is is that we are not in the caboose!
At least we have toilet paper.
You guys want any?
Thank you.
Ugh!
"Well, we're stranded."
"Our chocolate's on the train, and there's nothing around here for miles."
"My boy-dar isn't picking up anything, either."
"Oh, wait..."
"no, that's a deer."
We've got to get back to that chocolate before somebody else does.
"Guys, we're gonna be okay."
The train's coming right back here.
"Wait, what?"
- Hey!
You don't show the finger to the Boss.
Aren't you ashamed?
You thrashed Bajrang's men in Rajanwadi.
When someone's fit for a beating he's bound to get it.
But where's Bajrang?
He's been missing since you thrashed him.
No matter where the rat hides... you're going to blame me for it.
Boss.
You're acting too smart because Bajrang is still missing.
What will you do if you find him?
I will lock you up...
lock you up for assaulting him.
There's your man.
All the pain you took delivered him.
Now you beat him up along with me.
Now you'll be arrested too.
But... proof?
C!
C!
TV!
CCTV!
CC...
Inspector.
It's all about perspective.
Two strands of hair in a glass of milk seems gross... but on a bald head it seems too less.
From my perspective... the Boss did justice to the farmers.
Because...
The Boss is always right.
- Say it louder.
- Hail Goddess!
- Boss...
[Sighs] You mind if I...
Record this?
"Oh, this is not an interview."
We're just gonna have a talk.
- I record everything.
- I'd rather you not.
Thank you.
I want to apologize.
- You really don't have to.
"- No, I do."
I reacted emotionally to your article.
That was a mistake.
"You know, these people are my family."
"I'd kill for them, but I shouldn't have said what I said about you."
Or my father's cunt?
[Chuckling] Your your father's cunt.
Got a little personal.
"Well, you got a little personal, too."
- I don't think so.
- No?
Came after me.
"Came after my gym, my fighters."
You came after my son.
How is that not personal?
I write about MMA.
That's all fair game.
"Yeah, but your tone..."
You came after me.
How so?
"Well, you were writing shit that wasn't fact."
"Well, um, Nate lost his fight."
Ryan looked like anything but a champ.
"No, I'm not coming, I'm going to the fields."
"Come on, get in..."
No. I'm going to the farm.
"- Come on, I'll bring you back."
- No.
Why haven't you got out?
"Go on, get out."
Take the wheel.
Give my colleagues the keys.
Don't forget.
"Will he make it, doctor?"
"Yes, he just needed oxygen."
A jab and a respirator will put him right.
We've sent him to town.
Oxygen will save him.
- Where are you going?
- Down there.
There's a sick woman.
Perhaps you could see her.
All right.
- Do you mind?
"- No, no problem."
It's a miracle he survived.
He was lucky.
The stone got stuck before it struck his head.
Then some stones gave way.
"He was trapped, as if he was in a tiny cell."
He needed oxygen.
"If he gets oxygen, he'll pull through all right."
He was covered in dirt.

Well enough.
It's still fast and accurate.
You've got no way out.
Why are you doing this?
"You tell me, what's the alternative?"
- Where's the money?
- Give it to me!
I'm one step ahead.
Why didn't you shoot me in the head?
Maybe I'm no longer a professional.
I wish I could start all over again.
It's a pity...
- Give me the cash.

Give me the money first.
We owe it to him.
Hypocrite!
Do all killers have a sense of honor?
The world has changed.
Honor is now a dirty word.
"Sidney, sometimes I think you're not human."
You're more like a dog.
At least we have one thing in common:
We both use guns for a living.
But our motivations are different.
Right?
In some ways dogs are superior to men.

NARRATOR:
"BRANCH RICKEY, FERVENTLY ANTI-COMMUNIST,"
HAD URGED ROBINSON TO TESTIFY.
I HAVE BEEN ASKED TO EXPRESS MY VIEWS
ON PAUL ROBESON'S STATEMENTS IN PARIS
It's what marriage is all about.
I know.
I read it on the back of a matchbox.
"Basil, sometimes..."
"Seriously, Sybil, do you remember when we were first... manacled together?"
We used to laugh quite a lot.
"Yes, but not at the same time, Basil."
That's true.
"That was a warning, I guess."
"Should have spotted that, shouldn't I?"
"Zoom! ""What was that?"" ""That was your life, mate."""
"""Oh."
That was quick.
"Do I get another?"""
"""Sorry, mate, that's your lot."""
Basil.
Back to the world of dreams.
"Yes, dear?"
What are we going to do?
Give it another 15 years?
- About the money.
Do you...
"- Aw, she's left it in her room, or eaten it or something."
We'll get Manuel to go through the room.
Polly can check the lounge...
- I saw Polly with money just now.
"- Well, there you are."
"Quite a bit, too."
She was counting it in here.
"Well, it's probably hers."
"No, she's been very short lately."
I'll ask her...
I decided to find out.
- How much is she on the rim f or?
- Sixteen thousand.
Let's see what I can do with the same numbers.
Did you ride in on the killing?
Her horse stumbled.
Give me the 7-11 dice.
They're all 7-11 dice.
It depends on the player's talent.
- Not the luck?
- l was returning your compliment.
"You shoot honestly, we give you honest dice."
Open up the table.
"You won't mind if I watch, I hope."
"Not at all, if you think you can take it."
- What's the limit?
"- For Mrs. Chandler, no limit."
We shoot 2000.
- Seven.
- Seven the winner.
- The 4000 rides.
"- Ad infinitum, if you wish."
Eleven the winner.
"7-11, your system, Dusty."
"Once more, and we're even."
- We'd better stop with what we have.
"- No, we'll get even."
The house will change the dice.
"That's your privilege, f riend."
That squares you with the house.
You think there's something wrong?
"I never think when I gamble, I just feel."
For me and you
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world
I see skies of blue
And clouds of white
The bright blessed day
The dark sacred night
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world
Yes
I think to myself
What a wonderful
"Yes, dude!"
What the fuck?
What the fuck?
What are you doing?
"I'm taking the most incredible dump of all time, man."
You couldn't wait till I got out of the shower?
May I remind you that we both just ate 30 burgers... and four large orders of fries?
"Don't worry, in a little bit, I'm sure it'll hit you too."
It may be.
But I'm gonna wait till you get out of the shower.
"Well, don't wait too long."
We've got to leave for the airport in an hour.
"Ooh, that burns."
- An hour?
"- Hey, and, Roldy?"
Yeah?
Nice pubes.
Ooh wee
Ooh wee
When I step into the party all the ladies wanna know
Read me what I said yesterday.
"That's not exactly the idea, Mrs. Slocum."
It's a cross-examination.
That's where they catch you if you're lying.
Shh.
Fire away.
I'll answer your questions.
"Thank you, ma'am."
Let's start with de Mario.
De Mario?
Yes.
He says that he brought Mrs. Nash home at approximately 1:45 a.m.
"Now, does that check with you?"
Check.
Do you have anything further to say about this?
No.
"And he left immediately after with you in the car, right?"
Right.
What did he talk about on the way home?
Nothing.
Nothing?
Nothing.
"Well, didn't he say anything when he dropped you off?"
Nothing.
Nothing?
Nothing!
"Well, he must've said something when he dropped you off, Mrs. Slocum."
"He said, ""Good night."""
"Now, look."
"De Mario has been unable to account for his time... from then until 4:00 a.m. Now, exactly what time did you get home?"
"They can't prove it, Lottie."
"Now, don't say another word until you see a lawyer."
Get off her!
- This is my favorite part.
- Which part?
I was lucky to get out of rebecca's apartment alive.
She threw this at my head.
Finn was reading moby dick?
"No,she was throwing it."
I took it so she couldn't re-arm.
"Okay,let's see what he had at siri's place."
- Razor and a toothbrush.
- Razor and a toothbrush.
Three pairs of white underwear.
Three pairs... pinkish underwear.
One black sock with a gold toe.
Don't you hate it when you leave one black sock at one fiancee's house and the other one at the other's house?
One pair of blue jeans.
And one blacmesh t-shirt.
Do women really like these?
Depends on who's wearing it.
- So if I... - no.
Not much to go on.
Only one place left to check.
Tony just put his hand in ather man's pocket and it made him very happy.
I found a pre-paid calling card.
- That's it?
- Yes.
No engagement rings?
"You want those,too?"
I'll go to siri's and get the ring and any other gifts finn might've given her.
"Mcgee,you've got rebecca."
How uid they have been so clueless?
"Well,he's dead,so maybe they weren'T."
That's lovely.
Yes.
Alicia's loving it.
"Lovely, because from death emerges life."
From the male emerges the female.
Of course.
From the earth emerges...
The...
The... tree?
No.
From the earth emerges...
The... flowers?
No.
The ethereal.
"The ethereal, the impalpable, the ghostly."
Of course.
And I've got the music.
By Penderesky.
"It's for the victims of Hiroshima, World War II, but no matter."
Of course not.
And anyway Alicia remembers it perfectly.
That's the music for the battle.
It's brutal.
"And for the music for the deaths,"
I've got a masterpiece that you're going to hear right now.
You're going to flip out.
"Alicia, my dear, farewell."
Oh... dear...
Take care.
"You take care too, Katerina."
Though you look gorgeous.
"""Trenches"" must be made."
I didn't know.
Let's have a listen.
Could you take those downstairs for me?
And this trunk has to go.
(STARTS PLAYING)
"Franz, Chopin's going out."
We'll come with you so we can talk.
I'm going to meet Madame Sand.
- This is wonderful!
- You play it better than I.
You're going on a trip?
Franz!
Chopin is going to meet Madame Sand.
Franz thinks you're making a mistake.
He's in a position to caution you.
He once had his own experience with George.
"- Marie, I told you nothing happened."
- So you love to claim.
"You must listen to him, because, one way or another,"
Franz knows exactly who she is.
GEORGE:
I've always wanted to know.
"See here, darling."
Chopin has dedicated the Etudes to you.
To me?
It is a tremendous honour.
"What did you do to deserve it, I wonder?"
Marie is an angel of inspiration.
"It's good to see you, Franz."
You should come back to Paris more often.
We all get into such trouble when you're away.
Where are you taking him?
Oh.
Me neither.
I like to keep off the grid.
(Door opens and closes)
(Crow cawing in distance)
Yeah.
All right.
Let's do it.
Does this really seem like a good idea?
"I mean, mom won't even let me make toast."
"Oh, come on now."
Put her in drive.
There you go.
Now give it a little gas.
I'm so nervous.
"Well, there's nothing to be nervous about."
"Worst-case scenario, we both die, and that's gonna happen at some point anyway."
(Engine rumbling)
(Tires screech)
Okay.
(Chuckles) I'm driving!
(Tires screech) (Whispers) Driving.
"Okay, now keep your eye on the road!"
"Jeez, I learned that lesson the hard way."
"Hey, this is kind of embarrassing, but, uh, could you give me your name one more time?"
Is it... (Vehicle approaches)
(Brakes squeal)
"Hey, dad."
We had the best day.
"Uncle Rusty took me out of school, and we ate ribs, and I bowled a 39."
"I learned that I do not like beer, though."
Oh. (Laughs) He did pretty well.
I don't even know where to start.
So that's why I left.
That's why I went on this trip.
"Just to get away and make, you know, all the memories that I can... while I can."
And I know I gotta talk to her and I gotta just...
But not on this.
"You know, I just..."
I'll deal with it.
"I'll deal with it when I get back, you know."
I'll just...
"You're a good guy, Cooper."
Call your mum.
"Zero, zero, one, nine, three, nine, two, nine."
"No, I did not buy a pair of sandals in Koh Samui last night because I'm in..."
And how long does that take?
Because I need to buy a ticket back to America.
"Oh, my God."
Mm-hmm.
"Can I just say, this is the most blatant cover story for a second hook-up ever?"
Yes!
Yes!
"Oh, my God."
"Thank you, thank you, thank you."
Alright.
Don't forget your bag.
"The bag, yep, my bag."
Alright.
You are a top bird.
"I don't know what that means, but I heard somebody say it once, and you're it."
I got a plan.
Yeah.
It's odd jobs.
I'd like to ask you a few questions.
You don't mind do you?
-Recording your doing.
-Turn it off...now.
"If she doesn't want, she doesn't want."
Why?
nasty things this morning?
you know where they have the drugs?
How should I know?
Ask Jack.
Drugs?
"Don't be impatient, be cool."
"Brian was right, your roof is perfect."
This fucking city is really something.
What have you done to yourself now.
She can't hide it.
A chicken is a chicken.
Come on Jimmy.
You're both so beautiful and you look alike.
Be nice.
I'm not a chicken.
-Ouch!
-I'm sorry Jimmy!
I didn't know your scalp was so sensitive.
"Now don't get anything dirty, and tape the tags on the inside"
It's not necessary to cut them.
Where's the cocaine?
Dwayne?
"Would you fix us a few lines, darling?"
"Here, I've got some blow too, baby."
I'd like to ask you a few questions over your childhood.
"Come here, legs."
It's humiliating.
Yeah?
"How much did you lose, 500?"
A grand?
This is a way for us to get close again.
"Hey,"
I almost got killed a few weeks ago.
Sorry if it's affected your sex life.
That's not what I meant.
"Why don't you tell them,princess?"
Huh?
It was 3.
"Ladies, tango comes from the portuguese"
"""tangere."""
To touch.
It's all about touch.Not talk.
"Turns out talk is cheap,bro,huh?"
"A little tight,don't you think?"
It's fine.
We'll adjust it when we get in the ambulance.
"Man,look at this,my fingers are turning blue."
"I'm thinking your boyfriend's the senior guy here, maybe he can take a look."
My partner is busy.
I can wait.
"You didn't mean ""senior guy,"" did you?"
You meant white guy.
Is that what you meant?
Ha ha!
That's what he means.Kick his racist ass!
"You,shut up."
"And you, a little respect,or we'll leave you all here."
"I don't need your help,son."
She's mad at you now.
Has been for about a week.
- So is she...
- Pulling...
To the right?
Red 23!
"Excuse me, Miss."
Hi.
- You dropped this.
- Keep it.
Maybe you'll get lucky.
That's what I'm hoping.
Red 21!
Holy bananas.
You're really mad at me.
"- I feel sorry for you, actually."
- Why is that?
Because of all the things right in front of your face that you refuse to see.
Like what?
Like me.
"Oh, well."
I need to ask you a question that only the real Myka would know the answer to.
You know what?
"You're wasting time, 'cause Pete's in danger."
"Yeah, well, so are you, right?"
In danger if you're who you say you are?
"Okay, fine."
Here's what you and I both know but we never talk about it.
All right?
That I don't trust you.
That I need you to tell me the truth.
And to not treat me like some chess piece that you move around on a board that only you can see.
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
I have a restraining order!
"Trust me, I restrained myself."
"You can't tell Derek, okay?"
There's a lot more to this that you don't know about.
And just because you got the Alpha bite makeover doesn't give you a license to go around destroying people.
Why not?
That's all anybody ever used to do to me.
I used to have the worst crush in the world on you.
"Yeah, you, Stiles."
And you never once even noticed me.
Exactly how you're not noticing me right now.
Guys!
What the hell's going on?
Hey!
Enough!
Enough.
What do you idiots think you're doing?
Jackson!
Calm down!
"Mr. McCall, you wanna explain yourself?"
You dropped this.
You and you... actually... all of you...
Detention. 3:00.
"Hi, there."
"Oh, I'll make an announcement, have Scott brought to the office."
"Um, actually..."
I came here to talk to you.
Me?
Busy after school?
Always.
I WANT A BALLPLAYER
WITH GUTS ENOUGH NOT TO FIGHT BACK.
THINK YOU'VE GOT GUTS ENOUGH TO PLAY THE GAME
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS?
NARRATOR:
"BUT IT WAS A ONE-DIMENSIONAL PORTRAIT,"
HELPING TO SOLIDIFY MYTHS ABOUT ROBINSON
THAT WOULD PROVE STUBBORNLY HARD TO DISLODGE.
SO I HAUL OFF AND PUNCH YOU RIGHT IN THE CHEEK.
WHAT DO YOU DO?
"MR. RICKEY, I'VE GOT TWO CHEEKS."
GOOD.
[SPECTATORS CHATTERING]
NARRATOR:
"THAT SEASON, JACKIE'S ASSERTIVENESS"
BEGAN TO RANKLE MANY IN THE BASEBALL WORLD.
ROBINSON WAS CERTAIN THAT UMPIRES
WERE TREATING HIM DIFFERENTLY...
"MAKING BAD CALLS, TAUNTING HIM,"
THROWING HIM OUT OF GAMES WITH LITTLE PROVOCATION
BECAUSE HE WAS BLACK.
"LATER, THE ""SPORTING NEWS"" WOULD CALL HIM A ""CHRONIC GRIPER,"""
AND HE WOULD BE FALSELY ACCUSED
OF KICKING IN THE DOOR OF THE UMPIRES' DRESSING ROOM.
EARLY:
HE HAD A KIND OF FURY IN HIM.
"I THINK FOR THE PUBLIC, IT WAS MORE IMPORTANT FOR THEM"
TO SEE A BLACK MAN ARGUING AND BEING FEISTY.
IT WAS MORE IMPORTANT FOR THE PUBLIC TO SEE THAT
THAN TO SEE THE ROBINSON THEY SAW AT FIRST.
NARRATOR:
"MEANWHILE, BRANCH RICKEY"
- Yeah.
"Okay, ready?"
"Here, give me your foot."
The secret tattoo.
"My best friends Sport, Janie and I thought we should be blood buddies."
But this was so much less painful.
Just remember the rule.
If anyone sees the secret tattoo swift and painful death.
It's... starting.
Here comes... nice Marion Hawthorne.
It's happening.
I can feel it happening.
Good Lord.
It's the dreaded Hawthorne effect.
Oh.
"Good morning, Janie, Simon... and Harriet."
Harri... et!
I got to get to class.
See ya.
See you guys in a few.
Sixth grade.
All the usual suspects are back in action.
"First of all there's Rachel Hennessy,"
Marion's second in command.
The only thing more pathetic than being Marion Hawthorne is wanting to be Marion Hawthorne.
"Pinky Whitehead, the human fish belly."
"If Janie's theory is right, then Pinky's DNA was combined with a pint of vanilla yogurt at birth."
Carrie Andrews thinks she's cool... 'cause she spent her summer vacation growing boobs.
Laura Peters looks like someone pinched her face and it stuck that way.
The boy with purple socks.
A man of mystery.
He never talks.
What?
"This is your wake-up call, Mr. Klein."
I didn't ask for a wake-up call.
"What happened to you, Mr. Klein?"
I can't believe I got through.
"Gordon, where are you, man?"
Speak up.
"Listen, John, he was right."
Mr. Cold was right about everything.
Right?
Right about what?
I can't hear you.
He was right about understanding.
"It's real, John."
I want you to know.
- It's real.
- What is...
What are you talking about?
You've got nothing to worry about.
I'll see you in time.
Gordon?
Can they tell how long he was out there?
Looks like he's been dead about eight hours.
He died of exposure.
What made you come out here?
- He called me.
- When?
I didn't like the way he sounded.
"When did he call you, John?"
About an hour ago.
I can't stand this.
It didn't seem right to bring this up at the funeral... but as far as I know there's never been any accidents at the chemical plant.
Couldn't win this war without them.
Captain.
I'm sort of new out here.
What's this all about?
"Muldoon and MacDaniel, in those choppers fly low over the treetops and hope to draw V.C. Gunfire."
You mean there are V.C. That close?
Yes.
"Mr. Beckworth, I have V.C. In my own strike force."
Pardon me.
I have to check the perimeter.
"There they are, building a boat bridge."
MacDANIEL:
"They're not Cong, they're hard-core regulars."
Petersen you worry me.
Three tours of duty and you're still acting like a civilian.
"Sergeant Muldoon, I'm not a Marine."
I believe in my comfort.
We got the tin.
What about the .50 caliber?
Don't worry.
Next drop.
How'd you do it?
A guy in Khe Sahn wanted 2 cases of bourbon.
Bourbon!
How'd you get 2 cases of bourbon?
From a straight leg in supply in Bien Hoa.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Why would he give you that much booze?
He didn't give it to me.
I traded him for it.
Traded him what?
- No.
- Not you either?
Willy Kos... no.
I've never heard of that name.
Why?
Because she had his passport with her.
Stained with blood..
And forged.
You know nothing about this?
"No, how would I know with whom this crazy woman has associated with."
"I let her work with me out of pure compassion and good-heartedness upon her arrival from the East Zone, and for that I'm now interrogated!"
Hold on.
Bring the woman in here!
There's a possibility she might remember you.
- But what if she is dangerous?
"- What could she possibly do to you, Anna?"
"Don't worry, she's complety harmless."
My God.
She really is crazy.
Pauline.
Mrs John.
"Pauline, oh my goodness."
What has Bruno done to you?
Bruno?
Bruno!
BRUNO!
What is it?
Let me go!
Everything is like it should be.
"See, she really is insane!"
"So you recognize me, right?"
Did you beat me?
"Well, she barely spoke English, so..."
Okay.
"Well, thanks anyway."
"You got it, kid."
JURY DISMISSAL:
KYLE WADE WHITE MALE A REALLY BIG GUY
What are those?
- Prayer beads.
They're beautiful.
"- Yes, well, it's very important to put your nervous energy into something, huh?"
Do you have any more of them?
Hello?
"- Ginny, thank God."
You need to go to Uncle Peter's house.
Stay there until I tell you to come back.
Visit gross Uncle Pete?
Hard pass.
So did that cute Ryan guy ask about me?
Is he single?
For once in your life just do what I ask.
- What is the matter with you?
Don't give me a hard time.
"Just go to Uncle Peter's house and do not come back to the hotel, okay?"
Just go now.
"Okay, okay, I'm going."
"Hey, Clark."
"Hey, I know you said that we can't use an iPad, but what about an eReader?"
- That's a good question.
I don't see why not.
"- Yeah, there's no Wi-Fi."
"I mean, there's no connection to the outside world, so..."
That's a question for the judge.
–Beauty.
You got the address?
"–Yeah, sure."
"–Oh, geez."
–Corrine...
Don't run away.
Just hear me out for two seconds.
"Look, this running has to stop."
How much time could you possibly need?
"This isn't about me, Vic."
"It's about our kids, about them being safe."
Do you honestly think I'd put my children in danger?
"Not intentionally, but the things going on in your life..."
Something told me to run.
School's back in session.
Matthew needs to be at Glenridge.
He needs his routine.
Cassidy needs to see her friends.
This isn't gonna change things between us.
Don't punish them because of me.
"I'll move out if I have to, if that's what it takes."
But I need to know that they're at home where they can be safe.
I don't...
"I don't know, okay?"
I'll think about it.
"Hey, how'd your meeting with I.A.D go last night?"
Good.
Good.
You ran out of here so quick.
They told me not to discuss it with anyone.
But it went fine.
Anything yet?
"One at a time, if you please."
"Yes, you sir."
A whiskey?
"Why, of course."
Be my pleasure.
This here's our finest single malt.
Join you?
I'd be honored.
"To your health, sir."
[EZRA laughing ] I have an idea.
"About what, a bank we can rob?"
About food.
"I think we should offer something to eat, like the hotel does."
Try it.
"Muchas gracias, señorita, but I am drinking my dinner."
Have you lost your mind?
The sign outside says drinks for a penny.
What next?
Pay people to come in here?
"My God, at this rate you'll be broke in no time."
"Well, isn't that the object of your little exercise, Mother?"
Might as well help it along.
MAUDE:
"Oh, and that you have."
I have just come from the bank...
... wherel discovered that you paid your own money...
... tobuythisglorifiedshack.
"Well, who else's money was I supposed to use?"
Somebody else's.
Anybody else's.
-Right.
"-Ezra, rule number one:"
- Just runnin' around.
- Who sent you down here?
Don't talk back.
- What are you doin' here?
- We saw the car.
We was breaking down the tyres.
That's all it was.
Lock 'em up.
"Come on, come on!"
Nothin' but a bunch of lousy spic car thieves!
- Nothin' there except a New York City map.
- Are you bullshittin' me?
That car's dirty.
Take it in and tear it apart.
Tear it out.
"Nothin' here, Jimmy."
This is all solid.
There's nobody been under that car since it came from the factory.
That thing is clean.
"I don't buy that, Irv."
The stuff is in that car.
"Well, you find it."
I can't.
Enfiin on ne va pas passerlajournée ici.
Ça fait deuxheures qu'on estlá.
Soyez patient.
"Look, the car was lost sometime last night."
"First they send us to Pier One, then here."
Then what?
Why did you park the car down by the waterfront?
You're staying in midtown Manhattan and you lose the car by the Brooklyn Bridge?
Monsieur Devereaux is scouting locations for a film for French television.
Okay.
The first letter's a B.
A. It's an A.
I think it's gonna tell us who A is.
D?
B-A-D.
Bad.
That's the whole message?
Bad?
- What's it supposed to mean?
- It means you got punked.
Toby doesn't trust us.
I don't blame him.
I don't think he'd mess with us like this.
You'd be surprised what people are capable of.
"Guys, we have to figure this out."
"This might be a joke, but it could be real."
"Look, either way, Toby's not the enemy."
"You know what, guys?"
I'm gonna go.
What was that all about?
How should I know?
Doesn't look like very much.
"Well, it's all we have."
The rest is gone.
"Mom, Mrs. Potter doesn't need that money anymore."
"No, but we can't keep it."
"No, not keep it but I don't know, maybe we could give it to somebody who needs it."
I love you for thinking that but I just want this nightmare to be over.
I'm putting the money back in the safe deposit box.
What is left of it.
- I'll see you tonight.
He was here just now!
You'll be dead if I catch you
This is such a small place
Where can he hide?
I'm here!
"You bastard, you bastard!"
I'm so mad!
"Gao, how come you're so slow?"
I'm coming!
Coming!
You will have it for sure
"Y es, I'll be right there!"
"Gentlemen, take your time!"
Coming!
That way please!
"Gentlemen, have some tea"
What would you like?
"Whatever is good here, we'll take it!"
"Y es, yes, will be right here!"
Hurry up!
Just get whatever dishes here
"Anyway, we can eat as much as we want"
When we get to the home of Thunderstorm!
What're you rushing at?
Brother Y an is really smart
He can turn the home of Thunderstorm ...to be his own camp
What about Shi Zhengzong?
That coward
Of course he won't dare to fight back!
"Come, a toast!"
What happened?
You messed up again!
I can't eat here.
I got to go someplace where they make food that I like.
"Lemon, let's go."
I will not work with Tracy Jordan.
It's just a rumor.
Have you seen any of his movies?
The guy's sensibility is just cretinous.
"I saw the one where he plays, like, five different characters."
"Yeah, ""Black Cop, White Cop."""
No.
"""Who Dat Ninja""?"
"No, he... he had to pretend to be this old lady."
"[High-pitched voice] Ooh, ooh, goodness gracious!"
You hooligans better watch out!
[Normal voice] 'Cause this honky grandma be trippin'!
"Oh, yeah, that movie was hilarious."
"I saw it, like, five times."
Where's the love?
[Indistinct shouting]
Right on.
"Hey, let me get two half a chickens and some pecan waffles."
Nothing for me.
"I had, like, four hot dogs this morning."
"Eat, Lemon, eat."
I hate skinny women.
"Hey, Lana, 10 beers."
"So, Tracy, we should talk about the show."
I ain't doing it unless I can get to do it my way.
"You know, I want it to be raw, HBO-style content."
"Well, it's not HBO."
It's TV.
And I don't think that it's a good fit.
We have an eyewitness that saw him dump a body.
- Even you said it was a cop.
- I said it could be.
Now we have a witness that said it wasn't.
"- Dad, let's go in."
"- Sit down, I'll be right with you."
Go ahead.
Sit down.
I'll be right in.
I don't want any problems with you.
Do you understand me?
You should be glad we caught him.
Where is he?
"They're going to throw the book at him, Nick."
Your son or not.
The criminal court of Pennsylvania is now in session.
The sentencing for the State versus Detective Jimmy Detillo.
The Honourable Judge Hellen Kramer presiding.
"- Mr. Gunther, where is your client?"
"- We don't know, Your Honour."
Jimmy...
"Son, listen to me."
Listen to Daddy.
We'll talk to them.
We'll work something out.
Mama went off this bridge.
You remember?
They never found her.
"Jimmy, you don't have to do this."
"Cops don't go to prison, Dad."
I don't go!
Are you gonna give him a push?
- We're not all bumpkins.
So I'm not under arrest?
You didn't steal anything.
You didn't hurt anybody.
No breaking and entering.
You've had trouble with him before?
Gordy and Denise?
No.
They're good people.
Things have just been a little strange around here lately.
You still haven't told me what you're doing here in the middle of the night.
I don't know.
Where am I?
Think you could show me where we are on the map here?
We're right on the state line.
With Ohio.
- What time did you leave DC?
1:00 in the morning.
"If I was doing 80 the whole way, it would've taken me six hours to get here."
- There's gotta be a logical explanation.
- I don't know.
"By the way, don't worry about your pal the governor."
I'll take care of it.
Yeah.
Okay.
"Thanks, Eddie."
- So?
"- It's running fine, Mr. Klein."
- Can't find a thing wrong with her.
- Really?
Strange.
"- All right, what do I owe you?"
"I think treating her like a person, the kid's in love."
"You know, maybe she's in love with the possibility of something solid."
"I'm what she aspires to, a role model or something."
"Because if you're crossing the line, then it's you who's messing up."
"Yeah. I hear you, lieutenant."
LARSON:
"Hey, I gotta talk to you."
LlCALSl:
Okay.
"-What's going on, Janice?"
-Nothing.
Then how come the duty roster's paired me with Sackler?
Because I asked for a new partner.
-lf it's because I blew that undercover-- LlCALSl:
No.
LARSON:
Then what?
I don't think you are a safe or reliable partner.
-l can't believe I'm hearing this.
-You want it straight?
-You have a substance abuse problem.
-A what?
Substance abuse?
is that what your friend Kelly's saying?
"Okay, Roy, why don't we just drop this, okay?"
This is not about Kelly.
"And the thing I said, maybe I'm wrong."
All I know is that I'd feel...
... morecomfortablepartnering with somebody else.
-l can't argue with that.
-No hard feelings?
No.
You've created a life for yourself and a totally new path.
It's wonderful.
"I wish you good luck, Michael, and hope you visit us soon."
- I will.
"- Goodbye, Michael."
"Boy, you really knocked it out of the park in there."
I quit.
Seriously?
- Oh!
How'd it go?
- Great.
I quit.
Can you give me a ride to the airport?
Sure.
- You quit?
- I'll get my things.
"I didn't get what you meant at first, about me being afraid of something else, but I get it now and I know what it is."
Did you plan all this?
involved...
"Well, there was a certain amount of planning"
"No, it was instinct."
He's good.
- He's like a brain detective.
- What was the epiphany?
I don't wanna say it till I know I'm right.
I guess this is the end.
Of?
Therapy.
"I mean, you got me where I needed to be."
You literally drove me there.
"Well, therapy's never really over, remember?"
"Well, not for me, maybe, but..."
I didn't know his body was there!
I told you.
I followed you to apologise.
- I believe you.
- It's true!
Of course.
The transfer linkage you asked for.
About time.
Any news from the search parties?
No.
"No, there won't be."
"It was an unlikely idea, keeping out of sight for the length of time this ship has been in flight."
Not really possible.
I agree.
So who do you think it is?
- Mandrian.
- Why?
Instinct.
I discount Dr Kendall.
I thought you mistrusted instinct?
"I do, so I am probably wrong."
"It could be him I told you I heard him quarrelling with Sara, didn't I?"
"Sonheim makes me uneasy, too."
He would be next on my list.
The answer is here.
If only we could see it.
I knew you'd be here.
[DISTANT METEOR IMPACTS]
How far are we in now?
Halfway I can't be sure.
The detectors are swamped.
The force wall's eating into our power reserves.
A man came by here earlier today.
He said it was wooden buckshot.
"Told me if anyone got in our way,"
I'm supposed to shoot 'em.
What else did he say?
If Abby didn't find the location of some coffins...
I'm supposed to shoot myself.
What about me?
What did he say about me?
I'm not supposed to hurt you.
Are you sure?
Because...
These ropes are so tight that it is hurting me.
What can I do to help?
"Every time I move, the wood shifts inside of me."
I can feel it scraping against my heart.
You need to get the pieces out.
Aahh!
What took you so long?
I've been hiding behind your witchy friends.
"And in squalor, no less."
Insulting a bunch of dead witches...
Not smart.
I made the exact same mistake first time I came in here.
"Well, you know the funny thing about the witches is that living or dead, they care about their own."
A hundred dead witches have a thousand living descendents...
And I have no problem killing every last one of them if I don't get my coffins back.
"As we speak, my hybrid friend is prepared to end the Bennett line."
Now.
Please...
Show me the coffins.
Here we are.
Whose car's out front?
That's mine.
I'm Bonnie.
Your daughter.
"Hello, Bonnie."
How do you know this is going to work?
It's a process.
It took decades to train myself to resist compulsion.
The brain's like a muscle.
"The more you use it, the more it can do."
"A sire bond, at its core, is about one thing..."
Gratitude.
"If you believe you owe Klaus your life, ask yourself why."
I was cursed.
"Every full moon, I had to change into a wolf."
It was torture.
Klaus took that away.
Freed you from your pain and you feel indebted to him.
"To break the sire bond, you've to make yourself turn."
"Own your pain, then you'll owe Klaus nothing and you'll be free."
But how can he turn?
It's not a full moon.
He doesn't need one.
"You're a hybrid now, right?"
"I mean, you can turn at will or not, am I right?"
"Yeah, but I don't know how to just...Start."
Now you're making excuses.
You don't understand!
"When I turn, I break every bone in my body."
You asked for my help.
This is the only way.
How badly do you want your freedom?
Nah.
What if I just spruce up your... duds for you a little bit?
"Okay, sure."
Why not?
Since you're up for it and all.
Just don't make them too... froufrou-y.
Deal!
Look out below!
Sorry.
New trick.
Didn't quite work.
Idea!
"I'll make you an outfit for the Gala too, Rainbow Dash."
Outfit for the what now?
I'll make one for you and you and all of you.
Oh!
And of course Pinkie and Fluttershy too.
"Oh, and when I'm done, we can hold our very own fashion show!"
What a great idea!
If you're sure you can handle it.
"Oh, it'll be a little bit of work, but it will be a wonderful boost for my business."
"Plus, fun!"
"Oh, I love fun things!"
Then it's settled.
We'll have a fashion show starring us.
"So all you have to do is make a different, stunning, original... ...amazing outfit for one, two, three, four, five... plus yourself, six ponies?"
And lickety split?
"Oh, Applejack."
You make it sound as if it's going to be hard.
"Thread by thread, stitching it together"
Twilight's dress Cutting out the pattern snip by snip
Making sure the fabric folds nicely
Bite its throat and suck up the blood.
"Suck up the blood, and you will be powerful."
"I heard that you've been wearing a veil, not letting anyone to see your face."
"If someone sees you, you'll either kill him or marry him;"
Is that true?
Yes.
Great.
"Now, remove the veil, and let me have a look."
"Hurry, if you don't,"
I'll strip you naked.
You're the first man who has seen my face.
"I could only marry you, since I won't kill you."
You're my husband.
So pretty.
"After I've killed him, and you can be a merry widow."
You saw that?
"If you dare to touch me, he'll kill you."
Who cares!
The Red Python is dead
Who killed it and sucked up all its blood?
I did.
Great.
The Red Python lives in the hills.
"It feeds on ginseng, and the deer antlers."
"After thousands of years, its colour has turned red."
"Whoever drinks its blood, exercises internally, and he will acquire ""Red Dragon Soul"" style."
This is good news.
I know martial arts.
What are you laughing at?
"The ""Red Dragon Soul"" won't hurt me."
All I have to do is suck up your blood.
Then I'll be invincible.
"I won""t get anything in this deal. kaka sir!"
Where will you run?
Beg! lmplore!
"But I won""t spare you!"
"Tiger singh, please let me go!"
Forgive me!
You will surely die!
I have to settle old scores with you! scores with me?
"Yes, you!"
20 years ago the man who was the in-charge of Goga lighthouse.. ..his soul is still waiting for revenge!
But what is your connection with this?
"Won""t a son take the revenge of his father""s death?"
"Why, scoundrel?"
"Tiger singh, forgive me!"
"Don""t kill me!"
"For God""s sake, forgive me!"
"Today even God can""t save you!"
"Go and drown! come, shekhar! sP, my mission is over."
And I surrender myself.
"I was waiting for this day only, shekhar!"
I have found out about your helplessness.
But you have committed a grave mistake.. ..by taking law in your hands.
I wish you had told me this before.
But I will try.. that the law is lenient with you.
"Taking into consideration the police""s recommendation.. ..for taking law in your hands, you receive.. ..7 years imprisonment term. only you dwell in my heart."
Believe me.
"Beloved, this is true."
"Let""s love in the open."
ln my heart..
My name is David Wolfe.
"I was born near New York city in America, currently residing in Ontario Canada."
"I am a renegade nutritionist, I am renegade superfoodist and infopreneur, but above all of that"
What's going on?
Who did this to you?
"Forget it, just take me to the hospital, I'm not good"
Who did this to you?Say it.Only then I'll take you.
"Serdar, I'm good."
"Take him to the clinicand stitch the wound, thenget him back."
Take me to the hospital!
You will not get away with this.
"You thought to go outand fly, birdie... it's a good plan, but menobody can cheat."
Get him out!
"Mr. Serdar,If you had any humanity in you,let me..."
My son is dying.
What the hell do I care?
He's not my son!
"Perhaps you also will one daybe so helpless,Serdar, and I hope you will findsomeone to help you!"
"See our daughter,does not look good."
"Girl is not good,Take her to her roomand let it rest."
Change clothes you shall goand take a nap...
"'I waited for you,But you did not come."
Pleasant.Your fiancee. '
Bride!
Hello!- Turgut!
"I am Listening sir,tell me."
"Mahir Karaescaped death, he's alive! he canpostpone his fate, but there are thingsthat will happen immediately."
"Listen, afterthis change of events don t you daregive me empty promises!"
Hello!Is this the police station? yes please
I need to report a crime.
"In the store of Bulent Tiryaki,in the mall, I sawhidden boxes with bullets in them was writtenin Bulgarian..."
They were very concernedand I think it will move quickly.
With whom am I speaking?
I am an anonymous citizen.
I received the application.
"I wrecked my familyfor nothing, absolutely nothing."
I don't have the face to say anything.
But what happened has happened.
I did it again.
Forgive me.
Forgive me and go.
As if you left me anywhere to go.
Who would accept me now?
Who would forgive me?
"If you spoil those men's game...Maybe, your husband will get soften."
Go girl...
I'll buy your plane ticket.I'll put some money in your pocket as well.
Go and testify.Be their doom !
"Offf, days and weeks have passed here."
But these minutes feel even longer.I'll loose my mind.
- What if we come back here.- Stop being a merchant of doom.
We'll end up here againif you keep attitude.
Stop it!
"- What's wrong, man?- Don't touch me!"
- He is just shaving you.- I don't want him to.
Fuck off then.
- I'm not dying to touch your face.- Ibrahim...
- If it wasn't for the orders I was given...- Just do your job.
Sit down.
Don't piss him off.
"- Sit down!- Come on, man."
We need a shave as well.
I feel dizzy.Must be because of high blood pressure.
"- Perihan, please get a grip on yourself.- Can we find some water?"
My mouth is also dry.
I told you not to come hereand go directly to the courthouse.
I will be the only one to see them anyway.
"I'm sorry to have offended you, please forgive us."
Sorry.
Let's go.
"Old man, do you know what Xiang Yaocha is?"
What did you hit me for?
"Who are you, kid?"
Don't you have any manners?
How dare you call Miss Mu by her nickname?
You want to get yourself killed?
"Old man, what's going on?"
"Lucky for you that you've met me, or you'll die."
I don't understand.
"Let me tell you,"
"Xiang Yaocha is the alias of Mu Wanqing, a martial arts expert of great reputation."
"Oh, so it's a person!"
"She's as pretty as a peony, she is ruthless, can be quite scary, that's why she's also known as Xiang Yaocha."
Where does she live?
A deserted valley ten miles away.
"There have been many who went there, but none of them return."
Is she a very good host?
"No, she killed them all, peeled off their skin to block the sun."
Please sit down.
"What would you like to eat, master?"
Just a few dishes.
Right away.
Should I go or not?
"If I don't, then Miss Zhong's life is in danger."
"If I do, she might skin me alive to block the sun."
Difficult decision.
"I wanted to rush over, and kill that bitch, Xiang Yaocha."
"Be careful,"
"I heard her ""Bone cutting sword"" is lethal."
(Applause)
That's right.
"Now, since I haven't had the chance to work with these calculators,"
I need to make sure that they are all working properly.
"Would somebody get us started by giving us a two-digit number, please?"
How about a two-digit number?
Audience:
22.
AB:
22.
"And another two-digit number, sir?"
Audience:
47.
AB:
"Multiply 22 times 47, make sure you get 1,034, or the calculators are not working."
"Do all of you get 1,034?"
"1,034?"
Volunteer:
No.
AB:
594.
Let's give three of them a nice round of applause there.
(Applause)
"Would you like to try a more standard calculator, just in case?"
"OK, great."
What I'm going to try and do then --
I notice it took some of you a little bit of time to get your answer.
That's OK.
I'll give you a shortcut for multiplying even faster on the calculator.
"There is something called the square of a number, which most of you know is taking a number and multiplying it by itself."
"For instance, five squared would be?"
Audience:
I wasn't embarrassed.
Now that's when you're mad you're not a phony.
I still resent that.
I'm not a phony when I'm nervous.
Again!
I want to get mad at you!
I...I...you know what -- [mocking]
I...I...I...
I want you on my level so I can pick on you just as much as you're picking on me.
"Okay, pick on me."
I have to wait until you say something that I can pick on.
What does this mean?
Can you develop this movement?
It's a...I can't find words.
I want to...
Develop this.
But since you've been dancing...
I want to start all over again with you.
"Okay, let's start over."
I know a corner I'd like to put you in.
"I'd like to ask you a question and because I have a feeling you don't like me right off the bat, and I want to know if you do."
Can you not play [indiscernible]
What would he say?
"He'd say that she's a phony, for one."
"So, you are a phony."
"You're a phony, and you're a flip little girl, and you're a show off..."
What would [indiscernible] have said to that?
"I know what I'd answer,"
"I'd say, ""I think you are too."""
"Well then, tell this to me."
Tell me what a phony I am.
[laughing]
"But, you said some people choose to have sex this way some people choose not to have sex that way some people compromise."
"So, is it an orientation or is it a choice to be asexual?"
David:
How you feel internally is an orientation.
Star:
Okay.
David:
"What you do - so, an asexual person who does not feel desire to have sex. can choose to have sex if they're in a situation."
Star:
So that's more in your socializing?
David:
There is no desire.
Star:
Gotcha
Joy:
But how does that work?
[laughter]
Joy:
I can see for a woman.
"You know, she can just lie there."
"But you, you have to do something."
[laughter]
David:
There are gay guys who have sex with women before they realize they're gay.
It's the same.
Joy:
"Gay men who have sex with women, yes."
But they're fantasizing about a man.
Star:
You're right.
Chandra:
"And then you said that married couples and that, you know, they can make a choice to have sex"
Send me the case files and tell me when to be in court.
"Thank you, doctor."
We need this.
"Before he was arrested, Father Moore sent this to me."
He asked me to take care of it.
It's your burden now.
One more thing.
When you saw Emily... ...did Father Moore ask you to give her any medical help?
He was already trying to stop her from injuring herself and urging her to eat.
"And I told him, as a doctor, I couldn't help her."
Dr. Cartwright's going to testify.
Don't you get it?
He's not just an eyewitness to the exorcism.
He can also refute the prosecution's medical case.
This is huge for us.
When do I get to testify?
I don't know.
Let's take this one step at a time.
No.
"What matters most is Emily's story, which only I can tell."
I understand.
Have you thought about what I said before?
About dark forces and demonic attacks?
"Yes, I have."
"That day, after Briggs testified... *..."
I was feeling awful. *
*And I went out for a walk* *just to clear my head... *
*... and I was thinking about* *what you said to me.
Thinking:*
"*""What if demons really do exist?""*"
And wondering what that would mean if I believed that.
"Because God knows, I have my own demons."
Looking good.
Different and uncommon.
"lndeed, Reporter Jung of B.A.P."
He's a sensitive man who knows how to be romantic.
It's just piece of art no matter how you take it!
I heard that bridge was built in 1935.
"lts height is similar to that of ""63 building"" in Korea. &amp;lt;""The island across from here is the world's largest prison""&amp;gt; Wow, that?"
- That looks like an island.
- That's the world's largest prison?
I heard there are Dementors living inside.
Look at him enjoying nature.
It's freezing.
It would be so much fun to have a concert in a place like this.
My hair is stiff because of all the mousse I have in there.
That goes totally well with him.
He's got the aura.
Doesn't he look like a celebrity?
The wind is crazy.
I'm happy but it's cold.
It's always cold.
You can't tell on screen.
But this is a cliff.
I'm scared.
So when I was shooting that scene
I felt like it was life or death for me.
Great job.
Hi.
We're in San Francisco.
It's supposed to be a normal street in a town but the aura is totally different.
Taking pictures anyway still looks professional.
It's cold.
This is a port city in San Francisco.
He will go in and Kuzey Tekinoğlu will go out.
That was the deal.
"Yes, he's the one who offered to go to prison instead of an innocent person."
You're still so sure about Kuzey's innocence.
You're both the prosecutor and the judge of your father's case.
That man isn't my father.
He's a killer.
"Whoever pulled the trigger Kuzey or his men, doesn't matter."
They are not more guilty than Ferhat.
"So yes, an innocent person killed Ferhat."
Mirza knew he would die soon.
And when I told him Kuzey's story he wanted to help him.
But now... ... it hurts to know that he's spending his last days like that.
Wish I could see him at least for the last time.
"Okay, I'll try to do something."
- Thank you very much.
- You are welcome.
I went and checked on the Makara stalls a few times.
"- Everything's going smoothly, don't worry."
"- Okay, good."
Soon you'll be out of here anyway and get back to business.
We'll see.
It's too early to talk about that.
I'll handle the business until you're out.
Don't worry about it.
- Thank you.
- There's not much until 4th of the month.
The visitation is over.
"Warden, could you please give us 5 more minutes."
It was already over 5 minutes ago.
"Okay then, talk to you later."
God be with you.
"Don't forget, Applejack's duds must shine"
Dressmaking's easy Every customer's call
Brings a whole new revision
Have to pick up the pace Still hold to my vision
"That constellation is Canis Major, not Minor."
"French haute couture, please."
What if it rains?
Galoshes!
More balloons!
"Oh no, that's too many balloons."
More candy!
"Oh, less candy."
"Oh wait, I know."
Streamers!
-Streamers?
-Whose dress is this?
Streamers it is.
What?
Aren't you going to tell me to change something too?
"No, I just want my dress to be cool."
Do you not like the color?
"The color's fine, just make it look cooler."
Do you not like the shape?
"The shape's fine, just make the whole thing... you know, cooler."
It needs to be about 20% cooler.
All we ever want is indecision
All we really like is what we know
Gotta balance style with adherence
Making sure we make a good appearance
Even if you simply have to fudge it
Make sure that it stays within our budget
Got to overcome intimidation
And her fiancé isn't  happy with this at all.
His mother is being a bitch about it as well.
- I'm really sorry about it.
"- It's okay, thank you."
"- Thank you, usta."
- Take your share and let us part ways.
- Thank you for everything.
- You're welcome.
"Don't let anyone inside, son."
"How can I not, abla?"
They say they are customers.
- They're camping outside.
- Don't answer their questions.
- Come let's wash your face.
- I tell them I don't know anything... ... and I don't even know you.
"It makes the other shops uneasy, too."
I understand.
We'll talk to Kadir Bey first and then see what we can do about it.
You close to door.
"And tell anyone who comes, we're closed today."
"Okay, abla."
- The shop is swarmed with the reporters.
- What do we do?
It's a public restaurant.
"You can't say ""the reporters can't come in""."
"- But they have no rights to bother you, of course."
- But that's what they exactly do.
"- They are getting to our nerves, aren't they?"
- I'm most concerned about the Yaşarans.
I fear that they'll send someone to make a scene... ... in front of the cameras and we won't be able to prevent that.
"Abla, can you answer it please."
"Hello, Sinem."
Good Evening Samia !

"Poly, We were talking about Lady Gaga with those Little Monsters"
"What is the difference between Gaga's songs and style, AND your style in your own art ?"
The shocking style

Hello!
May I speak to your sister?
- Sure.
Don't hide your face.
I recognised you as soon as I saw you.
My husband died 4 years ago.
I have been looking for you ever since in order to apologise to you.
To apologise to me?
- Yes.
He told me everything about you before his death.
So you know that... - Suraj is your son.
And I also know the circumstances under which my brother died.
I am ashamed of myself.
I was very mean to you.
Forgive me if you can.
"- What are you doing, sister?"
Since the day I have learned the truth... ...
I have not considered Suraj my son but your safe keeping.
And I am waiting for the moment when I can give him to you.
Suraj must never learn the truth.
He is an excellent pilot.
He will soon marry Renu.
They have a bright future together.
"If he learns that it is not you but I who am his mother,... ... a woman who has spent 12 years in prison for murder,... ... he will be shattered."
He won't be able to hold his head high.
His life will be destroyed.
Don't you care about your own life?
Won't you accept your son after going through so much pain?
Only you have the right to be called his mother.
You are responsible for what he is today.
"But, Suraj is your son."
"No, sister."
"OK, so that means that P and Q are equidistant from this"
"line, so that means that this distance is equal to this distance."
"When they say P and Q are symmetric around AB, you can almost pretend like AB's a mirror right here, and P and Q are the mirror images of each other."
Good enough.
And then it also says points Q and R are symmetric around line CD.
So we also know that this distance is equal to this distance.
Good enough.
What is the length of PR?
This is fascinating.
So let's say that this length right here-- let me do it in yellow-- this length is x.
Then what is this green length going to be?
This green length right here is going to be 4 minus x.
How did I know it was 4 minus x?
"Well, this distance up here is 4."
So this is x.
This is 4 minus x.
"Well, then this distance right here is also going to be 4 minus x."
"And if this yellow distance is x, then we also know that this distance is x."
"So the distance from P to R is going to be the sum of all of these, right? x plus x plus 4 minus x plus 4 minus x."
And I think you see where this is going.
It's x plus x plus 4 minus x plus 4 minus x.
"These x's all cancel out, right?"
2x minus 2x.
And we're just left with 8.
And that's our answer.
B.
And you could've tried it out.
"You could have assumed Q was right in the middle, and it would have worked out the same, but you know for sure that the answer is 8."
Next problem.
Image clear.
Invert.
I don't know if I'll have time for this.
I can let Emily answer that.
"""Last night, on Allhallows' Eve... ...Father Moore tried to cast six demons from my body."
They refused to go.
"After the attempted exorcism..."""
"*I was taken to my room,* *and I fell into a deep sleep. *"
"*I awoke a few hours later,* *hearing a voice calling out my name. *"
"*""Again, I heard a voice* *calling my name. *"
It was the Blessed Holy Mother of God.
And when I looked at her... ...she smiled at me and said:
"'Emily, heaven is not blind to your pain.""'"
She said the Virgin Mary spoke to her in the middle of a field?
- Yes.
- And do you believe her?
I believe Emily spoke the truth.
Please continue.
"*""I asked the Blessed Mother,* *'Why do I suffer like this?""'*"
Why did the demons not leave me tonight?
"*""She said, 'I am sorry, Emily. *"
*The demons are going to stay* *where they are.'*
"*Then she said,* *'You can come with me in peace... *"
*... free of your bodily form... *
*... or you can choose* *to continue this. *
*You will suffer greatly. *
"*But through you, many will come to* *see that the realm of the spirit is real. *"
"*The choice is yours.""'*"
I choose to stay.
"""In the end, good will triumph over evil."
Through my experience... ...people will know that demons are real.
People say that God is dead.
"But how can they think that... ...if I show them the devil?"""
Did you see these wounds on both of Emily's hands and both feet?
Yes.
"You can""t see all this!"
"You can""t see all this!"
- Leave me!
Leave me!
Leave!
Leave my mother!
Leave her!
Leave my sister!
Leave her!
"lf you raised chaos, I will shoot you!"
Leave me!
Leave me!
You save yourself and leave!
"lf you too died with me, then who will.. ..take revenge for this family?"
"I don""t want to live! shekhar, why don""t you understand?"
"Look, one bullet is still left."
You are under my oath!
You have to take our revenge!
You become Tiger!
Tiger!
A wounded tiger always takes his revenge!
Go and jump in the water!
Go!
Go!
"My sister killed herself to save the family""s honour."
And I jumped in the ocean!
A captain sailing a ship saved me!
"I finished my education with Rajesh""s help."
"I can hear my mother and sister""s screams all the time!"
While dying my sister had said.. ..to take revenge from these scoundrels!
"And that desire of revenge has made me Tiger! seema.. till the time I don""t take revenge from them.. ..l won""t rest in peace."
"I won""t rest in peace! crook. crook. crook. crook. crook. crook. crook. crook. crook. crook. crook. crook. crook. crook. crook. crook. crook. crook. crook. crook."
them.
"So the first column is over two and down one, right?"
So there's the first column.
The first column.
Column one.
It's the vector two minus one.
The second column is --
minus one is the first component and up two.
It's here.
There's column two.
"So this, again, you see what its"
components are.
"Its components are minus one,"
two.
Good.
That's this guy.
Now I have to take a combination.
What combination shall I take?
"Why not the right combination, what"
the hell?
Okay.
So the combination I'm going
to take is the right one to produce zero three and then we'll see it
happen in the picture.
So the right combination is to take
x as one of those and two of these.
It's because we already know that
"that's the right x and y, so why not take the correct"
combination here and see it happen?
"Okay, so how do I picture this"
linear combination?
So I start with this vector that's
And always smile.
- I'm sorry.- It's okay.
"We can sit, if you want.I keep stepping on your foot."
Dance with Fatmagül.Go ahead.
"# I withheld my eyes,# Kept my words quiet."
"# Scattered my ashes,"
It's been so long since I last danced.Was never good at it.# While my flame is alive.
Just leave yourself to the flow of the music.
At least good things like this also happen in our life.
Enjoying this night despite everything... ... the best way of fighting our enemies.
- This is our second dance.- The first one was a reluctant one.
I was excited that day at least as much as today.
"They were beautiful that day, but...Your eyes are even more beautiful now."
"- Mustafa where are you?- I am outside, what's up?"
I'm told you didn't come to work all day.I got worried.
I had some matters to take care of.
"Good then, I was afraid of you and Kerim getting at each other again."
- Nothing happened just yet.- What does it mean now?
Nothing.
I mean don't worry.
- There's nothing I should be afraid of then.- Nope.
"- Alright, good then."
See you later.- Laters.
Damned bastard!
He is acting all bravebecause he knows we depend on him.
"My hands are tiedGod damn it, I can't punish him right now."
We need to remain calmuntil the trial.
How dare he do that to me!
No way Reşat...
I don't think this could be true.
- I expect anything from him... - But not from Meltem.
I don't believe that Meltemwould do such a thing.
We didn't know that so we both came here wearing hats.
We look too much alike.
This is the hat Dae Hyun was planning on wearing.
But he took it off and now he's getting his hair styled.
The concept has us meeting altogether in New York
"After wandering around in L.A., San Francisco"
And in Washington D.C.
There's a scene where Dae Hyun and I pass by each other.
Since you're wearing a hat it'll be better for you to sit down.
Dae Hyun can walk.
I'd only seen that in my dreams.
How cool is that.
That's the Statue of Liberty.
I can see the Statue of Liberty in the distance from here
It's so amazing.
It's the most exciting and cool thing I've seen in the U.S. thus far.
"It's huge even from here, how big would it be from up close?"
I was so surprised.
I wasn't expecting to see it from here.
I'm seeing it for the first time.
I'm seeing it from afar.
"Wow, I'm really in NY."
Cut!
The atmosphere in the background helps a lot.
It matches the song very well.
So it's very empowering.
"Today, the concept for my outfit and hair is an intern at the Brooklyn Newspaper."
It seems very different from the Brooklyn I'd seen in movies.
I really want to go to where the statue of liberty is at.
I think we might go. or I just have to go there.
"Please put an ice cream cone here, with CG."
"Finally, I got to see the Statue of Liberty."
But it's the picture that I'm
looking for today.
"Okay, so the row picture."
"All right, so I'm in three dimensions, x,"
y and z.
And I want to take those equations one at a time and ask --
and make a picture of all the points that satisfy --
let's take equation number two.
If I make a picture of all the
"points that satisfy -- all the x, y, z points that solve"
"this equation -- well, first of all,"
"the origin is not one of them. x, y, z -- it being 0, 0, 0 would"
not solve that equation.
So what are some points that do
solve the equation?
"Let's see, maybe if x is one,"
y and z could be zero.
"That would work, right?"
So there's one point.
"I'm looking at this second equation, here, just, to start"
with.
Let's see.
"Also, I guess,"
"if z could be one, x and y could be zero,"
so that would just go straight up that axis.
"And,"
probably I'd want a third point here.
"Let me take x to be zero,"
"z to be zero, then y would be minus a half, right?"
"So there's a third point, somewhere -- oh my -- okay."
Let's see.
I want to put in all the points that satisfy that
You don't know him.. but..
"If his hand stayed still, his arm would not.."
"If his arm didn't work, his mouth would.."
Look at his condition...
I understand.
"It is difficult for you all, too."
"But, Mustafa Bulut has given up on the real world, even without the effects of the medication."
"This is the most difficult time for us, as well."
He will heal faster if those close to him come and spend time with him here.
"What are you saying, Doctor?"
"Of course, we will come!"
We are childhood friends!
"Everything we eat, drink has been together."
Do you think I would abandon my brother?
Why don't you sit down?
Why are you acting like a stranger?
Of course she is not a stranger!
Gulengul is our daughter.
Our big family... ... this is all we have...
"Ah, my son... look at us.."
My beautiful Mother... don't worry yourself so.
He is going to be happy again...
He is going to mess with us when he returns..
Just wait...
Hasan...
"Aslan Bey ordered somethings, Yasar Abi."
Enjoy your food.
"Come, sit with us..."
"No, my mother wanted somethings..."
I am going to go home.
The poor woman is by herself.
Let me help Hasan.. With your permission..
Shailu is mine.
Dont play with love.
You will be ruined.
I will kill you if you obstruct my daughters path.
I prayed to God that they should be united.
God granted my wish.
That is all I want.
He piers my heart with the spear of love
He is the real man
Look how handsome my life partner is
She resembles the dancing waterfall
His sharp eyes pierce my heart
She has a body like a flower filled with honey
I will arrest you in my embrace
I will guard you against all odds
"O beautiful swan, you gave me a sweet pain"
I have a lot of belief in you
I felt the heat of your love
I owe my entire life to you
What is it?
Nothing.
Where did son in law go?
Wait here.
I will search for him.
Venkat!
You scoundrel!
Why do you stab from behind like that?
"If you are a man who took a mothers milk, fight from the front."
Let us decide the winner.
"Hey, what do you think?"
Do you think that he was brought up on donkeys milk?
Do you think that he cannot fight you?

DR. JAMES GRlME:
"This is such an inspiring story, because it shows how mathematicians can save lives."
We're talking about one of the most famous cipher machines of all time.
It's a code machine called the Enigma machine used by Nazi
"Germany in World War II to send secret, coded messages."
And we've got one over here.
This is not a copy.
This is not a replica.
This is an original Enigma machine actually used in World War Il.
This was made in 1936.
It's an army Enigma machine.
Let's see how it works.
So this belongs to a man called Simon Singh.
He's an author.
He writes popular science books.
And he lends it to the University of
"Cambridge, where I work."
"This was found in a French field, I was told, by an"
American cryptographer after the war.
And he took it home.
So I guess he took it home as his souvenir.
"Yoink, that's mine."
The guy who found it died about 12 years ago.
"And when he died, that's when Simon"
Singh bought the machine.
We're going to send a message.
"Now, we were talking about what to send before, so we send Numberphile."
Let's turn this into Enigma code.
So I'm going to type in N to begin with.
"And if you can see there, the letter Y lights up."
I have no idea.
Finch showers with his bathing suit on.
"I mean, uh--"
"As a matter of fact, it is true."
The guy's huge !
- Does he have a date for the prom yet ?
"- No, definitely not."
All right.
Thanks.
"Oh, man !"
"So I was thinking maybe you could give me some advice, brother to brother."
I thought you might know a trick or somethin' to make her--
- Orgasm ?
- Yeah.
- What's good here ?
- Try the spicy tuna hand roll.
- What ?
- How do you do that ?
"- Hey, never mind that."
"Listen, pay attention."
"Is that all that you're interested in, tryin' to get your girl into bed ?"
"No, it'd be good to be able to, you know, return the favor."
Be nice to know she enjoys things as much as I do.
See that ?
That's good.
That's what I wanted to hear.
"Now, you qualify."
- Qualify for what ?
"- My man, you've just inherited the Bible."
"It originally started as a sex manual, this book that some guys brought back from Amsterdam."
And each year it got passed on to one East student who was worthy.
"Now, it's full of all sorts of stuff that guys have added over the years."
Nooooooo.... of course not!
"We like people with big hearts, not big houses..."
Like you all....
"But, we can't continue like this..."
"Yes, yes, you can... and, you are company for my mother, as welil..."
Don't let anyone trouble themselves for now...
"I am leaving, Mom."
"- If you need anything for this evening, call, okay?"
"- Okay, my dear."
"See, how well she is talking???"
She got her voice back!
"Bravo, Doctor, Bravo!!!"
"You couldn't take my son's life, but you took away his mind."
"Did you hate us, this much, eh?"
Mustafa doesn't even know his own mother!
Is your conscience clear?
It is normal.
"How can this be normal, Doctor?"
"It has only been a week, and my brother doesn't recognize any of us!"
"Right now, he is going through an intense treatment and medication program."
"Because, he refused to eat, we have hooked him up to an I.V."
We need time to see the results of the medication.
"So, what are we to do, then?"
"Don't worry, and be patient."
He is going to get well.
Don't reduce your visits.
Come often as possible.
Spend time together.
It will be good for him.
"Would you like to go to a doctor, Duriye?"
No..
I don't want to..
You will surely meet me.
Hello!
Hello!
"Law can reach far and wide, shekhar."
"By closing your eyes, don""t think everybody is blind."
"Law won""t spare you."
When did I beg for mercy from law? sP.. if you have any evidence then you can arrest me.
I have not come to arrest you.
I have come here as a friend.
Your wife is missing for the past 4 days.
"Maybe you don""t even know.. whether she is dead or alive."
"This is my personal matter, Rajesh!"
You have no right to interfere! - shut up!
You could stoop to this level.. I could have never imagined!
"You are my friend, Rajesh. l can""t raise my hands on you."
"Don""t put a stigma on friendship, shekhar!"
I am ashamed to call you my friend!
"The man who can betray his country.. ..how can he be anybody""s friend?"
There is a patriot who helps law in every step.
And you.. you have betrayed your country in every step! shame on such a friendship!
"I wish I could rip apart my heart and show it to you, Rajesh."
I wish I could rip apart my heart and show it to you!
Where are my goods?
Where are my goods?
- We want our goods!
You have got the gold!
We want the goods!
From where will we give it to you?
"- I don""t know anything! shut up!"
The police have blasted our den.
The gold perished in the fire!
Now how can we give you the goods? kaka sir..
All of you please go out.
I want to talk to my son.
"You too, go outside."
Sir!
- Please go.
I understand how it will be when death comes near.
I know I am not going to heavens.
Being a gangster I killed many people and now I am suffering.
You dont repeat my mistakes.
And dont ever hurt any woman.
I did that with Parvati.
I never told anybody that I am the father of her son Kasi.
Now I want to do justice to him.
I want to give half of my property to her son.
Promise me you will fulfill my wish.
Why dont you talk?
Will you do it?
Do you equate me with the son of your mistress ?
Your dad is very great.
He lived and died like a king.
He died like a dog.
I became home minister because of your father.
From now I will serve you as I used to serve your father.
I know I will have your support.
Just a phone call is enough for any work.
By the way 17 of our people are in central jail.
If you ever need them I will release then on parole.
I have an urgent meeting with collector.
Bye.
You stay here.
She is the your fathers mistress and he is her son.
"Mother, he is my brother and he will be with me from now."
Lyuty and his men are billeted there.
You say she's at the inn?
"Lock my freedom behind iron bars,"
"I'll steal it, bars and all."
"Lock my freedom behind iron bars,"
"I'll steal it, bars and all."
"Out sailed the moon, then again"
Hid her fair face.
"Lock the black steed behind five iron locks,"
"I'll steal it, locks and all."
"I've known God and the devil,"
I've been God and the devil.
"Imprison the maid behind a high fence,"
"I'll steal her, fence and all."
"Imprison the maid behind a high fence,"
"I'll steal her, fence and all..."
Give us a dance!
Give him the guitar.
"Give us a dance, Gypsy!"
"All of us are feeble, for we are but mortals."
Vodka!
"Way to go, the black head!"
"You're sharp, Gypsy!"
I know a pure-blooded little filly when I see her!
How can you tell?
By her teeth.
I looked round -
A coffin flying over the graves!
And beside the road - ghosts with scythes.
And not a sound!
"Drink, sinner!"
Learn to partake of our fare.
Everything I worked hard for is happening.
Isn't that part I'm supposed to be happy
Hail
Hey Daddy
First day of your sophomore year.
You're growing up too fast
"Brook, you start making your old man look old"
"Listen, when I get back, what do you say we stop by doctor you know just to touch base##."
It's been a while since we've seen him.*
"Daddy, I'm fine."
I don't need to say him
I stopped by the store on the way home picked up the requested item*
"Dad, I told you..."
I use the kind with wings.
"But these came with , i thought you'd like that."
How long are you gonna be gone this time?**
I'm gonna reorganize the clients' portfolio in New York.
I should be back on Sunday.
I left all the phone numbers with Clara*
I just wanted to go to my routine with you
Are you cutting classes?
My cheerleading routine.
I told you about it.
Just let go.
I'll get it
"Just let go, okay?"
"Brooke', I mean look at me."
I'm trying
"Hey,"
I'm so worshipping your Gwynethness
"So Calvin, but hi, Brooke mutual admiration society is screeching to a dead halt*"
What?
Quick recovery.
Thank Godyou're good.
Who's in?
He would not say who it is.
"I hope it is not a false statement,I woke up in the middle of the nightcome here!"
search and browse!
"We found it ,Mr. Prosecutor! bravo"
Issue an order to the police stationfor whoever rented this store.
"At your command,sir."
"Mr. Mahir,Did you see who shot you?"
"Yes, his faceis engraved on my memory."
Can you describe him?We'll find it for sure.
"It was dark, boy hasAbout thirty years cheeks and eyes, skinny, and his eyebrowsdark prominent."
That's it.
Right.Do you know this man?
I do not know...I can not remember...
Can you remembersomething else ?
"Mahir just woke up,"
"Leave it to rest,let it bother."
"Brother Yassine,There is another thing,arrest warrant."
I've seen...
"Mahir, all these peopleneed to put handcuffs on your hands,they have a warrant, you're under arrestuntil the court hearing."
let them dowhat they should do.
I apologize ..
"If we know somethingabout who shot you,we'll let you know. thanks"
"Thanks, Atif."
thanks
Who wanted to kill you?Who is this bastard?
Describe it to meI will find him and punish!
"I saw his face,"
"I said to myselfI know this man, but where..."
"But where,I can not remember..."
I am sure of that.
I can tell that Kazım Bey wants to do something for her... ... we appreciate it but.
We don't want it.
I think you shouldn't make your decision now.
Think of it as your father's last wish.
No.
We thank you but.
I can't accept that either.
Because he's never been my father.
"I just named this big void in my life ""father""."
I will never forgive him because he didn't try to fill this void.
I'll never forgive him for trying to ease his conscience with a piece of paper.
But I will not wish him ill.
So he doesn't need to worry.
- I can understand your anger.
- No you can't.
"This is not anger, mom."
"It's not hatred, disappointment or anything."
"- I know, sweetheart."
"- I mean, I never had a father."
And there never will.
Please you close this subject not to be opened again.
The decision is yours.
I feel much lighter now.
I won't have to lie to anybody anymore.
I can say my father really died.
My dear child.
Did I wake you up?
"No, I gotta go anyway."
"Oh, why?"
I thought we'd have breakfast together.
"No, I'll go to work."
He came to talk to me.
He claims that Barış hired a man to go into jail for him.
"Come on, really?"
He made himself believe in that.
He thinks the man got himself caught on purpose.
That's why this happened after we confronted Barış.
He believes this story in his mind.
I think we shouldn't go deep on this.
We should just leave the rest to the police.
True.
"I just don't want to be suspicious of anyone around me, anymore."
And I made some spinach börek.
Kuzey's favorite.
It hasn't cooked yet.
It will be in 5 minutes.
Will you be okay while I am not here?
"Don't worry, I'll be home all day today."
But our girl is doing well.
She's getting better everyday.
"She'll be even better, inshallah."
Her face is getting more colorful as well.
The weather is fine today.
I'll go out in the yard with her.
"Careful, don't let her get cold."
- We'll be careful.
- Really though...
You sure you don't need to be at work?
"I'll feel so bad, if you have to stay here because of me."
No.
I don't have anything important to do at the company today.
I scheduled today to spend some time with my daughter.
Great.
"It pissed me off when she did that, and she does it on purpose"
"She knows it, she's always copying me, it pisses me off!"
"Same thing, later she enters my office, she opens my drawer, she takes my pen"
"No ""thank you"", no ""excuse me"", nothing!"
"Jean, are you listening to me?"
Of course I'm listening
"No, you're not looking at me!"
Well I'm sorry but I listen with my ears.
It seems strange but...
Very funny...
"By the way, I should probably clean them, cause it seems like I'm only hearing stupidities"
Strange huh?
I won't tell you anything anymore!
"Oh no Alex, I love your stories so much..."
Really?
So...
"The day after, the day after..."
"Oh, Loulou, I gotta pee"
"Oh, no, Alex, it's only been half an hour since we left"
"Oh, I need to pee, I must pee, I have to pee"
Have you ever thought about wearing a diaper before travelling?
"But, Loulou, I was careful this morning"
"I didnt' have any coffee, orange juice or water, nothing, so that I wouldn't need to pee"
Well what are you peeing then?
"Oh, Loulou, can't you stop at a gas station with restrooms?"
"No no no, I'm doing what I can, at the edge of the road, it will be fine"
"No, Loulou, I want real restrooms!"
What next?
"No, here it's fine, come on"
"No, baby, I'm gonna catch a disease"
"It'll be fine here, Alex"
Disease?
"Did something happen, Hasan?"
"Abla, you are here every day!"
This house's troubles will never end!
"Mom says somethings, too."
Stay home for a little bit!!!
"Did you stay here, Aslan?"
Duriye...
"I told myself not to mess with you, but... ... this is my house!"
My name is Aslan Bulut!
Don't drive me crazy!
Don't push it!!!
"My God, I don't want to hurt your feelings, but enough!!!"
I will stay in my house whenever I want!!!
"Am I supposed to ask your permission, woman????"
"I have tried to make you happy... ..to show you your worth... ..but, enough is enough!"
"And, I don't want to hear such ever again, from anyone!!!"
Where is my tea???
"Off, what a difficult situation!!!"
"Eh, they are going to be sorry even more, Ibo..."
It's not that easy...
"Don't say that, Seher... it is a pity for everyone."
Wasn't it a pity when they were doing it???
Let's hope we are not guilty of anything...
"See, how they have been torn to pieces.."
I don't think they will be problem free until Narin forgives them..
I doubt Narin will forgive them..
"Inci, I have been calling Narin, but she is not answering her phone."
"Harun went to Ankara... she shouldn't stay there by alone by herself, She should come here, Inci Abla."
"Okay.. relax.. perhaps she is in the garden, has some work to do.. She will come when she finishes her work."
- I hope that's the case.
- I am going mom...
"- Ok, sweetheart."
I love... cleaning something that's really dirty so you can see the result. man:

"I love the word ""mamihlapinatapai."""
"It's from the Yaghan language, which is now a dead language."
"But it was spoken in Tierra del Fuego, the very southernmost point of South America."
"I've never heard the word said properly, so I could be pronouncing it wrong."
But the meaning is quite beautiful.
"It means that moment or feeling when two people both want to initiate something, but neither wants to be the one to start it."
"It can be perhaps two tribal leaders both wanting to make peace, but neither wanting to be the one to begin it."
Or it could be two people at a party wanting to approach each other and neither quite brave enough to make the first move.

Hello? man:
Do you have a second to talk to me? woman:
Sure. man:
"Every summer we were excited of going there not because of the holidays ,but because we would eat there."
We would go there without fail.
The same for this place.
"It's like that, they have many clients, everyone comes."
Thanks &amp;gt; enjoy it.
Yoghurt? &amp;gt; I will have one more!
Brother if you could bring us two other yoghurts please!
"Ok, ok."
I will take care of Mr. Ismet's issue now.
I have his car.
"I'll eat something, then I will go, it's a long way."
"Ok, if there isn't any lameness we will hand it in at the evening."
"Okay, bye..."
"Wooow, what's up man?"
I recognized you only from your face.
"What can there be, what about you? &amp;gt; Fine."
Hello..&amp;gt; Hello.
I was talking about you here in above.
"I accused you wrongly, by God..."
I said:
"""Yaman forgot all this way"""
I can't forget it even if I wanted.
"How are you, do you have any trouble?&amp;gt; No, thanks. what are you doing?- As you know, the same."
I still work in the phone installment .
Do you have any news from Kenan?
"I didn't see him yet, he is fine."
I am waiting for the visit permission.
Say hello to him when you see him.
I will go to him on the first opportunity I have.
I'll tell him.
"Hey... who's she?- I just came to the reeve, there is nothing more."
Did you get your registration?- For some papers issues.
I will consider later.
SlR I felt like..
"Hey, you are starting a song when you are asked for a story."
You got your money.
Now leave.
What did he see in me to lend me this money?
If he gave you money without a mortgage.. ..then you must have something as valuable as gold.
What do I have?
I have a golden heart.
Gali Ganna Rao speaking.
Where is the rain?
We dont have rain in stock.
It is out of stock.
"How can rain the out of stock, you fool!"
You idiot!
Everyone calls me a fool.
But you have.. ..lovingly called me and idiot.
Who are you?
You said that there would be rain after 48 hours.. .. six minutes and eight seconds.
Where is the rain?
"Is it you, seed of love?"
Rain is not a wife to come as soon as it is called.
"Of course, my wife does not come even when I call her."
Then whose call will she respond to?
Are you talking about the rain or my wife?
At present we are talking about your wife.. ..tell me about the rain.
The rain was supposed to come.
"But the low pressure.. ..crossed Orissa, West Bengal and then moved over to Bangladesh."
Then what are you doing here without going to Bangladesh.
I do not have a passport.
"What passport, you anthrax......!"
"My boy, you are inventing new words to swear at me."
Can I come in?
"- Our Father, who art in heaven..."
- Emily?
Father Moore is here.
Can you come downstairs? - as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread...
"Emily, can you hear me?"
Let's get her off the floor.
"Alice, no!"
"You've suffered a terrible loss, Mr. Rose."
I know this is difficult.
So thank you for being here today.
"Sir, do you often read the Bible?"
"- Yes, I do."
- So do I.
What about the DSM?
The *Diagnostic and Statistical* *Manual of Mental Disorders*... ...commonly referred to as the bible of abnormal psychiatry.
- Have you read that?
- No.
So you're not aware that according to the DSM... ...a person's refusal to eat is a common indication of anorexia?
Objection.
"The witness just said he hasn't read the DSM, Your Honor."
- Sustained.
- Mr. Rose... ...are you aware that catatonic rigidity... ...specifically a locking up of the body's joints... ...is a known symptom of psychosis?
No.
I haven't studied these things.
Have you ever visited an insane asylum... ...or a hospital for the mentally ill?
Once.
My aunt was in one before she died.
Really?
So there's a history of mental illness in your family?
I suppose.
"You wanna know if I was moving on without you I miss you, miss you, miss you, I miss you"
"To tell the truth I've thinking about you lately I miss you, miss you, miss you, I miss you"
Burning Desires Part Two
[Questioner:]
My whole life I thought I wanted to get married and have a child and live happily ever after.
[Mooji:]
"Yes, Yes Yes.."
[Q:]
Ok?
And it hasn't happened.
I've been in and out of relationships.
And I'm getting older.
"And I still believe I want to find this man, who is going to make me happy and I want to have a child with him."
And I want to live happily ever after.
"And then I find this man, and then I'm finding his faults."
And I don't know if I want him anymore.
I don't know if I want his child.
Because I'm looking for something else.
And I've been doing this most of my life.
[M:]
Yes.
"Some,something. ..It's good, It's good to say"
"It's good to say, because I don't think you're not the only one, Ok?"
[Laughs]
[M:]
Ok.
"So, like this, it's good to speak it out."
"Because then you send, it out again in to the empty, in to space."
"And what is clear, is that this is not actually bringing any happiness."
"It is a sort of like a promise, promise, a sort of something, and keeps you on the move, you see."
But you're aware of this now.
You're aware of that.
3 minus 1.
So it's 6 over 2.
"When x changes by 2-- that's this 2, change in x-- y changes by 6."
That's change in y.
So the slope is 3.
So the equation of our line is going to be y is equal to 3x plus some y-intercept.
And now we could substitute some points in.
Let's substitute this one.
"This 1, 1 seems easy."
So y is equal to 1 when x is equal to 1.
So we get 1 is equal to 3 plus b.
Subtract 3 from both sides of this equation and we get what?
"1 minus 3 is minus 2 is equal to-- obviously, this disappears, 3 minus 3."
So b is equal to minus 2.
"So the equation of our line, we have a slope of 3 and a y-intercept of minus 2."
The equation is going to be y is equal to 3x plus b.
Well b is minus 2.
So minus 2.
And that is choice C. 32.
The equation of line I is 6x plus 5y equals 3.
And equation of line q is 5x minus 6y is equal to 0.
Which of the statements about the two lines are true?
"OK, let's see."
They have the same y intercept.
They're parallel.
They have the same x-intercept.
Lines I and q are perpendicular.
Well I'll tell you how you can identify perpendicular lines.
They have the negative inverse of each other's slope.
But I don't know if that's going to come into play yet.
I always find it easier to look at these lines in kind of the slope y-intercept form.
So let's do that.
They cancel out.
Then you have bi times minus bi.
So that's minus b squared i squared.
These cancel out.
So you're left with a minus bi over a squared minus b squared i squared.
We know what i squared is. i squared is equal to negative 1.
You square both sides of that and you get i squared is equal to negative 1.
"So if we multiply, this becomes a negative 1."
"Every zero - this one, this one, this one and this one - that's sandwiched between them is significant."
Are these guys significant?
It's to the right.
Is there a decimal point?
There is.
1-2.
Every single one of them is significant - 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10.
10 total.
Wow!
Let's look at this long guy.
OK?
"Again, break it down."
"The 5, the 9 and the 6 we know are significant."
Which means that any zeros sandwiched between them are also significant.
The zeros coming to the left of significant numbers are never significant.
We don't have to worry about them.
There are zeros coming to the right.
Is there a decimal point in the number?
There is.
So the zeros to the right are significant because of the decimal point.
1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9 - total significant figures here.
"8 - 9 significant, sandwiched zeros also, 1-2-3 to the right."
They are significant because there's a decimal point at the end.
6 total here.
"Poor man, they'll give him a stroke one of these days."
Selim!
But I'll get that newspaper shut down.
That'll teach them.
"Of course, you have the power to do anything."
You wouldn't move a finger in the first place if the Yaşarans weren't also in it.
"- You're the one cleaning up their mess, aren't you?"
- Look mister...
I told you a thousand times already...
"I went to help the girl, because the town folks asked me to."
And I helped her without expecting anything in return.
"Unlike you, I didn't turn my back on her."
"And if this news was right then you'd be the one  who really abandoned her, am I wrong?"
You did the right thing though.
Everyone went their own way now.
And that chapter's over.
"It was that girl, wasn't she?"
She was there at the night of engagement.
You're talking nonsense.
I am Fatmagül Ketenci's yenge.
Was her yenge there to ask about her?
You were acting so weird all night.
"For God's sake Selim, just tell me, is it true?"
Are you crazy?
How can you believe that rubbish?
This is how much you trust me?
Are you serious?
I can't believe you.
No...
This is unacceptable.
You can't ask me that.
"Look, Meltem...This is over, if you don't believe me."
And then I was working for Larry McDonough janitor work at the school.
He was the treasurer in charge of the ... there.
Where was his - ?
Grand Rapids.
So I was picking up a little money there.
And when I got done with the school at 7 or 8 o'clock at night I was painting apartment buildings until midnight and then back up again the next morning to go at it again.
You couldn't get a job.
I was making $5.50 an hour at
Steel Case.
Nobody's going to hire you.
"Because two weeks from now, Steel Case calls you back."
So the only place I get a job was to go to Spartan
Warehouse.
They paid a little more and I also had the 7 years teamster.
So then I just put my ... in his apartment and retired and came here.
Built this shack and that was it.
This house is out of styrofoam by the way.
"At Spartan, that's they way they built - Everything was out of styrofoam."
"So, Steel Case, did they call you back, then?"
"Yeah, but I was already in Spartan."
And how long did you work for Spartan?
"Oh, 24 years."
I lost some time getting a hip replaced so I had to work a little bit longer
"So you were off, away from Beaver Island, for a total of?"
"35 years, maybe."
And what brought you back here?
"Oh, hell, I never left."
Never left.
All our vacations were up there.
The kids never got out of Michigan until after - I don't know when they got old enough.
I guess when they got married.
My daughter went to Alaska and my son went to

I just want to know that
"I feel strong, you know."
"I want to reach the golden fountain, beat everyone without all the doubting."
I just want to know that
So the total preface has less than 300 words.
"They say each paragraph of the preface, and there's 2 of them, has fewer than 150 words."
So the total preface has less than 300 words.
So we could do the same logic.
So that means that the total is going to be less than what?
The total is going to be less than the original number of words plus the preface.
"So it's going to be less than 2,600 plus 300."
"It's going to be less than 2,900."
"Then if you divide both sides by 25 to get the average, 25 goes into 2,900 really four more times."
That's rightŁż
The average is going to be less than-- let me make sure
I'm getting that right.
"So 4, 25 goes into 2,900."
"1, 25, 40, 1, 25."
Then we have 150.
25 goes into 150 six times.
So we have the average is less than 1/16.
So statement 2 alone is sufficient.
"Statement 2 tells us that the average of the words per paragraph is less than 116,which is definitely less than 120."
"So statement 2 alone is sufficient, and statement 1 doesn't help us much."
I'll run out of time.
See you in the next video.
What's up dudes?
Freddy Wong and Brandon Laatsch here.
"What time of year is it, Brandon?"
Springtime.
Springtime?
I guess that means it's time for
Rollercoaster Day 2011!
We had our first rollercoaster day in 2010.
And take a look at how awesome that went!
Where is everybody?
- Who is Münir?- Don't play dumb!
You did it just to keep me away from that trial.
- Gather yourself !- I wrecked my home for you!
- God damn you.
"- Stop it, you will wake everyone up!"
Get your hands off me!You sold out jerk!
Damn you!
"- Shut up or I will --- Go on, hit me!"
- Damned bootlicker of the rapists.- What?!
God damn you.
You killed meto save the lives of three rapists !
"Wait, wait..."
What?Who the hell am I saving?
Explain it to me.
"Hay Allah, ya...Those bastards tricked me."
Motherf*ers!
Are you any different than them?
How could you do this to me?
I swear on anything you want me to.
I didn't know about it.
I asked him many times.He said it was a land lawsuit.
He didn't tell me the truth.
That pimp!
I would spit on his faceif I knew the truth.
And would this take away the guilt from you?
Whether you knew the truth or not... ... makes you less guilty?
But the stupidity is on me.
"I let you trick me again,although I knew what you were."
Despite what you put me throughI fell for you again.
I apologize so much.
You shot me down really bad this time.
I don't remember feeling more humiliated in my life.
We gave people material for 5 years of gossip.
Does it hurt?
Slowly...
"Easy, easy..."
Slowly...
I can go on my own..
Okay.
I don't have a white horse but I saved you with my white car.
I am ready to help you whenever you want.- Thanks again!
"Use your mind, don't be stupid as me."
"It doesn't matter if he is handsome, tall..."
The important thing for one man is to have so much money that it would not end because of his stupidity.
This is my number.
Don't lose it please!
Let me know how you are.I will be worried...
"Okay, Thank you."
"Otherwise your life will pass decreasing, you look and you see that youth belongs to the past..."
Are you better sweetie?- I am very well.
I elicited to the girl.
"I told her she two faced hypocrite and so on... she took care of her friend all night, my flower."
She called me unbalanced...
"""Unbalanced"" ."
My sweetie.
"She is very beautiful ,even when she gets angry..."
Don't!
Open it!
Don't close it!
I'll lick the window and you will have to clean it again.
Don't do it man!
Eylül calling.
Yes.- I came to the building today but you took flights.
I got your phone number from the foreman.
He????
Who am I???
"I am your husband, Narin!!!"
"Even if you won't do your wifely duty, I still acted as a husband towards you."
Don't touch me!
What's my fault?
Eh???
What's my fault?
It's been over two months since we got married.
I did whatever you wanted.
Whatever you wanted.
"Get up, get up... sit.. sit..."
It's enough!!!!
"What do you think I am, eh???"
What do you think I am?????
"I am supposed to shut up over everything, accept everything, and you all twist me around your fingers, eh???"
"There is no such world, Narin."
There is no such world.
"From now on, we are going to live as man and wife."
Everyone is going to know their place.
I am your husband.
"Mustafa... you can fool everyone, but.."
"I won't fall for your act, son..."
"I understand you.. if you have anything you want, tell me... relax.."
Don't worry yourself over it..
"If he needs anything, Neco is here.."
"But, when one sits around all day like a potato, they don't have any needs, right?"
It's enough to give a little fertilizer...
"Ah, now I believe you!"
If you won't stuff this man's words back into his mouth.. ... you are not aware of anything...
"If I wasn't too embarrassed, I swear to God, I would cry."
It troubles me so much.
"And when I trained steps  to work with this program,"
I use Thay's story and some  of you may have heard this.
He talks about -would you hold the mike for me so I can demonstrate this?-
"He talks about the flower and -no, for me.- (Laughter)"
- (K. Weare)There.
"- (J. Bell) Okay, here we go."
"So, Thay - a little more to this side."
(Laughter)
"So, Thay talks about the flowers like tulips that close up at night."
"Every morning the sun comes up, beams down... (Laughter)"
It is not working.
"The flower is here, the sun is here."
(Laughter)
(K. Weare) What are you going to do now?
And the sun beams down its photons indiscriminately on the flower and its natures open up.
The story works  with young people.
"The young people came in  like this, all closed up."
"And our job as teachers, and parents, and Youth workers, is to beam down love and respect indiscriminately on what they've done."
And they begin to test it out.
Sometimes it goes like that.
(Laughter)
Sometimes it goes like that.
Sometimes it goes like that again.
But our job is their nature to open to their own health.
And they will move towards that.
"Sometimes it takes years, we know."
"We get letters from students,  10, 15 years out of Youth Build saying,"
"""Thank you, I couldn't get it then, but now I know."""
Thank you.
(Laughter)
"So,respect and caring, one is going beyond what they expect, for instance, they said it was, ""Oh yeah, they come and grab me."
They knocked on my door  when I didn't get up for school.
I accused the butterfly wrongly.
The charge was written on me man.
"Let it be, no problem at all."
So?-The thunderstorm in my heart will go on.
I love Eylul so much
"Good- It can't be just go with ""Good"" and step down to the edge, we must join our powers for a new rendezvous."
"Mert, don't mix me man.- You can't ruin it."
We will stick together through thick and thin
You can't leave me in halfway...
"Man, you ask for a war man!"
"But I am asking for it in a sweet way, am i not brother?"
You can't say no.
I can see the smile in your face.
"Okay, I will close it.-Wait, wait, wait... don't close it, don't close it!"
I draw into talk.
I forgot something.
"I am in the forest way, I am done with my obligations I am coming back."
"See you at home!- Don't dare to be late, come early!"
Are you alright?
Did something happen?
"No,nothing, I'm alright."
"Your knee looks bad, shall we go to a pharmacy?"
"No need, my house is near anyways"
Will you be able to walk?
Nothing is sure in this life.
Mind is more important than money.
A stupid investment can turn one's life upside down.
"Unfortunately dear Mine, unfortunately..."
How old are you?&amp;gt; Eighteen...
"Okay sweetie, thanks for calling, good night!"
Hypocrite!
- Are you ok sweetie?-She was worried to know how I am.
"The vanilla bean, which is expensive and worth reusing."
Today's Episode
Vanilla Sugar
"Here, in this little pot, I'll show you."
"There's all the vanillas I save,"
That I let drying.
Moustache:
The smell is amazing!
"Everytime I make something with vanilla bean, I wash it if I put inside the milk or the cream."
"If I didn't put, don't need to wash."
"Then I put it beside my stove and leave there for a couple of days, it'll dry."
"When it dry, I save inside this little pot here, I close it, I let it quite closed."
"When I have the enough quantity for making the vanilla sugar, I make it."
For the vanilla sug...
Moustache:
And what is the enough quantity for making the vanilla sugar?
This is what I'm going to say right now!
"For the vanilla sugar, we will always need the sugar and the vanilla."
SUGAR &amp;amp; VANlLLA
Only.
Nothing more.
Moustache:
"Wonderful, it makes sense."
It makes sense.
And then what happens?
"In this case, here I have 15g of vanilla."
So I need 150g of sugar.
"In other words, we always need 10% of the sugar's weight in vanilla."
So: there's 200g of sugar?
I'm going to use 20g of vanilla.
Moustache:
Wonderful!
Shall we marry with out any delay
let us recreate history and show that.. ..our union is a proof of real friendship
I will never remove you from my heart . ..and this ring from my finger.
You should also promise me one thing.
Whenever it rains you should come and hug me like this.
My God!
From where did you get that heroine?
Shall we watch the shooting?
Why not?
Let us go.
"Sir, see this girl!"
How beautiful she is!
If we make her the heroine in our movie.. ..it will definitely go on to celebrate a silver jublee.
You are right director.
She looks wonderful.
Hey photographer!
Take a few snaps .. ..of that girl in the pink dress.
Look here Mr.Ranga Rao!
We never know when luck will smile on someone.
For example Simran became a heroine.
Her mother is moving around in a Benz car.
Roja also became a heroine. - Her brother too has a Benz car.
Same thing with Rambha too.
Her mother is moving around in Benz car.
You are talking only about brothers and mothers.
What about fathers?
- He is there.
And you are that person if you agree.
Listen to me and make your daughter a heroine.. ..then you will get not only Benz cars .. ..but you can enjoy all other luxuries.
You can earn some crores of money.
Crores!?
Yes believe me.
What's her damage?
No damage.
"Come on, Ric, it's a fact of life."
"A girl that hot, that smart...Damage."
"Well, you know, I'm looking for red flags."
"Her, uh, her ex called her a psycho case the other day."
"Yeah, but if it comes from her ex, it doesn't count."
I guess you're right.
It's yours.
I wonder what my exes would call me.
Nothing.
They're all dead.
Hmm.
"Well, her ex is the medical examiner, so he's dead-adjacent."
She dated the medical examiner?
Mm-hmm.
"Well, I don't think he's dead-adjacent."
I think he's just dead.
What?
Murdered.
Sheriff's trying to keep a lid on it because he was staked in the chest like a vampire.
"Well, Meredith didn't say anything about that."
"Well, red flag number two."
Who do you think killed him?
I don't know.
"But if I was a cop, your sexy doctor lady friend would definitely be a suspect."
"What are you doing here, Klaus?"
Enjoying our stalemate.
What do you want?
"Question is, what do you want?"
"My hybrids left town as you demanded, so please tell me what I need to do to get my family back."
"Well, ahem, see, Klaus..."
I'll go already...
I'm tired...
You have to take a look to the future plans with your lover once more
Come on..
"You were in class A, I was in B"
I'm saying...
"This is why I don't remember you ,..."
But i remember you..
I remember of my all primary school friends.
It means there is a problem in my memory card.
"You were not interested in anyone, you didn't play with the other kids."
"Even during the breaks when everyone was running, you were sitting in the edge and reading books."
So that no one would mess with me.
"Actually, I was like you too.."
Did you study a lot?
I did not have many friends. friend..
"In fact, no friend at all."
Oh snap!
Why?
"First I was very tall, I looked older next to them , and I had dental braces until the end of junior high school."
"It's beautiful to be tall, I wanted to be tall too."
But your height is good.
Thank you!
"Your dental braces served the purpose, your teeth are very beautiful &amp;gt;Thank you!"
No one cares about Mira.
And it's understandable why Eylul left us.
Life goes on...
Thanks for the beautiful moments tonight !
Don't mention it.
"Good night, &amp;gt; The same to you."
Mom?
"I struggled a lot to reach this Mira,"
"Do not remain silent, and play it cold cynic when the mate is in sorrow"
But cheer him up
What can I say to him?
Anyway he knows the banality
What is this nonsense?
What in this pursuit for the new and not the this basicl?
He does not need anything new!He just needs attention.See that he not left alone with his own sorrow
That's all!
"I can be your friend, buddy."
Why are you so nervous
"Ok,let's make YouTube comments under in this video, the happiest place online."
Put in them the rainbows and the respect for each other
Write something like:
"For boys, that the girl no longer with them I suggest this and that"
"Or someone who reads the response, you'll have only good ... something like this ..."
We have fun and heal with words
(hydra roars furiously) Twilight:

Spike:
"Uh, do you know any spells for turning a hydra into a mouse?"
Twilight:
"Like a pauper, even the heart has come on the street?"
Hey!
Stop!
What are you doing?
Apply the brakes!
So this trick was yours?
You are wasting my time.
"Forget the trick, think of my heart."
- Get lost!
"Or the paper heart burst today ; tomorrow, your heart will."
"You will say, how are you at fault."
This happens at this age.
One falls in love and intentions go wild.
It's all nonsense.
Know in how much tension I have come here today?
And you can only think of mischief.
You want to have fun in the garden.
"You are bad, even your heart is bad."
"I am leaving, good bye! "" What is the fault of the eyes? """
""" How is even the heart at fault? """
""" What happens at this age. . . """
""" I did just that """
""" Your face is like the moon, your body like dew """
""" There is mischief in the eyes, and rain in your hair """
""" Your grace has made me . . . """
""" even more crazy """
""" What is the fault of the eyes? """
""" Your love has made me so restless """
""" The truth is that even I have lost my heart now """
""" Before your love. . . """
""" I surrender """
""" What is the fault of the eyes? """
Your blood must be coursing the opposite way!
This interest business really kills you!
Look at how much weight you've lost!
"Since the ship has not yet set sail, that Yi Nok must still be free."
Yes.
He is furious about his ship not setting sail.
"If there are complications, it will make things difficult for us too."
- Who is doing this?
- I think they're going underwater.
"If the river freezes, we cannot leave!"
Why can't we stop them?
They are attacking our guards.
This cannot be just the parents of the girls.
So who can it be...?
It couldn't be...?
It must be the parents who are preventing the Choi Chul Joo's ship from setting sail.
Someone must be helping them.
I heard that Choi Chul Joo is planning on seizing them tonight.
Will he kill the girls?
Can she not see me?
Or does she think I cannot see her?
She may be involved with the girls' parents.
"If I don't do anything, she may fall into danger."
Did you just drop my merchandise?
It's dented here!
Pay me for it!
How much is it?
"Don't, Young Master!"
Weren't you looking at it because you wanted to buy it?
"Well, not really..."
Then?
Were you trying to avoid me?
Europe on average uses
about half as much as Americans use and England is a really low water user.
They use about 40 gallons per person per day.
"So, now this cup, this is another continent."
It's representing 22 gallons per person per day.
Any guesses? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Asia. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ALLEN:
Yeah.
Asia.
Yup.
"Now, we have another continent."
This is 12 gallons per person per
day.
Any guesses?
It's Africa.
"And the last one, this is one of the lowest water-using"
countries in the entire world.
It's representing 1.3 gallons of water per person per day.
Any guesses? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; A country? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ALLEN:
It's a country.
Yeah. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Rome. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ALLEN:
You're close.
Yes.
It's Gambia.
So it's one of the lowest water users in the world.
"So, we just wanted to start with, you know, how much water we do use."
"In the United States, we have a lot--we have a lot of water and we use a lot and so we're excited to talk about some better ways to use that water. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BULLOCK:"
"Thanks, Laura."
OK.
"So just picking-up off that theme, a few more questions for you."
"Anybody want to have a guess at what the recommended amount of water per person is recommended for basic sanitation and health needs, per person?"
"Charles, you should know this one. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; WARREN:"
Yeah. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BULLOCK:
- And I gave all my money to the taxi.
- Why are you doing dangerous stuff like that?
You're seeking trouble.
They could have seen you.
I can't bear the longing for my child.What can I do?
"Okay, this pregnancy really made you nervy.You better do something about it quickly."
I will.
Don't worry.
"I can come with you, to the doctor if you want."
"- Okay.- This week, I'll be a bit busy with work though."
"We can go next Thursday, okay?I'll be busy till then."
Which day of month is next Thursday?
Let me see...It's 8th today.
16th it will be.
16th...
"Don't waste time, if you ask me.Let us go and take care of it next week."
"Neither before you, nor after you."
"Fatmagül, shall we dance?Let us dance."
How sweet of you.
#Oh the separation.
Stronger than even death.
#Time stops flowing.
"#Neither my loved ones, nor the sweet memories are enough anymore."
"Abla, shall we dance?In honor of Fatmagül's birthday."
# I'm caught up in your love.
# I stole from my own life.
"- Let us dance as well.- No, baby."
You know this is not my type of song.
"# Travelling around the seven worlds,"
# I have yet to find a remedy.
Tonight is doing good for all of us.
- It made Fatmagül so happy.- I wish her to be always happy.
Don't blame others for your own sin.
We don't want any of you here.
- It is hard enough to contain Mustafa...
- Are you threatening me?
- We're just saying...
"- Okay, go back to your own business."
Let us go inside.
I can't believe it.
I really can't.
They nearly lynched me today in the town.
I bet it's the pig called Reşat who let those men on us.
I bet.
Do everything to prevent this news to reach the national newspapers.
People might believe it.
"Münir will sue them, of course."
But you should pressure them as well.
Your food.
I pity this country if people like them can freely write their fabricated lies.
- He's not picking up.
- That's better.
A crazy man throws a stone in a well...
Please sort it out.
- Where you going?
- To meet my father for visa procedures.
"Okay, I'll call Mustafa Bey right away."
Let's see how we're gonna clean up this mess.
"Reşat Amca, I have a visa appointment."
I have to go.
"Okay, let our driver take you there."
- Where are you going?
"- I'm here, I'll tell the driver."
- I'll call you later.
Some day no one will march there at all
"Waltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda"
Who'll go a waltzing Matilda with me
-You are now watching an interactive video from Haunted House Party.
Click anywhere to start at the beginning if you dare.
"-Well, she's fucked."
"-Okay, anyways... [monster growls, girl screams]"
Anyways... [monster growls louder]
"-What the fuck, demon."
Just get it done!
-[growls]
I'm finished.
"-Okay, everybody."
It's important that we all stick together and not panic.
[all scream]
-Ah!
-Is everyone...
"Oh, my God!"
[others scream]
"Someone should summon the spirit animals... or call the police,"
I guess that would work better in this situation.
"-Oh guys,"
I was just checking my iBoo app and whatever's causing this it's coming from upstairs.
[thunder claps]
"-Okay, guys, what should we do?"
Should we go upstairs or call the cops?

"Hello, It's nice to see you all here"
"As thew more pereptive of you have relized by now, this is hell"
"And I am the devil, good evening."
"You can call me Toby if you like, we try to keep things informal here, as well as infernal"
That's just a little joke
Why do they involve you?
Good heavens...
"Okay, I won't to talk about these now Orkun."
Come here!
Please!
Take me out of this nightmare.
Please I want you to be by my side today.
"Sweety I can't come now, I am at school."
I am solving the registration procedures.
You know our department has the courses selection today.
I can only come at the evening.
Let's do something at the evening.
"Anyway... good, forget about it."
"But, don't..."
Hello?
"What happened again?-Nothing, come on let's get these things done and go right away."
Where do you see yourself after five years?
"Probably I will graduate until then, I will find a job."
"A higher degree?- I don't want a higher degree or something like that, straight to the working life."
"It looks like you're in a hurry, do you have to go somewhere?"
I have one more exam today and...
I am stressed a bit because of that.
"Good, what's your life's philosophy in general?"
Not to quit the right way even in the hardest times.
Hello children.!
Do you know where is Yaman's house?
Yaman Koper?
"I don't know, do you know, dude? &amp;gt; No."
"Okay, but do you know where is the reeve?"
Thank you.
He is coming. &amp;gt; How was it?
"I don't know, Mert give me the scooter's keys."
What aunty?
You are praising me a lot?
The state is facing a drought.
People have stopped giving loans.
And they are unjustly asking me to repay their money too.
Since there was no one else I came back thinking that.. ..my mother in law is my only refuge.
Am I wrong?
You will always do this.
Do you know that you have a marriageable daughter?
First address that issue.
Ha!
Ha!
My daughter is a princess.
Some prince will definitely come for her.
He will give me half of his kingdom as dowry to marry her.
This is ancient tradition and is not wrong.
"My dear, I know that you made fish curry."
Serve it to me.
What happened?
"Boss, the girl is here, in Warangal."
"Hey, cant you see what is happening?"
Cant you wait?
You continue speaking.
Her father is a useless man.
Throughout the day he indulges in drink.. ..playing cards and spends all his time at the club.
There is no habit he doesnt have.
It will be very easy to manage him.
"Uncle, for the first time in my life"
I had the desire for marriage.
And that was after seeing her.
Handle this case carefully.
Give the money.
But there is somethingin which I'm sure...I've seen it before.
But where I saw it!?I can not remember. ok
Tell me ifsomething comes to your mind.
I'm going to talk to Kemaland see what you he has heard so far. thanks Yasin
Can I do anything elsefor you?
"Thank you very much, brother."
"I'm coming day and nightuntil you recover, everything you want from me,I am at your service , brother"
"Check my family,from time to timeand that's enough."
"Okay, do not worry."
"Mahir... well if you had not died,I'd be very upset."
"Sister, I should goto Ayten and Nurten we were very concernedfor my brother"
"Mother, let's go inside,I feel very sleepy."
Look dad was here...
"Dad, you're here,We are very scaredat night without you."
"I can not go in now,"
"I have a very sick friend,I need to see him..."
"I'll come back later,OK?"
"Uff .. adults still do what they want!That at least once, do what I say!"
Ilknur...
Tomorrow is my dad Nazifcourt date...
I'd comeif you do not mind.
good nighy bulent good night
"My brother is good,Ayten will be very happywhen it hears that and it will be better,It will raise its morale!"
"My sister is really not good,she cried the whole timeand does not leave the room."
"It is because of my brother ..wait, I'll goand talk to her .."
"Sister Ayten,"
Don t be sad my brother is goodand will survive...
"Sister Ayten, my brother is good very well, the doctor saidit will quickly get out of the hospital!"
"Sister Ayten, pleasedo not be sad..."
It's a miracle...
is there something elsewhy are you like that?
You d bettercome back later.
- Yeah.
You were so hilarious in that olive costume.
"But, Jas, you said boys don't rate girls for funniness."
"Well, I just meant that they rate other things more."
"Oh, yeah."
What do they rate then?
Skinny-Minnie blondie boobie girly girls like Slaggy Lindsay?
"Well, she does have that cover-girl look that boys die for."
"So, are you saying I have to be more like her?"
Thong alert!
I always knew she was from Vulgaria.
- Now that's what boys like.
- But they just go up your bum.
- Nah.
- Do you think you should try one?
No way.
I'm not gonna injure myself just because boys like it.
And Slaggy Lindsay should know that all those ancient women did not burn their bras and give women the vote so she could wear a thong.
What a swiz!
- That is just diabolical.
"- No, that is shocking."
Bet you Robbie doesn't know about that.
At least I sort of fill up my bra when I wear one.
Even though it does bunch up when I run for the bus.
"So, she has false boobs, a massive bum and a blank personality."
You would score more in all of those areas.
Defo.
But she's got Robbie and I haven't even kissed a boy.
I can't.
"You want to move up on the maturity scale, right?"
I'm not that desperate.
You have to step up to compete.
Kerim.
Thank you.
Thank you.You did a lot of preparation since the morning.
It was tiring.But it was worth it.
Everything was great.
Yes.
I worked hard for it.
But you see.I didn't think about setting off fireworks.
"- Kerim, don't say this.- God damn him."
- I'll make him pay for this.- Kerim please...
It's obvious why he did it.Don't do anything please.
- Listen to me at least this once.- Don't you see how he provokes me.
Should I pretend that nothing happened?
"A wrong step you take with anger, may affect the whole lawsuit badly."
Please don't do somethingthat would put our case on danger.
- This is what he exactly wants.- He is doing it out of desperation.
"Because, he is so lonely, so helpless.He is well aware that he lost everything."
He is actually taking revenge of himself.He's trying to hurt himself.
I could very well help him get hurt...
He's showing off.
Trying to impress you.
He is nobody for meeven if he pulls down the stars from the sky.
You think he could impress me by showing off with the Yaşarans' money?
He is a poor soul.You don't need to be jealous of him.
"I am not jealous, Fatmagül."
I am afraid.
Bastards as low and dirty as them...
I am afraid of what they are can do.
I'm afraid to loose you.
Don't be.
I love you so much.
Good night.
So you won't stray again.
What you have to understand is that the church and the state are the parents of the motherland.
That requires a sense of responsibility... and deserves respect.
You people don't respect anything so we have to take a hard line.
Nobody cares that you're here.
Your family and friends don't give a shit about you.
You won't get out of here alive.
I won't let you.
"And even if you did, I'd come find you."
I'd come find you.
You're cracking really fast.
This isn't happening!
You can't hurt me!
I can't hurt you?
No!
"What I just did, didn't that hurt?"
"Dad, please..."
It's me...
Malena.
I know you remember.
Please.
Don't hurt me anymore.
You know what?
Maybe you're right.
Remember the story of Abraham?
"No, you wouldn't."
"God told Abraham to kill his son, lsaac, and Abraham didn't hesitate for a second."
He looked at his son and saw an enemy he had to wipe out.
"He took him to the mountain top, drew a knife to cut his throat... and just when he was going to do it.."
God told him to stop.
"If I'm your father as you say, then God should tell me to stop."
Shall I tell you a secret?
But I'm still curious.
Chang Hui that boy...
I wonder how he will look when he shows up.
I was afraid of how you were wavering when you were with her.
Attendant Noh.
I am not wavering.
I am searching for the right path.
Your Highness!
"If I don't do that now, I will lose my way forever if I am lost later in the future."
"Right now, I want to look within myself rather than move forward."
"When I look at myself through Yi Nok's eyes, I can see the things I've been hiding."
And Hong Gil Dong gave me some advice as well.
He told me to protect the people if I wanted to be king.
Realize it?
Yi Nok!
- Try this on.
- What is this?
I borrowed this from Mae Hyang.
You should wear this next time you go to Yongmun.
How can I wear something like this?
You should learn to wear skirts now.
"You should dress like noble ladies do, and act like them."
"What's wrong with you, old man?"
"I'm a medicine peddler, Heo Yi Nok!"
The Moonlight Warrior can't wear a skirt!
"And besides, does this look noble to you?"
"Well, I suppose it is a bit sexy for a noble lady to wear."
I'll go bring something more conservative.
How am I supposed to wear this?
How embarrassing!
My colored glasses...!
We crushed the glass and used it to cut our binds.
How .. ?
"Poly: "" by my outfits """
"Okay Poly, we'll get to you back later."
"We'll discuss later, if you're crossing some red lines .. all of that later"
"Thank you so much, Poly"
Good evening Muhammad

"What does, Haifa Wehbi mean to you ?"
"Muhammad: "" first of all, Haifa is my role model """
* btw Haifa is a Lebanese singer

What do you like about Haifa ?
"Muhammad: "" her beauty, is the first thing that made me love her """
"Muhammad: "" And her personality """
Why haifa ?
"Not other character, like some other Guy ? and check his ideas ?"
"Muhammad: "" Every person has their own opinion, For me Haifa, is only Haifa"
*That's rubbish ..
Skip the Haifa part please to 17:50
One of the most selling artists in the world ..
Lady Gaga ..
Bloody Mary !!
"Mark, What is Lady Gaga's Message ?"
"Mark: "" Love, Don't bully and hate each other """
"Mark: "" Just like in BTW God makes no mistakes """
"Mark: "" He made you, the he wanted you to be, no one has the right to hate anyone else """

"Mark: "" My Look, My body, My hair perhaps """
"Mark: "" I gained that confidence from Lady Gaga """
"Good Evening Nadeem, You're also a Little Monster"
We've never even done anything bad to anyone for this to happen to us
"Guys, we need to calm down and figure out what we're gonna do tomorrow"
Isn't it your job to think about it?
Hello?
"Yeah, it's me"
What?
You sure?
"Okay, I'm on my way to you now!"
Thanks
Dad is in jail!
What?!
Jail?
Come on!
Come on!
"Just like I told you, we heard about a fight and we saw this man, it looked like he was gonna kill the other guy"
What was the reason behind the fight?
He told us he thought the man was gonna rob him
The guy who dad hit was a thief?
"No, he wasn't"
We searched him but found nothing
"Just like you can see, he looks decent"
"Yeah he looks decent and not like a thief, what's wrong?"
I've noticed that there's something weird about your dad
His speech pattern is odd
"I think there's something wrong with him, right?"
Yeah he has Alzheimer's
"Oh yes Alzheimer's, I thought so"
"Because when we saw Mr.Sameh's number, he didn't know whose number it was"
How do you just allow him to go out alone?
"Meem, get him out of the prison bars"
"To be honest, he's been missing for a while"
He left the house and nobody knew where he was and we kept looking for him
"I identify it with my father, but not me."
I don't feel I demand respect.
You don't demand respect?
No.
Should you?
"As a matter of fact, I'd like more."
I'd like you to respect me more.
"Now you see, so you demand respect."
"Alright, yes."
"Yes, as a matter of fact if I could demand respect from you"
I would.
So do it!
Who's preventing you?
Except yourself.
'Cause if I feel I get myself out on the corner you're going to let me just drown.
You're not going to help me one bit.
And I know that I can't quite come up to standards with you.
What should I do when you're on the corner?
Encourage me to come out.
Ah.
You don't have enough...courage to come out by yourself.
You need somebody to pull a little damsel in distress out of her corner.
Yes!
"So anytime you want somebody to... ...pay attention to you, you crawl into a corner and wait until rescue comes."
"Yes, that's exactly what I'd like."
And this is what I call phony.
Pardon me?
This is what I call phony.
Why is it phony?
"I'm admitting to you what I am, and how is that a phony?"
"That is a phony, because --"
Oh!
I'm confident with that news.
My source is reliable.
Who is your source?
Tell us so we know.
You will have to spill it out in court anyway.
I'm lose my mind...
There's the sworn statement of the girl.
And there's the gendarme reports.
Easy now...
Save yourself to the prosecutor.
You can't fabricate news like that.
You'll publish a refutation.
- Okay...
- I'll get your newspaper shut down.
I'll sue both you and your source.
You may come in.
"Mustafa, ignore her son."
Madam.
Madam.
Your husband left these bags for you.
Can you imagine my uncle?
He got furious.
And Selim is a wreck...
That's a bummer...
Just when we thought the things were settling.
Won't you say something?
What do you want me to say?
Don't think we're safe just because only Selim's name's involved.
"If Münir Abi can't stop it, then all the newspapers will write about it."
"And when they dig deeper, they'll find out more."
We will all be screwed.
They'll find out about all of us.
Fatmagül doesn't want to talk to anybody today.
Not even you.
"Of course, that's what we thought as well."
Thank you very much.
Good bye sweetie.
She said you shouldn't leave home for a while.
It's bad if she says that too.
I don't get it though.
This was supposed to be a private case.
"Yet, everybody is talking about it."
You are right.
They are doing a great job twisting the facts and informing the media.
I'll go to the prosecution office and see what they can do about this.
"Also, I'll gave them a petition about what happened last night."
But it's not going to happen over night.
This'll take a while.
I just want to live my normal life.
"This is only the beginning, girl."
You can't go outside for a while.
You can't.
But what about Kerim?
And what about your job?
Your appointment with the doctor and all?
- That's enough.
- The moment you go outside... ... you'll have all those microphones in your face.
- Will you stop doing that?
- I wish... ...
"I wish they could go somewhere far away, for a few days."
But where.
That would be great actually.
What would be great?
"- Hey, abi."
I will arrange a job for him.
Ask him will he do it?
Look here my child.
I care a lot for you.
All I want is you should never repent like your mother.. ..that you have married a guy who is useless like me.
Take this flower.
Girls should put it in the plait.
Boys must put it in the ear.
Give this flower to Venkat.
Take the plate.
By the way will our son-in-law agree?
How can I say that?
I know.
He will not accept.
Your father will arrange a job for me?
Will he make me a card distributor in that club?
"Venkat, be serious."
My dad want you to join.. ..as assistant manager in a cement factory.
I dont want that.
Why?
Because my father arranged it.
- Yes.
How will you feed me if you dont have any job?
Anyone can ask that to me but not you.
When you believed that rain has united us.. ..then why cant you believe that I can feed you.
How will you do that?
- I will rob a bank or I will steal.
I can do anything for my love.
Try to understand me.
You want to see me as an employee.
With in 24 hours I will come to your house as an employee.
You have tried to create a dispute between your daughter ..and me because I am unemployed.
And what does it do?
It marks a one in each of those spots.
"Now, what did I want to do?"
I wanted to check membership.
I want to do search.
Well that's simple.
"Given that representation and some value, I just say gee is it there?"
What's the order complexity here?
I know I drive you nuts asking questions?
What's the order complexity here?
"Quadratic, linear, log, constant?"
Any takers?
"I know I have the wrong glasses on the see hands up too, but..."
STUDENT:
[UNlNTELLlGIBLE]
PROFESSOR:
Who said it?
STUDENT:
Constant.
PROFESSOR:
"Constant, why?"
STUDENT:
[UNlNTELLlGIBLE]
PROFESSOR:
"Yes, thank you."
"All right, it is constant."
You keep sitting back there where I can't get to you.
Thank you very much.
It has a constant.
"Remember we said we design lists so that the access, no matter where it was on the list was of constant time."
That is another way of saying that looking up this thing here is constant.
"So this is constant time, order one."
This doesn't change anything.
What are you doing?
Pulling the plug.
No!
Rosie!
Watch it.
That was too close.
"If he had more than a drop of tritium, he could have destroyed the city."
I'm ruined.
"I have nothing left, except Spider-Man."
"He saved your life, sir."
He humiliated me by touching me.
The press will be here soon.
I suggest we move on.
What was he doing here anyway?
Molten metal penetrated the spinal cavity... ...and fused the vertebrae at multiple points... ...including the lamina and the roof of the spinal column.
We won't know the extent of the damage until we get in there.
"I suggest we cut off these mechanical arms, slice up the harness... ...and, if need be, consider a laminectomy... ...with posterior spinal fusion from C7-T1 to T1 2."
"We're ready, doctor."
Anybody here take shop class?
Help me!
Help me!
No!
"Is all over town, Robbie."
Gossip.
Rumors.
"Panic in the streets, if we're lucky."
Crazy scientist turns himself into some kind of a monster.
Four mechanical arms welded right onto his body.
Guy named Otto Octavius winds up with eight limbs.
What are the odds?
Hoffman!
"Everyone, in the bazaar, market, streets talking about it."
They know who cheated you.
"I am saying the painful truth, as your friend."
To make you bleed the poison out.
"She was smiling to you, but she loved someone else."
God saved you from the worst.
And they got lost.
Just leave it.
Who cares if the lawyer knows where they are.
They can go to hell.
You should focus on your own future.
Figure out what are you gonna do with your life.
But it's difficult to do it here.
- I know...
- It's best if you go away from this town.
You're a good seaman.
You can find a good job in a fine ship.
"- Of course, I can."
- Look for one that's going abroad.
Just sail away...
Some trips will take months.
I can't think of a better way for you to leave here.
"You'll make money, too."
You'll see a lot of countries.
You'll travel the world.
"And eventually, you will forget."
I will forget...
... that dark night...  ... and the smell of the ashes.
I will forget everything.
"Stop being stubborn, let's show your foot to a doctor."
At least eat your food.
You haven't eaten since yesterday.
"-You scared us... 929 01:16:20,547 --&amp;gt; 01:16:22,697 I was scared too."
"930 01:16:31,900 --&amp;gt; 01:16:34,800 Dad, please just a second."
"931 01:16:34,900 --&amp;gt; 01:16:38,148 How are the preparations going?"
"932 01:16:38,148 --&amp;gt; 01:16:42,831 Don't ask from me something I can't do Mert 933 01:16:42,900 --&amp;gt; 01:16:47,500 Dad, please don't send Yaman like this."
"If you love me, let him stay here a night more please!"
"934 01:16:47,900 --&amp;gt; 01:16:50,900 You will come without being late, right?"
"935 01:16:50,900 --&amp;gt; 01:16:56,500 Your guest can come too, please!"
"By the way, I am Mira."
Hello!
"936 01:16:56,512 --&amp;gt; 01:16:57,759 Hello."
"937 01:16:57,800 --&amp;gt; 01:17:01,400 Mrs. Nevin, Yaman's mom"
"938 01:17:02,500 --&amp;gt; 01:17:07,600 Is that so?"
Very pleased to meet you.- Me too.
"939 01:17:07,800 --&amp;gt; 01:17:13,500 What a beautiful name you have, just like you... 940 01:17:13,600 --&amp;gt; 01:17:15,273 Thank you.- Mira!"
"941 01:17:15,300 --&amp;gt; 01:17:19,100 Come on Safari, sweet."
"Err he escaped again 942 01:17:19,200 --&amp;gt; 01:17:23,400 I came to see where were you but... 943 01:17:23,500 --&amp;gt; 01:17:27,500 I see that the problem still continues here ."
"944 01:17:30,504 --&amp;gt; 01:17:37,199 No, the problem isn't continuing."
To the contrary we're celebrating that we returned from a mistake dear Sude.
"945 01:17:39,800 --&amp;gt; 01:17:45,900 Don't worry, we will be at the fair together with our guests a little after"
"946 01:17:48,100 --&amp;gt; 01:17:49,516 What fair?"
"947 01:17:49,516 --&amp;gt; 01:17:54,980 The foundation where my wife's dad is president is celebrating his 80th anniversary."
"948 01:17:54,980 --&amp;gt; 01:17:57,890 and tonight there is an aid night."
Everyone will be there.
"949 01:17:57,890 --&amp;gt; 01:18:02,000 I assume Mr. Asim will come too..- Of course he will be there too."
"950 01:18:02,060 --&amp;gt; 01:18:04,230 Wonderful .. 951 01:18:04,501 --&amp;gt; 01:18:07,827 We go get ready.."
"952 01:18:10,600 --&amp;gt; 01:18:14,900 Okay, then we are expecting you.. 953 01:18:15,600 --&amp;gt; 01:18:20,000 Come on ,Mira .- See you."
"954 01:18:22,240 --&amp;gt; 01:18:25,568 What happened?"
-We will talk with you later!
"955 01:18:27,800 --&amp;gt; 01:18:30,889 Come on, show your mom the room, I will take a shower 956 01:18:30,900 --&amp;gt; 01:18:33,500 No Mert , we are leaving.-Dad !"
"957 01:18:33,700 --&amp;gt; 01:18:36,334 Mr. Selim ,really we need to leave."
"958 01:18:36,334 --&amp;gt; 01:18:39,800 But look, if you go like this it will be like escaping as guilty, 959 01:18:39,915 --&amp;gt; 01:18:44,962 but if we go there as a whole family, all of us they will understand that all accuses are lies, 960 01:18:45,000 --&amp;gt; 01:18:48,100 and those who were up to something behind your back will be up a gum tree(surprised)."
"961 01:18:50,588 --&amp;gt; 01:18:55,066 If I were you I wouldn't let Mert down.- I love you."
- I'm glad you're safe.
Have you been hurt?
That evil bastard!
- How dare he hurt my daughter!
- It wasn't his fault I was hurt.
It was my own fault.
I'm afraid that bad rumors may start.
"Now that I am safe, please inform the police to stop searching for me."
"Alright, fine."
"- Granny, take Eun Hye outside."
"- Yes, Sir."
Did you meet him?
I hope he's safe.
"Seeing how the young miss is protecting him, it seems that she has already fallen for him."
I thought you were discussing marriage between the eldest son of the Interior Minister.
Isn't Hong Gil Dong his illegitimate son?
If the marriage negotiations break down because of this...
"If they break down, the Interior Minister's relationship with me ends too!"
We must proceed with the wedding!
"If we have Eun Hye followed, we should be able to catch Hong Gil Dong."
Find him for me and get rid of him!
"If it concerns you and the Interior Minister, then of course we should help you."
Was it really him that I saw?
"No, that's impossible!"
I must have been mistaken.
I came on behalf of everyone because too many people would cause trouble.
Thank you so much.
"If people find out about us, it'll be trouble."
"Since people think that Yongmun solved this problem, let them."
- Don't spread other rumors.
- We know.
What did Yongmun do anyway?
Hoity-Toity?
He's coming here?
To see THESE dresses?
Yep!
Get ready for all of your dreams to come true.
There he is!
Okay.
"Relax, Rarity."
Your friends like their outfits and so will he.
What's wrong with the lights?!
"Oh, yes."
That means the show's starting.
Good.
Since the beginning of time the elite of Equestria have longed for pony fashions... ...that that truly expressed the essence of their very souls.
"Patiently waiting decades... no, centuries! ...for the perfect pony gown."
"Today at long last, Equestria, your wait is over!"
Let's hear it for the breathtaking designs of Ponyville's own...
Rarity!
Why's everypony lookin' at us like that?
Oh dear.
You think we overdid it?
Nah.
"Okay, maybe a little."
Those amateurish designs look like a piled-on mishmash of everything but a kitchen sink!
"It's a travesty, it's what it is."
"Those outfits are the ugliest things I've ever seen, oh for shame."
Who is responsible for subjecting our eyes to these horrors?
Not to mention wasting my valuable time.
Hide me.
"Come on out and take a bow, Rarity."
You worked really hard for this.
Yes!
We need to find the recorder and prove the murder.
The left minister and the others are planning to find the truth.
All we need is to find the proof to assist them.
Who are you fellows?
How dare you come...
They all committed a sin of treason.
Arrest all of them.
Who are you fellows?
How dare you come...
They all committed a sin of treason.
Arrest all of them.
Yes sir.
Treason?
"Yoon-jungho, you bastard!"
Aren't you afraid of the heavens?
Now that heaven has changed.
Boo-won Goon (the queen's father's title) come out!
You are under arrest.
What's the matter?
He has committed a sin of treason.
It's an order from the Queen Mother.
How dare you make a loud noise here?
Go away!
Over there.
Catch him.
Take him away.
This red color is made by dipping the cloth in a mixture of flower petals.
It takes hundreds of dippings to make such a vibrant red.
"This red is the color that melds all the other  colors, which signifies the color of a King."
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty.
Our duty is not to be part of politics.
Where is my umbrella?
What do I know?
You forget things!
And you ask me where your umbrella is!
Here is your umbrella!
Take it!
But how did it come here?
"- By plane! shekhar.. why do you always get so angry? seema, I am not angry."
You just feel so.
I am not angry. come.
According to you shekhar had 4 suitcases.. ..when he disembarked from the boat?
- Yes!
But I saw only 2 suitcases in his house. shekhar had disappeared for sometime.
"When he returned, he got frightened when he saw me."
"I think the matter is serious. sir.. if you permit, shall we raid his place?"
"Now it""s too late!"
"We don""t have any evidence."

Whenever you will become the minister.
"Hey, mister."
Whenever you will become the minister.
It's over
I have good news for you!
Antony!
Leave us
Leave us
"Oh, I thought you were dead!"
I am dead
"No...no, don't say that"
This place is like a gigantic tomb you stay here long enough one becomes mummified
You deserted me!
They told me you were dead!
What should I have done?
I saw something tonight that I could not believe
The city...in victory
I had to buy time
"To keep my people from panic, to organize a defense"
A defense?
What defense?
Octavius has defeated us completely!
He has not defeated me!
I still rule Egypt
How!
By lying to your people?
How could you let them believe we've triumphed... when we've failed so miserably?
"We'll triumph, Antony, we will make that falsehood come true"
You've humiliated me with this vile hypocrisy!
As if I haven't been humiliated enough!
Be quiet!
Your men will hear you!
My men?
What men?
The bottom of the sea is littered with the bones of my men
"Well, I..."
Save it for your performance.
"Well, phony's not quite the right word, but it's more like a show off."
A show off?
-Like you know all the answers.
-Yeah.
"And I want you to be more human, and that doesn't seem very human to me."
To know all the answers is not very human?
"Yeah, and right away find out how"
"I'm kicking my feet, and why am I doing like this."
Why are you doing like that?
"Oh dear, I've got eyes."
I can see you kicking your feet.
I don't need a scientific computer to see that you're kicking your feet.
What's big about that?
You don't need to be wise to see that you're kicking your feet.
"I know, but it seems like you're trying to find some reason for it."
I don't.
It's your imagination.
"Okay, I know what I'd like from you."
Can I tell you what I'd like from you?
Yeah.
"I'd like you to be aware that I'm kicking my feet, and to be aware that I'm giggling when I'm really nervous, and accept it instead of putting me on the defense of having to explain it."
I don't want to have to explain why I'm doing these things.
Did I ask you to explain?
You said why am I?
Or what am I doing?
No --
"Well, what am I doing, you said."
"That's right, kicking your feet."
I didn't ask you to explain.
It's your imagination.

"And today, a human has accused our God."
This is not a personal war.
"lnstead, it's a battle for all humans.. ..who have faith in God."
"So I've decided that l, Siddeshwar Maharaj.. ..and Gopi Maiyya, will go to the court.. ..to give that shameless human a fitting reply."
Down with.. - Kanji!
"Yes, it's a democracy, where everyone is treated equally."
"And now, even God."
Even God will have to stand in the High Court's witness box.. ..where the most dangerous criminals stand for trial.
"Strange, but true."
"I still say, think about it once."
I already have.
Today's the first hearing.. ..and the judge will decide whether.. ..such a case can be accepted or not.
It's a good omen.
Really nice.
Let's go.
Many believers are standing outside the court shouting slogans against Kanji.
Down with.. - Kanji!
Down with.. - Kanji!
Down with.. - Kanji!
Down with.. - Kanji!
Down with.. - Kanji!
Many 'dharma gurus' have come to the court.. ..to give a reply of Kanji's baseless allegations.
Very few people have been allowed in the courtroom as well.
"Swami, give me your blessings."
"Move aside, no one will touch the swami."
"Move aside, move aside."
Down with.. - Kanji!
Down with.. - Kanji!
Down with.. - Kanji!
Down with.. - Kanji!
Down with.. - Kanji!
Down with.. - Kanji!
You shouldn't have come here.
Can't we see them as they're being taken out?
- Maybe you will.
But you can't talk to them.- That'll be enough for me.
What about the girl?
She's here under control.She departed from Istanbul early.
"- So she should be already here.- Be sure, and then talk to me."
"Okay, okay, okay."
- Yes?- Where are you?
I'm here.I've arrived.
"Okay, good."
- See you at the courthouse.- Okay.
- She is here.- What about that dog?
He's on his way.He should be here shortly.
I'm going inside now.
Kadir Bey wants to talk to you.
"Fatmagül, my child.Look, this is a very difficult day for you."
"You have been waiting and preparing yourself for months, for this day."
"It was very important, and also difficultfor you to even come here."
And you managed it.
We will manage to get them punished as well.
Together we will.
You will feel very tense during the trial.
This won't be a surprise.
You will be hurt and affected negativelyby what's going to be talked about in there.
Shortly it will shake you up badly.
"You may feel prepared for anything now.But during the trial, unexpected things can happen."
"It is okay, if you don't want to come."
Trust me and believe methat I will do my best to represent you there.
Don't come to the trialif you ask me.
But the decision is yours.
"My child, it will be better for you."
"What can I do,that this interferein the business?"
He knows what he's gotbecause of their work...
"I do not trust him... oh, you did of coursetrust him ."
If you sayI usehis position in court
"When you are concerned, it is the exception,"
"I do not know... ,"

Attorney?

"Let us Say this... f something happenswhile prisonnobody cares, all believe that he is veryaggressive man"
"But if you escape from here,the doors open to the investigationin all areas of the hospital."

"Oh, what do you do?"
"I have to go,excuse me. mr."

It should besend to jail tomorrow.
"And there is the jail clinic, and there can be cared for,what do you say?"
"Do not worry,"
I will personally tell themyou good care of him.
"You are very well chosen,very well."
Who would have guessed?Nothing can be done.
Go get a doctor!- Good.
Are you here to see the patient?
Mahir Karaescaped!
How is this possible?
"Thank you,Manager..."
[people speaking foreign language]
"Yeah, speaking of Ass Violator."
"Oh no, it gets worse."
You've been warned.
[people laughing]
"Wow, that Ugandan pastor would not approve of such behavior."
"Ugh, this video is some s--t, ain't it?"
So to speak.
Why did you guys make me review that?
"And more than that, why is the other elephant just sitting there like,"
"-Yeah, go ahead."
Stick your trunk in there.
"Oh, very nice."
"-Ugh, I don't know."
Maybe that's how this guy gets his peanuts.
"Oh, why did I make that joke?"
"All right, that's it guys."
"Don't make me review anymore videos of nasty turd-burgling elephants, all right?"
"Okay, so I actually do have something interesting for you."
"It's one of those things that's kind of racist but kind of f--ked up, but also kind of funny."
And it's just a commercial for a local mattress store.
"-Hi, I'm Gary."
At the one and only Gary's Mattress.
Now with locations in Koreatown and Little Tokyo.
We are karate-a-chopping a-prices just for you!
Oh cho!
Even we would buy it.
"At Gary's Mattress, we're blowing up prices!"
Yayayaya!
"-Wow, that is unfortunate."
I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say that I wouldn't buy mattresses from that guy.
"I mean, who's your target demographic when you trash everyone?"
There's this great building nearby that the city is just gonna demolish and turn into a parking lot.
- But if we get enough signatures... - Signatures?
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
Go on.
I was saying...
Maybe we could get the city to donate the building to our cause.
"We would be able to pry 250 new beds, get people off the streets and into job training so they could buy rocket packs and go to the Moon and become florists."
"You're not really interested in the homeless, are you?"
"No, I am."
But they're a symptom.
"You're treating a symptom and the disease rages on, consumes the human race."
The fish rots from the head as they say.
So my thinking is why not cut off the head.
Of the human race?
It's not a perfect metaphor but I'm talking about an overhaul of the system.
Putting the power in different hands.
I'm all for that!
- This petition is about the building.
- I'd love to sign it.
Thank you!
"Sorry, I come on strong."
But you signed!
I don't wanna turn my back on a fellow laundering person.
"Well, if we can't stick together, I don't..."
I'll probably see you there.
"No, I will."
I...
She talked to me.
Why did she talk to me now?
Maybe I should...
A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do.
I-I really don't think they liked it.
How do you know that ?
- She's already on a plane back home.
- [ Groans ]
Yeah.
"You know, guys ?"
"Maybe I'm just not good with girls, period."
"No-no-no, really-really."
Like-- Like I was born without that part of the brain.
"I mean, I can't talk to girls."
"And when I do talk to them, I screw it up."
"Yeah, well, come prom those excuses aren't going to do you any good."
- [ Sighs ]
- [ Michelle ]
"And one time at band camp, we weren't supposed to have pillow fights, but we had a pillow fight, and it was so much fun."
"A-And this one time, we all lost our music and we were supposed to play this song, but we didn't know it, so we just made it up and we kept playing and playing, and the conductor didn't know what we were doing, and it was so funny."
"-So, you're pissed about somethin', huh."
-[ Scoffs ]
You know what I do when I'm angry ?
I just play some Bach on my flute.
It's so relaxing.
- I learned to do that at band camp.
"- Hold on, uh--"
You have no idea why I'm angry ?
Is it because we have a test tomorrow ?
Sometimes I get cranky...
- when I know I have a big test to study for.
- [ Laughs ]
- Yeah.
"Yeah, that's pretty much it."
- I thought so...
- because this one time at band camp-- - W-What's your name ?
- And she knows we're Kerim's friends...
"- Please, I don't want to hear anything."
Thank you.
He should be here soon.
Our phones kept ringing since the morning.
Everyone who saw it on the Internet dialed our number.
You can imagine how difficult a situation it was for us.
"It's indeed difficult, having to defend ourselves against such a groundless and ugly claim."
- I can't believe we're even talking about it.
- Exactly...
Exactly.
I'm disgraced before all my friends.
I have been believing your lies closing my ears to what others said...
But I don't know how I am going to deal with this!
I've never lied to you.
Even if it's denied and refuted... ... the question marks in people's heads will remain.
"Even today, my best friend told me  ""There's no smoke without fire""."
To hell with their smoke and fire!
You'll keep hearing such things if you don't shut them up!
After all I've told you...
Is this how much you trust me?
Do you think I could possibly do something like this?
Meltem...
That girl was Kerim's girlfriend.
"Would she marry him, if she wasn't?"
Meltem...
That news are set up by my father's rivals.
Everyone in that town knows that.
It's OK.
Leave it.
"Welcome, dad."
Welcome dear.

And I have also heard that shekhar is your best friend.
"Which hospital, what happened to you? :"
Finally I ran off the rails.
Your lawyer knows it.
"What happened, didn't he tell you?"
"No, nobody told me anything."
Why are you at the hospital?
"Anyway, leave it now Yaman."
I need money.
Tomorrow the committee will have a meeting.
"They will decide, they will decide if I am crazy or not."
I have to please someone so that he gives me a sick certificate for being crazy. what are you saying man?
"Yaman, listen to your brother."
"I can't return to jail, if I return I will really go crazy."
"Until tomorrow until midday you find 1000 TL and bring it to me, OK?"
Hello?
Yaman?
"I am not asking if you can find it,i'm saying..find it and bring it."
"Yaman, it's very important, please!"
Where are you?

This is it!
Good morning &amp;gt; Same to you.
"You are so excited, look at your state.-Don't touch me."
"Suzan, today the men will come, you check the invoice, it must be around 500 TL..."
"OK, Mr Selim, don't worry at all."
I won't pay it without having the invoice
Thanks!
"If there is something, you call me."
"While we are here, my sail has to be renovated too."
"Fall in the middle as soon as you find a chance, of course, don't wait at all."
How much do you need?- 8040 EUR
Where am I going to get so much money for you Mert?
"If we take it to go,  they give 30% discount."
Hey!
Lee Tae Ik!
Are you trying to stingily save money?
"No, no!"
It's because it is good.
I like that pizza best.
This and... give us this.
We purposely came all the way here.&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;Please give us a lot of topping.
Also give us a lot of hot sauce and pickles.
"Whatever, give as much as possible!"
We are regulars.
"Also, give us garlic sauce."
"Anyway... just to get 30% discount,&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;we went all the way there?"
"Hallyu star, Take One?"
Hey!
"Baek Go Dong, don't just eat."
You must never tell about this to anyone. &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;It's such an embarrassment.
I also think so.
So what?
It's good to save money.
What is he doing?
The pizza will turn cold.
It's almost ready.
"Hurry and come, hyung!"
"It's so good, looks like we will finish it all."
Leave mine!
Put on the TV.
"Yes. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I met with world-famous star, Jin Se Ryeong.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I see. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Let's go to that scene! &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;As the first Korean to do so,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;you won the prestigious supporting actress award in the States.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;How do you feel? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I'm happy. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I see. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Sometime back, you even got a love call from world-famous director, James Wang.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Please tell us of your upcoming plans."
Why?
We were watching it well.
It's not interesting.
That man isn't the real killer.
You were the one who got him caught.
And now you want to clear his name?
A man appears out of no where to save Barış from the suspicions.
Ferhat's lighter found on him?
"Come on, that's not just a coincidence."
They just want us to think that way.
The man was following me just to get caught.
"So, you're saying that Barış hired that man?"
Exactly...
Barış took action when he felt he was cornered.
First he wanted to silence us to buy some time.
That's why he said he would sue us all.
And then he made his plan.
He made that man get caught.
So that he would confess the murder.
So simple...
"See, that man isn't the real killer."
All this was setup by Barış.
Or maybe Kuzey did it.
Just when Kuzey went into jail... ... a man confesses the murder to clear Kuzey's name.
Kuzey wouldn't do a sham like that.
If the killer is one of Bekir's men... ... he might have sacrificed himself to save Kuzey.
Can't that be possible?
You have this disease for how long?
Since my son died.
The doctors said it is at a progressed stage.
- You didn't get treatment?
- No.
- Why?
- Killing that man was my treatment.
Did you kill Ferhat?
"Kaderis enough, I learned everything I wanted to know..."
My father is not a murderer!
I gave you the permission to speak!
The final decisionabout this event will be madeat the next hearing.
Dear Dad!
"Never give upof hope, Dad!"
Neverdo not give up hope!
"Do not worry, my Mahir,finally the water finds its way!"
"Alo has little justicein this life,you will be hanged!"
Uncle Black!
I leave you the familycare
Do you understand me?
"My brave young man, now you care about them... come on"
"Congratulations,Feride dear!"
You did an Exceptionally excellent hearing You were very controlled.
I do not understandwhy have you postponed the verdict?
"I would not interfere, but I think you should nowmake a decision and break a pencil!"
"Do not interferewith this, Turgut!"
I'm justworried about you...
Mahir KaraI was hurt as a judge how many times you have to go throughthe same nightmare ?
"my Nazif is not over yet ,Do not lose hope !"
"No, Safija,it will happen what should happen ."
Fatherbrother will not give up !
Pencil will breakand nothing we can do.
"Grandpa,I know you're very sorry ,but do not be !"
"All you really like ,my little heros !"
"Mr. Nazif ,Come on, we gotta go !"

"Do not say that ,Ilknur !"
"You'll see that this is not so ,you'll see !"
"You'll see that this is not so ,you'll see !"
"Everything will be fine , we must not lose hope ,not over yet !"
We're going to film the first Las Vegas scene.
We suffered a lot until now in the U.S. because of the weather.
But I think it'll be okay in Las Vegas.
Although I am quite sleepy and that's not good.
What time is it now?
I couldn't fall asleep so I read a book instead.
There's nowhere to film here.
There should be a lot out there.
"For Las Vegas,"
This is where everything really starts.
None
None
None
It's a song about us B.A.P.
We wanted a song that matched Las Vegas.
It's a very fancy city.
"Since we are singers, we look the most splendid when we're up on stage."
It's a song about us and how we'll go to many cities in many countries to perform on stage.
There are many countries we want to go to
And there are many countries we will go to.
So it's a song that contains our greatest aspirations.
It's so pretty since the streets are so extravagant.
I'm not sure I did well.
There are too many people.
I'm nervous because too many people are watching.
None
I'm embarrassed.
It's crazy.
lf I were good at dancing then I would at least do something.
Singing is more embarrassing than dancing for some reason.
People are all staring...
So it's kind of hard to be confident.
"Ninja Turtles ill walks in place, and 1943 just fidgets around a lot."
It's another hunk of plastic!
Who made this thing?
Son of a bitch...
"Well, we might as well try an LJN game."
"Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice!"
Let's see if this works.
"No, of course not."
It doesn't.
It doesn't work.
It just doesn't work.
I need a beer.
I'm drinking Rolling Rock... ...on the Roll &amp;amp; Rocker!
Rolling Rock... ...Roll &amp;amp; Rocker!
"Yeah, Rolling Rock, on the Roll &amp;amp; Rocker!"
"I've also heard that you can't weigh more than a hundred pounds, but I still don't understand why I can't get any kind of response out of it."
Let's try the cat.
"Get on there, ya little bastard."
"Cat's like, ""Fuck that shit!"""
"Even though the Roll &amp;amp; Rocker does absolutely nothing, the B and A buttons still work."
"Yeah, you plug the regular controller into it,"
"So while you're standing on the thing, you still use the B and A buttons like normal."
"So even if it did work, what's the point?"
"If I'm holding the controller anyway, why not just use the controller?"
"It blows my mind, it's like, what were they thinking?"
"One more, the U-Force."
"So hot, nothing can touch it."
Nothing comes between you and the game.
That's what the advertisement said.
"You open the thing up, it basically looks like electronic Battleship."
It's got a three-dimensional invisible power field.
"Wow, a power field?"
He says that we have a stronger hand now that the killer has come out.
"That's great news son, I feel light as a bird."
He says that you will definitely be free in just one session.
Inshallah...
The nightmare will be over.
"- Well, we can't say for sure."
- Kuzey...
Don't think about bad things.
Obviously there's a misunderstanding.
"Yes, son, it's not like they'll keep you here for lifetime... ... just because you called him to the forest."
Do you know anything about that man?
Who is he?
What is his story?
His name is Mirza Çeltik.
Ferhat killed that man's son.
"Actually, got him wounded."
Are you gonna allow me?
Or keep interrupting?
What?
Who says you're the only one who can talk?
"Handan Hanım, did you swallow a microphone or something?"
Why do you sound so loud?
"After the incident, the boy was never the same."
"I don't know what Ferhat did to the boy but... ... in the end, he suicided."
"- Hence, his hatred to Ferhat."
He couldn't track Ferhat until he saw his picture on the newspaper upon Ali's death.
"And then, he chased him down."
Had Ferhat served time in prison because of that?
"When you first met Ferhat, that was why he was in prison."
He could kill a man without blinking an eye... ... just because he is my lover.
He's a monster with bloody hands who does not fear any prison.
That boy was Deniz's lover.
Approximate.
Did you find anything on that flight?
No.
"No, not that I remember, no."
"Of course, the thing I remember most was that landing."
I thought that was absolutely great.
Yes.
Frozen brake and 180.
"Yeah, and then have to run another runway."
"Like I said, He didn't let it bend or whatever"
"Now, the next day"
"I don't know if it was the next day or not, but you mentioned that the bodies started washing -"
"Yeah, even that first day they were picking some up."
"And the second day when we were at the Coast Guard station, yeah."
"They brought in the boats, you know."
"Smaller boats, and the 40-footers..."
"And there might have even been some private boats, I'm not sure."
"I can't remember, but they were consolidating at the Coast Guard"
Station.
But they were bringing the bodies in.
You could see them bringing them in.
They'd be in the fetal position.
For warmth.
I don't think they got them all.
I don't know how many there was but there was enough that -
"That's what they would do, obviously, when they froze to death."
"When they drowned and froze to death or both, a combination, I imagine."
That's bad.
"Hell, about two of them were from Rogers City."
"They left 50, 60 kids and stuff."
It was...
It wasn't anybody from the Island here on it.
"But we can't take it back  Late regrets, So don't cry"
Love you were different I know now that you changed me
Even if I push you away  And brush you away
You are everything  To me that can't go
I wanna go back I couldn't love anyone but you
"I don't know what to do  I'm puzzled Yeah, I feel restless"
I think my mind has  gone crazy Yeah
My man's sick pack  Girls fall in love respect
He lures me with energy
Confidence is boss  I'm totally in
Please know my heart  Wanting love
I want you to me my man From now
Hey you look at me only
Hey you don't make  me cry One two three four
Come to me slowly
Are you lured by me Don't smile
Too greasy  I have a man
He is full of charms  You can't be like him
Dark eyebrows  wide shoulders
From head to toe all  of them Oh my God
Please know my heart  Wanting love
I want you to me my man From now
Hey you look  at me only
Hey You don't make  me cry One two three four
Come to me slowly  Break it down take it slow
You keep on reading  my expressions
I feel irritated feeling stuffed
Don't read my face
Hey you look at me only
Hey you don't make  me cry One two three four
Come to me slowly
"Hello, LOEN TV  viewers"
She didn't talk about it for 20 years.
Her face-muscles were motionless.
"Everybody treat her and her mother well in Taiwan, because her father sacrificed himself."
But she says:
I'm not him.
Memory is the selection of images.
"Some elusive, other's printed indelibly on the brain."
"Daddy loves you, so much!"
I know we'll dance at every party.
Each image is like a thread. each thread woven together to make a tapestry of intricate texture. when I first met Louis I said to myself
"He is a healer, he will take care of me."
Do you still love her?
Men fought each other for the privilege of speaking her name.
And the tapestry tells a story.
And I find out he's just a man.
"You're in trouble, they're really mad."
Who them?
They always mad!
And the story is our past.
I'll never forgive you.
If you drive him away.
"The summer I killed my father, I was 10 years old."
"I saw daddy,"
Daddy and Mrs Munroe.
That's a lie!
What's wrong with her?
"Oh, she'll be alright."
Have you told anyone?
Cos if you tell I swear I'll do you harm.
You know i love my sister but she's not unfamiliar with the inside of a mental hospital.
"It's sunday, which one of your patients you gonna see Louis?"
What was wrong with that lady?
"Thanks to you, I get to experience situations that I never thought I would."
Sorry...
"But the work out seems to have had an effect, seeing how you managed to keep up so well."
"But, you knew?"
That we were following you?
It would be weird if I didn't know.
You're obvious.
I didn't have a choice.
When I found out you were going to watch a movie with Hae Ra...
Without knowing...
"But if you happen to like Hae Ra,"
That is something...
I can do nothing about.
Do you want to go somewhere?
What?
I'm asking if you want to go somewhere? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;It's like a dream... &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Me being with Seung Jo. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;With Seung Jo.
It feels like I'm having a life time of happiness on this one day.
I'm happy now
"But, it looks like only families are here."
We are the only ones who look like a couple.
Of course.
"There is a rumor that says, If a couple comes here together, they would break up in six months."
You didn't know?
What?
You didn't know?
It's well known.
"After all, we shouldn't care, since we are not dating."
You know what?
Let's just get out of here!
What to do?!
Wear it until your clothes dry.
"It's cheap, but it's better than wearing wet clothes."
"And then finally, we have 13/15."
"To get 180 from 15, multiply 15 by 12--1510 = 150, 30 remaining for 180."
152 = 30.
"So, 15*12 = 180."
"Multiple numerator by same number, 13."
"We know 12*12 = 144, so just add one more 12 = 156."
"So, we've rewritten each of these fractions with the new common denominator."
"Now, it is very easy to compare them."
We only have to look at their numerators.
"Foe example, the smallest numerator is 80, so 4/9 is the least of these numbers."
"The next smallest number looks like 135, which was 3/4."
"And then the next one is going to be the 144/180, which was 4/5."
"Next is 156/180, which was 13/15."
"Finally, we have 165/180, which was 11/12."
"And, we're done!"
We have finished our ordering.
"HI my name is Allison and I'm the president of Communication Conections,Inc., a nonprofit for families hearing loss.I'm sitting in my favorite place-my garden."
I love all of my flowers.They are beautiful and I have a variety of them.
I work hard to have them grow.
"But my favorite ones are sunflowers.Sure,they are pretty and yellow."
But why do I love sunflowers the most?
It's because they start with such a small seed and you add water and they start to grow.
You add sunlight and they grow more.
"Then all of a sudden,they grow HUGE!"
I was shocked when I saw how big sunflowers grow!
I never knew how big they would grow.
It's kind of t the same for the new nonprofit.
I worked hard for years as a teacher of deaf and hard of hearing children.
I worked for 15 years and I've seen growth and improvement.
"But,I wanted to see a BlG change."
I started with a small idea and decided to set up a nonprofit.
I researched and aksed people to help me.
Then there is nothing we can do.
"It was Narin who tied Mustafa's mind, then she will be the one who would untie it."
"You say that we should bring Narin, don't you?"
"I thought about it, too, but..."
I haven't said anything.
"Very well, but who is going to ask Narin?"
Take it easy!
-Welcome!
-Welcome!
- Take it easy!
- Welcome Yasar - Thank you.
How nice that you've started cleaning here.
This place is important for Guzelyurt.
There aren't many places like this that people can use.
"I love this place very much, too."
How is your brother?
"In fact, I came here for him."
I am going to ask you something difficult.
My brother doesn't recognize or remember anybody;  my mother... my father... me... his friends... no one...
It must be because he is taking a lot of medicine.
They say so...But they say he shut himself off completely and doesn't talk at all.
He doesn't even eat.
The doctor says that visitors whom he knows will be helpful but...
"He only recognized Narin, from a picture."
It will be very helpful if Narin visits my brother.
"Well, what do you want from me?"
"Doctor Bey, we can't ask Narin this."
"If you ask her as a doctor, maybe she would be convinced."
"How could you ask me something like this, Yasar?"
I've already been involved enough in your family affairs.
And I've paid the price for this greatly.
"Your mother, father, everybody see me as their enemy,"
ASSPlRATES!........ASSPlRATES!!!
The Albion Brotherhood will help you!!!
That's right.
"Bennet, mess him up"
Oh my god.
Your face.
Your beautiful face
I mean.
"How are you gonna nail all those chicks now, dude"
"Hold on a second, last night your police chief arrested over 60 African Americans and detained them for two hours while the records were check####."
You don't consider that revolting###
Have you ever seen strom thurmond in his gym shorts?
"Alright, remember your 3Ds."
"Deflect, dodge and deny"
"Hold on, you were saying"
"The police chief works for you, Mr Mayor"
And you know what that kind of policy says### to me.
It says that you're a racist.
Don't be ridicious.
I'm not a racist
I marched on Washington in 1963.
I've supported the affirmative action in my entire career
"Here you go, sir."
You got them on the run now.
Now lower the boom.
"In fact, I'm dating a black woman"
Boom
Then who would that be
My secretary
"Okay, well."
We'll take a break and we'll be right back
"Dodged that bullet, Mike?"
Thank you.
Hey interwebs.
"It's Thursday September 17, 2009 and a viewer informs me as of September 15th,"
I have been on YouTube for 3 years.
3 Mo-Fricken' years.
And a lot's changed since 3 years ago.
I'm no longer that person.
"A lot of people will say, ""Man, yeah time flies."""
No... 3 years ago feels like an entire lifetime away.
I was a completely different person then.
I would personally say a worse person.
A person I wouldn't be friends with right now.
"And back then I was just some douchebag witha camera, and now..."
Well I just get paid to be a douchebag with a camera.
And the conversation over the years has given me a lot of insight.
Even you stupid fuckers with your stupid comments.
"Like ""first""..."
Which shows me that even if  you're the first to the show it doesn't necessarily mean you're the winner.
Sometimes it just means you're an asshole.
But change is all around us.
"I mean, given time, a lot of things can change."
Peoples' perception of those things change with it.
"I mean, look at Lindsay Lohan."
She was adorable.
Then she was hot.
Then she was crazy.
Then she was kinda crazy hot.
Now she just looks like a coked out whore.
So still kinda hot.
Lindsay Lohan is kind of my dirty secret.
"If I was single, I would possibly  have sex with Lindsay Lohan."
"Right now some of you are judging me, but I would have sex with Lindsay Lohan for the same reason that I love skydiving."
Reliance.
- Reliance.
"So if there's an electricity problem in your home.. ..you will call up the Reliance office, won't you?"
You won't call Anil Ambani directly.
"Mr. Anil, we've a electricity problem."
Silence.
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
"These priests, the saints are officers of God."
- No.
They aren't officers.
Officers are educated people.
They are...
"They are salesmen, Your Honour."
They are collection agents.. ..because they own God's franchise.
Your Honour.
This man's an atheist.
He doesn't know what he's saying.
"But, we are saints."
We will forgive him.
But the world will never forgive him for this grave sin.
You won't be able to set foot out of your house.. ..if you say anything else.
ls that your concern for me.. ..or are you threatening me in front of the judge?
We...are concerned for you.
They pay me up quickly.
End this matter.
"My lord, this is enough."
"The donation receipts, the submissions."
There's no agency agreement between God and my clients.
Kanji is saying baseless things.
We cannot file a case against God for such a small thing.
Small?
Which proves all this
"Look, my memory is perfect."
I can remember anything even if it was 30 years ago
And you can ask Sheheibar and Abo Doma
Who are Sheheibar and Abo Doma?
My children
You mean Sameh and Karim?
Isn't that what I said?
You said Sheheibar and Abo Doma
No I said Sameh and Karim
Are you sure you didn't say Sheheibar and Abo Doma?
Who's the one forgetting now?
"Ok Mr.Mahmoud, Thanks"
This case is closed for now
You may go
What did your dad just do?
We all know he doesn't have alzheimer's
Maybe the medication he's talking is affecting him?
"Talk, Shaker"
Didn't you say the medication would only make him unstable and confused?
"Yeah, that's the medical evidence we know"
"But with old age, maybe the medication has affected his memory"
You mean he actually got Alzheimer's?
Even if he did get Alzheimer's
That's what we wanted
Ofcourse not
"We just want to win this case, not hurt dad"
It's the same result
"You won the case, what else do we want?"
"You're right, that's the most important thing"
"If you're gonna empathise, remember prison and all that"
"Once you get the money, just cure him using it."
Octavius has broken his pledge
"lmperator, go to Rome!"
Take your grievance to the Senate
"Strike, first, that's what you said, isn't it?"
A civil war?
"Romans against Romans, Antony!"
You must talk to the Senate!
"Take the world, before it takes you?"
We'll not wait for Octavius to come to us
We'll go to him
"Your fleet, my queen, there, is Octavius"
"More than an equal match, I think"
I don't like it
"What don't you like, General?"
"It's a bad business, attacking by sea"
"lf we really mean to defeat them, we should do it the Roman way strike quickly, by land!"
"Octavius has us blockaded inside the gulf, General"
We have no choice We must fight our way out
"But General, it's full of dangers"
"The enemy is upon us, comrades"
Prepare your stations
It will be decided here
May the gods favor us
There's Marc Antony's ship
Faster!
Faster!
Marc Antony thinks this is a cavalry charge
lf it's a fight he wants...
"Patience, patience"
We'll draw him in
He's going too fast!
He's too far forward!
Good.
Um.
"Two uh, galleries, online galleries, and stuff like that."
Mm-hm.
"But, I have some real good stuff on there, but."
"You know, we have um, an interesting series, it's, it's um, Wordpress."
"But, we are doing an interesting series with one of our authors, uh, Morton Ran Hendrickson."
"And he's doing this series called Start With A Theme, and he looks at three free Wordpress themes."
And ah looks at how to tweak them best for your website and the one that j ust released was on creative portfolios.
"Oh so you can actually, so you know if there's some advice on how to tweak them."
"Oh, that'd be great."
"Yeah, so, he did one on um, photography portfolios, and then the one that just came out yesterday I think is creative portfolios, and then he's doing another one this fall, on, um."
Magazines.
Styles.
Oh.
Magazine work.
I'd be interested in that one.
Yeah.
"My husband and I have a podcast, uh, uh, and we're using WordPress to kinda fix the audio thing."
Uh.
It's very hard to find a WordPress that actually has a good audio for the internet.
Um.
"We're having an earthquake. , Hm?"
We're having an earthquake.
Usgs?
What?
Yeah.
Oh right now?
"Uh-huh. , check on the USGS's website."
Have you been on the earthquake site?
I always am on the earthquake site.
"Is there, is there an immediate uh?"
I have received the reward that I deserved.
"Now I won""t live in this house even for a moment!"
"This is too bad, boss! she shouldn""t have come here."
"lt""s very dangerous. she saw everything with her own eyes."
"And now.. as per syndicate""s rule.. she has no right to live! kaka sir.. beware if you uttered a single word against seema."
"lf there is even a scratch on her body.. ..then I won""t spare you all!"
Pinto!
Quickly hide the goods!
"lnspector, what evidence do you have against me?"
"lf we had any evidence then you.. ..wouldn""t have been free like this."
Then why are you guys harassing me?
Tell me.
Why did you set your house ablaze?
I should be asking you this question.
"When you people were there, then who set my house ablaze?"
Thank God I was not at home at that time!
Fine!
But can you tell us what forced.. ..seema to leave her house at midnight?
"Mr. Diwan, this is my and seema""s personal matter."
"You don""t interfere."
"You don""t worry."
"I won""t let my wife be a burden on you. stop! stop! stop! stop!"
No!
"I don""t want to be a burden on anybody!"
"What burden, dear?"
We are poor.
"But we have a big heart. only a human come to a human""s aid."
"lt""s a sin to commit suicide. come, dear. come."
Mr. Rajesh.
"You couldn""t seize the gold."
And that gold is going to be smuggled tonight.. ..in the form of silver from Alibagh beach.
"But why don""t you reveal yourself?"
Everyone's looking fancy after shopping yesterday.
"Zelo, that's a very unique hat."
- I got it yesterday.
- Where'd you get it?
"I found it off the street, some US brand..."
Your hair color is very artistic
- My hair color?
- It really stands out.
- What color is it?
- It's purple.
Those sunglasses are very unique too.
"Yes, they are unique."
Your facial features are unique.
"I hear that a lot. oh, really?"
I have to buy things suitable for my age and pockets...
"I was surprised, to be honest."
They had everything I was looking for but they were all very costly.
- Limited editions are really expensive.
- The first thing that caught my eye was about 1400 dollars.
With 1400 dollars I can drink Nesquik 6000 times.
I couldn't sleep much but I came out because I wanted to shop.
"Actually, we were all washed up and ready to go to sleep."
But we all came out as soon as we heard we're going shopping.
We can only stay here for about 2 weeks.
There's no time to be sleeping.
At least one more hour...
Shopping helps a singer express more.
"Shoes too, styling for our album"
It helps us to discuss with the stylists.
We would be able to make suggestions and use those items.
I think it's a big help.
This is Hollywood.
"We will show you  our first ballad song,'crying'"
Thank you
A day without you I can't do anything
Never No more
Even if I regret it  It's all done now
I don't have the courage to Take it back
You come to me secretly And shake me again gently
Oh no Oh no Don't hold my heart
I feel like a fool looking at  You and crying
Oh no Oh no  This is not love
"Love, like nothing happened  Like I never loved"
I can't do that  Crying Crying
"Love, even if I try to take it back  Me without you"
Endlessly Crying crying
I open my eyes  You're nowhere
I brush my eyes and look for you But you are not there
I close my eyes and open it again  But you're still not there
I thought it would  be okay without you
But I look at the  memories we had
"Tears and memories that are  Falling out, it's all finished"
For You and Me
You come to me secretly And shake me again gently
Oh no Oh no Don't hold my heart
I feel like a fool looking at  You and crying
Oh no Oh no  This is not love
"Love, like nothing happened  Like I never loved"
I can't do that  Crying Crying
"Love, even if I try to take it back  Me without you"
Endlessly Crying crying
"No, this is not me I used to know"
"I'm going to be okay, I know Whenever I breathe  I hate you"
I can't sleep at night  Telling myself it's okay
I accept this beautiful death.
"Don""t say that, Mr. Rajesh."
You still have to achieve a lot.
A police officer has to play with life and death.
All that is fine.
First finish your dinner.
"lt""s enough!"
"I have to do some work too. shall we, Mr. Diwan? of course."
"Let""s go!"
David!
"- Yes, sir. okay, sir."
Mr. Rajesh.. this is the area.. where smuggling takes place.
Police and custom have raided this place many times.
But no clue was found. one thing is definite.
The smugglers dwell here only.
Yes.
"I entirely agree with you, Mr. Diwan."
These people have ruined the economy of the country.
They smuggle gold.. and shake.. ..the foundation of the government.
But who are these people?
They belong to this country only.
"They dance on other""s tunes."
"And they are leading to our country""s downfall."
This is some big international gang. such people should be shot!
They are not lndians!
They are traitors!
They have no nationality and no community!
Why are you worried?
"As we sow, so shall we reap."
"You don""t know, mother. lt""s about our country""s honour."
lf I had my way I would force all lndian mothers.. ..to first explain national character to their children!
To teach him to lay down their lives for their country!
"Let's put the meatballs in this magic box, just in case."
"- Okay, quick."
"""Comrade Dynin"""
- Come quick.
- Hold it.
"- Well, what have you got in there?"
"- Nothing, take a look."
- Some pioneers you are.
Torturing a poor bird.
"- Keep on pumping DDT, to destroy a bug or three!"
- Enough with the jokes.
No masquerade until we sanitize all the costumes.
- Won't that spoil them?
"- What's more important, clothes or the health of the children?"
- Nothing will spoil them any more.
"They've already been doused with formalin, scrubbed with pumice, and dunked into chlorine."
- I heard at another camp they also fried them with soldering irons.
- These clothes got dragged around various camps for about six years now.
- They are well-travelled costumes.
"- What's all this, now?"
- The band got relieved from nap time.
Let them practise.
- All clear.
"- Hurry up, guys."
Let's go.
- Playing on the go!
Virtuosos!
"""Boys"""
- Hurry.
- What are you guys doing here?
"- Get lost, shoo!"
Go on!
Shall we play a game while eating?
King Game?
Give it to me.
Jin Se Ryeong's interview isn't over yet.

"The kids aren't giving you any more trouble now, are they?"
I heard that there was an accident during the broadcast earlier.
"Ah, yes."
You needn't worry about it.
It is extremely bothersome to deal with kids that powder their faces.
Aigo!
Is the preparation for going public on the KOSDAQ going well?
"Yes, it is going according to plan."
"Nowadays, as soon as you put up a board (sign), you start making preparations to go public or go overseas..."
We are a little late.
It is the most important time now!
Make sure not to harm the company's image and make thorough preparations.
Yes.
"I will bear that in mind, Chairman."
Ah!
"Her father the king said, ""Don't whistle."""
"Her mother the queen said, ""Hai, don't whistle."""
But the princess continued whistling.
(Whistling)
"The years went by and the princess grew up into a beautiful young woman, who whistled even more beautifully."
(Whistling)
"Her father the king said, ""Who will marry a whistling princess?"""
"Her mother the queen said, ""Who will marry a whistling princess?"""
But the king had an idea.
He announced a Swayamvara.
He invited all the princes to come and defeat his daughter at whistling.
"""Whoever defeats my daughter shall have half my kingdom and her hand in marriage!"""
Soon the palace filled with princes whistling.
(Whistling)
Some whistled badly.
Some whistled well.
But nobody could defeat the princess.
"""Now what shall we do?"" said the king."
"""Now what shall we do?"" said the queen."
"But the princess said, ""Father, Mother, don't worry."
I have an idea.
I am going to go to each of these young men and I am going to ask them if they defeated correctly.
"And if somebody answers, that shall be my wish."""
"So she went up to each and said, ""Do you accept that I have defeated you?"""
"And they said, ""Me?"
Defeated by a woman?
"No way, that's impossible!"
No no no no no!
"That's not possible."""
"Till finally one prince said,"
"""Princess, I accept, you have defeated me."""
"""Uh-huh ..."" she said."
Don't spoil her life.
Think logically and tell me before 12 o'clock tomorrow night.
Because after 12 o'clock I am going on a test ride.. ..in my past.
Professor I have no time to think.. ..because tomorrow is my parent's 33rd anniversary.
And I have planned a surprise party for them.
Everyone must be thinking looking at you.. ..that why isn't her husband begging on the streets.
You look like Zhaveri Bazaar's showroom.
It's better than looking like an antique piece in the flea market.
How much does she love me?
Enjoy the party guys.
Go on!
"Excuse me, get me a drink please."
I should do all the work.
"Uncle Bhikhu, were mom and dad always like this.. ..or did this happen after marriage?"
They were sworn enemies.
Their marriage was the second biggest mistake.. ..in the history of mankind.
After the atom bomb.
When actually it wasn't their mistake.. ..but your grandparents.
How is that?
They're dead and all that's left of them are their pictures.
But they still don't like staying next to each other.
Your grandpa Rai Bahadur Dhyanchand.
No one ever took his advice nor was he brave.
Especially before your grandma.
And your grandma Bholi Devi.
She wasn't innocent or a Devi.
Wonder why they got their children married.. ..and sent me here as the dowry?
"""If I had wings, I would soar high."""
"""I would show you the anguish in my heart."""
"Here he comes, the great two-in-one."
Two-in-one?

[laughter]
Star:
I didn't know which one.

David:
It's funny you would say that because [laughter]
"I feel like, I mean in some ways my life would be so much easier if I were just interested in sex."
"There's a whole...I mean, there's some things that I don't have to worry about."
But there's all kinds of other stuff that I do worry about
I mean I can always exchange one big set of worries for another big set of worries.
Elisabeth:
What about when you're dating?
Like if you're dating someone and you've had romantic relationships in the past is this something you come out and tell them right away?
Do you only date other people who are asexual?
"And if the person you're with is sexual, how do you match up?"
David:
I date people who are sexual.
I pretty much have dated people who are sexual.
Elisabeth:
You tell them right away?
David:
"Yeah, and I tell them."
They find out right away.
I mean it's...I'm pretty out.
He is escaping !
You take the short cut.
You take the long cut.
Go!
I won't spare him!
My cycle!
- I won't spare him!
Where am I skating?
My pajama !
I won't spare you !
Where is he hiding?
My name is Gorpade.
I have felled big time goons.
Manish is not here.
"Don't worry, Manish will come with the diamonds."
Where is Hira ( diamond)?
"- Sir, I am here."
"Not you, where is the diamond thief?"
Where are you going?
I saved my life with great difficulty.
"Nowadays, guns are fired somewhere, and bombs are blasted somewhere."
"It was difficult to live before ; nowadays, it is difficult to survive."
"That is why I am telling you my love, get married soon, have a honeymoon. . . sire children."
- You are always joking.
"No Shalu, if you get separated from me, what will you do?"
"Will you toss in bed, or sigh?"
- Neither!
"I'll just write love letters to you round the clock. "" If ever you get separated from me, what will you do? """
""" Will you toss in bed, or sigh? """
""" I will neither toss in bed, nor sigh """
""" I will just write love letters to you round the clock """
""" If ever you get separated from me. . . """
"Because Faruk is lying,... because Faruk is an unreliable man."
"Ah,Selim..-An hour long he was droning ""No i'm not a thief,no the business went wrong ""... ..."
"""No, don't worry , when i get the money, i'll pay back..."""
""" Is it not so?"
Couldn't he tell this on the phone?
He wanted to talk face to face - And with it we are alright !
"Again, he wanted to ask for money from you.. and when he saw me, gave up that idea."
And he is taking me for a fool... as i don't understand his mind..
Again he did a wrong calculation.
He couldn't guess we would come together of course.
"It 's enough now, Selim.- And you, if I were not there when he called you, would you tell me? would you tell me come,we go together?"
He is even calling you to come to the hotel..Impertinent( Inappropriate.)
"What is there, he did not want to be seen."
"Anyway you're the lawyer of the other side, but don't forget a common friend of ours is in a very difficult situation."
"Okay, i know, you're right, see you."
"Yes, Burcu."
Okay i know i'm late.
I am on my way.
I am coming to the office.
What?...
"Oh, No..."
Which hospital?
"I am not crazy, I am not crazy man!"
I am not crazy.
Untie me!
"Find my lawyer, let my brother come to me."
"Man is okay, be quiet... - Leave me, i'm not crazy.."
Man i am not mad...
Leave me!
"Untie me ,i'm not crazy- Stop man, stop,they left.."
You will get mad by force!
Did they really inform my lawyer?-Yes they did..&amp;gt; Good...
"I said, ""I don't know."
"Why?"""
"And they said, ""It's really important."
"You gotta get it out of here."""
"So they talk to the pilot and aircraft commander and he came over and he said, ""Brian what do you think?"""
"Or, BJ, they called me."
"""Can you haul that thing?"""
"I was looking at it and there was a master sergeant there and stuff and said, ""What is it?"""
"He said, ""I can't tell you what's in it."
"But it has to be out of here, because they've having trouble..."""
That's that real hard area in Pakistan right now.
All the troubles and everything.
There were troubles back then.
"So, there was an old"
CG marked out with the circle and an X in it for
Center of Gravity.
"So, I said, ""Well, is that accurate?"""
"He said, ""Well, I don't know."""
"I said, ""Hey, listen, if you want me to haul it, I have to know pretty close because... the plane is big and touchy on this, you know."""
"He said, ""There's probably weight on both ends."""
"I said, ""What's it weigh?"""
"There was like 20-22,000 pounds on it."
"He said, ""We probably added a couple 3,000."""
"I said, ""Okay, I don't care what's in it."
You can have sugar in it.
I don't care what's in it.
"But I do have to know if it can hold it."""
"So he says that, so I said I can fly it - I can haul it."
We had a load of stuff.
We ran that stuff back down to
Karachi and then they'd ship it out there in boats and stuff like that.
Flew back up to
Let me try to take this one step further.
(Laughter)
I'm going to try to square a four-digit number this time.
You can all take your time on this;
"I will not beat you to the answer on this one, but I will try to get the answer right."
"To make this a little bit more random, let's take the fourth row this time,"
"let's say, one, two, three, four."
"If each of you would call out a single digit between zero and nine, that will be the four-digit number that I'll square."
Nine.
Seven.
Five.
Eight.

(Laughter)
Eight-digit capacity -- don't you hate that?
"So, since we've reached the limits of our calculators -- what's that?"
Does yours go higher?
Volunteer:
I don't know.

"Oh, yours does?"

I can probably do it.

The volume of a cube is equal to its length times its width times its height.
"A cube with side x has length x, width x, and height x."
"So its volume is equal to x times x times x, or x to the third."
Shane takes a big cube of butter with side length 5 from the fridge.
"So I'm assuming-- well, they're not giving us the units."
Maybe it's 5 centimeters.
With side length 5 from the fridge.
Maybe I'll go with 5 centimeters.
That seems reasonable.
Then he cuts out a little cube of side length 2 from one of the corners of the cube.
Write an expression that describes the volume of butter left.
So let's think about it.
The original volume of butter that was-- they're saying side length 5.
I'm visualizing it as 5 centimeters.
"Its volume is going to be 5 times 5 times 5, which we could just write as 5 to the third power."
And then he takes out a little chunk from that.
And the volume that he takes out is the volume of that little cube.
And that little cube has side length 2.
So its volume is going to be 2 times 2 times 2.
Or another way of writing that is 2 to the third power.
So it's going to be 5 to the third minus 2 to the third.
Why are we doing this?
Where are we going?
Why?!
What?!
Oohh!
We're in Paris!
"Yes, exactly, why don't we just stop and enjoy it?"
Just look.
I am grateful to them

She is WOW!
It's the end of year presidential elections and I'm here on the streets... ... to see what citizens really look for in their next presidential candidate.
Someone who is honest and knows how to communicate
I hope that someone who is successful in their field will run.
Someone who is proud for this generation and can blend in with today's values.
If you had to nominate someone?
Announcer Gong Jung Han?
"Gong Jung Han, the announcer."
"If i had to choose, Gong Jung Han."
Do you think he'll really run now?
"If he does, we should vote for him, right?"
We should know what kind of person he is before choose him.
It's ridiculous to vote for him just because he's our next door neighbour.
Gong Jung Han is Jo Ara's Husband.
They're such a lovebirds.
"If her family happy, then wouldn't the nation be happy too?"
Do you think Jo Ara is good?
I'll start the car.
"Honey, please keep our country safe today."
Let's see.
What's this?
Why is this out?
Are you tempted?
Thank you for buying.
My husband was the biggest help before the publication of my book.
He gave up his own study room for me.
And even my son all the way in America helped supervise me writing.
I write this without any exaggerations or lies.
I wanted you all to hear my true voice.
Which part should I read?
Probably 50 feet high
There's a picture of the ice house right there.
They put it right up to the heaves.
You can imagine how much - how many tons and tons of ice would be in there.
500 pound case.
"That was to supply the whole island all summer, or?"
"Yeah, in the 40s, yeah."
Probably 90% of them.
There wasn't that many refrigerators then.
"And in the 50s, you got more."
"But the people still that owned refrigerators, there weren't much size to them or anything."
"And even if the people got one, their old ice boxes, I still delivered a lot of ice."
"They delivered every day, pretty much."
Who did?
Dad.
And he knew every size of every ice box.
"One day he might be going along the harbor, next day he'd be out different places."
"Of course, there wasn't any out here then."
"But, Brother's, they'd take a couple hundred pounds every day."
Couple wash tubs.
"One would be full of the pop and stuff, and the other the cooks would use for the lettuce and -"
The Christian Brothers?
Yeah.
The hotels.
Talk a little bit about the Christian
Brothers at that time.
What were they like?
"Oh, real nice friendly guys"
They come here - there'd be two batches.
"I think 40 at a time, maybe."
40 rings a bell.
And then there was - they had a German guy and his wife were the cooks.
And we brought it all to bankruptcy.
"Of course, all the creditors - We tried to get our members their money back."
"Ten cents on the dollar, and they did."
Some of it was interesting.
How did you and De meet then?
I flew down on a Thursday and caught the Friday and Saturday and when I came back I picked up a case of some Irish whiskey.
I knew that a bunch of friends of ours were having a St. Patrick's Day party.
"So we flew in, I grabbed a jug and went on over there and she was making some salads or doing something like that."
She was looking pretty good.
One thing led to another and that was it.
"She had a background on the island, with her family?"
"She knew some friends, that was it."
The friends that she was at...
Maria [?] was married a guy from here.
And different people
They all went to school.
These were the nurses.
They were having a party.
"She wasn't there, but it was the people that she graduated with."
There was a bunch of them that used to stick together.
[?]
"Cole, Donald Cole's wife,"
Ellen [?].
She was one of them.
"So was De a nurse, too?"
"No, she was an executive secretary."
"She hung out with some Beaver Island nurses, and that was her only connection?"
"Yep, she'd never been to the island."
But then she went to Detroit.
I was sparking her for about a year but I wasn't
looking for that ring yet.
But of course she went to
"Oh, I'm sorry to have bored you with such story."
[Seul Hye]
Do not worry.
I have heard nothing.
You've changed somewhat since I've seen you last.
"You were cold as stone last time, but now you're even smiling."
"Back then, there was a man I had my heart set upon."
"Even though I may seem to be cold, I have my integrity."
Back then?
You speak of it as if it were a thing from the past.
Yes.
He was someone who I could not be with.
"So, I ended things in a petty way."
Is that so?
"Then, you could stay by my side tonight, right?"
"Forgive me, but I already made a prior engagment."
A prior engagement?
Yes.
"A favor was done for me, thus I promised to return the favor by greeting him tonight."
You wench!
You're arrogant!
How dare you put excuses as greetings to disobey him when he's speaking?
That's fine.
It's her arrogance that intrigues me.
Seol Hye!
Come outside for a minute!
"Forgive me, it seems I am required."
Alright.
She's a geisha from the commoners.
"You can just order her, why are you just watching her?"
I don't know why.
"Somehow, I can't seem to give her up."
It is dropping down...
"Oh, thank God..."
"Yasar, could you please buy these drugs immediately?"
"Look at us, Serdar Bey..."
"I am trying to keep my family together, but..."
"But, I can't."
And mother's heart can bear upto some point.
"Whatever prescription you give me, whatever you tell me..."
Useless...
My only medicine is Mustafa's health... his goodness...
When I see Asiye pregnant and in despair...
When I think about the innocent baby yet to be born...
I am losing my mind...
Be patient...
He is being treated.
"Believe me, the things being done is for Mustafa's benefit."
Tell Narin... ...to see Mustafa.
Help us.
We are falling apart...
We are breaking into little pieces..
This mansion is collapsing onto us.
We are getting burried under its weight.
It broke my heart to see the woman in that condition.
She was begging so desperately that
"It broke my heart...She said ""This mansion is collapsing onto us."""
"""We are getting burried under it."""
We.. stayed burried a lot under those walls...
Nobody heard our voice.
She was about to have a stroke because of high blood pressure...
"Luckily, you were there on time, Serdar."
Mustafa didn't recognize anyone of them.
He doesn't communicate with anybody.
"Oh, he's my neighbor."
Gatsby?!
What gatsby?
Tom:
"Come on, daisy."
Why candles?
"In two weeks, it'll be the longest day in the year."
Do you always watch
For the longest day in the year and then miss it?
I do.
We ought to plan something.
All right.
What'll we plan?
What do people plan?
Look at that.
"My little finger, it's all black and blue."
"You did that, tom."
"I know you didn't mean to,"
But that's what I get for marrying a brute of a man.
A great big hulking brute of a man.
"Oh, daisy, I hate that word, ""hulking."""
Even in kidding.
Hulking.
How do you know which measure of center best describes the data?
Let's see.
"We have the mean, the median, and the mode."
But how do you choose?
"In this lesson you will learn how to summarize the center of data with a single number  by examining the mean, median, and mode."
Let's start by remembering how to find the mode and median.
Here's the graph about how many books sixth graders  at Taylor Middle School read this summer.
The mode is the number that appears most often.
"So, in this data set, the mode is two."
Oh my God!
Oh man!

"- Beautiful, he is attempting to push forward here hoping that the fact he can just overrun the ramp, since the Hydras deal so much damage."
"- Yeah, he has two Infestors as well."
This is going to be wild.

And Alicia is using them so well!
"-	And you know what, he's gotta use the Scan off of this Orbital right here, so he has to land it."
But the DT!
"Moving into position preventing the landing, he stopped the Missile Turret."
Oh My God!
"Alicia, absolutely shutting down MarineKingPrime here with a single DT."
"He is going to surround the Missile Turret, it is going to get up, and Alicia's timing is so impeccable!"
He moves that DT away.

"It was the USDA that, sort of, came up with the idea of working on pennycress."
And he's going to tell us a little about how they got started and where they are now in the research side of things.
"But before we get to Terry, I'd like to introduce our overhead..."
"Dr. Bill Bailey, he is the director of the School of Agriculture."
"And he has some welcome words, I guess."
William Bailey:
Words of welcome.
A big decision I was involved in was whether or not to have coffee or cocoa or chili today.
We opted for the coffee.
Welcome.
You're part of a historic event.
Truly historic.
"This is the first Pennycress Field Day ever, in the history of the world."
"Right here, at Western illinois University."
So cutting-edge stuff.
"We're very pleased that you took the time to come here and share some of Win's work with him,"
It's exciting stuff.
It's new stuff.
It continues to the tradition that he started here at Western of looking at new ways and new crops to help
Illinois farmers make money.
"So I'll turn it over to you, Win."
Win Phippen:
Thank you.
And I'll turn it back to Terry.
Terry Isbell:

But Edie is not prepared for how difficult teaching Nathan will be.
"OK, where were you?"
The most basic school work is a chore for Nathan and a challenge for his mother.
Nine times six is 54?
Do I put it under here?
Do you remember what to do next?
You put it under here?
"OK, what do you put?"
5-4.
Nope.
5-4.
5-4.
I don't know that.
"OK, I'm trying to remind you."
"By early summer, Nathan's frustration has turned to anger."
"He is kicking doors, hitting his brother."
He loses control.
And that part is what's frightening.
His family is becoming increasingly fearful that Nathan's plummeting self esteem might cause him to hurt himself or others.
Sometimes I can't stop crying.
"And, like, I'm just in my bed with my head down."
I just get sad.
"A little while ago, like last year, I was like, I could just kill myself."
I tried to run away.
I just felt like no one really wanted me to be there.
"Nathan's mom, desperate to do something to improve her son's self image, begins to look outside Bear Creek for help."
An hour down the road are the offices of pediatrician Mel Levine whose specialty is finding out what's going on with kids
like Nathan.
Dr. Levine tests for strengths and weaknesses.
"You know, for kids, success is like a vitamin."
And it's a real vitamin deficiency to grow up success deprived.
Let's just compare it to the original.
That the police are harassing people!

Even after knowing I am in trouble.
You have crossed your limit.
Even beautiful face is a vice.
People only cast evil sight.
What sight of love did you cast on me!
You should control your heart.
You should control your heart.
There is twilight after every dawn.
Why did you make your plight bad?

I would've never married you if mother hadn't pressurised me.
You've always been the biggest geek in the world.
"You don't have any style of speaking, no personality and.. ..your outfits.. - Don't say anything about the outfits, Mala."
You dare not say anything about them.
No one washes clothes like I do in entire Lokhandwala.
I am talking about wearing and not cleaning.
"And that's what will say even after I die, isn't it?"
That buy a plain cloth to cover her body.
"Oh no, I know you will stand up, throw a tantrum."
"""Couldn't you get Kanjivaram?"""
"Exactly, you didn't give me anything during my lifetime."
I will definitely ask for something after I die.
I didn't give you anything as long as you were alive?
What did you give me?
Did you even buy me a dog?
All our neighbours have dogs.
But we don't.
- I am there.
"Then why do you need a dog to secure the house, madam?"
At least the dog will keep me company.
It will go along with me.
No moreno doubthe was the killer.
Does that meanyou made ​​a decision?
yes
I will rulein two days.

- Let us go.
You dont worry baby.
Nothing will happen to him.
He is angry with me so he did not do.. .. the job I offered.
Ego problem.
And joined in this dirty job and now arrested.
As a man he should have some ego but not this much.
As your father I have to try something.
But how?
I have to fall at their feet.
I will directly talk with the home minister.
I think it is the correct idea.
Small influences will not work.
Since it is a terrorist case.
Hello!
Is it the home minister?
"Yes, this is home minister speaking."
What is the matter?
"Its me sir, Kona Ranga Rao."
My fellow is in trouble sir.
It will not be a big problem.
If you give the surety.. ..he can be released.
No problem.
When I said that my father arranged a job for you.. ..you laughed at me.
As a result we became the laughing stock.. .. for everyone.
A man should not have so much ego Venkat.
You are crazy.
You are fortunate to be released.
Otherwise what would have happened?
"Shailu, you dont understand."
This is the drama ploted by ..your father and that Bhadram to separate us.
"Put a zero, okay?"
Yeah.
"If you have a longer vector, than your diagonal is long."
Does it just take the first?
Yes.
[inaudible] it kills the excess.
"Yeah, remember, so these things over run over here."
And they run over here.
And it just goes this way.
Everything is lined up according to here.
"Oh so, so that bottom the negative diaginol the diagnol negative what ever it was it got rid of the first section of the vector."
Yeah right here.
So thinks about putting the vector down right here.
Says well okay you put the vector start it here go down and then come up again to show that it doesn't exist.
Okay and on the other side it gets rid of the n of the vector.
Yes.
Okay.
Or it could be actually I think that's wrong.
It's the other way.
It goes this way.
So.
"These guys, here. ."
Get stuff thrown out down here.
And this stuff up here gets thrown stuff up there.
Okay?
But same concept.
"So let's put this E2 in, cuz we just, created this vector with an occasional zero."
"And that guy goes right, here."
"If I do this,"
"Come on, come on."
Look at that.
Oop.
They were selling them by the road.
You don't like it?
It's the same?
"Then, it's couple t-shirts?"
Hamburger!
I was so hungry. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;It's really good. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; Better than the delicious French or Italian food. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; I won't be able to eat such a delicious hamburger again. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; I wish time would stop right here.
Eat!
Don't just look at it
"But, why did you take my hand and run earlier?"
You were with Hae Ra. . .
That's because. . .
You were the one closest to me.
Thank you.
I keep causing trouble all the time.
I haven't really experienced something that was difficult for me.
But after you showed up...
I feel like I'm living in a completely different world.
I feel like I'm solving a sudden problem without an answer.
That may be an ordeal that I should get over.
"Something I can't avoid, something I have to solve."
Is the ordeal...possibly me?
"At first, I wondered about how to react to it and just wanted to avoid it."
"But now, I won't run from it."
"If the problem is not wrong, then there has to be an answer."
I'm going to approach it head on.
Huh?
You're going to face me head on?
If you don't get it then forget it.
"No, I get it."
"So, I am an ordeal to you and you were only trying to run away."
"But you changed your mind, and now, you are with me."
Are you proposing to me?!
You wouldn't be writing about mortality.
And then so.
Right.
You don't have to say that.
"I mean, things that are sort of obvious, don't say it."
"Just say the important limitations of your study, the important strengths."
"And, you don't have to label them as strengths and limit."
"It's sort of a jargon now, every epidemiologic paper, you have to find the word limitation."
[laugh].
"Yes, yes."
"Or, you know, just, state what they are."
"Yeah, yeah, good."
"So, I guess, You, you know, I guess just avoid making your paper seem like a, a thesis."
Yeah I've encountered that as well.
I'm reviewing papers.
Yeah.
Where you can tell that a.
Somebody had taken the thesis.
Yeah.
And just tried to turn it into a paper.
It's a very different product.
Right.
"So paying attention to the, the actually writing like a paper."
Right.
He says it's a great tip.
Mm-hm.
And lets talk a little bit about resubmission.
So lets say that you're offered the opportunity.
"The, the paper's rejected but."
Mm-hm.
You're offered the opportunity to resubmit it with a lot of comments from reviewers.
Mm-hm.
How is it?
Isn't it a good name?
Would you guide me to where you first entered this park?
It would be tough if another animals enters.
This is a place for repairing hunted robots.
"Anyhow, Doctor Ochanomizu, please take a look at that."
It's a very aggressive elephant called Zora.
Very aggressive?
All animal robots here are designed not to take people's lives.
"However, this Zora is different."
It kills people ruthlessly.
Why did you build such dangerous thing?
It's thrilling.
There wouldn't be any thrill if there weren't a crazy beast.
But this one is too dangerous.
I need your help.
My help?
Please rebuild this Zora to listen to what workers here say at least.
Do you think I'm going to help you?
"Please, Doctor Ochanomizu."
Visitors are also expecting a lot from Zora.
It sure leaves me some profit as well.
This is not right.
You are doing this for the sake of money...
That's right.
I became a scientist to earn money.
A man like you is not suitable for the world of science.
"Doctor Hura, a real elephant is shot dead near the spring."
What?
Is that true?
"There are real animals outside this park, right?"
Then there must be some place where they enter through.
You've heard of that?
"No It's quite alright, but a bit cold in...from October and into November."
So...
"""I like to pull pranks so much, tjomfallera, tjomafallera, hey!"""
I remember when
"I remember, I remember when I lost my mind"
There was something so pleasant about that place
Even your emotions have an echo in so much space
And when you're out there without care
"Yeah, I was out of touch"
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
I just knew too much
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Possibly
And I hope that you are having the time of your life
But think twice
That's my only advice
"Come on now, who do you"
"Who do you, who do you, who do you think you are?"
"Ha ha ha, bless your soul"
You really think you're in control?
"Well, I think you're crazy"
I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
Just like me
My heroes had the heart
To live their lives out on a limb
And all I remember
"Is thinking, I want to be like them"
Ever since I was little
"You can also begin to find out why they stick, if you want."
Why?
"What is so sticky , what is so appealing about this?"
"Why is this thought, this feeling so sticky?"
And hold this question.
Don't ask two / three questions.
Hold this question one at a time.
What is so enticing about this thought?
Ok?
"And you can see ,'Ok, because it promises that'"
"Ok, as you said before, 'that is going to bring me happiness'."
Ok.
That's the first thing you've identified now.
"Now, you find out 'bring happiness to 'who' exactly'?"
"Just this question, 'who's going to become happy?'"
"And initially, it's going to be a lot of blurring."
"'Wow, you can't see. wow', you know like,"
Something can't handle this question.
"'Who's , Who suffers?"
It's me'
No.
But don't just satisfy yourself with the assumed 'me'.
"Ask again, you know, 'who, who will, who's going to be happy?'"
And keep your attention still and hold this question.
And this stillness and focus of attention will begin to burn.
"It will begin to burn, all this noise."
Stay with it.
Stay with it.
You might find yourself going to sleep a little bit.
That's Ok.
Hold the question.
Even write it down.
"already here -- so that's one of column one,"
"that's one times column one, right there."
And now I want to add on --
so I'm going to hook the next vector onto the front of the arrow will
start the next vector and it will go this way.
"So let's see,"
can I do it right?
"If I added on one of these vectors,"
"it would go left one and up two, so we'd go left one and up two, so"
it would probably get us to there.
Maybe I'll do dotted line for that.
Okay?
"That's one of column two tucked onto the end,"
but I wanted to tuck on two of column two.
So that --
the second one -- we'll go up left one and up two also.
It'll probably end there.
And there's another one.
So what
I've put in here is two of column two.
Added on.
And where did I end up?
What are the coordinates of this
result?
What do I get when I take one of this plus two of that?
"I do get that, of course."
"There it is, x is zero, y is three, that's b."
That's the answer we wanted.
And how do I do it?
You see I do
it just like the first component.
I have a two and a minus two that
Kuzey's case will drop when the real killer is trialled.
And then he'll be free again.
"Okay, let's hope so."
And then I'll divorce and be free as well.
"Cemre, for God's sake don't live in vain hope."
- What hope?
- I'm saying I will divorce.
"I mean, for after you got divorced don't get hopes."
Look sweetie Güney is a black thorn between you two.
Nothing will change this reality.
Put this in your mind.
"Mom, what are you doing?!"
I'm giving them proper shape.
You can't send heart shaped cookies to jail.
You want to embarrass him?
"They will mock him, girl."
If they see them heart shaped like this.
"And you know Kuzey, how easy it is to push his buttons."
"See it looks nice, when it's plain and simple as well."
He can offer it to the other jailers as well.
"Okay, it seems you thought of everything."
"Well, we need a smart person in the house."
"Then, dear mom..."
You brush some eggs over those.
While I'm writing Kuzey a note.
What note are you talking about?
You've written a novel since last night.
"Please, I expect some respect to my privacy."
I didn't read your letter.
I just saw you writing it.
- Of course you didn't read...
- Why would I read it?

Background.
Allies.
"The plan for Operation ""Husky"" called for the sea attack of the island by two armies. One would land on the South Eastern coast. Another would land on the central Southern Coast. The attack would be helped by naval gunfire and bombing. The commander was the American General Dwight D. Eisenhower."
"The Allied land forces were from the American, British and Canadian armies. They were put into two groups. The Eastern Task Force was led by General Bernard Montgomery. The Western Task Force was commanded by Lieutenant General George S. Patton. In addition to the sea landings, airborne troops were to be flown in. They would capture bridges and high ground."
The Allied naval forces were put into two groups to transport the invading armies.
"The island was defended by the two corps of Italian 6th Army under General Alfredo Guzzoni. In early July the total Axis force in Sicily was about 200,000 Italian and 32,000 German troops, and 30,000 ""Luftwaffe"" ground staff. By late July there were 70,000 German troops."
Planning.
The attack plan was made on 17 May.
"At the Casablanca Conference in January 1943, political leaders and the military leaders of the US and Britain met to discuss future plans. The British wanted an invasion of Sicily. General Eisenhower was made Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces."
Preparatory operations.
"Once the Axis forces had been defeated in Tunisia, the Allied bombers attacked the airfields of Sardinia, Sicily and southern Italy. They also bombed industrial targets in southern Italy and the ports of Naples, Messina, Palermo and Cagliari."
Deception.
"To distract the Axis, the Allies did several trick operations. The most famous was ""Operation Mincemeat"". The British allowed a corpse disguised as a British officer to drift ashore in Spain, carrying a briefcase with fake secret documents."
"These stated that the Allies were planning to invade Greece and Sardinia, and had no plans to invade Sicily. The Germans thought the documents were real. The Germans moved much of their defences from Sicily to Greece."
Battle.
Two British and two American attacks by airborne forces were done on the night of 9–10 July. They wanted to capture the bridge over the River Anape. Strong wind made them land in the wrong places. Airborne troops attacked patrols. A platoon captured the bridge and fought off counterattacks for a few hours.
The strong winds made the sea landings hard. Landings were made on 10 July on twenty-six main beaches.
By the evening of 10 July the seven Allied divisions were ashore and the port of Syracuse had been captured.
Alexander's plan was to establish his forces on a line between Licata in and Catania. He wanted to capture ports.

Classes of natural numbers.
Prime numbers.
A prime number is a natural number which has only two divisors: 1 and itself.
Highly composite numbers.
"A highly composite number is a natural number that has more divisors than any smaller natural number. They are used a lot in geometry, grouping, and time measurement."
The first 20 highly composite numbers are:
"1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 120, 180, 240, 360, 720, 840, 1260, 1680, 2520, 5040, 7560"

Integers.
"Integers are a set of numbers. They usually are in arithmetic and number theory. There are many subsets of integers. These can cover natural numbers, prime numbers, perfect numbers, etc."
Popular integers are −1 and 0.
Orders of magnitude.
"Integers can be written in orders of magnitude. This can be written as 10""k"", where ""k"" is an integer. If ""k"" = 0, 1, 2, 3, then the powers of ten for them are 1, 10, 100 and 1000. This is used in scientific notation."
"Each number has its own prefix. Each prefix has its own symbol. For example, ""kilo-"" may be added to the beginning of ""gram."" This changes the meaning of ""gram"" to mean that the gram is 1000 times more than a gram: one kilogram is the same as 1000 grams."
Rational numbers.
"A rational number is a number that can be written as a fraction with two integers. The numerator is written as and the denominator(which cannot be zero) is written as . Every integer is a rational number. This is because in integers, 1 is always the denominator of a fraction."
"Rational numbers can be written in infinitely many ways. For example, 0.12 can be written as ""three twenty-fifths"" (), ""nine seventy-fifths"" (), etc."
Irrational numbers.
Irrational numbers are numbers that cannot be written as a fraction. These are written as algebraic numbers or transcendental numbers.
Real numbers.

Hypercomplex numbers.
A hypercomplex number is a word for an element of a unital algebra over the field of real numbers.
Transfinite numbers.
"Transfinite numbers are numbers that are ""infinite"". They are larger than any finite number. They are, however, not absolutely infinite."
Physical Constants.

Beriberi
Beriberi (also called vitamin B1 deficiency) is a disease of the nervous system. It happens when a person does not get enough thiamine (vitamin B1) in their diet.
"Thiamine helps the body turn food into energy. People need thiamine for good brain function and a healthy liver, skin, hair, and eyes. It also helps the nervous system work properly."
"Without enough thiamine, a person’s body cannot create all the energy the person needs. As a result, people with beriberi have severe lethargy and feel exhausted. Beriberi can also cause muscles to get weaker. These symptoms can make it hard for a person to do simple things."
Some people with beriberi have heart problems or even die. Beriberi can also cause problems with the gastrointestinal system.
"Most people get enough vitamin B1 in their regular diet. However, some groups are more likely to get beriberi. These include people who drink a lot of alcohol and people who eat an unhealthy or unbalanced diet, like a diet of mostly white rice."
There are two kinds of beriberi: wet and dry. Wet beriberi mainly affects the cardiovascular system. Dry beriberi affects the nervous system. There is also a rare type of genetic beriberi.
"Most of the time, dry beriberi and wet beriberi happen at the same time in the same person. When this takes place, the victim is likely to only get the symptoms of one beriberi."

Grotte Mandrin
"The Grotte Mandrin is a cave near Montélimar. It is near the small French town Malaverne, in the Drôme department. It is more like a shelter, that protects from the weather, and not really a cave. It is an archeological site: There are many well-preserved finds from the transition from the Middle to Upper Palaeolithic. The oldest layer of finds is 120,000 years old."
It is named after the French folk hero Louis Mandrin.
Location.
"The Abri is about southeast of Malataverne town center. It is at the foot of an exposed limestone cliff at 245 m height. At the site, the valley is very narrow, only about . Important traffic routes pass through there: the A7, N7, D169 and the high-speed line LGV Méditerranée ."
Topography.
"Today, the Grotte Mandrin has a depth of . At some point part of it collapsed. Today, large boulders on the slope below are still there. The covered area was originally much larger. There is an opening of about facing north. At the front, the cave has a height of about . From the middle of the cave, it gets lower. At the back, the height is about less."
"In 2013, a fence was built on the space in front of the case. In 2016, video surveillance was installed."
History.
"When he found traces Bronze Age settlements there in 1960, Gaston Etienne (1923-2010) recognized that the case was important for archaeology. Etienne was a councillor in Malaverne. Since 1993, there have been excavations each year. Since 2006, Ludovic Slimak - a research associate from the University of Toulouse and the CNRS is overseeing these excavations. There are twelve cultural layers at the site, In 2014, seven layers had been excavated. The layers date from 42.000 BP (called early Aurigacien) to 56,000 BP (La Quina-Mousterian)."
"The oldest known evidence that anatomically-modern humans (homo sapiens) were present in Europe was found in the Batcho Kiro Cave in Bulgaria; this evidence is 45,820 to 43,650 years (Cal BP) old. In February 2022, it was announced that part of a tooth was found at the Mandrin Cave. It came from a layer of the Mandrin Cave under and over which Neanderthal remains have been recovered, but this ""baby tooth"" has been attributed to a child of Homo sapiens. Articles in the Journals Science, as well as in Nature, said that the tooth was too badly damaged to be able to tell with certainty if it was from a Neanderthal, or a human."
Superabundant number
A superabundant number is a type of natural number. They were defined by Leonidas Alaoglu and Paul Erdős in 1944.
Definition.
"Any natural number ""n"" is called superabundant when a certain equation is true."
"In this equation, ""m"" is every integer less than ""n"". ""σ"" is the sum of every positive divisor of that number."
"An example would be to use the number 9. For every number less than 8, the sigma is 1, 3, 4, 7, 6, 10, 8 and 16. (""σ""(""m""))/""m"" is 16/9. (""σ""(n))/n is equal to 13/9. 13/9 is less than 16/9. This makes 9 not a superabundant number"
"The first few superabundant numbers are 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 120, ... ."

The line of succession to the British throne is the order in which members of the royal family would come to the throne if the reigning king or queen died.
"At present the first in line is William, Prince of Wales and then Prince William's son, Prince George of Wales."
"Traditionally, males came before females in the line of succession.

This system of inheritance is called absolute primogeniture, as opposed to male-preference primogeniture. When someone who is in line to the throne has a child, that child comes after them and their older children, but before anyone else in the line of succession."
Excluded from the line of succession are Catholics and illegitimate children.

Mugello region
How Australia was settled.
"The main idea is the Out of Africa hypothesis: It says that humans developed on the African continent, and spread from there. Another important site is called Kow Swamp, in the northern part of Victoria. It consists of about twenty skeletons, which are between 5,000 and 10,000 years old. The morphology of Mungo Man is noticeably different from these skeletons. For this reason, some researchers have said that Australia was probably settled twice. The settlers were probably descendants of Homo erectus and came from the Asian mainland. This theory is based on the analysis of mitochondrial DNA. If this is true, the two lines, that of Mungo Man and that of modern humans, separated a long time ago. This would also mean that Mitochondrial Eve of this line and that of modern humans would be older than mitochondrial Eve of all living humans."

those were the days!

Fixed-gear bicycle
"A fixed-gear bicycle (also called a ""fixie"") is a bicycle that has no freewheel mechanism (allowing pedals to stay still while moving)."
It is a dangerous bike to use in towns. This type of bicycle is becoming more and more popular around the world.
"Fixed-gear bicycles are very light. They are built without any unnecessary gadgets, such as chain rings or freewheel hub. When a person rides a fixed-gear bicycle, he/she/they need not put a lot of energy into it as with a geared bike."
"Most bicycles have a freewheel so the pedals will stay stationary while the bicycle is moving and so that the rider can ride without pedaling going forward or down a hill. Fixed-gear bicycles have even simpler mechanisms with pedals fixed to the back wheel. That means that the rider cannot stop pedaling. When the rear wheel turns, the pedals turn in the same direction. This allows a cyclist to use a brake by putting a pressure in opposite directions to pedals, so that the mechanism will not rotate."
"It also makes it possible to ride backwards, although learning to do so is much more difficult than riding forwards."

"Cartwright wrote that the illness caused people to break and mishandle everything they touched. They walked about as if they were in a daze, or half asleep. They often argued with people in charge and caused disturbances. They did not feel pain, and did not react when physically punished. It affected people who did not have white (or European) people to look after them."

Agalychnis callidryas
"Agalychnis callidryas, known as the red-eyed treefrog is a species of tree frogs."
"Red-eyed tree frogs spend most of their time on large tropical leaves. They are not poisonous, and rely on camouflage to protect themselves. During the day, they stay still, cover their blue sides with their back legs, tuck their bright feet under their stomachs, and shut their red eyes. So they look almost completely green, and are well hidden amongst the leaves. The large red eyes are a defensive adaptation called deimatic behaviour. When a red-eyed tree frog detects a predator, it abruptly opens its eyes and stares at the predator. The sudden appearance of the red eyes may startle the predator, giving the frog a chance to flee."
They are active at night. They like to eat small insects.
"During mating, the female carries the male on her back for several hours during the process. The female chooses a leaf above a pond or large puddle on which to lay her clutch of eggs. The male puts out his sperm onto the eggs as they are released."
Tree frogs lay jelly-like eggs. The mothers will stay near them and help them fight any hungry animals that want to eat them. They become a tadpole in one or two weeks. They drop from the leaf and into the lake which is below the leaf.
"If predators are close enough to produce vibration, the embryos sense this. After a few seconds, they vigorously hatch out into tadpoles and spread out to escape."

"Collectivists believe that one person is not as important as a group of many people. They often believe people should compromise to make things better for each other instead of just themselves. They also think that letting someone do whatever they want is not good if it hurts lots of other people. Collectivism has many different types. It can mean serving your community, your government, your social class, your race, or some other group."

Skin cancer
"Skin cancer is the term that is used for all bad forms of growth of the skin. In everyday use, people often talk about melanoma, but there are other forms of skin cancer, too.

Very often a tumor can be seen, so it is often possible to detect skin cancer at an early stage. Very few people with skin cancer will die of the disease., though it can be disfiguring. Melanoma survival rates are poorer than for non-melanoma skin cancer, although when melanoma is diagnosed at an early stage, treatment is easier and more people survive."
"Skin cancer is the most commonly diagnosed type of cancer. Melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers combined are more common than lung, breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer. Melanoma is less common than both basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, but it is the most serious — for example, in the UK there were over 11,700 new cases of melanoma in 2008, and over 2,000 deaths. It is the second most common cancer in young adults aged 15–34 in the UK. Most cases are caused by over-exposure to UV rays from the sun or sunbeds."
"Non-melanoma skin cancers are the most common skin cancers. The majority of these are basal cell carcinomas. These are usually small spot growths caused by too much exposure to the sun over time. They do not usually spread, and rarely kill."

"Most adult frogs are 45 to 65 mm long from nose to rear end, but some of them can be more than 75 mm long."
The skin on the frog's back is green toward the head and front. It is brown toward the rear end. It can have three or four brown lines. The frog's belly is white.
This frog eats insects and smaller frogs.
This frog mates after rain or other wet weather. The male frogs hide next to plants near the top of the water and sing for females. The females lay eggs that look like green froth on the top of the water.
"If the mother frog lays eggs in a temporary body of water (the kind that dries up), the tadpoles turn into frogs quickly. If the mother frog lays eggs in a permanent body of water, the tadpoles stay tadpoles for a long time. These tadpoles grow to huge sizes."
"The tadpoles of this frog can grow to be 22.0 cm long, much larger than the adult frogs. This is one of the largest tadpoles of any frog in the world. It is smaller when it is an adult than when it is a tadpole."

"The LM was the last of the Apollo “hardware” to be developed. Its start had been delayed while NASA made up its mind to take the lunar-orbit meeting approach and thus require a vehicle like the LM for a landing. A contract with the prime builder was signed on January, 1963, almost two years after the Apollo project began. The LM was tested several times in space. Finally, on July 20, 1969 the Apollo 11 LM Eagle made the first manned lunar landing."

"To land on the moon, the descent engine would be fired to begin the LM’s drop from out in lunar orbit down toward the moon. LM could descend vertically and hover above the surface of moon. After the two men finished their stay on the surface, the ascent stage, sitting on the descent stage, would use its ascent engine firing to lift itself off the moon."
"The original name of the city was Yadanabon (, ). This name came from the Pali word ""Ratanapūra"" (). ""Ratanapūra"" means ""City of Gems."" The city also had another name: Lay Kyun Aung Myei (, ). This means ""Victorious Land over the Four Islands."""
History.
Early history.
Mandalay was started by King Mindon. He started the city on 13 February 1857. He built Mandalay as the new capital city of the Kingdom of Burma.
Mindon's city was in size. There were rivers on each side. It had 144 square blocks in a grid. In the middle was a palace that was 16 square blocks in size.
The palace had four walls that were each long. Around the walls was a moat that was wide and deep. Each wall had turrets (towers) for watchmen. These turrets were placed every . Each turret had a spire made of gold. Each side had three gates and five bridges across the moat.
"The king also built some other buildings in the city. These buildings were the Kuthodaw Pagoda, the ""Pahtan-haw Shwe Thein"" upasampada hall, the ""Thudamma"" ""Good Dharma"" zayats (), and a library for the Pāli Canon. A ""zayat"" is a building where Buddhism is taught."
"In June 1857, the king moved the royal palace to Mandalay. The palace had been in Amarapura. The building was taken apart. Each piece was moved by elephants to Mandalay. The palace was put back together and finished on 23 May 1859. The palace is now at the bottom of Mandalay Hill."
"Mandalay was the capital for 26 years. It was the last royal capital of the Konbaung Dynasty. (The Konbaung Dynasty were the last rulers of the Kingdom of Burma before it was taken over by the British Empire.) On 28 November 1885, the British conquered Burma. This ended the Third Anglo-Burmese War. King Thibaw Min and Queen Supayalat were sent into exile."
Mandalay in British Burma (1885-1948).
Mandalay was still an important city in British Burma. The city of Rangoon became the capital of Burma.
"The British wanted to make Mandalay an important commercial city. They did not want it to be important for politics, education, or other reasons. Mandalay was connected to Yangon by railroad in 1889. The first college in Mandalay wasn't built until 1925."
The royal palace was looted by the British. All of the treasures were stolen. Some treasures can be seen in the Victoria and Albert Museum. The British changed the name of the palace to Fort Dufferin. British soldiers used the palace as a barracks (a place to camp.)
"Mandalay was the most important city for Burmese culture during the time the British were in charge. It was also the most important place for Buddhist learning. The Burmese people saw Mandalay as a symbol. Between World War I and World War II, there were many protests in Mandalay against the British."
"During the time the British were in charge, many people moved to Mandalay from India. (India was also a British colony.) From 1904 to 1905, a plague happened. About one third of the people of Mandalay left to get away from the disease."
"During World War II, Mandalay was bombed by the Japanese. The British moved all of their airplanes to India. Mandalay had no defenses against the Japanese air raids. On 3 April 1942, the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service bombed the city. Three-fifths (3/5) of the houses were destroyed. More than 2,000 civilians (people who are not military) were killed."
The Japanese soon invaded Burma. The Imperial Japanese Army took over the city of Mandalay. They were in charge from May 1942 until March 1945. The palace citadel was made into a supply depot. (A supply depot is a building that stores supplies like food and machines.)
The Allied forces bombed the city after the Japanese took it over. Much of the palace was destroyed. Only the royal mint and watch tower were not destroyed. The palace was rebuild in the 1990s.
Mandalay today (1948 - now).
"In 1948, the British left Burma. Mandalay was still the most important city for culture, education, and commerce in Upper Burma."
"Until the 1990s, most students went to university in Mandalay. Until 1991, there were only three universities in Upper Burma: Mandalay University, The University of Medicine, Mandalay, and the Defense Services Academy. All of these universities are in Mandalay. Only some other cities had schools called ""Degree Colleges."" These were small schools that were part of Mandalay University. These colleges had classes in a small number of subjects."
"From 1962 to 1988, Ne Win was in charge of the government. He was very isolationist. This means that he did not want Myanmar to be part of global trade or tourism. In the 1980s, Mandalay was the second biggest city in Myanmar. It looked like a town with low buildings, dusty streets, and more bicycles than cars."
"During the 1980s, there were two big fires. In May 1981, a fire destroyed more than 6,000 buildings. 36,000 people were left homeless. On 24 March 1984, there was another fire. This fire destroyed 2,700 buildings. 23,000 more people were made homeless."
"Fires are still a big problem. In February 2008, there was another big fire in Mandalay. It destroyed the Yadanabon Market. This was the second-biggest market in the city. In February 2009, a fire destroyed 320 houses. More than 1,600 people were made homeless."
"The fires during the 1980s destroyed a lot of buildings. This made a lot of land empty. Many Chinese people in Burma bought this land. A lot of these people had come from Yunnan in China. Many Chinese people came to Upper Burma and Mandalay from Yunnan and Sichuan in the 1990s. 250,000 to 350,000 people from Yunnan came to Mandalay in the 1990s. Today, about 30% to 40% of the people of Mandalay are Chinese. The native Burmese people complain that Mandalay is now like a part of China."
"The Chinese have rebuilt the parts of the city that burned down. They built apartment buildings, hotels, and shopping centers. They helped make Mandalay again an important city for trade and commerce. It now connects trade for Upper Burma, Lower Burma, China, and India."
Mandalay has grown much bigger over time. It now includes what used to be Amarapura. (Amarapura was where King Mindon's capital city used to be before he moved it to Mandalay.) Mandalay celebrated its 150th birthday on 15 May 2009 at 4:31:36 am.

"The Twenty-Third United States Census, known as Census 2010 or 2010 Census was a count of the population of the United States. It was done by the Census Bureau. It found that the population of the United States on April 1, 2010 was 308,745,538. This was an increase of 9.7 percent over the 281,421,906 people counted during the 2000 Census.

Operational costs were $5.4 billion, under the $7 billion budget. In December 2010 the Government Accountability Office (GAO) noted that the cost of doing the census has doubled each decade since 1970. In a detailed 2004 report to Congress, the GAO asked the Census Bureau to fix cost and design problems. They estimated the 2010 Census cost to be $11 billion."
"In August 2010, Commerce Secretary Gary Locke said that the census operational costs were a lot less than what they thought it would be. Their budget was almost $7 billion, but they saved:"

There is now a caldera where before was the central cone."
"It erupted in June 15, 1991 and is located on the island of Luzon in the Phillipines. Many Lahars and pyroclastic flows damaged much of the infrastructure of the country. They also killed upwards of 800 people. Officials at the US marine base were able to evacuate many people, but property damage was costly, totaling billions of phillipine pesos."

Pollinator
"A pollinator is an animal that does pollination. Pollination is almost entirely done by insects, though there are some exceptions. Some birds (such as hummingbirds) pollinate flowers as they take nectar. Overall, however, it is insects that pollinate. Bees, of course, pollinate flowers as they take nectar. But wasps, ants, flies, beetles, butterflies and moths all have many species which are pollinators. The plant which offers the pollen is called the ""pollenizer""."
"To be a pollinator, an insect has to move pollen from the male anther to the female stigma of a flower. The pollinator gets away with much of the pollen for its own use."
"Although it is obvious that flowering plants are the plants which usually offer pollen, there is a pre-history of pollination in cycads."
"Bees may not be the most numerous insects which take up the pollen. Hoverflies (Syrphidae) are very numerous visitors to flowers, and they may be more numerous than bees in many environments."
"The list of pollinators is long. Bees, wasps, ants, flies, mosquitoes, lepidoptera and beetles all have some pollinators who take nectar, and also some vertebrates: bats, birds, monkeys, lemurs, possums, rodents."
"Wild pollinators often visit many plant species, and plants are visited by many pollinator species. All these relations together form a network of interactions between plants and pollinators. Surprising similarities exist in the networks of interactions between plants and pollinators. This structure is similar in very different ecosystems on different continents, consisting of entirely different species."
"There are a number of hotels, restaurants, bistro and cafes in town."
"The Heysen Trail and the Mawson Trail, two long distance trails for walking and cycling, pass through town and there are many bushwalks and 4wd tracks."

"but long as you didn't spin the tires too much or, or spend too much time with the secondaries kicked in it, it didn't do too bad on gas."
Yeah.
Didn't have to work too hard to move the car around.
"Now, do you think since they started with electronic ignition that it improves the way the car runs?"
"Oh, yeah,"
"yeah,"
definitely.
Uh-huh.
I don't know.
I don't remember.
"I, I read it."
And are we still going to maintain drams for perfume?
Yeah.
"And, and then, but then the medicine."
"And, and some of these other things"
"and, and the chemistry in those kinds of areas,"
milliliter.
It's all metric all ready.
Yeah.
"And, and so, um, but, but when you go to order a drink, um, you know. say, they, they, I don't know, it's uh ..."
And what will a shot be?
Will a shot be an ounce?
I don't know.
"And, and, but, you know, when you go to the store and, and you're trying to figure, you know, well this box is, is, uh, is, is twelve ounces"
"and, and this one's, uh, uh, three pounds, um,"
and you ...
"And the other one's two point one kis,"
"and, and you're, you're lost."
That's right.
"And, and I don't know."
"I, I think that, I, I think, I think the Federal government is going to, more or less, leave it alone."
"I think they've got, I think there are more pressing problems."
"Oh, yeah."
The economy.
Yes.
"Uh, what I was thinking about is an economical issue concerning it. Uh,"
a machinist has a huge number of dollars invested in tooling.
Personal tools to be able to do his job.
Yeah.
"But, but are, are the tools that, uh,"
I could be wrong.
"Uh, I do not know what, what it is percentage wise"
"but I,"
I do not know for sure either.
"But it always seems well, it just felt different like when we were in Texas."
It had a different feel to it.
Yeah.
"It is, it is drier in Dallas than it is in Houston or San Antonio or even Austin, which is further south."
Uh.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
But it is not dry.
"And, and I have lived here for many years,"
and I think it has gotten more humid over the years.
"Where the water is coming from, I don't know."
Uh-huh.
"Well, it could be."
"I know my brother's home has been flooded a couple of times, uh,"
"Oh, does he live near the lake?"
"Well, there is a lake not far"
"but it is more run off from surrounding, you know, areas and that."
Uh-huh.
Uh.
"And, uh, he is just in an area where it is just low enough that it's, you know, it, it collects there."
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, he has had a couple of inches in his house several times."
"That is, that is a problem, uh,"
"they tell you when you are looking for a house or, or, or buying land to build on, to be very careful and check the drainage because, uh, it is, it is deceptive."
Uh-huh.
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
Because of that.
and they have nothing to gain one way or the other.
"So if they say a certain way, then why not believe them."
Right.
"And I don't know all the details on that,"
"but I certainly think that we've come up with a good idea with the, the the students coming into the jury."
Yeah.
And I don't think that it would be such a bad idea even if the judge didn't have the final say.
Uh-huh.
Do you have any?
"Yes,"
we do have a pet.
"We have a, a dog that we got from the, uh,"
"well, we call it the S P C A."
"It's the, uh, from an animal shelter."
Uh-huh.
"Uh, he'd come in there as a stray."
All right.
"Uh, he's a Pomeranian and Sheltie cross."
Yeah.
"Uh, well, he was very well trained when we got him."
"Uh, he's,"
"Oh, that's good."
"You don't often find that,"
I don't think.
"No, uh,"
"we suspect that he was hurt in an accident, you know, got away from somebody traveling through, and hurt in an accident because a dog that looks as good as he does and is trained as well is someone that has lost him and not have been able to locate him."
Right.
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, if they were local people, they would have been able to find him."
Sure.
"There's a,"
"okay, uh,"
I know.
Sometimes it's better just to tape record both of them and then watch it all in one.
Uh-huh.
"We, we do that sometimes."
"I, I guess I'm, I'm not into real heavy stuff."
L A LAW is about the heaviest thing I watch.
"I, I'll, mostly I'm into it for relaxation,"
Yeah.
so I like things like GOLDEN GIRLS or CHEERS
"or, uh, Monday night is real good with me, you know, MAJOR DAD and, and, uh, NORTHERN EXPOSURE and, and, uh,"
"oh, what's that one with Burt Reynolds?"
"That type of show is what we what, uh, we watch."
Uh-huh.
"We generally just stay on one channel all, for all of Monday night, just to watch those."
"Just some of the times they're continued,"
but mostly they're just little vignettes.
A new one we found we really like is that DINOSAURS.
Have you seen that?
Huh-uh.
"That is, it's, it's really funny."
"They use like animated,"
"it's not like a cartoon,"
"but it's like dummies and things, that are used,"
Uh-huh.
"and, uh, it's really, um,"
and robots probably.
"But there's always a, a moral to each story."
And what night is it on?
"Well, we watched it,"
"the times we've seen it, it's been like on or, excuse me, Friday night."
"Uh, but it's,"
we've only seen it a couple of times.
"Huh. So you have a M F A in, in what division of art?"
"but,"
"Well, I, I actually have a Masters of art"
and it's in art education.
"Oh, okay."
"So, I'm a licensed teacher"
"but jobs being what they are, I substitute teach"
Yeah.
and that way I have time for my kids too.
And I've been fortunate that I can afford to work part-time.
I don't know how long that's going to last
"Oh, yeah."
"And, uh, they're cutting back,"
so I don't go in all that often
"but I've been real interested in some of those cute country, country kind of things."
"Uh, I see stuff in craft galleries for five hundred dollars"
"and I say, oh no"
"and , and I go"
and I make it.
Yeah.
That's how I started jewelry making.
"I, I love to cook."
"Oh, that's great."
"And I saw a silver necklace that had these little teeny weeny silver spatulas and, and, and knife and, and a fork and all kinds of stuff"
and I went
"and I signed up for class because then again, you get, you know, get someone to guide you"
and you get the tools you don't feel like buying.
Exactly.
And I made a necklace that I saw in a gallery for three hundred twenty dollars
It took me a lot of time
"but  it didn't,"
"Oh, yeah."
more because of their personalities than their sportsman
Uh-huh.
Well part of it was the personality and their sportsmanship.
Another part of it was I'd pick one out that was different than what my husband was rooting for
"so you know, the competitor,"
and I became involved in following his career.
Right
"And, uh, I know that, that my husband,"
Tom Kite was his fair haired boy.
Oh.
And he thought he was spectacular.
"I said, Whoa."
"I'm not going to, I'm not going to stay interested in him."
So I decided Andy Bean was good competition
Uh-huh.
"Any time they both played, why, he was just real excited when Tom was, you know, shown on the television,"
and I followed Andy Bean.
Uh-huh
We both followed Lee Trevino into the Seniors.
"Oh, he's interesting."
He is.
I like to watch him.
"He is a character not just a golfer,"
Yeah.
but he's quite a character.
Yeah.
"And there are some really, really wonderful people in the game of golf who do give wonderful role models."
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
I think you're right.
"And I think it's critical, it's critical to have a good role model in any field, any sports."
Yeah.
"but for her to actually get in there and do it herself it was, uh, it was something, a little different."
"It's a good experience,"
"it helps you feel, I think comfortable with your car and feel like, it's not so, scary if, um, your driving it and you might get stranded somewhere that you might, you think, well, I've, I've been under that hood"
and I know what's going on
"but,"
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
"I think it's important that everyone know, you know, basically how, how the darn engine works,"
Uh-huh.
"it helps you figure out what's wrong with it, you know,"
Uh-huh.
"I've, I've been out with my sister before when, you know, her car died on the highway"
"and I happened to be with her and managed to get her to the other side of the road because it was dark and all,"
Women?
"Yeah,"
"the changing roles of women, how roles changed"
and what do you see coming in the future.
"Oh, okay,"
that's not a broad enough topic
"Okay,"
yeah.
Sounds good.
I'm ready when you are.
"Okay,"
hold on.
Okay.
Are you there?
"Yeah,"
I'm here.
"Oh my goodness,"
I can't believe I did that.
"Okay,"
because she can't wear like my pants
Uh-huh.
but she'll take all my shirts and my blouses and stuff.
Ooh.
"Man, I'm just glad she can't wear my pants or my skirts or my dresses, you know."
"Oh, yeah."
"But still, she'll just take them,"
"and she won't even think about it,"
"and then, I'll like see her that day,"
"and she'll be wearing my clothes,"
"and I'll be like, you know, I don't like to borrow my clothes out, you know,"
I really don't.
So I prefer that you just not go in and get them
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
because she doesn't even ask me.
Stuff like that really
"like that's an invasion of my privacy, I feel like."
"Oh, yeah,"
I agree.
"Stuff like that,"
"when you have your door closed, people just walking in and stuff like that."
Uh-huh.
I was thinking like my mom.
"I know this,"
"she would think this is like an invasion of her privacy, is like going through her purse, like if you ever needed money and stuff"
"Oh, yeah."
"we always just give her her purse, you know,"
and she'll get it out or whatever.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
"I was trying to think,"
"and, uh, course this,"
"grant it,"
"that's, you know, it's been four years ago,"
"but it's remarkable that the, that the bigger vans, uh, they're, uh,"
"my boss just bought a, a pick up truck,"
"and, uh, he only gets seventeen miles a gallon."
Yeah.
"But it, it has a big engine,"
"and it, it, pulls a boat and stuff,"
"but it's, and it, it's got the seats"
"that, and the other thing that is interesting, is it has, uh, rear air conditioning."
Uh-huh.
"And that, that makes a lot of difference in those of us that live in warm climates."
Yeah.
"Well, now, this one that we went in,"
it did
to baby what kind of van was that that we went to Florida in?
Ford.
A what?
Ford.
A Ford?
"Ford what,"
you remember?
"conversation with He was trying to think of what the name of it was,"
"Well, the big, you know, the big vans are all, real nice,"
this was a big one.
"I mean it was a big one,"
"yeah,"
oh those are
"it has the front and the back and you know, it has the uh, back seat let down into a double, I mean a queen size bed"
yeah.
Yeah.
Our local schools have adult education in the evening
Oh.
"uh, and I use their tools and, some of their guidance."
I'm an artist.
"Oh, okay."
And I'm very handy
"and, you know, if I touch it, it turns into something <laughter> us-, usually."
That's great.
"What, what type of art do you focus on?"
I have a Master's degree
"and, and my projects had to do with acrylic painting,"
but I'm really interested in the crafts.
Huh.
I make stain glass.
I've done some silver jewelry making
"and I kind of,"
"once I get you know, really pretty good at something, I want to try something else"
Yeah.
"Kind of jack of all trades, master of none."
"Yeah,"
"well no,"
"actually, I get good enough to sell it or have people say oh wow,"
"you didn't buy it,"
you made it.
That's great!
"And then I, it's like well the thrill is gone"
so let's do something else.
Right.
"You want to, uh, explore a new field"
"or, or,"
"Well, yeah,"
"I, I'm signed up for a class in pottery making because I've never tried that yet"
"Now they've gotten larger and larger as, as they have developed the land."
"And, of course, it's pretty static right now"
and all the values over here have dropped off because of the economy.
"Uh-huh,"
yeah.
How about you?
"Well, I am, uh, I'm, gosh, I'm barely in Dallas."
I'm just north of Addison Airport up on the tollway.
Okay.
Okay.
"And, I guess we have a similar situation."
"I mean, we've got houses two streets away that are probably around seventy, eighty thousand"
Uh-huh.
and then we've got Bent Tree right across the street
"so I don't I don't even know how high those go,"
Okay.
but some of those are pretty big.
"Yes,"
those are over a million.
Yeah
"So, it's, that's the strange thing about, I guess, Dallas because back where I'm from, you wouldn't have that sort of a variation at all."
"They'd all be pretty similar to one another within a, a couple miles."
"So,"
"Well, we have suffered from real lack of land use planning in Dallas."
Yeah.
"Not as bad as Houston,"
"but, exactly what you're describing is what happens all over."
"Uh-huh,"
"yeah,"
I've noticed that.
"Well, now, do you live in a, a home, or zero lot home,"
Uh-huh.
"Which was, uh,"
"I, I find that fascinating that, uh,"
"Yeah,"
"I do, too."
Do you ever listen to the radio
"or any,"
"I listen to K R L D, and, uh, uh, K L I F, the news talk radio."
Uh-huh.
And I actually listen to C N N radio.
Do you know it was on radio now?
"No,"
I don't.
It's on eleven ninety.
"Um. I really, uh, have gotten out of the habit of listening to the radio from any kind of, even music"
"and, uh,"
"Well, when I go to work I listen."
"Yeah,"
my husband does
"and it's how come he usually calls me sometimes, and says, oh, I just heard on the news that such and such happened, you know, if it's something really interesting"
"and and then I'll know to, to keep an eye out for it,"
Yeah.
but I've got out of the habit of listening to the radio.
"Well, with, with your, you know,"
"if you're around the home, though and, and, and can watch T V and read the paper, the problem is, is that about twenty minutes of news radio, or thirty minutes is"
and then they start repeating everything.
Uh-huh.
"And, and so it's kind of a, oh,"
"that's what's interesting is the C N N, uh,"
"I don't think, I'm trying to think if it's much local."
I listen to a little of that
and I listen to a little of ninety point one.
"I, I'm, I'm inveterate switcher."
Right.
"What, uh what do you feel are important to you or other people as, as crucial benefits?"
Uh-huh.
"Well, I'm a little different than other people because I don't have benefits with my job."
Uh-huh.
I'm a nurse
"and I work,"
Oh
I float so that I have no benefits except higher pay for doing that.
Uh-huh.
Right.
Uh-huh.
So I find that it makes up for what I pay for insurance
"and I, I make enough money by the hour to make up for that."
"To, to compensate for some of the benefits."
Right.
Uh-huh.
Oh.
"Yeah,"
it's cheaper for me to buy insurance by the month than to work staff someplace.
Yes.
And then I have my freedom.
I can work seven days in a row and take a week off or whatever I want to do.
"Well, that, that's an excellent,"
"so actually that is a benefit, uh,"
"Well, it is to me."
"Most people prefer the security of nine to five, and weekends off and knowing that their insurance is paid and their retirement,"
Yeah.
and I'm just really not interested in all that.
Right.
"Right,"
"well I guess that's a good point, uh,"
Yes.
it is a mental thing.
It is a conversion thing.
"It's like a mill, you know."
"We, we do, uh, um, well we use a one mill bond wire or one point five mill bond wire on on semiconductor devices."
Right.
"And well, what's a mill"
and ...
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"But what really annoys me is the way we, in the United States, have been converting to metric."
We have a eighty-nine Chevy Blazer.
"And before that we had a Horizon. Uh, you know, Plymouth Horizon?"
Yeah.
And both of them were a mismatch of both American and metric.
"Don't you find that interesting? Uh, that they, that that they're doing that, uh, in any field,"
"for why, why, why pieces,"
"could you, could you get any connection on which was metric and which wasn't."
"Uh, okay."
The engine itself was mostly metric because it came from Canada.
"Oh, okay."
"And the starter was Bosch American,"
so.
"The bolts were, were were, were English then."
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"It was, it was annoying."
"One, one half of the starter you know, three bolts on the starter"
and two of them were American
and one of them was metric.
Now that's strange.
"And, uh, you go from the, uh, water pump up to the radiator"
"Got three bedrooms, one bath and that just makes me scream."
That's pretty tough
What area do you live in?
I live in Houston.
"Oh, okay."
I see.
Is that pretty typical for your area?
"Well, for the neighborhood I'm in,"
"yeah,"
Yeah.
"This is one of the more established neighborhoods,"
Huh-uh.
That sounds real interesting.
I live in a suburb of Dallas
"and, uh, I live in the basic three bedroom, two bath home."
"So, at least, I have two bathrooms."
"That's not so bad,"
"but, uh, it's pretty typical for the area, as well."
"Uh, I've always been interested in older homes, personally."
"So, I think you can end up doing more with them, it seems like."
What about yard space?
"Do you have lot of, a big lot, or anything like that?"
The whole lot I'm sitting on is roughly half an acre.
"Oh, I see."
"About half of that, about a quarter acre of that, I've got a garden."
Huh-uh.
"Oh, that's nice."
"Because I have just like a very small, you know, those basic tract houses, like that."
We have a very small yard
"and, um, I do have garden,"
"but it's extremely small,"
"but, uh, it seems like, though, for your area that, that is sort of different."
"I mean, it's, it's,"
"and so I'm going, I'm so old"
"and I'm, I, I really have to always tell myself, no, you're not, you're very young."
"No,"
"you're extremely,"
"yeah,"
"it's, it's"
"And, you know, so it's,"
"Well it's like us, we're getting ready to do, if possible, for an adoption"
"and I have friends that say well why would you do that,  if you know you haven't been able to children, which we do know, why would you do that now, at this part, point,"
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"and, um, it's just individual choices."
Yeah.
"I stopped comparing myself a long time ago to somebody who had, um,"
"in my family my brother's children,"
Uh-huh.
"I mean, he just turned forty,"
his children will be out of high school before he's forty-five.
Wow.
"Um, I mean that's like your mother,"
"look how young she is,  compared to where you are out of school and everything."
"Uh-huh,"
yeah.
Right.
"It's just, it,"
"but what you find is you don't compare the woman, because you just get into trouble."
It's all independent and choices.
"Uh-huh,"
"yeah,"
very true.
"Um, but what I was going to say about mothers is, uh, your mother probably just won't say it,"
"yeah,"
"lot of people don't, don't see the excitement in sailing,"
"but, then, again, they may they may never have tried anything like, uh, catamaran"
Uh-huh.
"and, uh, that's when you really start getting into speed. You know,"
"you actually, some catamarans you can actually pull people behind, the skiers,"
"they get so fast, you know."
I didn't know that.
"Yeah,"
"they get pretty quick,"
but
That that would be something.
"uh,"
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
"I haven't, I haven't personally done that,"
"but, uh, the races,"
"I, I work with a guy right now that, uh, races catamarans in the summertime"
Uh-huh.
"and, uh, he's pretty gassed about it."
"He's got a good, uh,"
"What kind of, what lake do you all use?"
"Well, he, uh, he's from Detroit"
Uh-huh.
"so he usually goes on one of the Great Lakes, I think, and does his sailing. Uh,"
"for me, I, I go back to Orlando, uh, in about a month, and so, down there, basically just go to the coast."
"We're about thirty miles from Coco Beach and the east coast,"
"and there's a lot of places there you can go, you know."
"So, uh, so that's a good thing."
Yeah.
"But, yeah, so, what do you do for a job?"
"Uh, I build transformers."
I've caught it a few times
"and they, they do some pretty good news."
"Uh, seemingly unbiased news broadcasts."
"Uh uh, the, the title of the network is sort of surprising."
Uh-huh.
You'd think it would carry mostly religious
"but it, it doesn't seem to."
"So I'll flip through and listen to it once in awhile too, uh, and catch something maybe a little different than, than C N N might be covering."
"Uh, some more interest type topics in, in other countries."
"But it's kind of world, world, uh, network too."
Yeah.
"Uh, I, I guess I've never seen the T V show."
"I used to get the, uh,"
"A, uh, Golden Retriever."
"Ooh, that's one of my favorite kinds of dogs."
Yeah.
Is it really?
How long have you had it?
"We've had him for,"
"let's see, he just had his fourth birthday."
Fourth birthday.
"Yeah,"
and we got him when he was about eight weeks old
"and, uh, he's pretty okay,"
we like him.
Does he shed a lot?
He does.
That's the one thing we don't like about him.
"In fact, we threaten him in the summertime that we might just shave all of his hair off."
He'd probably look pretty funny if we did that.
How much does he weigh now?
"He, actually, he just went to the vet yesterday to get his shots and everything,"
At Carnegie Hall is the second album by The Weavers. The concert was recorded live at Carnegie Hall in New York City on Christmas Eve 1955. At the time the concert was a comeback for the group following the inclusion of the group on the entertainment industry blacklist. The album peaked at number 24 on the Billboard Top 200.
"This album represents the first half of that landmark Carnegie Hall concert. A recording of the concert's second half was also released as an album, entitled ""The Weavers on Tour"" (1970)."

"The Aven is a natural watercourse on the south coast of Brittany, France (Atlas, 2007). Its source is near Coray. It flows in a generally southerly direction through Rosporden and Pont-Aven before discharging into the Atlantic Ocean at the seaside resort Port Manec'h, part of Névez. Paul Gauguin spent some of his life living in the town of Pont-Aven, where he enjoyed painting scenes by the river Aven. The waters of the river are rather rapidly flowing and are tidal up until the town of Pont-Aven. The water quality has been tested as slightly alkaline with a pH of 8.50 (at a location in Pont-Aven) where Gauguin was known to have painted his noted ""Lavenders"" (Lumina Tech, 2006). Summer water temperature has tested at 17.5 degrees Celsius and electrical conductivity of the river tested to be .19 micro-siemens per centimetre. The waters are relatively clear with Secchi disc tests at Pont-Aven yielding a measurement of 65 centimetres."

"The Banahaw Broadcasting Corporation (often shortened to BBC) was a Philippine television network that began operations on November 4, 1973 and ceased transmission on March 20, 1986."
"DWWX-TV (formerly DZAQ-TV) station owned by ABS-CBN was shut down following the declaration of Martial Law in 1972, and served as the flagship station of BBC. Roberto Benedicto, a crony of then-President Ferdinand Marcos and owner of the Kanlaon Broadcasting System, took over the ABS-CBN Broadcasting Center complex on Bohol (now Sergeant Esguerra) Avenue in Quezon City after the KBS Studios along Roxas Boulevard in Pasay City (which were ironically sold to them by ABS-CBN in 1969) were destroyed by fire on June 6, 1973, a few months before BBC went on air. The new network was named the ""Banahaw Broadcasting Corporation"" after Mount Banahaw, a dormant volcano located in southern Luzon known for its hot springs and mystical associations."
"In July 1978, BBC, RPN and another Benedicto-owned network, the Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation (IBC) (which originally aired from San Juan del Monte), transferred to the Broadcast City compound in Old Balara, Quezon City, with the transmitter located along Panay Avenue, Quezon City (now being used by ABS-CBN), with the then newly upgraded 35 kW transmitter for better broadcast reception. This left Channel 4 (a frequency formerly owned by ABS-CBN and taken over by the government through National Media Production Center (NMPC) as Government Television in 1974) at the ABS-CBN Broadcast Center complex, then renamed MBS Broadcast Plaza (MBS being Maharlika Broadcasting System, the name that Channel 4 acquired in 1980)."
"By December 1973, the network also operated DYCB-TV 3 in Cebu and DYXL-TV 4 in Bacolod, both of which were also originally owned by ABS-CBN. Their call signs were also changed to DYCW-TV and DYBW-TV, respectively. The Cebu and Bacolod stations switched affiliations to GTV (Government Television; later the Maharlika Broadcasting System) in 1978 and reverted to their former call letters."
"BBC-2 was rebranded as City 2 Television from 1980 until 1984. In 1984, it was rebranded again back as BBC-2 (not to be confused with the British television channel). BBC ended operations on March 20, 1986 after People Power Revolution along with RPN and IBC (temporarily), after reformist soldiers disabled the transmitter that was broadcasting Marcos' inauguration from Malacañang Palace. Upon Corazón C.

Relay Graduate School of Education is a private graduate school for teachers in New York City and other cities across the nation. It was established in 2011 after being spun off from Hunter College's Teacher U program. It is the first stand-alone graduate school of education to open in New York since Bank Street College of Education was founded in 1916.
"The New York Board of Regents approved the school unanimously with one abstention. Alternative certification programs such as Teach for America and the New York City Teaching Fellows utilize existing colleges for required coursework, while Relay GSE provides its own course program. Teacher U CEO Norman Atkins was chosen as the graduate school's president."
"Teacher U was founded by three charter school networks ""with impressive student achievement records"": KIPP, Achievement First, and Uncommon Schools. The school will serve charter school and district teachers. There was opposition to the school's establishment from some of New York's existing universities that offer teacher education programs."
"On September 7, 2013, Relay GSE held the commencement ceremony for its first graduating class of students on Pier 60 at Chelsea Piers in New York City."
"The school has since expanded nationwide, with additional campuses in Baton Rouge, Chicago, Connecticut, Delaware, Denver, Houston, Memphis, Nashville, New Orleans, Newark, Philadelphia, Camden, and San Antonio."

"Hovey appointed a committee of trustees to administer the fund, headed by abolitionist Wendell Phillips. Hovey specified that the funds should be spent at the rate of $8,000 per year to meet immediate needs."
The fund paid Susan B. Anthony's salary ($12 per week) while she coordinated the Women's Loyal National League's massive petition drive asking Congress to approve an amendment that would abolish slavery.
"With 400,000 signatures, it was the largest petition drive in the nation's history up to that time, gathering signatures from approximately one out every twenty-four adults in the Northern states and significantly contributing to the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution."

= = = Cyclone Miller = = =
"Joseph H. ""Cyclone"" Miller (September 24, 1859 – October 13, 1916) was an American pitcher in Major League Baseball born in Springfield, Massachusetts. He played just two seasons in the majors, but did play with four teams in three leagues. He stood at 5'9""."
"Miller's major league career began in 1884 for the Chicago Browns/Pittsburgh Stogies of the Union Association. He lasted just one start, in which he threw a complete game victory, allowing only two runs. He then moved on to the Providence Grays, filling in the rotation due to injuries to their top pitchers, Charles Radbourn and Charlie Sweeney. Even though he did pitch well for long stretches during the games, he struggled to secure the victories in the late innings and had to be replaced. On July 31, 1884, in a road game versus the New York Gothams, he was appointed umpire due to the scheduled umpire calling in sick. The New York fans thought his calls were decidedly one-sided toward his Grays team, and he had to have a police escort off the field after the game. The game ended in a 3-3 tie."
"On one occasion, with Miller playing right field, the manager had wanted Sweeney to switch from pitcher to right field to bring in Miller to pitch in the 9th inning. Sweeney refused the move and walked off the field, and because of the rules during that time, Miller had to pitch the game with only two outfielders. He went on to lose the game, and Sweeney was suspended for a game to violating the manager's order. Instead of serving the suspension, Sweeney quit the team and joined the St. Louis Maroons of Union Association, leaving Radbourn to shoulder the team's pitching duties for the rest of the season. It was that season that Radbourn set his all-time record for wins with 60, which under today's rules would have only been 59 because in one game, he relieved Miller with Providence having the lead after five innings. On September 13, when the team departing on a lengthy road trip, they decided not to bring Miller along with them, thus ending his short tenure with the team. He compiled a 3–2 record with them in five starts and one relief appearance that resulted in a late-inning loss."
"He is also on record as having pitched one game for the Philadelphia Quakers during the 1884 season. In that game, he pitched a complete game loss, giving up 19 runs, 10 of them earned."
"Miller spent 1885 in the minor leagues. He started 1886 with Macon of the Southern Association but finished it with the Philadelphia Athletics of the American Association. He went 10-8 that season, completing all of his starts and throwing one shutout. On August 20, he threw a one-hitter, giving up his one hit in the ninth inning and losing 1-0 to the Baltimore Orioles, and their young fireballer Matt Kilroy. During this season, he played one game at third base, becoming one of only 36 left-handed players to have played at least one game at that position."
"Miller died at the age of 57 in New London, Connecticut, and was interred at Comstock Cemetery in Montville, Connecticut."

= = = Der Philosophische Arzt = = =
"Der Philosophische Arzt is a medical publication published in the late 18th century by Melchior Adam Weikard, a prominent German physician and philosopher to the Russian Empress, Catherine II."
"The first edition of ""Der Philosophische Arzt"" was first published in 1775, but perhaps as early as 1770. It was initially published anonymously as was the second edition, though it was widely believed that Weikard was the author. The reason for doing so is unclear but was probably due to anticipated critical reactions to its publication from several sources. A principal one was the Prince-Bishop of Fulda, to whom Weikard served as physician and in a Catholic region where Weikard worked as a spa doctor being supported by the state. According to Otto Schmitt's biography of Weikard published in 1970, the reaction of organized religion to the publication of his textbook was widespread condemnation. This was likely due to his attacks in the textbook on various religious practices for curing medical illnesses. According to Schmidt, the attacks against Weikard continued throughout his career but his patron, Prince Heinrich von Bibra, maintained an amicable relationship with him and supported him financially late in his career despite many people who criticized the Prince for doing so."

In the fall of 1941, German forces evicted the residents of the village to make room for the planned resettlement of Gottschee Germans.

= = = Sesame Street (comic strip) = = =
"Sesame Street is a nationally syndicated comic strip inspired by ""Sesame Street"". Written and drawn by veteran Sesame animator Cliff Roberts, the earliest concept art was created in 1970, and by 1971, a promotional booklet was created as the comic entered the market, courtesy of King Features. The strip debuted on November 15, 1971, in more than 175 newspapers, and ran until 1975. The strip, which ran both daily and on Sundays, was conceptually similar to the series in its pedagogical goals, but, in the first year of the strip, conspicuous by the absence of the Muppets."
"Instead, the strip featured several new characters created by Roberts, such as Jasper and Julius, Christopher Clumsy, and Miss Fortune; in 1972, all of these characters appeared in animated inserts on ""Sesame Street"" itself. Also regularly seen was Professor Drummond Bugle, a lecturer, similar to more generic characters used in Roberts' animated segments. Roberts fleshed out the strip's cast with a vast menagerie of newly minted animal characters. Amongst them were Lotta Elephant, Richard Bird, Hedda the frog, Balderdash the mouse, Titus the snake, Thomas Turtle, Crawley the worm, and an errant spider. A pair of nameless, Muppet-esque monsters also skulked through on occasion."
"Though the earlier version of the strip avoided the Muppets, Big Bird, Oscar the Grouch and Cookie Monster joined the cast in December 1972, and appeared through the end of the strip's run in 1975."
"Like ""Sesame Street"", the comic strip was largely educational, using broad humor to relate learning concepts. The most frequent topics were parts of the body, shapes, and identification of objects. Other subjects included opposites or pairings (up and down, here and there, etc.) and emotions. Letters and numbers surfaced rarely, presumably because the strip's target audience was different from the largely pre-literate television audience. However, many strips were pure comedy, revolving around the characters' eccentricities and foibles."

"Marguerite Bellanger (10 June 1838 - 23 November 1886) was a French stage actress and courtesan. She was a celebrity of Second Empire France and known for her relationship with Napoleon III of France. She was often caricatured in contemporary press and is considered to be the model for Émile Zola's ""Nana"". A candy is also named after her. She was reputedly the most universally loathed of Napoleon III's mistresses, though perhaps his favorite. She outlived Napoleon's deposal in 1870 and died in 1886 aged 48."
"Marguerite Bellanger was born Julie Justine Marine Lebœuf on 10 June 1838 in Saint-Lambert-des-Levées, Maine-et-Loire to François Lebœuf and Julie Hanot. Born into poverty, she began working as a laundress in Saumur at the age of 15."
"After an affair with a lieutenant opened her eyes to the wider world, she became an acrobat and trick rider in a provincial circus, she travelled to Paris where she made her debut as an actress at the theater ""La Tour d'Auvergne"", under the name of Marguerite Bellanger (the surname of an uncle)."
"Although her acting talent was limited, she was cunning. She became one of the most sought-after cocottes of all Paris. She led a princely lifestyle, and the climax of her gallant life took place in the years 1862-1866. She is reported to have said: ""It is very nice Paris, but it is only habitable in the beautiful districts ... In the others, there are too many poor!"" according to ""Le Rappel"" of 16 April 1871. Author and playwright, Ludovic Halévy, is reputed to have said that Bellanger had the ""daintiest feet in Paris""."
Her celebrity status was such that she became a figure in the literary and artistic world. Zola quoted her as a friend of Nana.
"In 1947, he returned to Italy and a year later published his memoirs as ""Due dittatori di fronte"" (""[Two] Dictators Face to Face"" – i.e.: Mussolini and Hitler). Much details about the hierarchy and events of the war, not well known, are in the book."

"Gaustatoppen is the highest mountain in the county Telemark in Norway which lies in the municipality Tinn and Hjartdal. The view from the summit is impressive, as one can see an area of approximately 60,000 km², one sixth of Norway's mainland. The mountain is popular for downhill skiing in winter, and competitions have been held on its slopes. These competitions include the ""Norseman triathlon"", billed as ""the world's most brutal iron-distance triathlon"". It starts in Eidfjord and finishes at the top of Gaustatoppen. The summit is accessible on foot in the summer, on a rocky pathway of medium difficulty, although the southern side of the mountain is very dangerous and inaccessible. The wreckage of an airplane crash lies there, as it is too difficult to remove it."
"The first element is ""Gausta"", the name of the whole mountain, the last element is the finite form of ""topp"" m 'top, summit'. The name ""Gausta"" is probably a shortened form for ""*Gaustafjell"" (Gausta mountain), because Gausta originally was the name of a farm beneath the mountain. (For the same development see Dovre.) The Old Norse form of the name was maybe ""*Gautstǫð"", the name is then a compound of ""gaut"" f 'flooded place', and ""stǫð"" f 'stead, landing place for boat'. (The farm lies at Rjukan river.)"
"There is a funicular railway inside the mountain, built for military purposes. This ascends from the base of the mountain almost to the summit. A short railway takes the passengers from the mountain base horizontally to the lower station deep inside the mountain. It was built to access the military radio relay station built at and inside the mountain top. The installation is now a tourist attraction. It was financed mainly by American military grants, and cost one million US dollars to build from 1954 to 1959."

The harbour is run by a committee, the chair of which is Charles Williams. Visitors are attracted to Portloe by its fishing, scenery, and walks."
"Portloe lies within the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). Almost a third of Cornwall has AONB designation, with the same status and protection as a National Park. The South West Coast Path passes through the village."
The Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) stationed a lifeboat at Portloe in 1870 but it was withdrawn in 1887 without ever having performed a rescue. It was kept at first in a boat house built at the end of the road above the beach. It proved difficult to move the boat across the beach so a new house was built in 1877 nearer the water. The first house was converted into a church; the second was a school for a while but has since become a private dwelling house.

"Forget the Rules was an Australian short form episodic comedy-drama, which ran for two seasons from 2005 to 2007. It was the first scripted drama in the world to simultaneously broadcast over broadband, mobile phones and television. It employed the push model of crossmedia, and was one of the more successful models of an often failed interactive format that included audience input into the script and submitting visual elements as part of a tight weekly production cycle. It was conceived and piloted in Australia during 2004. In Canada, Season 1 has been broadcast on Movieola."
"Season 1 of Forget the Rules ran on Channel V (Foxtel), Hutchison 3G mobile phones and on the web, and consisted of nine minutes of drama produced every week featuring audience-driven story directions. Three-minute episodes were broadcast on Monday, Tuesday & Wednesday, starting October 10, 2005. Audiences voted on a choice of three possible story directions following the Wednesday episode. The 117 minutes of production (39 x 3min episodes) represents the equivalent of 5 x 30min episodes on free-to-air TV."
"Season 2 ran weekdays from November 12, 2007 to December 21, 2007. The series was distributed across Optus Television (Ovation Channel weekdays, The Music Factory weeknights) and Optus Zoo (mobile), as well as online through the show's website, YouTube, Facebook, and MySpace."
"The Season 1 scripts were written on Thursday based on the most popular audience vote. Pre-production and rehearsal on Friday. All nine minutes of the show was shot on Saturday and was broadcast each Monday-Wednesday throughout the 13-week season.

= = = Müngsten Bridge = = =
"Müngsten Bridge is the highest railway bridge in Germany. The bridge is high and spans the valley of the river Wupper, connecting the cities of Remscheid and Solingen. This stretch is part of the Wuppertal-Oberbarmen–Solingen railway. It is used exclusively by the Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn line S 7. On 1 April 2013, the Müngsten Bridge was closed for extensive renovation work: it reopened on 27 July 2015, but a further lengthy closure for a comprehensive corrosion treatment is planned for 2018. During the works, the train from Solingen Hbf to Remscheid Hbf terminated at Solingen Mitte and a bus continued to Remscheid."
"Originally the bridge was named ""Kaiser-Wilhelm-Brücke"" (Emperor Wilhelm Bridge) to honour Emperor Wilhelm I. After the end of the monarchy the bridge was renamed after the nearby settlement of Müngsten, which is close to the city limits of Solingen, Remscheid and Wuppertal. Today, the settlement no longer exists, so Müngsten is simply a landmark."
"First drafts for a bridge connecting the two cities of Remscheid and Solingen go back as far as 1889. Preparatory work began in 1893, the bridge was finished in 1897."
"The six support columns have a maximum height of 69 meters (230 ft). In the middle of the structure, the main arc has a span of 170 meters (560 ft). The overall length of the structure is 465 meters (1,530 ft)."
"A total of 5,000 tons (4,900 LT; 5,500 ST) of steel were used in its construction. 950,000 rivets hold the structure together. During construction, a number of advanced building techniques were used."
"Anton von Rieppel (1852 – 31 January 1926), an architect and engineer, was in charge of the project. A memorial plaque at the foot of the bridge reminds one of his efforts."
"Originally, the bridge was planned to be single-track. However, high future traffic growth projections led to the redesign as a dual-track bridge. Before its opening, the rail distance between the cities of Remscheid and Solingen was . With a direct connection via the bridge, this distance shrank to ."
The Prussian Parliament approved the 5 million Marks required to build the bridge in 1890.
"The first breaking of the earth was on 26 February 1894. A total of 1,400 kilograms (3,100 lb) of dynamite and 1,600 kilograms (3,500 lb) of black powder were needed during construction."
"The bridge's official inauguration celebration took place on 15 July 1897. Emperor Wilhelm II did not attend the ceremony in person. Prince Friedrich Leopold of Prussia attended the festivities instead. Emperor Wilhelm II visited the bridge two years later, on 12 August 1899."

"Plzeňský Prazdroj, a. s. (, known in English as the Pilsner Urquell Brewery, is a Czech brewery founded in 1842 and headquartered in Plzeň, Czech Republic. It was the first brewery to produce pale lager, branded as Pilsner Urquell; the popularity of Pilsner Urquell resulting in it being much copied so that more than two-thirds of the beer produced in the world today is pale lager, sometimes named ""pils"", ""pilsner"" and ""pilsener"" after Pilsner Urquell. The brewery name, ""Pilsner Urquell"", which can be roughly translated into English as ""the original source at Pilsen"", was adopted as a trademark in 1898. Pilsner Urquell is the largest beer producer in the Czech Republic and is also the largest exporter of beer abroad."
"The brewery has been part of the SABMiller group of companies (at the time South African Breweries) since 1999. As part of the agreements made with regulators before Anheuser-Busch InBev was allowed to acquire SABMiller in October 2016, Pilsner Urquell (excluding certain geographical areas) was sold to Japan based Asahi Breweries in March 2017."
"The brewery was founded in 1839 by both local Czech-speaking and German-speaking citizens in Bohemian city of Plzeň as (citizens' brewery, later translated to ""Měšťanský pivovar"" in Czech). The first beer was brewed here in 1842 by Bavarian brewer Josef Groll. In 1859, “Pilsner Bier” was registered as a brand name at the local Chamber of Commerce and Trade. In 1869, a competitor was founded as a joint stock company, later known as Gambrinus. In 1898 the German trademark ""Urquell"" and Czech trademark ""Prazdroj"" were created, to underline the claim of being the older, original source of Pilsner beer. In 1932 ""Měšťanský pivovar"" merged with ""Plzeňské aciové pivovary"". In 1946, the brewery was nationalized under the name ""Plzeňské pivovary"" (Pilsen breweries)."
"After the fall of communism in late 1989, the brewery was turned into a public share company, then renamed in 1994 after the Czech name of their famous beer, ""Plzeňský Prazdroj"". In 1999, they started to merge with "" Pivovar Radegast a.s."" and ""Pivovar Velké Popovice a. s.""."
"The brewery has been part of the SABMiller group of companies (at the time South African Breweries) since 1999. It has been the largest exporter of beer produced in the Czech Republic since 2000 when production surpassed that of Budějovický Budvar. In 2016, the company was sold to Asahi Group Holdings of Japan."
"A brewery museum (""Pivovarské muzeum"") has been set up near the brewery in the authentic medieval brewing house with malt house, which has been declared a cultural monument. It includes the late Gothic malt house, kiln, original drying shed and two-level laying-down cellars with ice-cellar, which are hewn from the Pilsen substrata. The exhibition covers Pilsen's most ancient history, the development of crafts, the emergence and growth of the guilds, the beginnings and development of brewing, malting, the craft of cooper, haulage and catering."
The tour includes a replica of a pub from the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries and a laboratory from the second half of the 19th century. The city walls have been opened with an example of the cultivation of barley and hops.

"Second-order election is a term that appeared for the first time in Karlheinz Reif and Hermann Schmitt's ""Nine second-order national elections – A conceptual framework for the analysis of European election results"" article for the [European Journal of Political Research, in 1980]. It was used to analyze the first European Parliament elections, held in 1979 in the, then, nine member states of the European Economic Community. According to the ""second-order elections"" approach, European Parliament elections were ""second-order"" in that they were viewed as less important by voters, parties and the media than first-order elections."
"First-order elections are those that determine the government and/or executive power in a political system, i.e., national elections. They are first-order in that they are seen as more important by parties, voters and the media. Local and regional elections are also considered second-order elections."
"Second-order elections present the following characteristics: turnout is expected to be lower than in national elections, voters are more prone to vote for protest parties, or parties in the periphery of the political system, rather than the usual mainstream parties they would vote for in a national election. As a result, second-order elections are often used by voters to punish or reward the current governing parties."
"Regarding EP elections, empirical evidence has shown that all six EP elections (1979, 1985, 1989, 1994, 1999, 2004) have been second-order elections. However, the second-order elections approach has not been confirmed for the twelve new member states of the European Union (Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Cyprus, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia)."

"Joel Lester Oppenheimer (Jacob Hammer) (February 18, 1930 – October 11, 1988) was an American poet associated with both the Black Mountain poets and the New York School. He was the first director of the St. Marks Poetry Project (1966–68). Though a poet, Oppenheimer was perhaps better known for his columns in the ""Village Voice"" from 1969 to 1984."
"Oppenheimer was born in Yonkers, New York, attended Cornell University for one year in 1948, spent less than one semester at the University of Chicago, and in 1950 enrolled at Black Mountain College in North Carolina. At Black Mountain, he studied with Paul Goodman and poet Charles Olson, became friends with Fielding Dawson and Ed Dorn, and worked in the school's print shop."
"In his earliest poetry, Oppenheimer shows clearly the influence of William Carlos Williams, but he soon developed his own style. While at Black Mountain, Oppenheimer met and married his first wife, Rena Furlong. He left the school in January 1953 without taking a degree, eventually settling in New York and working in a print shop while continuing to write poetry."
"His first publications were ""The Dancer"" (1951), as ""Jargon"", no. 2, 1951, by The Sad Devil Press/Black Mountain College; ""The Dutiful Son"" (1956) by Jonathan Williams's Jargon Society, reprinted by LeRoi Jones's Totem Press in 1961, ""The Love Bit and Other Poems"" (1962), again with Totem. His satiric Western drama ""The Great American Desert"" was the first play produced by Robert Nichols, directed by Lawrence Kornfeld, who had been with the Living Theatre, at the Judson Poets' Theatre. It opened on November 18, 1961."
"Oppenheimer's poetry has been collected in two volumes: Robert J. Bertholf (editor, introduction), ""Collected Later Poems of Joel Oppenheimer,"" with eleven drawings by John Dobbs, The Poetry Collection, 1997 and ""Names & Local Habitations (Selected Earlier Poems 1951-1972),"" editor Jonathan Williams, The Jargon Society, 1988."
"He also published two nonfiction works, ""The Wrong Season,"" Bobbs-Merrill 1973, about the New York Mets, and ""Marilyn Lives,"" Delilah, 1984, on Marilyn Monroe. ""Drawing from Life"", posthumously published in 1997, gathered 92 columns written for the ""Village Voice"".

"Lesiëm is a German musical project created in 1999 by the producers Sven Meisel and Alex Wende and active until 2005. The project's music combines elements of rock, pop, electronica, new age, enigmatic and ambient music, as well as Gregorian chant and other choral music. It is frequently compared to French project Era, Shinnobu, German musical project Enigma and the Norwegian artist Amethystium. Lesiëm's website makes extensive reference to the group's mystical and spiritual influences."
"Lesiëm released its debut album, ""Mystic Spirit Voices"", in 2000. When the album was released in the United States in 2002, it climbed to no. 10 at the U.S. New Age Albums Billboard chart. Lesiëm's second album, ""Chapter 2"", was released in 2001 in Europe, and in the United States in 2003 under the title ""Illumination"", where it reached no. 7. at the New Age Albums Billboard chart."
"The first two albums were some sort of prelude for the pop-opera ""Times"", which was Lesiëm's third album (released as ""Auracle"" in the United States in 2004). The musicians started their work in March 2002 and finished it in the end of July. The single ""Caritas"" (featuring Scottish singer Maggie Reilly and Deutsche Oper Berlin) was presented in December 2002 on the philanthropic TV-show of José Carreras, ""Carreras Gala"". In 2005, Lesiëm released its latest songs for a new version of ""Times"", ""Morgain"" and ""Morgause"", both also collaborations with Maggie Reilly."
"Lesiëm was created in Germany by producers Sven Meisel and Alex Wende in 1999 as an eclectic combination of Gregorian chants and choral music with modern genres and soundscapes, especially rock, pop and electronic music. The lyrics in Latin are written by Thomas Pflanz and sung by the all-male Carl Maria von Weber choir in the first two albums and the Deutsche Oper Berlin in the third."
"Its first album, ""Mystic Spirit Voices"", was released in January 2000 in Germany and 2002 in the United States, where it reached the number 10 at the Billboard New Age Albums chart."
"Lesiëm's second album, ""Chapter 2"", was released in 2001 in Germany and 2003 in the United States under the title ""Illumination"", ranking at number 7 at the Billboard New Age albums chart. It presented strong ethnic influences with its use of instruments like the duduk, the bagpipe and a second collaboration with South-African singer Lawrence Sihlabeni (following ""Indalo"" from the first album) in the track ""Africa""."
"""Times"", Lesiëm's latest work, was released in 2003 in Germany (with a reissue in 2005 featuring two new songs, ""Morgain"" and ""Morgause"") and 2004 in the United States under the title ""Auracle"". It is the only album to feature a mixed-gender choir."

Originally, the community of Hanging Rock sprang up in the Henderson Hollow gap of North River Mountain. While only a few buildings of the old hamlet remain, today's Hanging Rock is situated at the intersection of North River Road (County Route 50/21) and Delray Road (West Virginia Route 29) where the North River flows under U.S. Route 50 towards the Cacapon."
"On April 16, 1756, Daniel Morgan was wounded during a Native American attack near Hanging Rock while on the road to Winchester. The attack also resulted in the death of his two companions. Morgan managed to remain in his saddle and escaped with neck and mouth wounds towards Fort Edwards on the Cacapon River near Capon Bridge."

= = = Walter Beisiegel = = =
"Walter Karl Beisiegel OBE (13 July 1907 – 8 January 1973) was an English career Royal Air Force officer who played first-class cricket for the Royal Air Force cricket team and also for Leicestershire. He was born at Uppingham, Rutland and died in the RAF hospital at RAF Halton, Buckinghamshire."
"Beisiegel was educated at Uppingham School, where his batting at cricket won praise from Harry Altham in the annual review of schools cricket in ""Wisden Cricketers' Almanack"" in 1926. Altham wrote that Beisiegel ""stood head and shoulders over his colleagues"" and his innings of 126 not out for Uppingham against Rugby School ""was a fine wind-up to his school career""."
"For a period of five years between 1927 and 1932, inter-services cricket matches between the different branches of the UK armed forces – the Army, the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force – were rated as first-class. Beisiegel played in five of these matches for the RAF team between 1928 and 1931 as a middle-order batsman. In his first match, against The Army cricket team in 1928, he scored 54 in his only innings of the match, and this was to be the highest score of his first-class career. A year later, in the same fixture, he top-scored for the RAF with 53. Though Beisiegel continued to play in these inter-services matches through to 1938, none of his games were first-class after 1931, and these were the only first-class scores he made of more than 50."
"Three years after his last first-class game for the Royal Air Force team, Beisiegel played 10 matches for Leicestershire in the 1934 season as a middle-order batsman. He was not particularly successful, scoring 185 runs at an average of just 12.33 and with a highest score of only 33. But when the Leicestershire captain Arthur Hazlerigg was injured late in the season, it fell to Beisiegel as an amateur player to take over the captaincy, and in his first game as captain he led the team to its first victory over Yorkshire since 1911. ""The Times"" report said that it was ""the most sensational victory of the season"": Yorkshire had declared their first innings 102 ahead with only five wickets down but, set 149 to win, were all out for 90. Two weeks later there was a second victory under Beisiegel's leadership against a team considered greatly superior to Leicestershire when Nottinghamshire were beaten by an innings and 106 runs inside two days at Trent Bridge. The end of the season, however, marked the end of Beisiegel's first-class cricket career as he resumed his RAF duties; he was, however, awarded an honorary county cap in recognition of his captaincy successes."
"From school, Beisiegel went as a cadet to the Royal Air Force College Cranwell where he graduated as a pilot officer in December 1927. He was promoted from flying officer to flight lieutenant in 1933. This was followed by promotion from flight lieutenant to squadron leader in 1937. From the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939 to May 1940, he was in charge of No. 616 Squadron RAF, a unit that was equipped with the Mark I Spitfire during his command and that was based at RAF Leconfield until deployed south in May 1940. In 1942, he was temporarily promoted from wing commander to group captain under the heading of ""General Duties"". He remained in the RAF after the Second World War and was then officially promoted from wing commander to group captain in 1947. In 1950, he was awarded the OBE in the King's Birthday Honours. He retired from the RAF with a promotion to the rank of Air Commodore in 1956."

"The Capitanes de Arecibo are a Puerto Rican professional basketball team based in Arecibo, that competes in the Baloncesto Superior Nacional (BSN) league. In 2010, the team also had the distinction to play in the Premier Basketball League (PBL) under the name Capitanes de Puerto Rico. The team began play in the league in 1946. Home games are held at Manuel Iguina Coliseum, which the team shares with the Capitanes de Arecibo men's volleyball team."
"The team has won seven BSN Championships (1959, 2005, 2008, 2010, 2011, 2016 and 2018) and has had a total 16 finals appearances, being a runner-up 9 times (1932, 1946, 1948, 1961, 1966, 1992, 2007, 2012, 2014, 2015, 2017). Capitanes is the only team to participate in all editions of the FIBA Americas League, having entered the final four twice (finishing 2nd in 2010 and 3rd in 2013)."
"In 1946, coached by Wilfredo Franco, Tingo Díaz, Piro Méndez and for a pre-Olympic tournament, the Capitanes emerged. A group of young athletes, mostly from Arecibo, like: Manuel Gilberto (Petaca) Iguina, Quicón Iguina, Abdiel de la Rosa, Alberto Renta, Joaquín Balaguer, Armando Villamil, y Pipe Beníquez showed themselves to be a part of it and dominated the sport in Puerto Rico, finishing in second place."
"On August 19, 1959, the Capitanes won their first basketball championship against the Rio Piedras Cardinals at the Rodríguez Olmo Stadium in Arecibo. They were coached by Lou Rossinni, and the heroes of that series were Jaime Frontera, Francisco Pancho Padilla, Felipito Colón, Bill MacCadney, José (Fufi) Santori Coll, Moisés Navedo, José Rodríguez Gómez, Eddie Martínez, José Vázquez, José Aponte, Angel Morales, Jaime Miranda, Joe Phillip Padilla hijo, Ramón Siraguza, Enrique Miranda, and Sitín García. This team is the only team in BSN history to have gone the entire season, including the playoffs, undefeated."
"In 1992, coached by Alfred “Butch” Lee, the Capitanes returned to the BSN Finals with elite players Ferdinand Morales, Rafael Hernandez, Giovanni Colón, Fitz Roy Brow, Juan Griles, Orlando Febres, Bryan and Mark Santiago, losing a hard-fought series against the Ponce Lions."
"The Capitanes in 2002 wrote another page in the history of their city and the BSN when the so-called ""kids"" broke the predictions of the media and basketball analysts by taking a semi-final series to Game 7 with young talents Giovanni Jiménez, Rick Apodaca, Buster Figueroa, Pachy Cruz and David Cortes; and veterans Félix Javier Perez, Javier Rolón and Oscar Chiaramello."
"In 2005, general manager Regino Babilonia hired Carlos Mario Rivera as head coach and the Captains again won the BSN Championship (4-0) over the Bayamón Cowboys."
"In 2007, with David Rosario at the command of the Captain Ship, and the fiery players Rafael “Pachy” Cruz, Ángel “Buster” Figueroa, David Cortes, Carlos Payano and Marcus Fizer as reinforcement, the Capitanes returned to the BSN Finals. In a historic, sold-out Game 7 at the Jose Miguel Agrelot Coliseum, where 75% of the attendees were from Captain Correa City, the Arecibo Captains came back from a 20-point fourth-quarter deficit to force an overtime. In a hard-fought and emotional series of plays and calls, the Captains came up just short of another championship."
"During the 2008 season, the Capitanes advanced again to the finals against the Carolina Giants. The series went to seven games, with both teams winning three games at home. Arecibo won the seventh game, 99-94, for the third championship in the franchise's history. Ángel Figueroa was selected the Finals' Most Valuable Player."
"It was forty-six years since the Captains succeeded in that first championship. That was on August 19, 1959. They came short in 1966 when they lost in overtime against Ponce and in a seventh game finals held at the court of Manuel Carrasquillo Herpen Country Club. In 1992 the attorney Hiram Ruiz saw the Lions come from behind in the series to thwart another major celebration in Arecibo."
"In 2005, there were doubts. However, unlike the team of 1959, the 2005 edition played with many ups and downs during the regular season and also in the ""round robin"", for example beating the best in the league but losing to last-placed teams. The reason for not dominating as expected was the failure of the team's ""Refuerzo"" (reinforcement player), former rebounding leader and prolific scorer, center Nick Davis, who did not meet the team and fan's expectations, as well as his following replacements until the arrival of Richard Lugo."
"In the ""round robin"" the Captains won five and lost as many games. The team was torn between changing Dickey Simpkins or staying with the player that looked more like a fifth man with the added reinforcement that was hurt."
"With all that were chosen as a finalist in the analyzes that the Cowboys favored above all others for having excelled in the second stage of the tournament. Unlike the 1959 champion who went undefeated, these Captains had to earn their stripes."
The Captains got a breaks with the elimination of Ponce. The Lions were the best team that could match-up with the Captains and successfully handle the full-court press.
"The Captains then faced a remodeled Santurce, with former Nigerian NBA player Olumide Oyedeji. The series became complicated and unpredictable."

"Robert Ernest Keeton (December 16, 1919 – July 2, 2007) was an American lawyer, jurist, and legal scholar. As a law professor at Harvard Law School and a United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts he was known for his work on torts, insurance law, and practical courtroom tactics. Keeton, with Jeffrey O'Connell of the University of Virginia School of Law, played a key role in the advancement of no-fault automobile insurance."
"Keeton was born in Clarksville, Texas. He was the second youngest of five children of William Keeton (who owned a general store) and Ernestine Teuton Keeton. One of his brothers, W. Page Keeton, also became a prominent lawyer and educator. Keeton earned his Bachelor of Business Administration from the University of Texas at Austin and his Bachelor of Laws from the University of Texas School of Law. As an undergraduate he became one of three students inducted into the Friar Society, an honor society at the University of Texas. In law school he was the assistant editor-in-chief of the ""Texas Law Review"". Keeton went into private practice with the law firm of Baker & Botts in Houston before joining the United States Navy in World War II. As a lieutenant serving aboard the escort aircraft carrier USS ""Liscome Bay"" (CVE-56) he survived the sinking of the ship on November 24, 1943, by a torpedo from the Japanese submarine I-175. Keeton, clinging to debris for hours, was later pulled from the ocean. He was awarded a Purple Heart. Keeton returned to Baker & Botts in 1945 after the war. He later taught at Southern Methodist University."
"Keeton joined Harvard Law School in 1953, where he would remain until 1979. In 1954, he wrote ""Trial Tactics and Methods"", a book of practical advice on courtroom skills. Keeton later developed a program at Harvard (later used at other law schools) in which experienced trial lawyers taught students. One rule of Keeton's program was to not ask hostile witnesses open-ended questions. In 1956, Keeton received his Doctor of Juridical Science from Harvard. In 1973, he was named the Langdell Professor of Law. Keeton served as associate dean from 1975–1979. In the early 1970s, Keeton worked with University of Virginia School of Law professor Jeffrey O'Connell on a study that contributed to the development of no-fault automobile insurance, later adopted by many states. Under a no-fault system, damages below a certain level are paid by insurance companies, thus avoiding a determination of who was at fault."
"Keeton was nominated by President Jimmy Carter on January 25, 1979, to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, to a new seat authorized by 92 Stat. 1629. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on March 21, 1979, and received his commission on March 23, 1979. He assumed senior status on February 28, 2003. His service terminated on September 8, 2006, due to retirement. In 1979 Chief Justice Warren Burger appointed him chair of the Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure of the Judicial Conference of the United States, a body responsible for developing the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure."
"Keeton presided over the 1988-1989 mail fraud and obstruction of justice trial of Lyndon LaRouche and eleven associates, which ended with Keeton declaring a mistrial. He also presided over the 1995 ""Lotus Dev. Corp. v. Borland Int'l, Inc."" trial involving the extent of software copyright, a case that later was decided by the Supreme Court. In 1984 Keeton, along with older brother Page as lead author, and professors Dan Dobbs and David Owen, published the 5th edition of ""Prosser and Keeton on Torts"". The book, based on William Prosser's influential ""Prosser on Torts"" (1941), became a foundational text of tort law and has become frequently used as a law textbook and reference work for many law students, lawyers, and jurists."

The Bobcats registered victories at Marist, Rhode Island and Toledo, against Akron and Samford at home, and took 18th-ranked Kentucky to the wire in Cincinnati, Ohio."
"From 2003 until O'Shea's departure in 2008, Ohio would have five-straight winning seasons with at least 19 wins each season. O'Shea was 120–95 in eight seasons in charge."
"O'Shea returned to his New England roots when he signed an eight-year contract to take over the head coaching duties at Bryant as the school transitioned to a full Division I member of the Northeast Conference. The Bulldogs broke through in the Bulldogs' first season of full Division I eligibility in 2012-13, winning 19 games and hosting a game in the College Basketball Invitational."
"Bryant went 16-15 the following season with an NEC semifinal appearance, but the Bulldogs failed to make the NEC Tournament in two of O'Shea's final three seasons at the helm, including an injury-plagued 2017-18 campaign in which Bryant's four leading scorers made a total of four starts together, all in the month of November."
"On February 12, 2018, O'Shea announced his retirement from Bryant, effectively at the end of the 2017–18 season."

"Pavol Horov Gymnasium () is an upper secondary school located in the city of Michalovce in Kosice Region, Slovakia. Established in 1922, it is the oldest Slovak Gymnasium east of the Mátra-Slanec Area and is one of two main providers of secondary school education in Michalovce, along with ""Gymnázium na ulici Ľudovíta Štúra""."
"Before the Czechoslovak declaration of independence on 28 October 1918, the area of surrounding the city of Michalovce was a part of the former Hungarian County of Kosice (). At that time, there was only three secondary schools in the entire county, all of which was purely Hungarian, located in the then cultural centers of Kosice, Presov and Uzhgorod."
"After becoming independent, patriotic sentiment ran high and Slovaks sensed immediately the need to establish a Slovak high school in the area, in order to provide higher education in Slovak language for the populace in eastern Slovakia. At first the choice stood between three sites in the Zemplin region, which were the cities of Humenne, Trebisov and Michalovce. Due to its ability to provide sufficient funds and staffing, Michalovce soon became the obvious choice for the construction of the new school."
"The new school was finished in 1922 and in the period 1922 - 1938 the school bore the name ""Czechoslovak state gymnasium."" At the stage, the education was conducted in a way that emphasized the idea of the single Czechoslovak nation, and the language taught was the ""českoslovenčina"", or Czechoslovak language.The School's administrators constantly struggled with finding teachers with sufficient qualifications, teaching post was often filled with engineers, and often the school was dependent on the assistance of local school teachers."
"In 1931, the school marked its first graduating class, of the 22 students, 18 managed to graduate. Seven years later the school was markedly affected by the First Vienna Award, which saw the departure of all Czech professors along with their families from Michalovce. These were highly skilled academics which undoubtedly contributed to the high reputation of the school."
"Following the Munich treaty in November 1938, the Name of the school was changed to ""Slovak real high school"" (). In connection with the events of Munich, the beginning of the 1938-39 school year the school was occupied by the army (mobilization). Teaching was suspended from 24 September 1938 to 10 October 1938. After the First Vienna Award the new students came from schools from the Hungarian territories, (mainly Uzhhorod)."
"After Slovak students started moving to nearby Sobrance and the number of classes was reduced from 19 to 16 by April 1939, teaching in at the school year was interrupted again. When Hungarian troops invaded Slovakia on March 23, 1939 and the subsequent Slovak–Hungarian War, Slovak troops occupied the school and returned Slovak language to the curriculum. This education highlighted growing Slovak national consciousness and nationalism. At this time the Head teacher was also the government commissioner of Michalovce and later the leader of the Hlinka Youth (Slovak paramilitary scout movement, modeled after the Hitler Youth). In school year 1939/40 that organization counted 118 of the schools students. Two years later the count was 590 boys and girls. In 1944 it was 694 students out of a total 875. Influenced in part by the ideas of Slovak nationalist Andrej Hlinka, Catholicism became an important part of the school year, the year began with worship of Veni Sancte Spiritus, a school celebration, ending a solemn Te Deum. During the closing phase of World War II, the school became a military hospital for the Wehrmacht, and after November 1944, for the Red Army."
"The school education programme consists of 8 semesters (4 years), divided into two parts of two years each. Each part includes subjects such as General education, Foreign languages (usually Russian, French, German and English), Physical Education, Informatics and Science/technology."

"""DragonHeart: Fire and Steel"" follows the story of medieval dragonslayer Sir Bowen in his attempt to rid the world of a particularly evil king along with seven evil dragons that have ruled the world (the seven evil dragons never appeared in the movie). On the way, he befriends the last dragon to exist, Draco. Sir Bowen and Draco must join forces to defeat the king's army and rescue a damsel in distress. It drops out some of the movie's plot, but it is still a close match."
"After its release, ""Dragonheart"" spawned a spin-off 2D hack and slash game for the PlayStation and Saturn called ""Dragonheart: Fire & Steel"", made by Acclaim Entertainment. The game does not use the film's music, instead featuring an original score by Thomas Egeskov Peterson. It was met with overwhelmingly negative reviews due to simplistic gameplay, poor controls, and jerky animation. Though the graphics were praised, particularly the rendered backgrounds, critics agreed that the gameplay problems were an overriding problem. In late 1996, Acclaim ported a PC version of the game, which received similar criticism."
"""Maniac Games"" gave it a score of 28 out of 100."
"There was also an original Game Boy game based on the film, titled simply ""Dragonheart"". The four reviewers of ""Electronic Gaming Monthly"", while remarking that the Game Boy game is rather simple and lacking in challenge, especially the ""anticlimactic"" combat, concluded that it offers decent entertainment and longevity for a portable game.

"From Mandaluyong City, Buncio is the son of Gregorio ""Yoyong"" Buncio, a motorcycle racer, mechanic, and modifier. His mother is Mylene Buncio. He has four other siblings, namely Lourdes, Shara, Jacquelyn, and Barny."
"Buncio's father gave him the name ""Maico"" from a European motorcycle brand. At the age of three, he had started to learn riding motorcycles before bicycles. His training began early under the mentoring of his experienced father."
Buncio started his motocross competition career at the age of eight. He won first place in the 1996 FBO Motorcross Series 50cc category for ten years old and below held at the TRAKSNIJAK Race Track in Tagaytay City.
"At the age of 14, Buncio represented the Philippines in Perris, California at the FMF Memorial Day Motorcross Races, winning first place in the Mini Class 85cc for the 14 years old and below category."
"Buncio took up Bachelor of Science in Commerce, Major in Entrepreneurship at the University of Santo Tomas. Buncio was a consistent honor student since elementary and studied in OB Montessori until high school. He also finished his computer New Media Design Course from Phoenix One Knowledge Solutions in Makati on his latter years."
"Buncio was the sole representative of the Philippines in the 2004 Yamaha ASEAN Cup held at Shah Alam, Malaysia, where he raced against competitors from Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and Indonesia. He won the fourth overall title for the country despite having to start from the back of the grid and having to race against five representing riders each from the other competing countries. This feat earned him the title Rookie of the Year from the organizers of said event."

He was rushed to a nearby hospital in Mabalacat and transferred to the UST Hospital in the wee hours of 15 May and was pronounced dead at 3:57 PM on the same day due to massive internal bleeding. The father of the late superbike champion Maico Buncio raised questions over the first aid procedure done on the rider during his fatal crash at the Clark Speedway Circuit.
"He said that the Aeromed's medical response team pulled the victim's body from the steel bar. This, he said, might have caused his son's death. The bar punctured his body and damaged his kidney and liver. Instead of cutting the steel bar to free Maico, the AeroMed emergency staffers decided to pull the young motorcycle champion free from his entanglement. This, they learned later, caused massive internal damage to Maico's organs and prompted him to scream in pain."
"Dr. Reynante Mirano, chief of St. Luke’s Hospital Emergency Medicine, said that instead of pulling Buncio’s body from the protruding metal, the medics should have cut the steel bar."
"Maico Buncio left a memorable quote to his fellow riders ""Never stop riding, because I didn't."""
Buncio's wake was held in the Loyola Memorial Chapels in Makati City and he was laid to rest in the Loyola Memorial Park in Marikina City on 21 May 2011. A motorcade organized by his fellow riders marked his funeral procession.

"Since ending his football career he has worked in the media, including with the BBC, Setanta Sports, Talksport, BT Sport and RTÉ."
Initially rejected by Arsenal for being 'too small' he went to West Ham United where he moved up the ranks of the academy but did not play for the first team. He joined Football Conference side Farnborough Town during the 1992–93 season and made twenty-one appearances.
"In order to gain first team football, he joined South Coast side Bournemouth in January 1995. He played a total of 104 games, scoring 18 goals whilst at Dean Court, and also became captain."

He captained the club to a fifth-place finish and qualification for the UEFA Cup in their first season in the Premier League in 2001. Though Ipswich were relegated in 2002 he stayed with the club after he turned down a £4 million move to Aston Villa. His spell at Ipswich is remembered for the consistency he showed, after playing 223 consecutive games and only missing one league match (due to international duty) in the six years he was at Portman Road."
"After Ipswich failed to win promotion in 2003, Holland moved back to the Premier League by joining Charlton Athletic on a four-year contract for an initial £750,000 fee, which later rose to £900,000. Again with this move he assumed the captain's armband and was ever-present in his first season for the club. One of the longest-serving Charlton players, he claimed more than half the entire vote for the 2007–08 Fans' Player of the Year. His final match came in a 2–2 draw with Cardiff on 21 April 2009, and the club released him after relegation to League One at the end of the season."
"In July 2009, Holland trained with Colchester United following his release from Charlton in order to keep himself fit."
"Although born in England, Holland qualified to play for the Republic of Ireland through his grandmother who hailed from County Monaghan. He made his international debut on 9 October 1999 in an away Euro 2000 qualifier against Macedonia, playing the last five minutes as a substitute for Mark Kennedy. His first goal came on his fifth cap, the equaliser in a 1–1 draw with Portugal on 7 October 2000 in qualification for the 2002 FIFA World Cup. Holland captained the side in three internationals, the first on his 28th cap, a 2–0 friendly defeat to Scotland."
"He went with the Republic of Ireland to the 2002 World Cup scoring the equaliser against Cameroon in their opening game. Ireland were eliminated from this tournament in a Second Round penalty shoot-out against Spain, with Holland among those who missed. Following Ireland's failure to qualify for the 2006 World Cup, he announced his retirement from international football on 5 February 2006 having made 49 appearances and scoring five goals.

Related acts include:
Also relevant is the Forest Practices Code.
"Lawyers for Forests (LFF) published a review of the act in 2002, and found a lack of resources to enforce the act, a lack of government transparency and accountability, that the act may be and is ignored in government decisionmaking, and that the act is generally unenforceable. The review identified the following factors:"
"As well as a general review, the review considers the impact of the Act on the Leadbeater's possum, the powerful owl and the tiger quoll, as well as on a threatened community and a threatening process. For example, it considers the concern of environmentalists for the small and poorly placed Special Protection and Management Zones for the tiger quoll, the continuing clear-fell logging followed by slash burns in their management zones, and the failure to stop the use of 1080 poison, which is a threat to the species."
"LFF recommended that the NRE should receive appropriate funding to fully implement the FFG Act, and the government commit to NRE fulfilling its obligations under the Act. The group further recommended that the Act should be enforceable, and NRE should be accountable in its efforts to fulfil its obligations under the Act."

"Cap was the most bickered eating club in 2011, 2013, 2014, and 2015. It has been the most selective club since 2013, with 227 students bickering in Spring 2015, forty-four percent of whom were offered membership."
"Cap is located at 61 Prospect Avenue between Cloister Inn and the University Cottage Club. It is the only Princeton eating club to stay in the same geographic location for its entire existence. Three Cap clubhouses have occupied this location. The first was completed in 1892. In 1895 when the club outgrew this clubhouse, the structure was moved across the street, and William Ralph Emerson was commissioned to design the second clubhouse (completed in 1896). Ten years later, Cap was ready to expand again. The Emerson building was moved away, and Raleigh Gildersleeve designed the clubhouse that Cap still occupies today. A major renovation and expansion of the clubhouse to increase the size of the clubhouse in step with its growing membership was completed in February 2011."
"Notable Cap and Gown alumni include Dean Cain '88, Brooke Shields '87, and Donald Rumsfeld '54. Neurosurgeon Wilder Penfield, who pioneered the concept of the brain homunculus, was also a member of Cap and Gown."

"The seaman were classed as either Able Seaman, Ordinary Seaman, or Landsman. An Able Seaman was an expert all rounder, happy aloft in the rigging or taking the helm and all other aspects of shipboard life. An Ordinary Seaman was one who had a grasp of basic seamanship and could be useful aboard ship but was not yet an expert or skillful sailor. A Landsman was a man with very little or no prior sea experience at all, most commonly a product of the press gang."

"Gary Wang or Wang Wei (; born May 8, 1973) is a Chinese entrepreneur. He is the founder of the Chinese video sharing company Tudou.com and served as its CEO until August 2012. He is currently the founder of Light Chaser Animation Studios, an animation studio based in Beijing. Wang is also a novelist, screenwriter, and playwright. He holds a Computer Science degree from the Johns Hopkins University, and an MBA from INSEAD. He received his bachelor's degree in international business from the College of Staten Island, CUNY, in 1995."
"Wang's first full-time job out of college was as a salesman of apparel snap fasteners, although he ""wore an ill-fitting $90 suit and didn't know how to pronounce Christian Dior."" He later moved on to a position at Hughes Electronics, where he worked from 1997 to 2001 through roles in engineering and last held the role of business development manager. After obtaining his MBA at INSEAD in 2002, Wang served as the corporate development director of Bertelsmann Group, an international media company, and also served as the managing director of Bertelsmann Online China, a company operating the e-commerce businesses of Bertelsmann Group in China, from 2003 to 2005."
"Wang founded Tudou in January 2005 (a few months before YouTube), citing the tightly regulated nature of television content in China and his hope to ""bridge the huge gap between those people who have creative ideas and talent, but cannot get their work to the audience"" as his primary reasons."
"Wang formally launched Tudou online on April 15, 2005, and the website soon took off. Tudou started as a website hosting user-generated content (UGC), but soon expanded to include UGC, premium licensed content and content developed in-house, commonly described as a combination of the YouTube, Hulu, and HBO business models. The number of monthly unique visitors to Tudou increased from approximately 50 million in December 2007 to approximately 182 million in December 2010, and to approximately 200 million in May 2011. The number of registered users increased from approximately 35.6 million in December 31, 2008 to approximately 78.2 million as of December 31, 2010 and further to approximately 90.1 million as of June 30, 2011."
"Wang took Tudou public on NASDAQ in August 2011. On March 12, 2012, Tudou and competitor Youku.com announced a merger to form Youku Tudou Inc., with Tudou valued at US$1.2 billion. Since the merger was formally completed in August 2012, Wang has retired from the new company's daily operations."
"In an interview with the Wall Street Journal on March 12, 2013, Wang announced his new project, Light Chaser Animation Studios, to produce animated feature films targeting the rapidly growing Chinese movie market, which grew by 30% in 2012 and is widely expected to overtake the U.S. market in size by 2020. He cited the lack of quality domestically produced animation content, a rapidly growing domestic market, and improving environment for movie distribution, promotion and copyrights in China as the main reasons behind his decision."
"Light Chaser Animation Studios is based in Beijing, China."
"Wang is also a novelist and playwright for stage and ballet. At 24, Wang wrote the novel ""Waiting for Summer"", loosely based on his early experiences studying and living in the United States. Wang published the novel in 2006, first serially in the acclaimed Chinese literary magazine ""Harvest"", and then as an independent work a year later. In 2011, Wang wrote ""The Residential Compound"", a stage play about urban development and relocation in Beijing. In the same year, Wang wrote the libretto for the San Francisco Ballet's critically acclaimed ""RAkU"", a story about a ""triangle of obsession"" taking place in the Tokugawa Era."
"Wang is the screenwriter and director of Light Chaser Animation's first movie, Little Door Gods."

"Frederick Tansley Munnings (1875, Lowestoft – 1953) was a 20th-century British spiritualist medium and former burglar. He was exposed as a fraud."
"Munnings lived in Hastings and worked as a boarding-house keeper. He was convicted of burglary for housebreaking at Woking and was sentenced to nine months' imprisonment. Munnings claimed to be a ""direct voice"" medium, but was exposed as a fraud when one of his séance sitters turned the lights on, revealing him to be holding a trumpet by means of a telescopic extension piece and using an angle piece to change the auditory effect of his voice."
"In February 1926 a public warning against Munnings was issued in the press by Arthur Conan Doyle, Abraham Wallace, R. H. Saunders, and H. D. Bradley. The psychical researcher Harry Price also exposed his fraudulent mediumship. Munnings claimed to produce the independent ""spirit"" voices of Julius Caesar, Dan Leno, Hawley Harvey Crippen and King Henry VIII. Price invented and used a piece of apparatus known as a voice control recorder and proved that all the voices were those of Munnings. Munnings admitted fraud and sold his confessions to a Sunday newspaper."

= = = Powell-Cotton Ethnographic Films = = =
"The Powell-Cotton ethnographic films is a collection of over 70 ethnographic, documentary and wildlife films made by the Powell-Cotton family between 1922 and 1973. The films relate exclusively to the family's expeditions in Africa during this time. The original films are held in the British Film Institute archives, and the Powell-Cotton Museum own copies contemporaneous with the originals."
"Between 1887 and 1939 Major Percy H G Powell-Cotton undertook a total of 28 expeditions to Africa and Asia. Alongside the extensive collection of game and animal specimens he bought back, Major Powell-Cotton also shot several reels of 16mm film footage whilst out in the bush."
"His films mainly depict African game and wildlife, as well as market scenes, craft making and tribal ceremonies from the African rural communities. One particular film, ""Gorilla Drive, Cameroons"", is believed to be the only one of its subject from this date in existence. It shows the mustering of the animals by the local people, their herding and despatch by the natives with spears."
"Powell-Cotton made 17 films in total, either independently or together with his daughter Diana or wife Hannah. All the films are 16mm black and white silent films, made in a non-narrative documentary style. The major also shot all his films using a handheld, windup Bell & Howell Filmo 70 camera, which is currently on display in the Powell-Cotton museum. The first recorded use of colour film was in 1950’s in the film ""South Africa: Victoria Falls & Livingstone Game Park"" made by Christopher and Diana Powell-Cotton."
"Most of the films in the collection were made for private viewing only and for the purposes recording keeping from the expeditions. However, Major Powell-Cotton did present several of his films to the Royal Anthropological Institute in 1932, including ""Crafts in the Cameroons"" (1931) and ""Osonigbe Juju House and Benin Brass Cutting"" (1931)."
"The most notable films of the collection are those by Major Powell-Cotton’s daughters, Diana and Antoinette Powell-Cotton from their expeditions to Angola in 1936 and 1937."
"The result of their trips was just under three hours of edited black-and-white 16mm film, accompanied by nearly 3,000 objects and 2,000 photographs. The films portray local ceremonies, craft-working and family life in rural Africa. Together they provide a unique record of the region at a crucial time in its history, before the full impact of the massive cultural changes brought about by missionization and colonial rule."
"Diana and Antoinette filmed their entire footage on a single, small windup Kodak cine camera which is currently on display in the Powell-Cotton museum. The sisters were not able to review or edit any footage on location, and so were constantly anxious they had not captured the events and activities in Angola successfully. They only edited their footage on their return, and would give private viewings accompanied by music and live narration to family members in their screen room which is now Gallery 4 in the Powell-Cotton museum."

The Marathon was first announced on October 3, 1984 with U.S. Steel and PNC Bank as sponsors. From 1985 to 2003, the race was held annually and named the UPMC/City of Pittsburgh Marathon, although serious financial difficulty within the City of Pittsburgh municipal budget and UPMC's withdraw from title sponsor led to suspension of the race from 2004 to 2008. In 2009, the event was revived with a new title sponsor, Dick's Sporting Goods, and renewed interest in the race."
"The 1988 and 2000 races were USA Olympic Trials for women and men, that were held separately from the regular event although both were held over the same course."
"Aside from the main marathon event, several races occur during the weekend of the marathon, including a half marathon, two to five person marathon relay, 5k race, and ""kids marathon."" All races except for the ""kids marathon"" and 5k utilize the same route and starting time as the marathon. Attendance and popularity of the events has risen greatly since the 2009 revival. The 2012 race had the largest field in the history of the race. Registration for 2012 closed with roughly 25,000 participants between all races, with 6,000 entrants in the full marathon, 13,000 entrants in the half marathon, and 800 teams in the marathon relay, with the remaining entrants distributed in the 5K. Additionally, an estimated 60,000 spectators lined the course, and 4,000 volunteers provided assistance. 2012 also marked the earliest sellout in the race's history with all events except the 5k selling out on or before March 6, 2012."
"Historically, the course has wound through the unique and hilly topography of the city. Crossing five different bridges, the course traverses all three rivers of Pittsburgh's at least once. The start and finish lines have changed many times, but have always been in either Downtown or North Shore. Previous finish lines have included Point State Park, David L. Lawrence Convention Center, and the 50 yard-line of Heinz Field. The current finish line is on the Boulevard of the Allies near Point State Park. Numerous other historic and well-known Pittsburgh neighborhoods are along the route, including the South Side, Oakland, Shadyside, East Liberty, Highland Park, Bloomfield, Lawrenceville, and the Strip District."
"Throughout the course, thousands of neighborhood residents show their support by lining the streets of the course and volunteering at aid stations. Neighborhood organizations are awarded financial grants for community-engaging celebrations along the route. Sixty bands, almost all of which are from the Greater Pittsburgh area, line the streets throughout the course, spanning a range of musical genres."
"The Pittsburgh Marathon hosted the United States Olympic Marathon Trials for men in 2000 and the US Olympic Trials for women in 1988. In addition, it has served as the site for the United States men's national championship three times, the National Wheelchair Championship in 1986, as well as the Olympic Marathon Trials for both Finland and Denmark in the 1980s."

The football program installed one of the first artificial turfs in the state, the only Sprinturf installation in Arizona, as its main football, soccer, and track field at a cost of $1 million."
"Paradise Valley opened in 1957 at Bell Road and 40th street which at the time was on the outskirts of Phoenix. The original campus consisted of an administration building, several small classroom buildings and a small gymnasium and athletic fields located to the north of the classroom buildings. In the 1960s a library, cafeteria, shop building and three larger classroom buildings were added to the campus. The gymnasium was also expanded in the 1960s. In the early 1970s a new building called the 700 building was constructed. Between 1976 and 1979 several new buildings designed by the Tempe architecture office of Michael & Kemper Goodwin Ltd. The plan included a new vocational education building and an additional physical education building. In 1982 the remaining 1957 classroom buildings were demolished to make way for a larger classroom building. The new building was nearly complete when the 1983-1984 school year began. At that time the 1960s buildings were updated. In 1983 the 700 building was demolished to make way for a new 1,200 seat auditorium and associated fine arts building. The auditorium and fine arts building were completed in 1984. In 1990 it was decided that Paradise Valley would close its original campus and move to a new campus being constructed at Union Hills Drive and 16th Street. The new campus opened for the 1991-1992 school year. It was then decided that the original campus would be renovated and reopened. The original gymnasium as well as the administration building were demolished and rebuilt and the campus was thoroughly spruced up. The updated school reopened for the 1993-1994 school year. The new campus on Union Hills was then renamed North Canyon High School. The CREST STEM program was established in 2010 offering students classes in Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics. In 2013 the three 1960s classroom buildings were demolished to make way for two new twin story buildings housing the science department and CTE classes. In 2013 the auditorium was also completely renovated. The 2013 projects were completed by McCarthy Construction."
When the school was established the Paradise Valley High School District was also created. In July 1976 the high school district unified with the elementary district to form the Paradise Valley Unified School District.

"A 6'11"" power forward/center, McDaniels averaged nearly 40 points per game as a senior at Allen County High School in Scottsville, Kentucky. From 1967 to 1971, he played at Western Kentucky University, leading his team to a third-place finish in the 1971 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. (The NCAA later voided Western Kentucky's participation in the tournament, accusing McDaniels of signing with an agent while still in college.) He also set WKU school records with 2,238 career points (now tied with Courtney Lee) and 1,118 career rebounds."
"McDaniels was drafted by the Seattle SuperSonics in the second round of the 1971 NBA draft and No. one overall by the Dallas Chaparrals in the 1971 American Basketball Association Draft, but he began his professional career with the Carolina Cougars of the American Basketball Association, who offered him a $1.35 million contract to be paid over twenty-five years. Reportedly, the Cougars first approached McDaniels during November 1970, while he was still playing for Western Kentucky. McDaniels averaged 26.8 points and 14 rebounds in 58 games with the Cougars during the 1971–72 season and scored 24 points and grabbed 11 rebounds in the 1972 ABA All-Star Game. However, he feuded with the Cougars while trying to renegotiate his contract – he wanted his salary to be spread over fifteen years, rather than twenty-five – and near the end of his rookie season he decided to leave the Cougars for the SuperSonics."
"McDaniels remained with Seattle for the next two full seasons. However, he struggled to maintain the same level of production he had achieved in the ABA, and by the 1973–74 NBA season, McDaniels was averaging just 5.5 points per game. During that time, McDaniels was dogged by off-court troubles as the Cougars questioned the legality of his jump to the NBA. He later admitted in an interview, ""I should have stayed in the ABA for a couple of years. I was just young and things started going bad for me there and I didn't know how to handle them."" SuperSonics coach and general manager Bill Russell ultimately released McDaniels in fall 1974."

"The Port of Salem is a shallow-draft port in the vicinity of the Salem River Cut-Off on the Salem River in Salem, New Jersey in the United States about east of the Delaware River and about from the Atlantic Ocean. It was re-designated a port of entry in 1984 and became a foreign trade zone (FTZ) in 1987. Transloading operations include the handling of a variety of bulk cargo, notably of construction aggregate, break bulk cargo, and containers for clothing, fishing apparel, agricultural produce, and other consumer goods, and has at times involved lighterage. It is operated under the auspices of the South Jersey Port Corporation."
"The Delaware River estuary was the territory of the Lenape. European settlement of the region around today's Salem began in 1638 when the colony of New Sweden was established and the Salem River was called Varkens Kill or Hogg Creek. Tradition holds that ethnic Finns settled inland from Finns Point in 1638. In 1641, a group from the New Haven Colony settled around Varkens Kill. In 1655, it was re-claimed by New Netherland and in 1664 it became part of the Province of New Jersey. In 1675, a land patent was given to John Fenwick, who founded the town. Originally, Salem's wharves were located along Fenwick Creek and Salem Creek, and received calls from Philadelphia, Boston and the Caribbean. During the American Revolutionary War, it was occupied by the British to prevent supplies from reaching American troops. Steamer service between Salem and Philadelphia began in 1825. The Salem Railroad opened in 1863."
"The Salem River Cut-off, which bypasses a large bend in the river at the port, was authorized in 1925. For much of the 20th century, the waterfront along the Salem River Cut-off and Fenwick Creek was dominated by industries centered around glass manufacturing, food processing, and mineral/oil storage. From 1905 to 1978, H. J. Heinz Company operated a large processing plant along Fenwick Creek. Mannington Mills, Anchor Glass, and AluChem are located proximate to the port, as well as the South Jersey Farmers Exchange in nearby Woodstown."
Salem was originally designated a port of entry in 1682 by royal commission of the British Crown.
"The City of Salem established a municipal port authority in 1982. In 1984, the port resumed international shipping operations and the United States Customs Service granted it status as a ""water port of entry"", the first such designation made since the 1930s. It is now a port of entry in United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) District 21, which is headquartered in Newark and covers New Jersey."
"Along with Millville Municipal Airport, portions of the port have been part of foreign trade zone #142 since 1987. Subzones associated with FTZ142 are located at the Port of Paulsboro and other locations in South Jersey."

The shipping channel of the Salem River is much shallower, making the city a shallow draft port, which prohibits use by Handymax class ships. The Salem River and Cut-Off were first channelized in 1925 to a depth of . The river is entered though Salem Cove about from the Atlantic Ocean at the entrance of the Delaware Bay. The channel travels along the southeast side of the cove for and continues another to the Cut-Off and to the head of navigation at the first bridge crossing (Route 49)."
"The Delaware River is served by various range lights. Reedy Island is approximately southwest of the mouth of the Salem River. Reedy Island Front Light works in conjunction with the Reedy Island Range Rear Light for navigation of the Salem reach of the river. The Finns Point Range Light upstream of the Salem River was deactivated in 1950. From the Delaware River, entrance to the port is guided by the Salem River Range Lights, the Salem River Directional Light (), and 11 other lighted navigational aids."
"The city and county of Salem have a long history of glass manufacturing, along with the site of the first successful glass production facility in North America. Adjacent to the port is the oldest manufacturing facility for glass containers in the United States, established in 1863 and long known as Anchor Glass, once owned by Anchor Hocking and now part of the Ardagh Group."
"The rail line serving the port is called the Glass House Running Track and is an extension of the Salem Branch. On the verge of abandonment by Conrail, the southern section of the route from Swedesboro to Salem was purchased by the county in 1983 and is leased to Southern Railroad of New Jersey (SRNJ). Long neglected, it is in poor condition and travel speeds are very slow. The line is undergoing upgrades to the rail bed, trackage, a trestle at Oldman's Creek, and other work. At Swedesboro, SRNJ interchanges with Conrail Shared Assets Operations to reach Pavonia Yard, the regional rail center."
"Route 45 and Route 49 provide access to Interstate 295, the New Jersey Turnpike and the nearby Delaware Memorial Bridge. In 2005, the Route 49 bascule bridge built in 1927 over the Salem River was replaced with a fixed bridge that can be converted to a vertical lift bridge and has been dedicated the ""Veteran’s of Salem County Memorial Bridge""."
"The Salem Municipal Port Authority was established in 1982 with the intention to revitalize and coordinate shipping in the port district. In 2005, the Salem City Industrial District Brownfield Development Area was created to spur re-use of brownfields, including numerous properties within and adjacent to the port district, which is located along the southern banks of the river between the Salem River Cut-Off and the Route 49 bridge just outside the downtown area. It encompasses several terminal and wharf facilities for barges and container ships for bulk and break bulk cargo, and shipping containers."
"In 2006, the municipal port authority described the typical container ship making use of the port as carrying 150 containers and taking approximately 12 hours to unload and reload. The ""Bermuda Islander"", a Dutch-flagged container ship, calls regularly at Salem."
= = = Kuha-class minesweeper (1974) = = =
The Kuha class minesweepers () is a series of six inshore minesweepers of the Finnish Navy. The ships were constructed in 1974-1975. All the vessels of the class were modified and modernized in the late 1990s. This included a lengthening of the hull.
"The vessels have a glass fibre hull and are amongst the largest vessels built in this material. They are equipped with hydraulic machinery, and its engines are placed in the aft part of the superstructure. The engines are separated from the hull with rubber springs. The engine power is transferred to the propeller unit (which can turn 360 degrees) through two separate hydraulic valves; in this manner the vessels are as quiet as possible, and it has been possible to completely eliminate propeller axles, which are very difficult to silence and are easily damaged in mine explosions."
"The vessels are very lightly armed with only a twin anti-aircraft gun and a couple of heavy machine guns; ""Kuha 22"" is an exception, as it assumes an anti-aircraft readiness role. It is therefore equipped with a couple more guns than its sister vessels."
"The ""Kuha"" class vessels usually operate together with some vessels of the ""Kiiski"" class, and they can sweep both impact and influence mines."
"The ""Kuha"" class will be retired when the ""Katanpää"" class mine countermeasure vessels enter active service."

"Alejandro Castro Fernández (born 27 February 1979), known as Jandro, is a Spanish footballer who plays as an attacking midfielder."
"He appeared in 331 matches during 11 seasons, scoring a combined 73 goals for Celta, Albacete, Alavés, Gimnàstic, Elche and Girona. In La Liga, other than the first and the third clubs, he also played with Valencia."
"Jandro was born in Mieres, Asturias. A product of Valencia CF's youth system, he played three times for the first team in a three-year span (with a stint at CD Numancia in between, where he did not appear. Subsequently, he had another La Liga spell with RC Celta de Vigo, also featuring sparingly during two seasons and being loaned in between."
"After helping Celta regain its top flight status in 2005, scoring 12 league goals, Jandro moved to Deportivo Alavés also in the top division, being immediately relegated. He signed with Gimnàstic de Tarragona in summer 2007 and, after two second level seasons with the Catalans as first-choice, continued in that tier as he joined Elche CF on a two-year contract."
"On 11 March 2010, after appearing rarely for the club – but netting three times – Jandro was released by mutual consent. In late July he signed with another club in division two, Girona FC, and scored 11 goals while playing in all 42 games (38 starts, nearly 3,500 minutes of action) in his first season, with his team eventually ranking 11th."
"On 25 August 2012, Jandro was named ""Man of the match"" as Girona won 5–1 away against CD Guadalajara, netting once and providing two assists."

= = = 31st Reserve Field Artillery Regiment (Ireland) = = =
"The 31st Reserve Field Artillery Regiment was a field artillery unit of the Southern Brigade Irish Reserve Defence Forces tasked with the defence of part of County Tipperary and also with providing support to the 1st FAR, a unit of the Irish Army."
"The Corps of Artillery of the Irish Army was founded in 1924, and based in Connolly Barracks in the Curragh Camp. The Patron saint of the corps is Saint Barbara, and she appears on the corps insignia sitting astride a cannon. The 31st FAR came into being on 1 October 2005, and was made up of units from the former reserve structure, the FCÁ. The units which were disbanded in order to form the new 31st FAR were the 8th FAR (Cork), 3rd FAR (Tipperary) and part of the 14th Infantry Battalion also from Tipperary."
The 8th FAR was originally formed in Ballincollig in 1979. It was made up of the reserve batteries which had once formed part of the 1st FAR. The regiment consisted of two batteries: 2nd Battery (25 Pounder field guns) and 21st Heavy Mortar Battery (120 mm Mortars). The unit moved to Collins Barracks in Cork City following the closure of Ballincollig Barracks. 2nd Battery and 21st Battery merged to become 1st Battery of the 31st FAR on 1 October 2005.
"The unit had both ceremonial and training commitments, with annual artillery practice held in the Glen of Imaal in Co Wicklow in July of each year. A camp was also held around Easter time which focused on small arms training. Reservists from this unit were often invited to participate in training courses outside the unit, and members also participated in Defence Forces sporting events and shooting competitions, and have won several medals across a variety of events."
"The Pistol Team from 1st Battery was in the forefront of army shooting competitions for some years. In January 2005, members of the 8th FAR (later the 1st Battery) were called upon to take part in a ceremonial 21-gun salute in honour of the City of Cork becoming the European Capital of Culture. Other ceremonial duties have included committing a contingent of reservists to represent the 1st Southern Brigade at the National Day of Remembrance ceremony at Kilmainham. Reservists in the 31st FAR were also trained in Infantry Tactics, Amphibious operations, Fighting in Built Up Areas (FIBUA) and Peace Support Operations."
"The unit used 25 Pounder field guns and L118 and L119 105 mm Light guns. Some smooth-bore Brandt 120 mm heavy mortars were in the unit's possession but this obsolete weapon was later removed from service, while the 25 pounder became an exclusively ceremonial weapon. The unit acquired a number of 120 mm Ruag mortars."

"After John Lennon's murder in December 1980, Starr returned home to England to live at Tittenhurst Park, which Starr had purchased from Lennon in 1973. In early 1982, Starr was eager to move on to his next solo project. Deciding that he needed more consistency this time around, he would work with only one producer, Joe Walsh, a former member of the recently disbanded Eagles. Walsh and Starr had known each other since the mid-1970s, having met and befriended each other in Los Angeles. Walsh immediately agreed to work with Starr and they met at Tittenhurst in February to begin writing material. Recording shortly afterwards begun and instrumental backing tracks for seven songs were recorded at Startling Studios, after Starr had previously converted Lennon's recording studio. Engineering duties were handled by Jim Nipor. These sessions were mainly done with a team consisting of Starr on drums and percussion, Walsh on guitar and backing vocals, Mo Foster on bass and keyboardists Gary Brooker and Chris Stainton."
"Sessions came to a halt when Walsh and Nipor went to California on 19 March. Sessions recommenced on 6 April for a few days until 16 April. On 15 April, ""Rolling Stone"" broke the news that Starr was ""in London working on a new album with Joe Walsh acting as the producer."" Lead vocals were laid down from 19 to 23 April. Sometime in May, Starr requested permission to build a new building on his Tittenhurst Park land, which he would use for video and recording purposes, from Windsor and Maidenhead District Council. Sessions resumed from 31 May until 10 June; the next day, taking the masters recorded up to that point with him, Starr and his wife Barbara Bach fly from London to Los Angeles, and return on 14 June. The album was finished with a third batch of sessions from 24 June into early July."
"""Everybody's in a Hurry But Me"" came about from a jam session between the Who's former bassist, John Entwistle, drummer and percussionist Ray Cooper and also Cream's former guitarist, Eric Clapton. ""As Far as We Can Go"", was originally recorded at Sweet Silence Studios, in Copenhagen, Denmark, on 23 July 1978. From that original rendition, only the vocal was used. Walsh re-recorded an entirely new track utilizing one of the latest technology synthesizers."
"The album was originally titled ""It Beats Sleep"". The portrait on the album cover was shot in a booth in northern England. As Starr's RCA contract had been cancelled, he needed to find a new label for ""Old Wave"". Though it was just over a decade after the Beatles' dissolution, no major UK or US record company was interested in signing him. Starr would not accept that and was determined to have ""Old Wave"" released any way he could. The album was due to be released on the Boardwalk label, but never appeared due to the death of the label's head, Neil Bogart. RCA Canada ended up distributing the album in June 1983 in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, the Netherlands, Mexico, and Brazil; while in Germany, the album and lone single pulled from it, both released on 16 June, appeared on the Bellaphon label. The Canadian release of the album occurred on 24 June. However, ""Old Wave"" failed to achieve success in any of these territories, and would be Starr's last studio album until 1992's ""Time Takes Time"". Two singles were pulled from the album: one in Germany, ""In My Car"", backed with ""As Far as We Can Go"", and the other in Mexico (""I Keep Forgettin'"" b/w ""She's About a Mover"")."
"Walsh's 1987 album ""Got Any Gum?"" included a cover of ""In My Car"", which was released as a single and became a moderate hit. Four tracks from the album appear on Starr's US compilation """" in 1989. The album was reissued on CD, on the same day as ""Stop and Smell the Roses"" (1981), in the US by The Right Stuff on 22 August 1994. A further release, on 6 September, as both CD and cassette deluxe editions, included a bonus track, the original 1978 version of ""As Far as We Can Go"". ""In My Car"" was re-released, this time on yellow vinyl, with ""She's About a Mover"" as the B-side, on The Right Stuff on 1 November 1994. A promotional CD was released in 1994 by Capitol, featuring three songs from both ""Old Wave"" and ""Stop and Smell the Roses""."
Track numbering refers to CD and digital releases of the album.

"The ""Payroll Room"" is how much money in a National Hockey League (NHL) team's salary cap is left to acquire players, whether such players are signed as free agents or join the team via a trade or waivers. The term originated in 2005 with the NHL Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA), which was negotiated following a season-long lockout. The new CBA includes a salary cap (formally titled the ""Upper Limit"" of the ""Payroll Range"" in the agreement). Payroll room is often called cap room in the media."
"A team can increase its cap room if it trades high-salary players to other teams and gets lower-paid players in their place. A team cannot trade its cap room to another team or defer its cap room to subsequent seasons. Other practices once common in the NHL, such as exchanging cash for players or agreeing to pay a portion of a player's remaining salary after trading him, have been explicitly forbidden in the new CBA to try to prevent wealthier teams from evading the restrictions of the cap."
"Knox was the son of William Shadrach Knox Sr and Rebecca Walker, and the grandson of Samuel Knox and Mary Kimbell and Jimmy Walker and Hannah Richardson. Born in Killingly, Connecticut, he moved with his parents to Lawrence, Massachusetts, in 1852; he attended the public schools and Amherst College where he studied the law. He was admitted to the bar in 1866 and commenced practice in Lawrence. In 1874 he became a member of the State house of representatives in 1874 and 1875, and he was city solicitor of Lawrence in 1875, 1876, and 1887-1890. Knox was elected as a Republican to the Fifty-fourth and to the three succeeding Congresses (March 4, 1895 – March 3, 1903). There he served as chairman, in the Committee on Territories (Fifty-fifth through Fifty-seventh Congresses). He was not a candidate for renomination."
"Later, he became president of the Arlington National Bank of Lawrence."

= = = Lead(II) hydroxide = = =
"Lead(II) hydroxide, Pb(OH), is a hydroxide of lead, with lead in oxidation state +2. It is doubtful that such a simple compound exists. Lead basic carbonate (PbCO·2Pb(OH)) or lead(II) oxide (PbO) is encountered in practice where lead hydroxide is expected. This has been a subject of considerable confusion in the past."
"When a hydroxide is added to a solution of a lead(II) salt, a hydrated lead oxide PbO·xHO (with x < 1) is obtained. Careful hydrolysis of lead(II) acetate solution yields a crystalline product with a formula 6PbO·2HO = PbO(OH). This material is a cluster compound, consisting of an octahedron of Pb centers, each face of which is capped by an oxide or a hydroxide. The structure is reminiscent of the MoS subunit of the Chevrel phases."
"In solution, lead(II) hydroxide is a somewhat weak base, forming lead(II) ion, Pb, under weakly acidic conditions. This cation hydrolyzes and, under progressively increasing alkaline conditions, forms Pb(OH), Pb(OH)(aqueous), Pb(OH), and other species, including several polynuclear species, e.g., Pb(OH), Pb(OH), PbO(OH)."
The name Lead hydrate has sometimes been used in the past but it is unclear whether this refers to Pb(OH) or PbO·xHO.

"The White Brotherhood was an urban society (or militia) of Toulouse established in 1211 during the episcopate of Folquet de Marselha, so-called from its members' habit of wearing white crosses on their chests. The society, called a ""pious institution"" by William of Puylaurens, was militant towards usurers (Jews) and Cathars, robbing them and destroying their homes. Most of the Whites came from the city proper. A Black Brotherhood, so-called in opposition to the White, was soon formed and the two factions went to war in the streets of Toulouse. According to Puylaurens:"
"Daily the two parties would clash, banners flying, bristling with weapons, even with cavalry in evidence. Through the agency of His servant the bishop, Our Lord came to bring them, not a bad peace but a good war."
"From the White Brotherhood Folquet selected 500 men-at-arms and sent them to aid the Albigensian Crusade in besieging Lavaur. The bishop even composed pro-Crusade ""sirventes"" for the troops to sing. Count Raymond VII, however, forbade the citizens to go and tried to force Folquet from the city. The White Brotherhood did go, however, and the bishop eventually left as well, to join the siege at Lavaur."
"The White Brotherhood gained notoriety among the opponents of the Crusade. The troubadour Gavaudan wrote the song ""A la plus longa nuech de l'an"" in which he criticises the ""foolish white people"", almost certainly a reference to the Whites of Toulouse."

"In 1948, platforms on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line from 103rd Street to 238th Street were lengthened to 514 feet to allow full ten-car express trains to platform. Previously the stations could only platform six car local trains. The platform extensions were opened in stages. On April 6, 1948, the platform extension opened for stations from 103rd Street to Dyckman Street, with the exception of 125th Street."
"This station, located atop an embankment, has two side platforms, two tracks and maintains a level grade. It lies at the northern portal of the Washington Heights Mine Tunnel, which takes the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line through the bedrock of Manhattan. North of the station, the terrain of Upper Manhattan drops abruptly and the line becomes elevated to Van Cortlandt Park–242nd Street."
"Both platforms have beige windscreens and red canopies with green frames at the center. A waist-level black fence runs along either side. The platforms are offset as the South Ferry-bound one inclines more to the north than the 242nd Street-bound one. Each platform has two ""DYCKMAN ST"" mosaics."
"This is one of only two aboveground Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line stations with two tracks (the other being 242nd Street). A center express track, which is currently unused in revenue service, forms just north of this station and runs nonstop to just south of 242nd Street. A spur track used to be located to the south of the station, but was removed when the platforms were extended."
"The station is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, as is the nearby Substation 17."
"A 1991 artwork in the waiting area is called ""Flight"" by Wopo Holup. It features ceramic relief tiles depicting birds in flight."
"The station's only entrance is a station house slightly above ground level at the southern corner of Nagle Avenue, Dyckman Street, and Hillside Avenue. There is a ramp and stairs from street level to the station house. It has a turnstile bank, token booth, and two staircases to each platform, with an elevator to the southbound platform."
"In February 2014, as part of an ongoing rehabilitation, the MTA built a ramp from street level to the mezzanine and opened an elevator to connect the southbound platform to the mezzanine. The elevator, which was not originally planned in the station renovation, was built due to a lawsuit by the United Spinal Association. The elevator is of a ""machine room-less"" design and is the first of its type to be installed in the New York City Subway system. The renovations also included rehabilitation of the tunnel portal, realignment and rehabilitation of the platforms and installation of new cast iron lighting fixtures."
"The southbound elevator is located at the southwest corner of Hillside Avenue, St. Nicholas Avenue, and Fort George Hill, and is accessible by a ramp to the station house."
"This station is not accessible to the disabled on the northbound side because the suit was settled only after the northbound side was already renovated, and in any case, the area's geography made it prohibitively expensive to add an elevator to the northbound platform. Northbound accessibility was proposed in February 2019 as part of the MTA's ""Fast Forward"" program."

"Acton was born and raised in Coleridge, Cambridge, England. Without any sailing experience, he departed in a used 18' 4"" bilge-keel sailing boat for which he paid the modest sum of £400. The boat was a Caprice, a Robert Tucker design originally named ""Super Shrimp"" but referred to by Shane simply as ""Shrimpy"". Later Shane was accompanied for much of the voyage by his girlfriend, Iris Derungs, a photographer from Switzerland. He sailed westabout through the Panama Canal, circling the globe and returning to England as a local celebrity eight years later.

Ruddy was the second-round draft choice (65th overall) of Miami in 1994. Ruddy started 140 games of his 156 games played in which 16 of those non starts were his rookie year but he saw time in all of them. During most of his career he was the center for Dan Marino who has held almost every meaningful NFL passing record and is widely recognized as one of the greatest quarterbacks in football history.
"In 2001 Ruddy was named to his first and only Pro Bowl. He was originally named a second alternate, but replaced the injured Tom Nalen of the Denver Broncos. He was the first Miami center to be selected to the Pro Bowl since Hall of Fame center Dwight Stephenson in 1987. The last few years of Ruddy's career were plagued with knee problems and his playing time was limited. Ruddy was released by Miami following the 2003 season. It was rumored he talked to a few teams after his departure from Miami but didn't sign with any team."

"Itbāy () or ʿAtbāy is a region of southeastern Egypt and northeastern Sudan. It is characterised by a chain of mountains, the Red Sea Hills, running north–south and parallel with the Red Sea. The hills separate the narrow coastal plain from the Eastern Desert."
"The Red Sea Hills are composed of the exposed Neoproterozoic volcano-sedimentary rock of the Arabian-Nubian Shield. Although the rock itself is 550–900 million years old, the mountains were created by uplift when the Red Sea itself was formed in the Oligocene, only some 23–34 million years ago. The Red Sea Hills are thus part of the same formation as the Sarawat Mountains of Saudi Arabia and the mountains of the Sinai Peninsula. The Red Sea Hills rise almost to today, but in the past were much higher. The Oligocene uplift caused the rejuvenation of their streams and the increased erosion removed most of the limestone and sandstone to expose the basement layer."
"The Itbāy is arid, receiving less than of rainfall each year with high variability. The Barka River, the most significant of the few seasonal streams that flow into the Red Sea, rises in the Red Sea Hills of Sudan and empties into the sea at the Tokar Delta. In prehistorica times it was probably a permanent river."
"The Red Sea Hills are a source of porphyry, which was being mined as early as the fourth millennium BC."
"The Red Sea Hills are inhabited by the Beja people, who practice pastoralism and live mainly near the dry riverbeds, ""wādī""s, that flow seasonally into the sea and the Nile, where there is limited vegetation. In antiquity, the Beja were known as the Blemmyes and their presence in the hills is detected archaeologically by the presence of Eastern Desert Ware from the fourth century AD. The material culture of the hills places it firmly within ancient Egypt's sphere of influence. Extensive mining settlements have been found in the Wadi Allaqi and the Wadi Gabgaba. The early Blemmyes built platform tumuli (flat-topped burial mounds), and the appearance of cairns to mark burials in the late Middle Ages may be linked to Islamization."

= = = Itinerarium = = =
"An itinerarium (plural: itineraria) was an Ancient Roman road map in the form of a listing of cities, villages (""vici"") and other stops, with the intervening distances. One surviving example is the Peutinger Table (""Tabula Peutingeriana""); another is the Antonine Itinerary."
"The Romans and ancient travelers in general did not use maps. They may have existed as specialty items in some of the libraries, but they were hard to copy and were not in general use. On the Roman road system, however, the traveller needed some idea of where he or she was going, how to get there, and how long it would take. The ""itinerarium"" filled this need. In origin it was simply a list of cities along a road: ""at their most basic, ""itineraria"" involve the transposition of information given on milestones, which were an integral feature of the major Roman roads, to a written script."" It was only a short step from lists to a master list. To sort out the lists, the Romans drew diagrams of parallel lines showing the branches of the roads. Parts of these were copied and sold on the streets. The very best featured symbols for cities, way stations, water courses, and so on. The maps did not represent landforms but they served the purpose of a simple schematic diagram for the user."
"The Roman government from time to time undertook to produce a master itinerary of all Roman roads. Julius Caesar and Mark Antony commissioned the first known such effort in 44 BC. Zenodoxus, Theodotus, and Polyclitus, three Greek geographers, were hired to survey the system and compile a master itinerary. This task required over 25 years. The result was a stone engraved master ""itinerarium"" set up near the Pantheon, from which travelers and itinerary sellers could make copies."
"Archaeology has turned up some itinerary material in unexpected places. The Cups of Cadiz, four silver cups found by workmen excavating a foundation at Bracciano in 1852, are engraved with the names and distances of stations between Cadiz and Rome. The term itinerary changed meaning over the centuries. In the ""Itinerarium Burdigalense"" (Bordeaux Pilgrim, 333 AD), the itinerary is a description of what route to take to the Holy Land. The ""Itinerarium Alexandri"" is a list of the conquests of Alexander the Great. Today it means either a travel journal or a list of recommended stops."
"WTIX-FM is an oldies outlet serving the New Orleans area. The station is owned by Michael A. ""Michael In The Morning"" Costello (under the name Fleur de Lis Broadcasting) and operates at 94.3 MHz with an ERP of 100 kW. Its city of license is Galliano, Louisiana. Its studios are in Metairie and its transmitter is in St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana."
"Costello was program director at WRNO-FM from 1976 to 1991 and also hosted the morning show as ""Michael In The Morning"" (M&M). Additionally, he hosted the Sunday night edition of ""The Rock 'N'Roll Hall Of Fame"". He then acquired the former KLEB-FM from the Harold Callais family which was a country music outlet in 1995 and flipped it to its current oldies format. The station is modeled after the original Top 40 AM station WTIX, which was a very successful Top 40 outlet in New Orleans from the 1950s through the 1970s. He increased the transmitted power and moved the antenna from its original location to its present location in 1998 to better serve the New Orleans metro area. Mike Costello also handles GM, PD, and also hosts the morning show. Many of the jingles used on WTIX-FM are the originals used by WTIX/690 in the 1960s and 1970s. WTIX-FM also adapts a time-honored feature from the old WTIX: the ""Chime Time"", wherein a chime rang whenever jocks gave the time on the air. (Coincidentally, ""Chime Time"" was also the staple of Musicradio WABC in its heyday.)"
"WTIX-FM's format, Oldies, is patterned after half of WTIX's late-1980s hybrid Talk/Oldies format (before the latter switched to All-Talk in 1988). Three of the WTIX-FM disc jockeys, ""Hot"" Rod Glenn, Bobby Reno, and Terry Knight, also had very minor and short-term ties to the original WTIX. Terry Knight left the station several years ago."

"As an extension to the problem, consider the case where the player is allowed to look in Envelope A before deciding whether to switch. In this ""conditional switching"" problem, it is often possible to generate a gain over the ""never switching"" strategy"", depending on the probability distribution of the envelopes."
"The envelope paradox dates back at least to 1953, when Belgian mathematician Maurice Kraitchik proposed a puzzle in his book ""Recreational Mathematics"""
"concerning two equally rich men who meet and compare their beautiful neckties, presents from their wives, wondering which tie actually cost more money. He also introduces a variant in which the two men compare the contents of their purses. He assumes that each purse is equally likely to contain 1 up to some large number ""x"" of pennies, the total number of pennies minted to date. The men do not look in their purses but each reasons that they should switch. He does not explain what is the error in their reasoning. It is not clear whether the puzzle already appeared in an earlier 1942 edition of his book. It is also mentioned in a 1953 book on elementary mathematics and mathematical puzzles by the mathematician John Edensor Littlewood, who credited it to the physicist Erwin Schroedinger, where it concerns a pack of cards, each card has two numbers written on it, the player gets to see a random side of a random card, and the question is whether one should turn over the card. Littlewood's pack of cards is infinitely large and his paradox is a paradox of improper prior distributions."
"Martin Gardner popularized Kraitchik's puzzle in his 1982 book ""Aha! Gotcha"", in the form of a wallet game:"

The first paper just presents the two problems. The second discusses many solutions to both of them. The second of his two problems is nowadays the more common, and is presented in this article. According to this version, the two envelopes are filled first, then one is chosen at random and called Envelope A. Martin Gardner independently mentioned this same version in his 1989 book ""Penrose Tiles to Trapdoor Ciphers and the Return of Dr Matrix"". Barry Nalebuff's asymmetric variant, often known as the Ali Baba problem, has one envelope filled first, called Envelope A, and given to Ali. Then a fair coin is tossed to decide whether Envelope B should contain half or twice that amount, and only then given to Baba."

"Mitsubishi MCA stands for Mitsubishi Clean Air, a moniker used in Japan to identify vehicles built with emission control technology. The term was first introduced in Japan, with later introductions internationally. The technology first appeared in January 1973 on the Mitsubishi 4G32A gasoline-powered inline four cylinder engine installed in all Mitsubishi vehicles using the 4G32 engine, and the Saturn-6 6G34 six-cylinder gasoline-powered engine installed in the Mitsubishi Debonair. The technology was installed so that their vehicles would be in compliance with Japanese Government emission regulations passed in 1968."
"Emission reducing technology began with the installation of a positive crankcase ventilation (PCV) valve (MCA-I), followed by the addition of a thermo reactor air pump and catalytic converter in addition to an exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) valve (MCA-II) and a solenoid controlled automatic choke installed on the carburetor."
"The MCA-Jet system has a small third valve separate from the intake and exhaust valves. Separate passages in the intake manifold feed each MCA-Jet valve. Since these passages are smaller than the main intake manifold passages, the air/fuel mixture must move faster. When the faster moving air/fuel mixture from the MCA-Jet valve hits the slower moving air/fuel mixture from the intake valve, a strong air swirling effect occurs that promotes more complete combustion. With MCA-Jet it was found that stable combustion could be obtained even with large amounts of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), NOx could be reduced, and combustion improved. Honda's CVCC Stratified charge engine approach also used a small third valve, but sent a richer air/fuel mixture to a small pre-combustion chamber near the spark plug, to help ignite a leaner air/fuel mixture in the main combustion chamber. MCA-Jet was a simpler system that sent the same air/fuel mixture to all intake and MCA-Jet valves. Each MCA-Jet valve is quite small and may be prone to carbon build-up, causing the MCA-Jet valve(s) to stick open. If a Mitsubishi-designed engine has low compression, the MCA-Jet valve(s) could be the cause. Each MCA-Jet valve and valve seat are a self-contained cylinder-shaped unit that screws into the cylinder head for easy replacement. Aftermarket MCA-Jet valves are available. With the advent of 4-valve-per-cylinder engines, manufacturers typically design the camshaft(s) to open one intake valve slightly before the other to create a swirling effect. This has made the MCA-Jet system obsolete. The MCA-Jet system was used in certain Mitsubishi-designed engines installed in both Mitsubishi-branded and Chrysler/Dodge/Plymouth-branded vehicles during the late 1970s to late 1980s."

"Tracey Lee Wickham (born 24 November 1962 in Rosebud, Victoria) is an Australian former middle distance swimmer. Wickham was the World Champion for the 400 m and 800 m freestyle in 1978, and won gold in both events at the 1978 and 1982 Commonwealth Games. She is a former world record holder for the 400 m, 800 m and 1500 m freestyle. Despite her success in the pool, Wickham has battled hardship and personal tragedy throughout her life."
"Wickham began swimming at the age of eight at John Rigby’s pool in Brisbane and mastered her technique under the guidance of Peter Diamond. At the age of thirteen, she was selected to be on the Australian team for the 1976 Montreal Olympic Games but failed to reach the finals at that meet."
"In 1977, Wickham’s family moved to California, where she trained for six months with coaching legend Mark Schubert. She returned to Brisbane at the end of 1977 and she came under the guidance of coach Bill Sweetenham at the Commercial Swimming Club. On 8 February 1978, Wickham broke her first world record, the 1500 m freestyle, in a solo swim at the Fortitude Valley Pool in Brisbane, clocking 16:14.93."
"At the 1978 Commonwealth Games in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, Wickham won both the 400 m and 800 m freestyle. That same year, she set world records in both events, and won both the 400 m and 800 m freestyle at the 1978 Berlin World Championships, setting a world 400 m record of 4.06.28, which stood as the Championship record until 2007. Both world records stood until 1987, long after her retirement."
"In 1980, Australia decided against an official boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics. A number of Australian athletes elected to boycott the Games personally. Wickham maintains that she withdrew from the team because of illness, as she was suffering glandular fever at the time, not because of the boycott. The 800 m freestyle was won by fellow Australian Michelle Ford at that meet."
"Wickham retired at the end of 1979 due to financial problems. The policy of amateurism was upheld by the Amateur Swimming Union of Australia during this period, meaning Wickham could neither earn money from the sport nor receive any prizes."
"Wickham returned to swimming in the early 1980s under coach Laurie Lawrence. She won gold in the 400 m and 800 m freestyle at the 1982 Commonwealth Games, where she took the Athletes Oath at the Opening Ceremony. Her gold medal for the 400 m was presented to her by Queen Elizabeth II and Wickham retired from swimming immediately afterwards."
"Following the birth of her daughter, Wickham dived back into the water in May 1990, again with Lawrence as her coach. She competed in the 7.6 km open water race from Magnetic Island to Townsville, placing first in the female division. She also won the female division of the Lake Trasimeno 20 km marathon race. She retired for good following the birth of her son in January 1992."
"She was educated at the All Hallows' School, in Brisbane along with her sisters Julie and Kelly. Wickham married in 1986 and had two children, Daniel and Hannah. She divorced her husband in the mid-1990s."
"Her daughter, Hannah, died at the age of nineteen from synovial sarcoma on 2 October 2007. Wickham is an ambassador for Hannah’s Chance Foundation, which supports teenage cancer victims."
"On 30 December 1978, Wickham was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire."
"On 10 December 1985, she was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame, and was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame at Fort Lauderdale in 1992."
"On 25 October 2000, she was awarded the Australian Sports Medal for outstanding contribution as a competitor in swimming."

= = = Tarr = = =
"Tarr is a modernist novel by Wyndham Lewis, written in 1909–11, revised and expanded in 1914–15 and first serialized in the magazine ""The Egoist"" from April 1916 until November 1917. The American version was published in 1918, with an English edition published by the Egoist Press appearing shortly afterwards; Lewis later created a revised and final version published by Chatto and Windus in 1928. Set in the bohemian milieu of pre-war Paris, it presents two artists, the Englishman Tarr and the German Kreisler, and their struggles with money, women and social situations. The novel abounds in somewhat Nietzschean themes. Tarr, generally thought to be modelled on Lewis himself, displays disdain for the 'bourgeois-bohemians' around him, and vows to 'throw off humour' which he regards—especially in its English form—as a 'means of evading reality' unsuited to ambition and the modern world. This self-conscious attitude and the situations that it brings about are a major source of the novel's pervasive dark humour. Lewis will later clarify that there ""is laughter and laughter. That of true satire is as it were tragic laughter"". Kreisler, a violent German Romantic of protean energy and a failure as an artist, is in many ways the focus of the novel. An indication of the extremity of his vivid portrait is Lewis' own wondering several years later if he had, in Kreisler, anticipated the personality of Hitler."
"The American first edition used a punctuation mark (resembling an equals sign: '=') between sentences (after full stops, exclamation marks or question marks; in the earlier ""Egoist"" version it had been an m-dash). It has been claimed that these were an attempt by Lewis, an artist, to introduce 'painterly strokes' into literature. This has, however, been disputed by Dr. John Constable, who believes that they are nothing more than a German punctuation mark briefly adopted by Lewis. Lewis himself wrote to Ezra Pound about this when reconstructing missing parts of the manuscript for the U.S. edition: ""Were those parallel lines = Quinn mentions kept going by the Egoist, or not? Could not they be disinterred, & used by Knopf?"" (Lewis to Pound, October 1917). Evidently not all were disinterred, as large stretches of the book as published are without them."
"Both the 1918 and 1928 versions of the novel have been in and out of print since its original publication. Oxford University Press has reissued the 1928 text, edited and with notes by Scott W. Klein of Wake Forest University, as part of its Oxford World Classics paperback series in 2010."

Albelin was drafted 152nd overall by Quebec in the 1983 NHL Entry Draft. Before joining the club he played five seasons for Djurgårdens IF in the Swedish Elitserien, winning the Swedish championship in his first year (1982–83). Albelin left for Quebec upon the conclusion of the 1986-87 season. He played a year and a half for the Nordiques before being traded to New Jersey. It would be with the Devils that he would play 10 seasons for and win two Stanley Cups, in 1995 and 2003. In 1996, he was traded to Calgary, but he signed to play with New Jersey again in 2001. His best season was the 1988–89 season when he put up 37 points. Albelin announced his retirement from hockey on 29 July 2004, however the Devils re-signed him in December 2005 (abbreviating his retirement after he had practiced with the team as an unsigned player for nearly half the season). He finished out his final year in 2006 playing for the Devils."
"On 25 July 2007, Albelin was hired by the New Jersey Devils as an assistant coach to head coach Brent Sutter. It was his first NHL coaching job."
"On 10 August 2010, Albelin was named assistant coach of the Albany Devils, the AHL affiliate of the New Jersey Devils. On 9 September 2014, following Scott Stevens' decision to step down from a coaching position in New Jersey, Albelin was promoted to be an assistant coach under Peter DeBoer in the 2014-15 season."
"In July 2016, he was appointed as assistant coach of the Swiss men's national team."
= = = Witteric = = =
"Witteric (; Portuguese and Galician: ""Viterico""; 565 – April 610) was the Visigoth King of Hispania, Septimania and Galicia. He ruled from 603 to 610."
"The first mention of Witteric in history was as a conspirator with Sunna, the Arian bishop of Mérida, to reestablish Arianism in 589. While Sunna was sent into exile, it is unknown what happened to Witteric. In the spring of 602, Witteric was given command of the army with the job of expelling the Byzantines. However, when it came time to do so in the Spring of 603, Witteric instead led his troops against King Liuva II, counting on the support of a faction of nobles in opposition to the dynasty of Leovigild. He invaded the royal palace and deposed the young king. Witteric cut off the king's right hand, and then had him condemned and executed in the Summer of 603."
"During his reign, the Visigoths fought the Byzantines. However, Isidore of Seville is dismissive of Witteric's accomplishments, writing that ""although he frequently fought battles against the Roman soldiers, he did not win any adequate glory except for capturing some soldiers at Sagunto with the help of his generals."" The campaign against Sagunto probably took place in 605. It was probably during his reign, as well, that Bigastrum (near Cartago Nova) was taken, as its bishop appears in a council of Toledo in 610."
"In the twelfth year of his reign, king Theodoric II sent for bishop Aridius of Lyons and the constable Eborin to ask Witteric for his daughter Ermenburga's hand in marriage. Although the envoys gave their word that she would not be disowned by Theodoric, and she was received by Theodoric in Chalon-sur-Saône (606), his grandmother, the regent Brunhilda and Theodoric's sister Teudila (or Teudilana) did not provide a welcoming reception. Theodoric then disgraced Ermenberga by sending her back without her dowry. Incensed, Witteric entered into a quadruple alliance with Theodobert II of Austrasia, Clotaire II of Neustria, and Agilulf of the Lombards to effect his deposition and death. Despite their mutual fear of Theodoric, their alliance did not accomplish anything; according to Fredegar, ""Theodoric got wind of it [the alliance] but treated it with utter contempt.""."
"In April 610, a faction of Catholic nobles conspired against Witteric and assassinated him during a banquet. His body was dragged ignominiously through the streets and he was later buried without the honors corresponding to his status. The nobles then proclaimed Gundemar, Duke of Narbonne, king."

"Machine is the second EP by the indie rock band Yeah Yeah Yeahs. It was released in 2002 by Touch and Go Records, and contains three songs from the ""Fever to Tell"" sessions. From this EP came one single, ""Machine"", which was released only in the UK. As of 2009, sales in the United States have exceeded 24,000 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan ."
= = = Proteus (2003 film) = = =
"Proteus is a film by Canadian director John Greyson. Although the film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2003, it did not have a general theatrical release until 2005."
The film is based on an early 18th century court record from Cape Town.
"The film also attempts to explore unanswered questions, such as why prison officials tolerated the relationship for a full decade before Blank and Jacobsz were executed. (In an interview packaged with the DVD release, John Greyson notes the real Blank and Jacobsz began their relationship when they were very young - Blank having been imprisoned on Robben Island at age 16 - and were actually known to be a couple for twenty years before they were charged with sodomy and executed, when they were both nearly 40.) Intentional anachronisms - such as transistor radios, electric typewriters and jeeps - are also used in the film to illustrate Greyson's larger theme that homophobia and racism of the type that led to Blank's and Jacobsz' executions are still very much present in today's world. These twentieth-century objects, including modern (c. 1964) dress on many occasions, are invariably presented in juxtaposition with eighteenth-century items. The eighteenth-century prison commandant, for example, is replaced by a former subordinate, who wears a twentieth-century guard's uniform and is often accompanied by a fierce-looking Alsatian on a short lead. A 'wetbag' is seen, as it was used as a torture devise in Apartheid South Africa."
"An extract from the speech Nelson Mandela made at his sentencing hearing in 1964, before he was imprisoned on Robben Island, is displayed at the end of the film."
"The Italy national cricket team is the team that represents the country of Italy in international cricket. They have been an associate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) since 1995, having previously been an affiliate member since 1984. The Italian national cricket team is administered by the Federazione Cricket Italiana (Italian Cricket Federation)."
"In April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Italy and other ICC members after 1 January 2019 will be a full T20I. Italy played their first T20I against Germany in May 2019. From August 2019, Italy will play in the 2019–21 ICC Cricket World Cup Challenge League."
"The earliest mention of cricket in Italy is of a match played by Captain Morgan's sailors in Bayside, NY in 1793 during a stop in Naples harbour. Around the end of the 19th century, several combined cricket and association football clubs formed, including the world-famous A.C. Milan, which was originally the ""Milan Cricket and Football Club"" and the first Italian football team Genoa Cricket and Football Club, which was originally the ""Genoa Cricket & Athletic Club"". But these clubs soon forgot about cricket and concentrated on football. Cricket started to be revived after the Second World War."
"The ""Federazione Cricket Italiana"" (Italian Cricket Federation) was formed in 1980, and they became an affiliate member of the ICC in 1984, and were promoted to associate member in 1995."
"In 1996, Italy took part in the first European Championship in Denmark, finishing seventh after beating Israel in a play-off. They took part in the ICC Trophy for the first time in the 1997 tournament and performed poorly, finishing joint last out of the 22 participants. They finished fifth in the following years European Championship."
"In 1999, Italy took part in a quadrangular tournament in Gibraltar also featuring France and Israel. They won the tournament, beating the hosts in the final. They finished fifth in Division One of the European Championship the following year and were due to participate in the 2001 ICC Trophy, but pulled out at the last minute due to a dispute over the eligibility of four players."
"The 2002 European Championship saw Italy finish sixth in Division One, relegating them to Division Two for 2004, which they promptly won. This qualified them for the repêchage tournament for the 2005 ICC Trophy in early 2005 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. They finished seventh in that tournament after beating Zambia in a play-off."
"They took part in Division One of the European Championship in 2006, finishing fifth. In May/June 2007, they travelled to Darwin, Australia to take part in Division Three of the World Cricket League. They finished seventh after beating Fiji in a play-off, and played in Division Four of the World Cricket League in 2008 to come 3rd and remained in 2010 ICC World Cricket League Division Four. They came 2nd there to be promoted to 2011 ICC World Cricket League Division Three, where they came 4th to remain in 2013 ICC World Cricket League Division Three. They have a chance of reaching the 2015 Cricket World Cup, if it finishes in the top two in the 2013 ICC World Cricket League Division Three, and then in the top two of the 2013 Cricket World Cup Qualifier. An encouraging start to this tournament has witnessed wins over Oman (9 wickets) and United States (8 runs), followed by defeats, narrowly to Ireland (2 wickets) and more comprehensively against Kenya (7 wickets). After finishing last in this tournament they will be relegated to Division Four in 2014"
"In November 2013 they competed in the 2013 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier in the U.A.E their highest level of competition to date. They finished 9th place with victories over the USA, and higher ranked opponents in U.A.E and Namibia."
"In September 2018, Italy qualified from Group B of the 2018–19 ICC World Twenty20 Europe Qualifier to the Regional Finals of the tournament."
Italy's squad for the 2018–19 ICC World Twenty20 Europe Qualifier in August 2018 were the following players:
"Other players, who were part of Italy's squad at the 2017 ICC World Cricket League Division Five."
Gareth Berg was chosen for European T20 World Cup Qualifier in 2019 but removed from the squad by Hampshire due to a fixture clash.

= = = Joe Cesare Colombo = = =
"Joe Colombo, born Cesare Colombo (30 July 1930 – 30 July 1971) was an Italian industrial designer."
"Cesare ""Joe"" Colombo was until 1949 educated at the Accademia di Belle Arti di Brera, the academy of fine arts, in Milano as a painter and studied afterwards until 1954 Architecture at Politecnico di Milano University."
"In 1951 he joined the ""Movimento Nucleare"", founded by Sergio D´Angelo and Enrico Baj. The following four years Colombo was active as a painter and sculptor of the abstract Expressionism and exhibited his works with other members in Milano, Torino, Verviers, Venice and Brussels."
"In 1955 Colombo joined the Art Concret group, but gave up his painting to promote his Design Career. Before he cooperated at an exhibition for the tenth Triennale of 1954 and documented the Ceramic Designs of an international meeting in Albisola. For his presentation Colombo created for example three exterior seatings which were combined with a ""shrinelike"" presentation of TVs."
"In 1959, Colombo had to take over the family company, which produced electric appliances, and started to experiment with new construction and production technologies. In 1962 Colombo opened his own interior design and architecture projects, mostly for lodges and skiing."
"Colombo designed products for Oluce, Kartell, Bieffe, Alessi, Flexform and Boffi."
Colombo died in 1971 on his 41st birthday.
"Together with his brother Gianni, Colombo developed the idea of prismatic lamps like the lamp ""Acrilica""(1962). His first design for Kartell was the chair ""No.4801"" (1963–1967) which consisted of three assembled plywood elements. The flowing elements of his chair were a foretaste of his later plastic designs, like the chair ""universale No.4860"" (1965–1967), which was the first seating for adults made of ABS."
"Moreover, Colombo produced innovative designs for furniture, lamps, glass, doorknobs, pipes, alarm clocks, and wristwatches. He created the professional camera ""Trisystem"" (1969), the air conditioner ""Candy"" (1970), dinnerware for Alitalia (1970; still in use), as well as an ergonomic and engined printing table."
"Since the beginning of his career Colombo was most interested in living systems. His early modular container ""Combi-Centre"" of 1963 is an example for that. This preference for furniture systems led to designs like ""Additional Living System"" (1967–1968) and the chairs ""Tube"" (1969–1970) and ""Multi"" (1970), which could be assembled in various positions to get a great number of sitting positions."
"Tanenbaum's involvement in community associations includes the following: vice chair of Sinai Health System; co-chair of the Research Committee for the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute; vice-chair, Brain Canada; member, University Council, Cornell University; Honourary Board Member, Baycrest Centre for Geriatric Care; member of the advisory board, Montreal Neurological Institute; co-founder and board member, Tanenbaum Open Science Institute at MNI; member, Dean's advisory council, Schulich School of Business, York University; founding board member, executive committee member and member of the Global Leadership Council of Right to Play; founding member, Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs; and co-chair, Tomorrow Campaign (UJA)."
Tanenbaum is married and has two daughters and one son.
"In recognition of his contributions in the areas of philanthropy, volunteerism and sports, Tanenbaum was appointed an Officer of the Order of Canada on October 25, 2007."
"In June 2012, he was awarded an honorary degree of Doctor of Laws, by St. Michael's College at the University of Toronto."
= = = Phileine Says Sorry = = =
"Phileine Says Sorry () is a Dutch/American 2003 comedy-drama film directed by Robert Jan Westdijk. It is based on the novel ""Phileine zegt sorry"" by Ronald Giphart."
"The story is about Phileine (Kim van Kooten) and her actor boyfriend Max (Michiel Huisman). He goes to New York City to improve his acting skills. Later on, without Max knowing it, Phileine also travels to New York."
"On the plane, she meets an American couple, Fabian and Lena, who offer to bring her to Max's house. Fabian gives Phileine his phone number to call him during her stay for a tour. Inside Max's house, Phileine meets his friends: the bespectacled Jules, the sick Leonard, the Flemish Gulpje, the terrible Joanna and weatherman LT (Louis Theodore). That same evening, a welcome party is held, but because of all the new impressions, drinks, and fatigue, Phileine goes to bed early."
"In the morning, she finds a note from Max that he had to leave early for rehearsal but that the two of them will have dinner together in the evening. Phileine goes to the living room and meets Gulpje. Soon, they decide to be best friends and have lunch. After lunch, Phileine calls Fabian for a tour. During that tour, Fabian gets a little bit too personal so she reminds him that he has a wife."
"Max can’t make it to diner because his rehearsal runs out. Phileine spends that night with the friends of Max. Together with Gulpje, she stirs the group up because they both like to joke around at the expense of others."
"On day two, Phileine attends the premiere of Romeo and Juliet. The play shows the sexual side of society, so it is played naked and shows sex and masturbation scenes. Part of the audience is so shocked that after the break, they call out their displeasure and leave the theater. Phileine is astonished but remains still in her seat until the end."
"At the after party, she tries to obtain explanations about what had happened on stage. She asks Max and the director Reginald, but neither gives her an answer. She quarrels with Max but settles the matter later in a pub. The next day, she goes with Gulpje to the restaurant where the scene from “When Harry Met Sally"" was filmed. Phileine and Gulpje get the attention of two men and they invite them to their table. They want to show off their tricks and begin gently with panting and moaning. Initially the men find it funny, but when Phileine and Gulpje start screaming, the whole thing gets embarrassing and they run out the restaurant."
"A little later the women run into Jules and start a conversation about sexual harassment from men. After an insulting remark by Phileine, Jules departs. Only then does she discover that Jules is not female but male. Phileine goes to meet LT, the boyfriend of 'terrible Joanna', on his boat on the water. They have sex in 'revenge' for the escapade between Joanna and Max on stage."
"The next day, they decide to go to the last performance of the show. From the back of the theater, they see that Max is about to penetrate Joanna on stage. This time, Phileine will not let this happen and makes a huge scene by disrupting the play. Max tries to defend his action by explaining it as art. Phileine doesn’t accept this and gets the audience on her side in the argument."
"The day after, the newspapers are filled with what happened in the theater and Phileine is requested for a number of TV shows. She goes to David Letterman's show where she takes control over the show and wins the support of the audience. She is provided with money so she can stay the night in a hotel. The next day, Max is at her door to take her to an AIDS Gala of his friend Leonard. She doesn’t want to go with him, so he lifts her up over his shoulder and takes her to a taxi."
"The atmosphere between Phileine and the other people is hostile at the Gala. Except for Gulpje, Phileine has offended everybody else. Even Max is furious at her because he finds out she has slept with LT. Eventually Phileine realizes why everyone is mad at her. She gets on the stage and delivers a speech in which she says sorry for the first time in her life to everyone who she has treated rudely. She ends the speech with: ""Sorry that I exist."""
= = = Liuva II = = =
"Liuva II, ( 584 – June/July 603), youthful son of Reccared, was Visigothic King of Hispania, Septimania and Galicia from 601 to 603. He succeeded Reccared at only eighteen years of age."
"In the spring of 602, the Goth Witteric, one of the conspirators with Sunna de Mérida to reestablish Arianism in 589, was given command of the army to repulse the Byzantines. From his position of power at the head of the army, he surrounded himself with people in his confidence.

= = = William Howard Taft National Historic Site = = =
"William Howard Taft National Historic Site is a historic house at 2038 Auburn Avenue in the Mount Auburn Historic District of Cincinnati, Ohio, a mile (1.6 km) north of Downtown. It was the birthplace and childhood home of William Howard Taft, the 27th President of the United States and the 10th Chief Justice of the United States. The two-story Greek Revival house, built circa 1835, is a reminder of the elegant era when wealthier people here could escape the dirt, heat, smoke and crowded conditions of the lower city."
"William Howard Taft's father, Alphonso Taft, came to Cincinnati from Vermont in 1838 to establish a law practice. He moved his family to this house a little over a decade later. Alphonso Taft became an early supporter of the Republican Party in Cincinnati. He lived in this house with his family and parents. He would eventually serve as the 31st United States Secretary of War and the 35th United States Attorney General."
"The house is believed to have been built in the early 1840s by a family named Bowen. Alphonso bought the house at 60 Auburn Street (now 2038 Auburn Avenue), with its accompanying 1.82 acres, for $10,000 on June 13, 1851. Mount Auburn was once a popular area to live for upper-class Cincinnatians, as it allowed those of higher incomes to escape the sweltering heat and humidity of downtown Cincinnati summers. The Taft residence, a Greek Revival domicile, was relatively modest compared to other nearby residences, which were a mix of Second Empire, Italianate, and Georgian Revival."
"Alphonso's wife Fanny Phelps Taft died a year after the family moved to the Mount Auburn residence, in June 1852. In December 1853 Alphonso remarried, choosing a schoolteacher from Massachusetts named Louise Torrey. Louise Taft would give birth to their second child, William Howard Taft, in the house on September 15, 1857, presumably in the first-floor nursery in the rear ell. (The first child had died at age fourteen months from whooping cough.) Alphonso had six children living in the house, two by Fanny (three others had died beforehand) and four by Louise."
"The house was used for social events. Visitors included many local and state dignitaries, including future President James A. Garfield. Rugs in the parlor were often rolled up for dancing. Family activities took place in the library; Alphonso was an avid book collector."
"William would live in the house until he went to Yale University in 1874. Afterward, the Taft family would spend less time in the house, starting when Alphonso served in the Ulysses S. Grant administration. In 1877 a fire damaged the second floor and roof. Alphonso and Louise would lease the house in 1889, moving to California because the climate was thought to be beneficial for those with declining health. William had married in 1886, and the rest of the Taft sons had moved out by this point as well. In May 1891 Alphonso died in San Diego, California, and was buried in Cincinnati; the tenants of the Auburn house allowed the mourners to gather at the house for the funeral. Louise eventually was able to sell the house outright, after ten years of trying, in 1899 to Judge Albert C. Thompson, after returning to her home town of Millbury, Massachusetts, to live with her sister."
