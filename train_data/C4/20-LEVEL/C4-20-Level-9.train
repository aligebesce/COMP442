"If they can't accept it, dunno, who ca who can  what would John Major have said?"
Who's John Major?
"The Prime Minister, you dope!"
Typical woman!!

She's starting to call the wedding off.

"and then I spoke to the feller, said aye!"
Is that the union?
It's supposed
It's something there  in a magazine the other week there.
Found something wrong with his
"What animals do, like and what it means."
he said they just  do.
And they were saying that  when they lick each others
Yeah  what does that
you know?
Apparently
it's the  the one who's doing the
licking is looking at the
But they tell you

it means
is the turn
I thought  now erm  sort of
That just proves what you already know.
"Right dad, I'll show you something else."
No.
I was going to do more
"But I wa I want to show you something, that's all."
Go on then.
"Nine, fifty six  square root."
Er
Who taught you that?
"Well, I lis no one."
It's Mrs  said to Mark
Just a minute.
"he, he, he was getting the  controls wrong."
He pressed square root instead of equals .
Yes.
And so you've discovered
Eh!
"the square root of ninety six is nine point seven nine, seven nine, five, eight nine."
But do you know what square root means?
What?
Well the square root of a number
Yes.
is the number which if multiplied by itself
Yes.
gives you back the number you started with.
"Take, for , the easiest one is  four."
The square root of four is two.
Try it on your machine.
Right.
What do I press?
"Four  four, square root  and it gives you two."
Because two times two  gives you four.
Forget about it Nick!

Shut up!

Urgh!

"I think  Jean said, well she watched the others do it."
They only did like erm  a square foot every time.
"Erm you have to do, put it on  and then design it."
And then move over to the next square.
"Put it on, design it  she said because it dries very quickly."
Mm.
It's only like a plaster of paris stuff isn't it?
It does go off quick.
Mm that's right.
Quick.
She said it's er  about ten pound a tub but I don't know how far a tub would go?
Not very far.
Mm.
"And then she said there was stuff called textured paint  that has, it's like paint with lumps in it."
I think it's just lumpy paint gone wrong and then  and they sell it.
"But then she said you get erm  you put it on and you get a brush and er not a brush, a roller."
"And the roller has  a design, a line on it."
Different designs.
That's right yeah.
And then you just roll it on.
Mm.
"Mind you , we won't be going up into, up into to thing until later."
Will we?
"Yes, but I want to send it from town."
"You know, er, we finish work go into the post office and get the  reply stamp from there and stamp it and  post it"

"It  you know th , their green symbol with the black"
Yeah.
in it?
"Well it's green and it's got cream in it, but it's not the exact symbol of the Body Shop,i a bit different."
It's weird!
It's just really puzzling me!
I don't know what it is.
.
Oh they're recording us.
What's it for ?
What?
You wanna put it on the table where it's  actually.
"Right, just put it on the table and leave it!"
No you can't.

Oh May .
"He weren't sitting outside her house at all, he was sitting up here!"
"Yeah well he, didn't go up the sides or something?"
"Oh well he might of done, yeah."

"I was telling Sue  about it, oh my God she said!"
"She said well they didn't look the type, I was going well now"
Yeah.

Yeah.
I said and he's quite and inoffe i inoffensive little man  he was a nice little man.
Bag of nerves weren't he?
"Well yeah, but he was a nice little man."
Yeah.
He knew what he was talking about.
"He reminded me of someone, I couldn't quite  I know somebody who acts very much like him  I just can't  well I told him  you remind me of someone."
"I don't think we'll pick spice again, do you?"
No.
Ooh!
Smells like somebody's lavatory .
Looks like you'll have to sort of like  put it up for a day and then  take it down for a week and put it back in again.
It's too much for one day .
"You shou , perhaps you should have kept the  bag on it."
You know it's too strong to .
"You take the bag off, off it after a month or something."
Even your Bounty must taste a bit poorly.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Bet the bloke listening to this can hear it  smell it.
I know.
Put it in there.
.

Yeah.
"Er  hang on though, perhaps that's not so good."
"I, it might make the sweets taint."
Mm.
"I reckon we'll  when, when we get out we'll put it in the boot and it'll  filter through  through on its own ."
Ooh dear!
How about just keeping it in the bag?
It's overcoming me.
Yeah.
"Open your window, quick."
Oh  look.
Panic.
"Not everybody's window, Paul ."
Ah!
Strewth Pauly.
Well you can write save money across the top then
"Well I, I wrote actually that article for the the Herald and Post that has appeared in Harlow but not here."
A  whole load of tips  like that.
Oh.
"Now every week I open Herald and Post and think oh it's gonna be in there, it's gonna be in there but it never is."
It's only appeared in Harlow and she told me it would get in the Bishop's Stortford one but it hasn't so far.
It's a bit annoying really.
Who does all the schools?
As to recycling.
They must be checked.
What about asking Caroline?
School.
Well I mean somebody who knows the teachers or
Yes.
That's gonna be a difficult one cos they don't always want
I will  I'll do the schools.
Yeah.
erm the general public walking into their
Yeah.
.
We ought to split the schools because there's quite a lot of them.
I'll do the primary you do the secondary.
I'll do the secondary.
What about that?
Okay.
Primary.
Well I think Boy's High  were active in between weren't they?
Whether they er  still are.
How about St Mary?
I I found that erm erm  littered all over the place!
St Mary is  wall!
The P E
You'll have a lot of a headache by the time I've finished.
Now would I?
I don't play music loud.
There you go.
Thank you.
I couldn't have done that myself.
I'm only helping.
If you don't want any help just
"Alright, okay, fair enough, alright?"
Thank you.
You can say it as loud as you like Jo.
"I know, I don't want to say it as loud as I like."
"Go on, you shout it."
open the door.
There we are  there's no-one in there.
It wasn't exactly a joke was it now Andy?
It didn't make anybody laugh  because it was funny
You both laughed when I  shut the door.
No it's just cos you're a twat
Yes it's   vagina.
We know.
See the tufts of hair spring out  and the clitoris bulge.
Shut up.
No I know but
It should be quite
What are you looking at him like that for?
What?
That  to you dunnit?
What?
No.
listen to it.
"Yeah, it's dynamic."
Oh th the erm  the surveyor reckoned that that house next door
Yeah.
was built afterwards as a servant's house.
Lovely!
Too bad it doesn't come with the property.
Yes.
"Why is it smaller, it's much smaller is it?"
"Oh yeah it's smaller, but it's a nice er"
Is this the biggest one in the section?
"Er, well it's bi , I don't know."
It must be pretty near it.
Don't know.
Don't really care!
It's got the biggest garden in the area.
"I don't know, I don't really care!"
Not really.
You can see that about five garden size.
Well it's not really relevant.
Well it's a property!
He said it was a big one didn't they?
Mm.
Cos it's probably double the size of this one.
"Er it's,"
"It's gotta be  well it's ri , what do you reckon, four thousand square feet?"
"No, no!"
Oh I can't work it out.
I really can't afford
It must be pretty close.
"So you don't need all this, surely?"
What do you need Alistare's report for?
"I'll keep the  no, I just keep the stuff, that's er  got sentimental value."
Oh Christ!
It's come to me.
"Oh not a big team is it, again?"
Tottenham.
Oh no!
Oh no it's not Tottenham.
"No, you know when we played our Birmingham replay?"
Yeah.
That night we were gonna play Tottenham.
Were we?
Mark  told me that.
It was on his picture list.
Really?
That night we were gonna play Tottenham
Oh well.
in the league.
Oh sorry.
Perhaps we can play Tottenham when they haven't got er Gary Lineker in  their games any more.
Yeah.
You start hitting periods like this and you think  oh no.
You think every team  you start worrying about almost every side don't you?
Yeah.
Oh we always worry about every side cos Crystal Palace  always hate the  bad sides.
Cos usually we do well against the Man United and as soon as we start  losing against them we start getting worried.
They outplayed us last season at fairground didn't they?
Liverpool
What do you mean  at Liverpool?
What did Liverpool do to them then?
Well we lost  no we beat them two one
Yeah.
I remember that.
Most surprising result of that season.
Not really.
It looks better for going around most of the edges and going over the grass.
The back bed looks particularly good.
The one
It does.
by the
Yes.
Well I mean it was a lot
it was a lot of edging to do.
I mean it was just the back  though.
Now if you'll excuse me a moment.
I'll just watch the last few laps.
How many laps are there to go?
That .
Look.
Dad!
Yes love.
Come here.
"No I'm, just got sitting down again."
Yo go on you can tell me this joke and then you can finish.
But it isn't a joke.
Alright.
Well tell me whatever it is.
"No it's er, mum, shall I finish this?"
Mm mm.
All my carrots I'm eating.
"I would rather you ate your vegetables, yes, rather than the chicken please."
But mum  I
Yes?
I won't go hungry.
Well I hope you won't.
"It's down, down to those two cos of the Grand Prix on."
Those two do like watching it don't they?
I'll turn it.
I hope we can get out at the road end.
"Have you stuck a poster in, no you haven't, in the back window?"
"No, I haven't."
I think more people see the back
"Well I know, cos"
coming up that way than they do the front window.
"a lot of people go to  now, more people"
Yeah.
"there, yeah."
So they'll see it
Yes.
both ways.
I'm gonna stick one in the back as well.
Have I got my glasses with me or I can't see the prices.
Oh!
I haven't got my purse.
"Oh well, brilliant!"
Is that a squashed ball in the road?
That means I haven't got a key to get back in the house.
If you just stop here I'll run over the road.
If you give me the key please.
Thanks.
Ooh!
There's a car wants to be in.
It's there.
Sorry!
He didn't look very pleased did he?
If he was in a such a desperate hurry he could have gone down and gone  over there.
We don't usually get a second post on a Saturday.
"We do, you get a parcel delivery."
Oh yeah.
"Yeah, when you get your"
"no rules on the general public, there wasn't a general public,"
it was only collar and

But now it's casual.
But now he's put a casual bar in as well.
"He's opened another bar, he  when they went bust."

Aye.

the menu was second to none.
"The meals were second to none, Albert."
Mm.

Always on about it.

What you want paper for.

No Peter wants  about them  finally closing his business down.
He's still obliged to
"No, I mean, the C G Whittakers."
I was working there other day.
Ha.
I said  people you.
I went to put back what he had somebody take out.
He were that  as well.
"Well, you know, I didn't mean exactly the middle, go back"
"Well, I don't bloody know, alright if you can say middle, you mean middle."
papers.
Stop shouting.
Fourteen fifte fourteenth?
"That bloke didn't come on Saturday, he come on Friday didn't he?"
"No, well"
"What, why have you put down that you have your regional accent and I have an Irish accent?"
I haven't.
"Well, you can't tell that I'm Irish but I can tell you're Irish."
Oh.
How can you do that?
I I  .
You're you're a frigging idiot you are.
How do you know that people can't tell you're Irish?
Nobody can.
Nobody can tell  that I'm Irish.
Only when I swear.
And you know I don't swear very often.
No.
Erm
kids  anyway.
But that could change when Patricia comes in.
And what  does erm why does Brian and Patricia not have a regional accent?
Well I don't think they have.
Think a brummie accent.
"They haven't got a brummie accent, no."
No.
And th th they haven't got a twang as far as I know anyway so
Mm.
I'm only putting the truth down as I see it.
Yeah.
You know?
I mean I could be wrong.
I can only put down what I know  to be  the truth as far as I can tell.
Mhm.
Try the square root of nine.
Just press clear.
"Yeah, I just press this one."
Yes.
Clear that bit.
Cos it clears the whole mind.
Right.
What shall I press?
Nine  square root  is three.
So if you multiply three times three  you get nine.
Now it's easy when you deal in numbers like that because if you go to sixteen
Yes.
the square root is four.
Yes.
And if you go to twenty five the square root is five.
That's the number which multiplied by its self
Right.
gives you the number.
"Now, now it gets difficult when you come to a number like six."
Oh yes.
Try and find the square root of six.
"What do you think, have you an idea of what it will be."
"Don't, don't press the button."
Six.
Er er
"What, what number do you think you'd have to multiply by itself to get six?"
Three.
No.
Three times three is?
"I don six, six."
It's three.
No.
I don't think she knows it very well.
She said she's seen the film but none of the other family have seen it.
You know.
"Where they, they're having a fight and  they've got all the different people in the news like Chinese people go  and there's fights and then they get, there's custard pies thrown at them."
Oh yeah.
And Germany  going boom boom boom boom
That's just gonna make an awful mess on stage isn't it if they  ?
Is that all she's got to do?

Oh!
I feel fine  let me flare my nostrils.
Unless we can turn it off for a bit.

"No, why not?"
I'm in love with her and I feel fine   afterwards  it's only

So she said somebody else it could have been.
I said I don't know I said.
Angela
No.
I don't know.
"But erm  she said  she has said that we could do this and she said that's fine, she said."
As long as you don't  as long as you don't put erm anything too near it.
Mm.
And I said Mark's here so that he can switch it  switch it off at nights.
So anyway while I was there  Darren came in.
Is everything alright?
He said.
Are all the jobs done?
"And I said well look I said, I've got to come  because I said there's no way anybody  I said I wouldn't do it myself, I wouldn't put anybody in those beds."
I said something's got to be done and it won't wait.
And I said I'm going to leave the fire on  and er Mark's here and he'll switch it off at night.
That's alright she said.
"Let's see she said,th when's the first  when's your first booking?"

We wondered round the streets just taking photos.
You can go the coach route can't you?
"Yeah well  we was, we was gonna go down the west coast  go and see Rome and then down from there."
Yeah.
But the weather was terrible.
"I was driving through what, eighteen inches of water."
Yeah  when you go through Switzerland.
Yeah.
It seems to be following you.
Yeah well Switzerland weren't too bad cos the road surfaces are pretty good.
Yeah.
But in Italy there's no drainage.
Ooh.
"but on, on a motorway  brand new motorway, no lines"
Yeah.
"no white lines, nothing."
No?
about eighteen inches of water.
Right?
Cor!
And the cars are just  straight on.
"You know,"
Went round taking  photos of old and the new.
See this is the new stuff that's going up.
"I said well  I'm afraid if I don't, I said, I don't do it!"
That's right.
I said and I do I said I can't bare piles and piles of ironing.
So he said well if you'd have come over this morning June you'd have fainted!
So I said why?
He said well there was
Talking about fainting I still have my    I can't standing talking about bloody !
What're you gonna now then?
Take this bloody car up!
Yep.
"And he picked up four people on his, on that, imagine your the bus driver."
Yeah.
A man went to Edinburgh
"Yeah,then."
and picked up  five people on his bus.
Yeah.
Then he got four off in Kings Lynn  three more got on at erm Queensgate
"Yep, come on then, get your shoes on!"
and a little boy nipped on to see his mum  the boy never got off  so he was still on the bus
Yeah.
so that
Here's your shoes.
then him and his mum got off along with the rest of the people  what was the driver's name?
Dunno !
Your the driver!
Oh !
"James did that to me , me and John, I was thinking  I went Fred!"
"He goes, I didn't know your name was Fred!"
James who?
He was fighting everybody yesterday!
Yeah!
What was the matter with him?
Three times three.
I don't know the answer!
Well look  three  three  and three.
So how many have you got?
Ten.
No!
Plonker !
You've got nine.
I'm just going
Anyway
to check.
"So, there you are."
"It's two point four four nine, which really, is very close to two and a half."
Which isn't quite right.
"Oh that, well that's the square root of the other one so you're, you're going to smaller square roots every time."
That gets very difficult.
Right.
Right.
So clear all that and go back to what you wanted to do.
"Right, I'll show you."
Ten  square root  is
Three point one six two two seven seven six.
Right.
Eh eh.
Four hundred and fifty six square root is twenty one point three five four one five six.
Very clever.
Useless for you though.
You don't really need that information do you?
Well dad!
"So what, what, what sort of information do you need?"
Tt.
Counting information.
"She was pretty upset, though, weren't she?"
"Well, she upsets herself."

Trip.
"Bloody hell, I try and get bloody dressed up, should be looking, stupid sod, drunk, got drink all down me."
"I think Dwayne, just, he was, just wasn't, wasn't that interested."
Can't blame him.
"He was just, oh, it was funny."
"he deliberately, I was standing next to him,he was just leaning on me."
That's Dwayne.
Just leaning on me.
"You know that    they all disgust me, and er, John went yeah, that's the sort of woman I like."
Comes carrying a load of  in her hand.
"It was like, shut up."
"He's a real prat, ain't he?"
"I was sitting there going,ha ha ha  got a  stuck."
I tell
"Oh, Lord."
That's a pint glass gone.
Naked woman on it.
"Ain't it, it's like out of a porno mag."
It is bad.
I don't know how he got that on there.
The
It's not painted.
"But when, when when the colour glass is full, she's got clothes on."
"Oh, really?"
Never.
Do you remember that.
That was a really silly thing wasn't it?
Can I just have a look Kath?
Yeah.
He organized it all and then I think was it a week before he suddenly said  well we can't possibly have two hundred people walking along  a nature trail  that we want to protect.
And he was really of the illusion that there might be  I think two hundred no six hundred people
Two hundred people might turn up.
turning up.
In the end I think three people turned up.
Oh.
"It was, it was  no it was"
This looks really interesting.
get it.
I had to write off
Yeah.
Er it was a nice  er display  thing to show to show the kids when you do talks in schools.

Is is that Greenpeace?
Yeah that's what I think is it's no

Well he's obvious they've obviously the group has bought it and he's got it and he's gonna say do you want to buy
Oh yeah.

Originally cost twenty pounds and we could get it for ten it's er
It's Chris

"I think it's really funny, cos it's thirty quid she's spent on two tickets, and she's telling us, she's got no money."
She's spent fifteen quid on her tickets for the concert.
"Oh, shit."
"She's bought the C D of them, this week, and I'm just like, oh my God."
"Does she really like them, then?"
Well.
"I think she's somebody that just like, has to go with the flow, with what her friends are doing, and all her friends back home are really seriously into them."
Really?
I just think what a load of rubbish.
How old is she?
She's twenty .
Blimey.
"Yeah, but I thought Take That was for twelve year olds."
"Well, it is, innit."
"Yeah, likes a bit of Take That."
She don't.
"She does, that's the kind of thing she likes, Fred, innit?"
"Ah, she's sad, ain't she?"
Oh yeah.
"I bet Kerry likes them, don't she?"
"She is a sad person, anyway."
That's true.
Too true.
"Does Kerry like Take That any more, or has she gone off them?"
I don't know really.
Trouble is
"You don't communicate any more, do you?"
"No, she's a bit odd, Kerry, listening to the Rolling Stones and U B Forty."
Bit out her   ain't she?
Especially at the volume she listens to it.
I know.
Has anyone not got a map here?
Yeah.
Is it up there?
I don't know!
Why don't you ?
"Now, who got the cigarettes?"
"Oh, some of them are outside, yes."

Well I'm not.
"Just think, use your options."
"This is so , you know so many days"
Yes.
Yeah.
Just use different options.
Alright?
Better put your name at the top of the page as well.
We'll go through the answers anyway.
"Instead of just spouting at me, I'd just like you all to engage brain with ."
"Do you do, I've got one wrong."
"Alright, just  make some notes  and stuff that you've got already."
Right.

"I said I wanna get on with these, those dining chairs next  in the sale."
When's the sale?
Summer time isn't it?
About June?
Erm May  some time in May.
Well where are you going to get the fabric for those?
Trip to
"Yes Margaret, what do you think?"
brilliant ideas
"And see they were asking me what I was gonna use yesterday and I said oh I don't know I said, I haven't got a clue."
something about er  tapestry.
I said oh you're
No
spending a lot of money and er
Don't forget
I said it's not for us anyway so
it's going to take a lot of fabric  both sides and the back.
Full length of the back of the chairs  across the seat
Exactly.
"Er er, like that."
You know how to do a seven.
Oh here's the tram bit.
"Let's fli turn up the sound  then we can    No you've done that backwards, it's seventeen not seventy one."
Here we go look.
Oh look Dave this is great!
Going  back to the old trams.
But how can they go through the towns?
"Well trams Dave  they do both, they go on the railway lines and they go through the town centre."
Right.
Oh dear!
Don't watch this .
"The Olympics, not that far away."
Right.
Let's see.
Seven minus two is
Good.
Ah ah!
That's wrong.
Right.
I'll just turn off the television then we can concentrate on
I can.
Da David!
You're not doing very well on that question and you've done harder ones.
Remember how you do it.
Add the four to the three
I have.
and what do you get?
Eighteen!
No you don't.
"Well do it, do it the way on your fingers."
You've got thirteen plus four.
"And  oh they were talking about Rod they was  they were saying that, you know, about Rod getting married"
Yeah?
Well I said well how old is Rod?
I dunno he said er Steve how old's Rod?
"I said well come on you're his dad, you should know how old he is."
So he went out to the car and asked mother  how old is Rod?
She says I don't know    don't remember having him  mind you I remember having him but I don't know  I can't remember when it was.
He's thirty something.
Hard to put an age on him.
Ray was thirty eight
Is he as much as that?
Mm.
"Well it must be ten years ago when he worked for the B B C and that, he must have been in his late twenties then"
Mm.
so  anyway he's  he's engaged and  it's taken him two years to get engaged  so it's gonna take another couple of years to get married.
Yeah.
He's still got the M G and it's got three twen twenty three thousand on it now.
It's
Mm
"S reg, got it from new of course,."
And some chap came down from the M G B Owners' Club and said he'd offer him six thousand for it.
Mm
"But he said he thought that was  price cos he said it's worth at least ten   the mileage originally, you know?"
Mm.
it's absolutely like new.
?
Mm?
Where did he get it?
"He bought it from brand new somewhere,"
"In Devon, yeah."
Mm.
"He's got a Metro at the moment they're driving around in, she drives, she passed her test at sixty eight."
Yeah.
"And you measured it with a protractor,"
Mm.
"it was forty five degrees so you thought it was one, but the scale was two to one."
Yeah.
"The gradient is the tan of the angle, but you can only read that off the graph if you've got the same units."
Same scale on the X and Y. Erm what would be  let's say someone gave you this  find an approximation for the gradient  erm Y equals X squared  minus one.
X squared?
"Y equals X squared minus one, at around the point where X equals three."
Someone wanted to know the gradient.
"So, so"
Ooh.
you d you'd have to find Y.
Okay.
So Y is three squared minus one.
Yeah okay.
be Y would equal eight.
Yeah.
Erm  so
Good.
"Right, draw a sketch, cos we need to know what we're working with here."
So Y could perhaps equal  three.
the rest of the graph
the opposite point.
Right.
Good.
It's symmetrical down the Y axis.
And  the lowest point.
It'd be about one .
About one.
"What's the graph going to look like here, when X is very big?"
.
"And it were a good group, I wanted to go see."
Our think nowt about going and watching 'em.
Johnny won't go anywhere like that.
"Kay's wanted to do what we do, and Johnny's not interested."
Yeah.
"Like went to fair, she went to the riding, he ."
"He said, that's  ya like a big kid, going up fair."

"Yeah, twenty nine."
"Well, I like to go on rides."
"I go on rides, June won't  go on."
I know.
"Yeah, well, that's what I mean,"
"Go on, shit."
"The thing is, like he is even apart apart from 'im being a lot older than 'er, he acts older."
"I mean, he acts like his always, er forty three, he acts like he's like, fifty sometime, well you you're older than, you know what I mean, he acts older than you, because as you say, you'll go on fair rides and"
Aye.
"Mind you, we're we're getting on"
"No, but you know what I mean, I mean,"
"Yeah, I know what you mean."
"Fifty,"
Fifty-three.
Four.
"Fifty-three,"
Fifty-four.
I'm fifty-three
Your fifty-four next birthday  you're only a couple of months off.
"Well, I'm fifty-three."
He's fifty-three.
'Cos you probably do more things.
"You know younger things, than what he does."
Mm?
You know what those sa staff are like.
I know.
"Most of them are, well yes."
"But, they certainly do."
"If anyone offered me a chocolate when I was nursing, yes I would eat it cos I was always  hungry ."
Which reminds me I meant to get weighed this morning  before I had my breakfast.
That don't matter.
And I forgot.
Remind me tomorrow.
Before I eat anything.
I think I'd better put some washing in before I go out.

That's all she's saying  you couldn't it with these before if you .
What?
The boots you've got on.
Give better support than the ones  those flat heeled ones.
Where did you buy them from?
For your Achilles' tendon.
It's better now.
"I get, on Wednesday I, I did the erm  Angeline said to me don't do the high impact if you think it's  going to hurt again."
I co still have the support under it.
I managed okay.
It didn't hurt.
Who's Angeline?
Which is the right one for
The pink one's a dish cloth.
The blue one's the one I wipe up  small stains off the floor.
Right.
I wonder how Bryony is?
What?
"I said, I wonder how Bryony is?"
"We went there, had a look."
Perhaps they'll open at night time.
Dunno.
When he asked me when they opened.
I don't know I said.
And what time do they shut?
And I said I don't know but I said I shouldn't think it would be too late.
I dunno.
And er
Did he eat the dinner?
Well I dunno.
I left it there and then  went down the caravan.
When we come back he'd got the dishes all ready for me.

Erm  so I had a chat to him.
He drew me a little plan of how to get to W H Smiths and that.
What the hell do you wanna go to Smiths for?
Maps.
So I had a walk up the town and called in Tesco's and got a bit of shopping.
Got some teabags.
Did you?
Yeah.
"Is it much of a place, Caernarvon?"
Not really.
They have a market there don't there?
On a Saturday yeah.
"So I went to Smiths, got this map"
What and do a photocopy?
But I don't think I'll need it.
"It's just a one to twenty five thousand, a Pathfinder."
Cos I picked up the Chester to Wrexham one instead of the Snowdonia one.
Caernarvon's on the Snowdonia map.
Ah.
An O S one to fifty thousand  and that's what I thought I'd picked up this morning to take with me  but when I looked it was Chester and Wrexham so it didn't do me much good.
So I thought oh well I'll buy this other one and
Claim it back off the firm?
Yes.
"Three pound ninety something     chicken butties and  bag of crisps and that, it was nice."
"Cos I'd parked on the top of this multi-storey car park at the  offices, is it called?"
Erm  I parked on the top.
So it wasn't all dark and that
Mm.
cos I wanted to be looking at me plans.
I'll bet it is.
Oh as I say I've seen the film.
"I, I liked the film of Hannibal, with Oliver Reed."
Now that's quite good.
Yeah.
Was it
I've never seen the film.
"It's very good, the film is."
But I mean round there it's absolutely steeped in history.
I couldn't believe it.
Mm.
I mean  er when they told  the tales of the  of the seven winds and the  was it seven winds?
Yeah.
"The seven winds and Romu Romulus and Remus and the, the, the wolf  it all happened round there."
And they reckon the golden wolf is still down
But
there somewhere.
Rome is supposed to be built on seven hills isn't it or something?
It is.
"Yeah, seven hills."
Yeah we saw the seven hills as we drove past Rome because you
Yeah
can see it.
Just like this can't you?

Amazing place.
"We didn't go into Rome, we went round it."

And then I just never understood a word of what he said.
Well I can never understand him.
No I can't.

If we ought to had him mate  they'd have thought he'd come from
Well

I can't never understand him.
No I must admit I can't.
"We have this French woman come in  she comes quite often Mrs   and  she said  I'd like to make an appointme appointment on the  she said the eleventh, and I thought   I said  pardon?"
And she said it again and I thought well i it didn't sound  like eleven  eleven   I don't know what it sounded like really and I just went  so that'll be Wednesday the eleventh?
"And I thought  if she says yes, I've got the date right !"
Yeah.
And did you get it right?

Yeah.
Yeah.
I've been a West Brom supporter
They wouldn't be able to afford to keep the ground on would they?
all my life.
What?
They wouldn't be able to afford to keep the ground on if they went out
Well I mean it shows you what marvellous West Brom were.
When West Brom got lost four nil to Woking  wasn't it Paulie?
"The next round they had West Brom supporters supporting, came down from"
Yeah.

"What I'll do, I'll measure up today for er"

It might have been.
I can't remember.
Wasn't it just before or after her husband died?
Dunno.
"Cos that, well I don't know, her husband died when we were just, came here."
It could have been that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well I phoned Shirley  and she said she's fine.

Yes!
"They accost me in the street every time I walk  every time I walk down for money, they're"
Do you e
terrible!
Do you ever give them any money?
Of course I don't give them any money!
"Bearing in mind that you're rich enough to live in Surrey, and some people can't even afford a roof over their head don't you think you have a moral obligation towards these people?"
It's not my problem!
Yeah.
If they're stupid enough to be homeless!
"No, I don't."
I don't.
You put it in the bin.
"No, they, they've said in there you mustn't."
Where?
No not cooking oil.
"Er pet , car oil ."

bifocals today new.

But this guy seems to be well worth nurturing.
Yes.
Here you are.
It says here oh that's waste oil cooking fat and other liquids.
I know it says fat collection but I
Well that only should only be because erm  the bin's going to be soiled.
In in in  in the end  terribly smelly that's the reason.
I mean why there shouldn't be cooking oil in in in landfill.
I mean
Dad
Dad's not in
Mm
I can only think that  I mean it sticks to the sides of the bin  at the bottom
Well if it's if it was very hot could it could it melt the plastic?
It could even melt the plastic yes.
Or could it ignite?
Yeah.
No I I definitely  foodstuffs out of the water.

Probably will.
Hello.
"Hello, alright"
I wouldn't trust those two any further than I can throw them.
My instincts straight away.
Mm.
"You reckon, you reckon they're Bonny and Clyde do you?"
I wouldn't be surprised if they were the sort of people who had the stolen bicycle down in the bushes.
"Oh dear, they haven't go a dog, but they went on the dog walk!"
Ah.

"But I mean, you really have to be, like, a member before like  if you were starting to like, want to do all the shows  they'd want you"
"No, but I mean , no one ever really does all the shows."
I know.
"But say,ma , maybe  if you did the pantomime and then the next one coming up  I mean  er er  er,th , I think they'd actually ask you  like, your membership money."
What's the  what do you actually do this for?

No.
"Go the motorways though, if you can."
Oh.
"You'll have to watch for, for the roadworks."
I mean the roadworks on the M 6 are diabolical now.
Mm.
I it took us three and a half hours coming back from Swansea.
But we stopped off for half an hour as well.
And  I think it's longer coming back that way.
Over the bridge.
No it isn't.
It isn't.
You sure?
I'd be positive.
Shorter.
Cos  th I remember the first time I went down that way over the bridge.

Haven't got any what?
That is right isn't it?
One pint is
Well a quart is two pints.
Yeah.
And point five of a quart is one pint.
That makes it three pints.
Why they can't put three pints on instead of one point five quarts .
But does she want a three to four one?
If she wants a three to four you gotta have the next size up.
Three stroke four
Well she said  three or four.
Oh I see.

So they must still be doing them and that was two  huge boxes.
Oh.
Er
I know they are not very happy
Well that needs a check that needs needs another check I I would guess.
Yeah.
And I quite honestly I don't
I I'm going to say about back to this erm sump oil.
"Daisy heard it , ran in , saw the empty dish , also the end of a yellow tail disappearing under the bed ."
"Without a word she seized that tail , pulled out the thief , and shook him till his ears flapped wildly , then bundled him down-stairs to the shed , where he spent a lonely evening in the coal-bin ."
"Cheered by the sympathy which Demi gave her , Daisy made another bowlful of batter , and fried a dozen cakes , which were even better than the others ."
"Indeed , Uncle Fritz after eating two sent up word that he had never tasted any so nice , and every boy at the table below envied Demi at the flapjack party above ."
"It was a truly delightful supper , for the little teapot lid only fell off three times and the milk jug upset but once ; the cakes floated in syrup , and the toast had a delicious beef-steak flavor , owing to cook 's using the gridiron to make it on ."
"Demi forgot philosophy , and stuffed like any carnal boy , while Daisy planned sumptuous banquets , and the dolls looked on smiling affably ."
"`` Well , dearies , have you had a good time ? ''"
"asked Mrs. Jo , coming up with Teddy on her shoulder ."
`` A very good time .
"I shall come again soon , '' answered Demi , with emphasis ."
"`` I 'm afraid you have eaten too much , by the look of that table . ''"
"`` No , I have n't ; I only ate fifteen cakes , and they were very little ones , '' protested Demi , who had kept his sister busy supplying his plate ."
"`` They wo n't hurt him , they are so nice , '' said Daisy , with such a funny mixture of maternal fondness and housewifely pride that Aunt Jo could only smile and say : `` Well , on the whole , the new game is a success then ? ''"
"`` I like it , '' said Demi , as if his approval was all that was necessary ."
`` It is the dearest play ever made ! ''
"cried Daisy , hugging her little dish-tub as she proposed to wash up the cups ."
"`` I just wish everybody had a sweet cooking stove like mine , '' she added , regarding it with affection ."
"`` This play out to have a name , '' said Demi , gravely removing the syrup from his countenance with his tongue ."
`` It has . ''
"`` Oh , what ? ''"
asked both children eagerly .
"`` Well , I think we will call it Pattypans , '' and Aunt Jo retired , satisfied with the success of her last trap to catch a sunbeam ."
CHAPTER VI .
"A FIRE BRAND `` Please , ma'am , could I speak to you ?"
"It is something very important , '' said Nat , popping his head in at the door of Mrs. Bhaer 's room ."
"It was the fifth head which had popped in during the last half-hour ; but Mrs. Jo was used to it , so she looked up , and said , briskly , `` What is it , my lad ? ''"
"Nat came in , shut the door carefully behind him , and said in an eager , anxious tone , `` Dan has come . ''"
`` Who is Dan ? ''
`` He 's a boy I used to know when I fiddled round the streets .
"He sold papers , and he was kind to me , and I saw him the other day in town , and told him how nice it was here , and he 's come . ''"
"`` But , my dear boy , that is rather a sudden way to pay a visit . ''"
"`` Oh , it is n't a visit ; he wants to stay if you will let him ! ''"
"`` Captain , '' said the squire , `` the house is quite invisible from the ship ."
It must be the flag they are aiming at .
Would it not be wiser to take it in ? ''
`` Strike my colours ! ''
cried the captain .
"`` No , sir , not I '' ; and as soon as he had said the words , I think we all agreed with him ."
"For it was not only a piece of stout , seamanly , good feeling ; it was good policy besides and showed our enemies that we despised their cannonade ."
All through the evening they kept thundering away .
"Ball after ball flew over or fell short or kicked up the sand in the enclosure , but they had to fire so high that the shot fell dead and buried itself in the soft sand ."
"We had no ricochet to fear , and though one popped in through the roof of the log-house and out again through the floor , we soon got used to that sort of horse-play and minded it no more than cricket ."
"`` There is one good thing about all this , '' observed the captain ; `` the wood in front of us is likely clear ."
The ebb has made a good while ; our stores should be uncovered .
Volunteers to go and bring in pork . ''
Gray and Hunter were the first to come forward .
"Well armed , they stole out of the stockade , but it proved a useless mission ."
The mutineers were bolder than we fancied or they put more trust in Israel 's gunnery .
"For four or five of them were busy carrying off our stores and wading out with them to one of the gigs that lay close by , pulling an oar or so to hold her steady against the current ."
Silver was in the stern-sheets in command ; and every man of them was now provided with a musket from some secret magazine of their own .
"The captain sat down to his log , and here is the beginning of the entry : Alexander Smollett , master ; David Livesey , ship 's doctor ; Abraham Gray , carpenter 's mate ; John Trelawney , owner ; John Hunter and Richard Joyce , owner 's servants , landsmen -- being all that is left faithful of the ship 's company -- with stores for ten days at short rations , came ashore this day and flew British colours on the log-house in Treasure Island ."
"Thomas Redruth , owner 's servant , landsman , shot by the mutineers ; James Hawkins , cabin-boy -- And at the same time , I was wondering over poor Jim Hawkins ' fate ."
A hail on the land side .
"`` Somebody hailing us , '' said Hunter , who was on guard ."
`` Doctor !
Squire !
Captain !
"Hullo , Hunter , is that you ? ''"
came the cries .
"And I ran to the door in time to see Jim Hawkins , safe and sound , come climbing over the stockade ."
"19 Narrative Resumed by Jim Hawkins : The Garrison in the Stockade AS soon as Ben Gunn saw the colours he came to a halt , stopped me by the arm , and sat down ."
"`` Now , '' said he , `` there 's your friends , sure enough . ''"
"`` Far more likely it 's the mutineers , '' I answered ."
`` That ! ''
"If you can not attend to your business , I shall go to the floor walker and ask him to direct me to somebody who can ."
The laziness and disobligingness of the girls in this store is really getting beyond endurance . ''
A passionate answer was on the point of Marcella 's tongue .
All her bitterness and suffering and resentment flashed into her face and eyes .
"For one moment she was determined to speak out , to repay Mrs. Liddell 's insolence in kind ."
A retort was ready to her hand .
"Everyone knew that Mrs. Liddell , before her marriage to a wealthy man , had been a working girl ."
"What could be easier than to say contemptuously : `` You should be a judge of a clerk 's courtesy and ability , madam ."
You were a shop girl yourself once ? ''
"But if she said it , what would follow ?"
Prompt and instant dismissal .
And Patty ?
The thought of the little sister quelled the storm in Marcella 's soul .
For Patty 's sake she must control her temper -- and she did .
"With an effort that left her white and tremulous she crushed back the hot words and said quietly : `` I beg your pardon , Mrs. Liddell ."
I did not mean to be inattentive .
"Let me show you some of our new lingerie waists , I think you will like them . ''"
But Mrs. Liddell did not like the new lingerie waists which Marcella brought to her in her trembling hands .
For another half hour she examined and found fault and sneered .
"Then she swept away with the scornful remark that she did n't see a thing there that was fit to wear , and she would go to Markwell Bros. and see if they had anything worth looking at ."
"When she had gone , Marcella leaned against the counter , pale and exhausted ."
She must have a breathing spell .
"Oh , how her head ached !"
How hot and stifling and horrible everything was !
She longed for the country herself .
"Oh , if she and Patty could only go away to some place where there were green clover meadows and cool breezes and great hills where the air was sweet and pure !"
During all this time a middle-aged woman had been sitting on a stool beside the bargain counter .
"When a clerk asked her if she wished to be waited on , she said , `` No , I 'm just waiting here for a friend who promised to meet me . ''"
She was tall and gaunt and grey haired .
"She had square jaws and cold grey eyes and an aggressive nose , but there was something attractive in her plain face , a mingling of common sense and kindliness ."
She watched Marcella and Mrs. Liddell closely and lost nothing of all that was said and done on both sides .
Now and then she smiled grimly and nodded .
I began to see that here was one of the best of possible shipmates .
"When we got to the inn , the squire and Dr. Livesey were seated together , finishing a quart of ale with a toast in it , before they should go aboard the schooner on a visit of inspection ."
"Long John told the story from first to last , with a great deal of spirit and the most perfect truth ."
"`` That was how it were , now , were n't it , Hawkins ? ''"
"he would say , now and again , and I could always bear him entirely out ."
"The two gentlemen regretted that Black Dog had got away , but we all agreed there was nothing to be done , and after he had been complimented , Long John took up his crutch and departed ."
"`` All hands aboard by four this afternoon , '' shouted the squire after him ."
"`` Aye , aye , sir , '' cried the cook , in the passage ."
"`` Well , squire , '' said Dr. Livesey , `` I do n't put much faith in your discoveries , as a general thing ; but I will say this , John Silver suits me . ''"
"`` The man 's a perfect trump , '' declared the squire ."
"`` And now , '' added the doctor , `` Jim may come on board with us , may he not ? ''"
"`` To be sure he may , '' says squire ."
"`` Take your hat , Hawkins , and we 'll see the ship . ''"
"9 Powder and Arms THE HISPANIOLA lay some way out , and we went under the figureheads and round the sterns of many other ships , and their cables sometimes grated underneath our keel , and sometimes swung above us ."
"At last , however , we got alongside , and were met and saluted as we stepped aboard by the mate , Mr. Arrow , a brown old sailor with earrings in his ears and a squint ."
"He and the squire were very thick and friendly , but I soon observed that things were not the same between Mr. Trelawney and the captain ."
"This last was a sharp-looking man who seemed angry with everything on board and was soon to tell us why , for we had hardly got down into the cabin when a sailor followed us ."
"`` Captain Smollett , sir , axing to speak with you , '' said he ."
`` I am always at the captain 's orders .
"Show him in , '' said the squire ."
"The captain , who was close behind his messenger , entered at once and shut the door behind him ."
"`` Well , Captain Smollett , what have you to say ?"
"All well , I hope ; all shipshape and seaworthy ? ''"
"`` Well , sir , '' said the captain , `` better speak plain , I believe , even at the risk of offence ."
I do n't like this cruise ; I do n't like the men ; and I do n't like my officer .
That 's short and sweet . ''
"`` Perhaps , sir , you do n't like the ship ? ''"
"inquired the squire , very angry , as I could see ."
"`` I ca n't speak as to that , sir , not having seen her tried , '' said the captain ."
`` She seems a clever craft ; more I ca n't say . ''
"`` Possibly , sir , you may not like your employer , either ? ''"
says the squire .
"Alan Douglas was a sincere man , with himself as well as with others , yet there are some motives that lie , in their first inception , too deep even for the probe of self-analysis ."
He had not as yet the faintest suspicion as to the real source of his interest in Lynde Oliver -- in his sudden forceful desire to be of use and service to her -- to rescue her from spiritual peril as he had that day rescued her from bodily danger .
"She must have a lonely , unsatisfying life , he thought ."
It is my duty to help her if I can .
It did not then occur to him that duty in this instance wore a much more pleasing aspect than it had sometimes worn in his experience .
"* * * * * Alan did not mean to be oversoon in going back to Four Winds , but three days later a book came to him which Captain Anthony had expressed a wish to see ."
It furnished an excuse for an earlier call .
After that he went often .
"He always found the Captain courteous and affable , old Emily grimly cordial , Lynde sometimes remote and demure , sometimes frankly friendly ."
"Occasionally , when the Captain was away in his yacht , he went for a walk with her and her dogs along the shore or through the sweet-smelling pinelands up the lake ."
He found that she loved books and was avid for more of them than she could obtain ; he was glad to take her several and discuss them with her .
She liked history and travels best .
"With novels she had no patience , she said disdainfully ."
She seldom spoke of herself or her past life and Alan fancied she avoided any personal reference .
"But once she said abruptly , `` Why do you never ask me to go to church ?"
I 've always been afraid you would . ''
"`` Because I do not think it would do you any good to go if you did n't want to , '' said Alan gravely ."
`` Souls should not be rudely handled any more than bodies . ''
"She looked at him reflectively , her finger denting her chin in a meditative fashion she had ."
`` You are not at all like Mr. Strong .
"He always scolded me , when he got a chance , for not going to church ."
I would have hated him if it had been worthwhile .
I told him one day that I was nearer to God under these pines than I could be in any building fashioned by human hands .
He was very much shocked .
But I do n't want you to misunderstand me .
Father does not go to church because he does not believe there is a God .
But I know there is .
Mother taught me so .
"I have never gone to church because Father would not allow me , and I could not go now in Rexton where the people talk about me so ."
"Oh , I know they do -- you know it , too -- but I do not care for them ."
I know I 'm not like other girls .
I would like to be but I ca n't be -- I never can be -- now . ''
"`` I will get up at sunrise every morning of my life hereafter , '' exclaimed Murray rapturously , not meaning a syllable of it , but devoutly believing he did ."
Just as the fiery disc of the sun peered over the sand dunes Murray heard music that was not of the birds .
"It was a girl 's voice singing beyond the maples to his left -- a clear sweet voice , blithely trilling out the old-fashioned song , `` Five O'Clock in the Morning . ''"
`` Mrs. Palmer 's niece ! ''
Murray sprang to his feet and tiptoed cautiously through the maples .
He had heard so much from Mrs. Palmer about her niece that he felt reasonably well acquainted with her .
"Moreover , Mrs. Palmer had assured him that Mollie was a very pretty girl ."
Now a pretty girl milking cows at sunrise in the meadows sounded well .
Mrs. Palmer had not over-rated her niece 's beauty .
Murray said so to himself with a little whistle of amazement as he leaned unseen on the pasture fence and looked at the girl who was milking a placid Jersey less than ten yards away from him .
Murray 's artistic instinct responded to the whole scene with a thrill of satisfaction .
"He could see only her profile , but that was perfect , and the colouring of the oval cheek and the beautiful curve of the chin were something to adore ."
"Her hair , ruffled into lovable little ringlets by the morning wind , was coiled in glistening chestnut masses high on her bare head , and her arms , bare to the elbow , were as white as marble ."
"Presently she began to sing again , and this time Murray joined in ."
She half rose from her milking stool and cast a startled glance at the maples .
"Then she dropped back again and began to milk determinedly , but Murray could have sworn that he saw a demure smile hovering about her lips ."
"That , and the revelation of her full face , decided him ."
He sprang over the fence and sauntered across the intervening space of lush clover blossoms .
"`` Good morning , '' he said coolly ."
"He had forgotten her other name , and it did not matter ; at five o'clock in the morning people who met in dewy clover fields might disregard the conventionalities ."
`` Is n't it rather a large contract for you to be milking seven cows all alone ?
May I help you ? ''
Mollie looked up at him over her shoulder .
She had glorious grey eyes .
Her face was serene and undisturbed .
`` Can you milk ? ''
she asked .
"`` Unlikely as it may seem , I can , '' said Murray ."
"`` I have never confessed it to Mrs. Emory , because I was afraid she would inveigle me into milking her fourteen cows ."
But I do n't mind helping you .
I learned to milk when I was a shaver on my vacations at a grandfatherly farm .
May I have that extra pail ? ''
"Ragged , dirty , thin , and worn-out he looked ; one foot was bare , the other tied up in the old gingham jacket which he had taken from his own back to use as a clumsy bandage for some hurt ."
"He seemed to have hidden himself behind the hay-cock , but in his sleep had thrown out the arm that had betrayed him ."
"He sighed and muttered as if his dreams disturbed him , and once when he moved , he groaned as if in pain , but still slept on quite spent with weariness ."
"`` He must not lie here , '' said Mrs. Bhaer , and stooping over him she gently called his name ."
"He opened his eyes and looked at her , as if she was a part of his dream , for he smiled and said drowsily , `` Mother Bhaer , I 've come home . ''"
"The look , the words , touched her very much , and she put her hand under his head to lift him up , saying in her cordial way , `` I thought you would , and I 'm so glad to see you , Dan . ''"
"He seemed to wake thoroughly then , and started up looking about him as if he suddenly remembered where he was , and doubted even that kind welcome ."
"His face changed , and he said in his old rough way , `` I was going off in the morning ."
"I only stopped to peek in , as I went by . ''"
"`` But why not come in , Dan ?"
Did n't you hear us call you ?
"Teddy saw , and cried for you . ''"
"`` Did n't suppose you 'd let me in , '' he said , fumbling with a little bundle which he had taken up as if going immediately ."
"`` Try and see , '' was all Mrs. Bhaer answered , holding out her hand and pointing to the door , where the light shone hospitably ."
"With a long breath , as if a load was off his mind , Dan took up a stout stick , and began to limp towards the house , but stopped suddenly , to say inquiringly , `` Mr. Bhaer wo n't like it ."
I ran away from Page . ''
"`` He knows it , and was sorry , but it will make no difference ."
Are you lame ? ''
"asked Mrs. Jo , as he limped on again ."
`` Getting over a wall a stone fell on my foot and smashed it .
"I do n't mind , '' and he did his best to hide the pain each step cost him ."
"Mrs. Bhaer helped him into her own room , and , once there , he dropped into a chair , and laid his head back , white and faint with weariness and suffering ."
`` My poor Dan !
"drink this , and then eat a little ; you are at home now , and Mother Bhaer will take good care of you . ''"
"He only looked up at her with eyes full of gratitude , as he drank the wine she held to his lips , and then began slowly to eat the food she brought him ."
"Each mouthful seemed to put heart into him , and presently he began to talk as if anxious to have her know all about him ."
"`` Where have you been , Dan ? ''"
"she asked , beginning to get out some bandages ."
`` I ran off more 'n a month ago .
"Page was good enough , but too strict ."
"I did n't like it , so I cut away down the river with a man who was going in his boat ."
That 's why they could n't tell where I 'd gone .
"But cast with what skill he might , it availed nothing , for the salmon would not even look at the bait . '"
"I am beaten at last , unless the Doran-donn can deliver me , ' he cried ."
"And as he spoke there was a swish of the water , and the face of the Doran-donn looked up at him . '"
"O catch me , I pray you , that salmon under the rock ! '"
said Covan son of Gorla .
"And the Doran-donn dived , and laying hold of the salmon by his tail , bore it back to the place where Covan was standing ."
"` The roe , and the duck , and the salmon are here , ' said Covan to the old man , when he reached the cottage ."
"And the old man smiled on him and bade him eat and drink , and after he hungered no more , he would speak with him ."
"And this was what the old man said : ` You began well , my son , so things have gone well with you ."
"You set store by your mother 's blessing , therefore you have been blest ."
"You gave food to the raven when it hungered , you were true to the promise you had made to me , and did not suffer yourself to be turned aside by vain shows ."
"You were skilled to perceive that the boy who tempted you to leave the temple was a teller of false tales , and took with a grateful heart what the poor had to offer you ."
"Last of all , difficulties gave you courage , instead of lending you despair ."
"And now , as to your reward , you shall in truth take your sister home with you , and your brothers I will restore to life ; but idle and unfaithful as they are their lot is to wander for ever ."
"And so farewell , and may wisdom be with you . '"
` First tell me your name ? '
asked Covan softly . '
"I am the Spirit of Age , ' said the old man ."
The Princess Bella-Flor -LSB- Taken from a Celtic Story .
Translated by Doctor Macleod Clarke . -RSB-
Once upon a time there lived a man who had two sons .
"When they grew up the elder went to seek his fortune in a far country , and for many years no one heard anything about him ."
"Meanwhile the younger son stayed at home with his father , who died at last in a good old age , leaving great riches behind him ."
"For some time the son who stayed at home spent his father 's wealth freely , believing that he alone remained to enjoy it ."
"But , one day , as he was coming down stairs , he was surprised to see a stranger enter the hall , looking about as if the house belonged to him ."
` Have you forgotten me ? '
asked the man . '
"I ca n't forget a person I have never known , ' was the rude answer . '"
"I am your brother , ' replied the stranger , ` and I have returned home without the money I hoped to have made ."
"And , what is worse , they tell me in the village that my father is dead ."
I would have counted my lost gold as nothing if I could have seen him once more . '
"` He died six months ago , ' said the rich brother , ` and he left you , as your portion , the old wooden chest that stands in the loft ."
Rilla 's fear lifted .
Dog Monday howled no more and resumed his routine of train meeting and watching .
When five days had passed the Ingleside people began to feel that they might be cheerful again .
"Rilla dashed about the kitchen helping Susan with the breakfast and singing so sweetly and clearly that Cousin Sophia across the road heard her and croaked out to Mrs. Albert , '' ` Sing before eating , cry before sleeping , ' I 've always heard . ''"
But Rilla Blythe shed no tears before the nightfall .
"When her father , his face grey and drawn and old , came to her that afternoon and told her that Walter had been killed in action at Courcelette she crumpled up in a pitiful little heap of merciful unconsciousness in his arms ."
Nor did she waken to her pain for many hours .
"CHAPTER XXIII `` AND SO , GOODNIGHT '' The fierce flame of agony had burned itself out and the grey dust of its ashes was over all the world ."
Rilla 's younger life recovered physically sooner than her mother .
For weeks Mrs. Blythe lay ill from grief and shock .
"Rilla found it was possible to go on with existence , since existence had still to be reckoned with ."
"There was work to be done , for Susan could not do all ."
"For her mother 's sake she had to put on calmness and endurance as a garment in the day ; but night after night she lay in her bed , weeping the bitter rebellious tears of youth until at last tears were all wept out and the little patient ache that was to be in her heart until she died took their place ."
"She clung to Miss Oliver , who knew what to say and what not to say ."
So few people did .
"Kind , well-meaning callers and comforters gave Rilla some terrible moments ."
"`` You 'll get over it in time , '' Mrs. William Reese said , cheerfully ."
"Mrs. Reese had three stalwart sons , not one of whom had gone to the front ."
"`` It 's such a blessing it was Walter who was taken and not Jem , '' said Miss Sarah Clow ."
"`` Walter was a member of the church , and Jem was n't ."
I 've told Mr. Meredith many a time that he should have spoken seriously to Jem about it before he went away . ''
"`` Pore , pore Walter , '' sighed Mrs. Reese ."
"`` Do not you come here calling him poor Walter , '' said Susan indignantly , appearing in the kitchen door , much to the relief of Rilla , who felt that she could endure no more just then ."
`` He was not poor .
He was richer than any of you .
"It is you who stay at home and will not let your sons go who are poor -- poor and naked and mean and small -- pisen poor , and so are your sons , with all their prosperous farms and fat cattle and their souls no bigger than a flea 's -- if as big . ''"
"`` I came here to comfort the afflicted and not to be insulted , '' said Mrs. Reese , taking her departure , unregretted by anyone ."
"Then the fire went out of Susan and she retreated to her kitchen , laid her faithful old head on the table and wept bitterly for a time ."
Then she went to work and ironed Jims 's little rompers .
Rilla scolded her gently for it when she herself came in to do it .
"`` I am not going to have you kill yourself working for any war-baby , '' Susan said obstinately ."
"`` Oh , I wish I could just keep on working all the time , Susan , '' cried poor Rilla ."
"He was a pale , tallowy creature , wanting two fingers of the left hand , and though he wore a cutlass , he did not look much like a fighter ."
"I had always my eye open for seafaring men , with one leg or two , and I remember this one puzzled me ."
"He was not sailorly , and yet he had a smack of the sea about him too ."
"I asked him what was for his service , and he said he would take rum ; but as I was going out of the room to fetch it , he sat down upon a table and motioned me to draw near ."
"I paused where I was , with my napkin in my hand ."
"`` Come here , sonny , '' says he ."
`` Come nearer here . ''
I took a step nearer .
`` Is this here table for my mate Bill ? ''
he asked with a kind of leer .
"I told him I did not know his mate Bill , and this was for a person who stayed in our house whom we called the captain ."
"`` Well , '' said he , `` my mate Bill would be called the captain , as like as not ."
"He has a cut on one cheek and a mighty pleasant way with him , particularly in drink , has my mate Bill ."
"We 'll put it , for argument like , that your captain has a cut on one cheek -- and we 'll put it , if you like , that that cheek 's the right one ."
"Ah , well !"
I told you .
"Now , is my mate Bill in this here house ? ''"
I told him he was out walking .
"`` Which way , sonny ?"
Which way is he gone ? ''
"And when I had pointed out the rock and told him how the captain was likely to return , and how soon , and answered a few other questions , `` Ah , '' said he , `` this 'll be as good as drink to my mate Bill . ''"
"The expression of his face as he said these words was not at all pleasant , and I had my own reasons for thinking that the stranger was mistaken , even supposing he meant what he said ."
"But it was no affair of mine , I thought ; and besides , it was difficult to know what to do ."
"The stranger kept hanging about just inside the inn door , peering round the corner like a cat waiting for a mouse ."
"Once I stepped out myself into the road , but he immediately called me back , and as I did not obey quick enough for his fancy , a most horrible change came over his tallowy face , and he ordered me in with an oath that made me jump ."
"As soon as I was back again he returned to his former manner , half fawning , half sneering , patted me on the shoulder , told me I was a good boy and he had taken quite a fancy to me ."
"`` I have a son of my own , '' said he , `` as like you as two blocks , and he 's all the pride of my ` art ."
"But the great thing for boys is discipline , sonny -- discipline ."
"Now , if you had sailed along of Bill , you would n't have stood there to be spoke to twice -- not you ."
"That was never Bill 's way , nor the way of sich as sailed with him ."
"And here , sure enough , is my mate Bill , with a spy-glass under his arm , bless his old ` art , to be sure ."
"You and me 'll just go back into the parlour , sonny , and get behind the door , and we 'll give Bill a little surprise -- bless his ` art , I say again . ''"
"I wish I knew , though , how one ought to see about changing one 's position ."
I should very much like to move about .
"If I only could , I would glide up and down the ice there , as I saw the boys doing ; but somehow or other , I do n't know how to run . '"
` Bow-wow ! '
barked the old yard-dog ; he was rather hoarse and could n't bark very well .
His hoarseness came on when he was a house-dog and used to lie in front of the stove .
` The sun will soon teach you to run !
"I saw that last winter with your predecessor , and farther back still with his predecessors !"
They have all run away ! ' '
"I do n't understand you , my friend , ' said the Snow-man ."
` That thing up there is to teach me to run ? '
He meant the moon .
"` Well , it certainly did run just now , for I saw it quite plainly over there , and now here it is on this side . '"
"` You know nothing at all about it , ' said the yard-dog ."
"` Why , you have only just been made ."
The thing you see there is the moon ; the other thing you saw going down the other side was the sun .
"He will come up again tomorrow morning , and will soon teach you how to run away down the gutter ."
The weather is going to change ; I feel it already by the pain in my left hind-leg ; the weather is certainly going to change . ' '
"I ca n't understand him , ' said the Snow-man ; ` but I have an idea that he is speaking of something unpleasant ."
"That thing that glares so , and then disappears , the sun , as he calls it , is not my friend ."
I know that by instinct . '
` Bow-wow ! '
"barked the yard-dog , and walked three times round himself , and then crept into his kennel to sleep ."
The weather really did change .
"Towards morning a dense damp fog lay over the whole neighbourhood ; later on came an icy wind , which sent the frost packing ."
"But when the sun rose , it was a glorious sight ."
"The trees and shrubs were covered with rime , and looked like a wood of coral , and every branch was thick with long white blossoms ."
"The most delicate twigs , which are lost among the foliage in summer-time , came now into prominence , and it was like a spider 's web of glistening white ."
"The lady-birches waved in the wind ; and when the sun shone , everything glittered and sparkled as if it were sprinkled with diamond dust , and great diamonds were lying on the snowy carpet ."
` Is n't it wonderful ? '
exclaimed a girl who was walking with a young man in the garden .
"They stopped near the Snow-man , and looked at the glistening trees ."
"I 'm glad ... I really feel the need of some diversion , for what with Anthony Pye in school and Davy Keith at home my nerves have had about all they can endure for one day . ''"
"IX A Question of Color `` That old nuisance of a Rachel Lynde was here again today , pestering me for a subscription towards buying a carpet for the vestry room , '' said Mr. Harrison wrathfully ."
`` I detest that woman more than anybody I know .
"She can put a whole sermon , text , comment , and application , into six words , and throw it at you like a brick . ''"
"Anne , who was perched on the edge of the veranda , enjoying the charm of a mild west wind blowing across a newly ploughed field on a gray November twilight and piping a quaint little melody among the twisted firs below the garden , turned her dreamy face over her shoulder ."
"`` The trouble is , you and Mrs. Lynde do n't understand one another , '' she explained ."
`` That is always what is wrong when people do n't like each other .
I did n't like Mrs. Lynde at first either ; but as soon as I came to understand her I learned to . ''
"`` Mrs. Lynde may be an acquired taste with some folks ; but I did n't keep on eating bananas because I was told I 'd learn to like them if I did , '' growled Mr. Harrison ."
"`` And as for understanding her , I understand that she is a confirmed busybody and I told her so . ''"
"`` Oh , that must have hurt her feelings very much , '' said Anne reproachfully ."
`` How could you say such a thing ?
I said some dreadful things to Mrs. Lynde long ago but it was when I had lost my temper .
I could n't say them DELIBERATELY . ''
`` It was the truth and I believe in telling the truth to everybody . ''
"`` But you do n't tell the whole truth , '' objected Anne ."
`` You only tell the disagreeable part of the truth .
"Now , you 've told me a dozen times that my hair was red , but you 've never once told me that I had a nice nose . ''"
"`` I daresay you know it without any telling , '' chuckled Mr. Harrison ."
`` I know I have red hair too ... although it 's MUCH darker than it used to be ... so there 's no need of telling me that either . ''
"`` Well , well , I 'll try and not mention it again since you 're so sensitive ."
"You must excuse me , Anne ."
I 've got a habit of being outspoken and folks must n't mind it . ''
`` But they ca n't help minding it .
And I do n't think it 's any help that it 's your habit .
"What would you think of a person who went about sticking pins and needles into people and saying , ` Excuse me , you must n't mind it ... it 's just a habit I 've got . '"
"You 'd think he was crazy , would n't you ?"
"And as for Mrs. Lynde being a busybody , perhaps she is ."
"But did you tell her she had a very kind heart and always helped the poor , and never said a word when Timothy Cotton stole a crock of butter out of her dairy and told his wife he 'd bought it from her ?"
Mrs. Cotton cast it up to her the next time they met that it tasted of turnips and Mrs. Lynde just said she was sorry it had turned out so poorly . ''
"`` I suppose she has some good qualities , '' conceded Mr. Harrison grudgingly ."
`` Most folks have .
"As for washing dishes , Mr. Harrison never made any pretence of doing it unless a rainy Sunday came ."
"Then he went to work and washed them all at once in the rainwater hogshead , and left them to drain dry ."
"Again , Mr. Harrison was `` close . ''"
When he was asked to subscribe to the Rev. Mr. Allan 's salary he said he 'd wait and see how many dollars ' worth of good he got out of his preaching first ... he did n't believe in buying a pig in a poke .
"And when Mrs. Lynde went to ask for a contribution to missions ... and incidentally to see the inside of the house ... he told her there were more heathens among the old woman gossips in Avonlea than anywhere else he knew of , and he 'd cheerfully contribute to a mission for Christianizing them if she 'd undertake it ."
"Mrs. Rachel got herself away and said it was a mercy poor Mrs. Robert Bell was safe in her grave , for it would have broken her heart to see the state of her house in which she used to take so much pride ."
"`` Why , she scrubbed the kitchen floor every second day , '' Mrs. Lynde told Marilla Cuthbert indignantly , `` and if you could see it now !"
I had to hold up my skirts as I walked across it . ''
"Finally , Mr. Harrison kept a parrot called Ginger ."
Nobody in Avonlea had ever kept a parrot before ; consequently that proceeding was considered barely respectable .
And such a parrot !
"If you took John Henry Carter 's word for it , never was such an unholy bird ."
It swore terribly .
Mrs. Carter would have taken John Henry away at once if she had been sure she could get another place for him .
"Besides , Ginger had bitten a piece right out of the back of John Henry 's neck one day when he had stooped down too near the cage ."
Mrs. Carter showed everybody the mark when the luckless John Henry went home on Sundays .
"All these things flashed through Anne 's mind as Mr. Harrison stood , quite speechless with wrath apparently , before her ."
"In his most amiable mood Mr. Harrison could not have been considered a handsome man ; he was short and fat and bald ; and now , with his round face purple with rage and his prominent blue eyes almost sticking out of his head , Anne thought he was really the ugliest person she had ever seen ."
All at once Mr. Harrison found his voice .
"`` I 'm not going to put up with this , '' he spluttered , `` not a day longer , do you hear , miss ."
"Bless my soul , this is the third time , miss ... the third time !"
"Patience has ceased to be a virtue , miss ."
"I warned your aunt the last time not to let it occur again ... and she 's let it ... she 's done it ... what does she mean by it , that is what I want to know ."
"That is what I 'm here about , miss . ''"
`` Will you explain what the trouble is ? ''
"asked Anne , in her most dignified manner ."
She had been practicing it considerably of late to have it in good working order when school began ; but it had no apparent effect on the irate J. A. Harrison .
"`` Trouble , is it ?"
"Bless my soul , trouble enough , I should think ."
"The trouble is , miss , that I found that Jersey cow of your aunt 's in my oats again , not half an hour ago ."
"The third time , mark you ."
I found her in last Tuesday and I found her in yesterday .
Never to feel that perhaps her eyes rested on him now and then as he went about his work in the valley fields !
Never to stoop with a glad thrill over the first spring flowers because it was his privilege to take them to her !
Jeffrey groaned aloud .
"No , he could not go up to see her that night ; he must wait -- he must strengthen himself ."
Then his heart rebuked him .
This was selfishness ; this was putting his own feelings before hers -- a thing he had sworn never to do .
Perhaps she needed him -- perhaps she had wondered why he had not come to offer her such poor service as might be in his power .
"He turned and went down through the orchard lane , taking the old field-path across the valley and up the hill , which he had traversed so often and so joyfully in boyhood ."
"It was dark now , and a few stars were shining in the silvery sky ."
The wind sighed among the pines as he walked under them .
Sometimes he felt that he must turn back -- that his pain was going to master him ; then he forced himself to go on .
"The old grey house where Sara lived seemed bleak and stricken in the dull light , with its leafless vines clinging to it ."
There were no lights in it .
It looked like a home left soulless .
Jeffrey went around to the garden door and knocked .
"He had expected the maid to open it , put Sara herself came ."
"`` Why , Jeff , '' she said , with pleasure in her tones ."
`` I am so glad to see you .
I have been wondering why you had not come before . ''
"`` I did not think you would want to see me yet , '' he said hurriedly ."
`` I have thought about you every hour -- but I feared to intrude . '' ''
"You could n't intrude , '' she said gently ."
"`` Yes , I have wanted to see you , Jeff ."
Come into the library . ''
He followed her into the room where they had always sat in his rare calls .
Sara lighted the lamp on the table .
"As the light shot up she stood clearly revealed in it -- a tall , slender woman in a trailing gown of grey ."
"Even a stranger , not knowing her age , would have guessed it to be what it was , yet it would have been hard to say what gave the impression of maturity ."
"Her face was quite unlined -- a little pale , perhaps , with more finely cut outlines than those of youth ."
"Her eyes were clear and bright ; her abundant brown hair waved back from her face in the same curves that Jeffrey had noted in the purple-gowned child of six , under the pines ."
Perhaps it was the fine patience and serenity in her face that told her tale of years .
Youth can never acquire it .
That is not the way God works .
"But work He does , Miss Oliver , and in the end His purpose will be fulfilled . ''"
"`` Sound and orthodox -- sound and orthodox , '' muttered Susan approvingly in the kitchen ."
Susan liked to see Miss Oliver sat upon by the minister now and then .
"Susan was very fond of her but she thought Miss Oliver liked saying heretical things to ministers far too well , and deserved an occasional reminder that these matters were quite beyond her province ."
In May Walter wrote home that he had been awarded a D.C. Medal .
"He did not say what for , but the other boys took care that the Glen should know the brave thing Walter had done ."
"`` In any war but this , '' wrote Jerry Meredith , `` it would have meant a V.C. ."
But they ca n't make V.C. 's as common as the brave things done every day here . ''
"`` He should have had the V.C. , '' said Susan , and was very indignant over it ."
"She was not quite sure who was to blame for his not getting it , but if it were General Haig she began for the first time to entertain serious doubts as to his fitness for being Commander-in-Chief ."
Rilla was beside herself with delight .
"It was her dear Walter who had done this thing -- Walter , to whom someone had sent a white feather at Redmond -- it was Walter who had dashed back from the safety of the trench to drag in a wounded comrade who had fallen on No-man 's - land ."
"Oh , she could see his white beautiful face and wonderful eyes as he did it !"
What a thing to be the sister of such a hero !
And he had n't thought it worth while writing about .
His letter was full of other things -- little intimate things that they two had known and loved together in the dear old cloudless days of a century ago .
"`` I 've been thinking of the daffodils in the garden at Ingleside , '' he wrote ."
"`` By the time you get this they will be out , blowing there under that lovely rosy sky ."
"Are they really as bright and golden as ever , Rilla ?"
It seems to me that they must be dyed red with blood -- like our poppies here .
And every whisper of spring will be falling as a violet in Rainbow Valley .
"`` There is a young moon tonight -- a slender , silver , lovely thing hanging over these pits of torment ."
Will you see it tonight over the maple grove ?
"`` I 'm enclosing a little scrap of verse , Rilla ."
I wrote it one evening in my trench dug-out by the light of a bit of candle -- or rather it came to me there -- I did n't feel as if I were writing it -- something seemed to use me as an instrument .
"I 've had that feeling once or twice before , but very rarely and never so strongly as this time ."
That was why I sent it over to the London Spectator .
It printed it and the copy came today .
I hope you 'll like it .
It 's the only poem I 've written since I came overseas . ''
"The poem was a short , poignant little thing ."
"Rilla , be awfully good to mother while I 'm away ."
It must be a horrible thing to be a mother in this war -- the mothers and sisters and wives and sweethearts have the hardest times .
"Rilla , you beautiful little thing , are you anybody 's sweetheart ?"
"If you are , tell me before I go . ''"
"`` No , '' said Rilla ."
"Then , impelled by a wish to be absolutely frank with Walter in this talk that might be the last they would ever have , she added , blushing wildly in the moonlight , `` but if -- Kenneth Ford -- wanted me to be -- '' `` I see , '' said Walter ."
"`` And Ken 's in khaki , too ."
"Poor little girlie , it 's a bit hard for you all round ."
"Well , I 'm not leaving any girl to break her heart about me -- thank God for that . ''"
Rilla glanced up at the Manse on the hill .
She could see a light in Una Meredith 's window .
She felt tempted to say something -- then she knew she must not .
"It was not her secret : and , anyway , she did not know -- she only suspected ."
Walter looked about him lingeringly and lovingly .
This spot had always been so dear to him .
What fun they all had had here lang syne .
"Phantoms of memory seemed to pace the dappled paths and peep merrily through the swinging boughs -- Jem and Jerry , bare-legged , sunburned schoolboys , fishing in the brook and frying trout over the old stone fireplace ; Nan and Di and Faith , in their dimpled , fresh-eyed childish beauty ; Una the sweet and shy , Carl , poring over ants and bugs , little slangy , sharp-tongued , good-hearted Mary Vance -- the old Walter that had been himself lying on the grass reading poetry or wandering through palaces of fancy ."
They were all there around him -- he could see them almost as plainly as he saw Rilla -- as plainly as he had once seen the Pied Piper piping down the valley in a vanished twilight .
"And they said to him , those gay little ghosts of other days , `` We were the children of yesterday , Walter -- fight a good fight for the children of to-day and to-morrow . ''"
"`` Where are you , Walter , '' cried Rilla , laughing a little ."
`` Come back -- come back . ''
Walter came back with a long breath .
"He stood up and looked about him at the beautiful valley of moonlight , as if to impress on his mind and heart every charm it possessed -- the great dark plumes of the firs against the silvery sky , the stately White Lady , the old magic of the dancing brook , the faithful Tree Lovers , the beckoning , tricksy paths ."
"`` I shall see it so in my dreams , '' he said , as he turned away ."
They went back to Ingleside .
"Mr. and Mrs. Meredith were there , with Gertrude Oliver , who had come from Lowbridge to say good-bye ."
"Everybody was quite cheerful and bright , but nobody said much about the war being soon over , as they had said when Jem went away ."
They did not talk about the war at all -- and they thought of nothing else .
"At last they gathered around the piano and sang the grand old hymn : `` Oh God , our help in ages past Our hope for years to come ."
Our shelter from the stormy blast And our eternal home . ''
"`` We all come back to God in these days of soul-sifting , '' said Gertrude to John Meredith ."
`` There have been many days in the past when I did n't believe in God -- not as God -- only as the impersonal Great First Cause of the scientists .
"It looked strange enough , to see all this wealth in a nest upon a cliff-side , wattled about growing trees ."
"And even then , I thought it seemed deep water for Alan to be riding , who had no better battle-horse than a green purse and a matter of five pounds ."
"The luck , it seems , changed on the second day ."
"About noon I was wakened as usual for dinner , and as usual refused to eat , and was given a dram with some bitter infusion which the barber had prescribed ."
"The sun was shining in at the open door of the Cage , and this dazzled and offended me ."
"Cluny sat at the table , biting the pack of cards ."
"Alan had stooped over the bed , and had his face close to my eyes ; to which , troubled as they were with the fever , it seemed of the most shocking bigness ."
He asked me for a loan of my money .
`` What for ? ''
"said I. `` O , just for a loan , '' said he ."
`` But why ? ''
I repeated .
`` I do n't see . ''
"`` Hut , David ! ''"
"said Alan , `` ye wouldnae grudge me a loan ? ''"
"I would , though , if I had had my senses !"
"But all I thought of then was to get his face away , and I handed him my money ."
"On the morning of the third day , when we had been forty-eight hours in the Cage , I awoke with a great relief of spirits , very weak and weary indeed , but seeing things of the right size and with their honest , everyday appearance ."
"I had a mind to eat , moreover , rose from bed of my own movement , and as soon as we had breakfasted , stepped to the entry of the Cage and sat down outside in the top of the wood ."
"It was a grey day with a cool , mild air : and I sat in a dream all morning , only disturbed by the passing by of Cluny 's scouts and servants coming with provisions and reports ; for as the coast was at that time clear , you might almost say he held court openly ."
"When I returned , he and Alan had laid the cards aside , and were questioning a gillie ; and the chief turned about and spoke to me in the Gaelic ."
"`` I have no Gaelic , sir , '' said I ."
"Now since the card question , everything I said or did had the power of annoying Cluny ."
"`` Your name has more sense than yourself , then , '' said he angrily , `` for it 's good Gaelic ."
But the point is this .
"My scout reports all clear in the south , and the question is , have ye the strength to go ? ''"
"I saw cards on the table , but no gold ; only a heap of little written papers , and these all on Cluny 's side ."
"Alan , besides , had an odd look , like a man not very well content ; and I began to have a strong misgiving ."
"`` I do not know if I am as well as I should be , '' said I , looking at Alan ; `` but the little money we have has a long way to carry us . ''"
"Alan took his under-lip into his mouth , and looked upon the ground ."
"`` David , '' says he at last , `` I 've lost it ; there 's the naked truth . ''"
`` My money too ? ''
"I told him not at all ; that I had seen much to admire among the Highlanders ; and if he came to that , Mr. Campbell himself was a Highlander ."
"`` Ay , '' said he , `` that 's true ."
It 's a fine blood . ''
`` And what is the King 's agent about ? ''
I asked .
`` Colin Campbell ? ''
says Henderland .
`` Putting his head in a bees ' byke ! ''
"`` He is to turn the tenants out by force , I hear ? ''"
"said I. `` Yes , '' says he , `` but the business has gone back and forth , as folk say ."
"First , James of the Glens rode to Edinburgh , and got some lawyer -LRB- a Stewart , nae doubt -- they all hing together like bats in a steeple -RRB- and had the proceedings stayed ."
"And then Colin Campbell cam ' in again , and had the upper-hand before the Barons of Exchequer ."
And now they tell me the first of the tenants are to flit to-morrow .
"It 's to begin at Duror under James 's very windows , which doesnae seem wise by my humble way of it . ''"
`` Do you think they 'll fight ? ''
I asked .
"`` Well , '' says Henderland , `` they 're disarmed -- or supposed to be -- for there 's still a good deal of cold iron lying by in quiet places ."
And then Colin Campbell has the sogers coming .
"But for all that , if I was his lady wife , I wouldnae be well pleased till I got him home again ."
"They 're queer customers , the Appin Stewarts . ''"
I asked if they were worse than their neighbours .
"`` No they , '' said he ."
`` And that 's the worst part of it .
"For if Colin Roy can get his business done in Appin , he has it all to begin again in the next country , which they call Mamore , and which is one of the countries of the Camerons ."
"He 's King 's Factor upon both , and from both he has to drive out the tenants ; and indeed , Mr. Balfour -LRB- to be open with ye -RRB- , it 's my belief that if he escapes the one lot , he 'll get his death by the other . ''"
"So we continued talking and walking the great part of the day ; until at last , Mr. Henderland after expressing his delight in my company , and satisfaction at meeting with a friend of Mr. Campbell 's -LRB- `` whom , '' says he , `` I will make bold to call that sweet singer of our covenanted Zion '' -RRB- , proposed that I should make a short stage , and lie the night in his house a little beyond Kingairloch ."
"To say truth , I was overjoyed ; for I had no great desire for John of the Claymore , and since my double misadventure , first with the guide and next with the gentleman skipper , I stood in some fear of any Highland stranger ."
"Accordingly we shook hands upon the bargain , and came in the afternoon to a small house , standing alone by the shore of the Linnhe Loch ."
"The sun was already gone from the desert mountains of Ardgour upon the hither side , but shone on those of Appin on the farther ; the loch lay as still as a lake , only the gulls were crying round the sides of it ; and the whole place seemed solemn and uncouth ."
"We had no sooner come to the door of Mr. Henderland 's dwelling , than to my great surprise -LRB- for I was now used to the politeness of Highlanders -RRB- he burst rudely past me , dashed into the room , caught up a jar and a small horn-spoon , and began ladling snuff into his nose in most excessive quantities ."
"Then he had a hearty fit of sneezing , and looked round upon me with a rather silly smile ."
"`` It 's a vow I took , '' says he ."
Richard of Gloucester flushed .
"`` Mark it right well , '' he said , harshly ."
"`` I love not mercy , nor yet mercymongers ."
Ye have this day laid the foundations of high fortune .
"If ye oppose to me my word , which I have plighted , I will yield ."
"But , by the glory of heaven , there your favour dies !"
"`` Mine is the loss , '' said Dick ."
"`` Give him his sailor , '' said the duke ; and wheeling his horse , he turned his back upon young Shelton ."
Dick was nor glad nor sorry .
He had seen too much of the young duke to set great store on his affection ; and the origin and growth of his own favour had been too flimsy and too rapid to inspire much confidence .
One thing alone he feared -- that the vindictive leader might revoke the offer of the lances .
"But here he did justice neither to Gloucester 's honour -LRB- such as it was -RRB- nor , above all , to his decision ."
"If he had once judged Dick to be the right man to pursue Sir Daniel , he was not one to change ; and he soon proved it by shouting after Catesby to be speedy , for the paladin was waiting ."
"In the meanwhile , Dick turned to the old shipman , who had seemed equally indifferent to his condemnation and to his subsequent release ."
"`` Arblaster , '' said Dick , `` I have done you ill ; but now , by the rood , I think I have cleared the score . ''"
But the old skipper only looked upon him dully and held his peace .
"`` Come , '' continued Dick , `` a life is a life , old shrew , and it is more than ships or liquor ."
"Say ye forgive me ; for if your life be worth nothing to you , it hath cost me the beginnings of my fortune ."
"Come , I have paid for it dearly ; be not so churlish . ''"
"`` An I had had my ship , '' said Arblaster , `` I would ` a ' been forth and safe on the high seas -- I and my man Tom ."
"But ye took my ship , gossip , and I 'm a beggar ; and for my man Tom , a knave fellow in russet shot him down ."
` Murrain ! '
"quoth he , and spake never again ."
"` Murrain ' was the last of his words , and the poor spirit of him passed . '"
"A will never sail no more , will my Tom . ' ''"
"Dick was seized with unavailing penitence and pity ; he sought to take the skipper 's hand , but Arblaster avoided his touch ."
"`` Nay , '' said he , `` let be ."
"Y ' have played the devil with me , and let that content you . ''"
The words died in Richard 's throat .
"He saw , through tears , the poor old man , bemused with liquor and sorrow , go shambling away , with bowed head , across the snow , and the unnoticed dog whimpering at his heels , and for the first time began to understand the desperate game that we play in life ; and how a thing once done is not to be changed or remedied , by any penitence ."
But there was no time left to him for vain regret .
"Catesby had now collected the horsemen , and riding up to Dick he dismounted , and offered him his own horse ."
` It 's true I have n't lost a husband -- I have only lost the man who would have been my husband .
I have lost no son -- only the sons and daughters who might have been born to me -- who will never be born to me now . ' ''
"` It is n't ladylike to talk like that , ' said Cousin Sophia in a shocked tone ; and then Gertrude laughed right out , so wildly that Cousin Sophia was really frightened ."
"And when poor tortured Gertrude , unable to endure it any longer , hurried out of the room , Cousin Sophia asked mother if the blow had n't affected Miss Oliver 's mind . '' '"
"I suffered the loss of two good kind partners , ' she said , ` but it did not affect me like that . '"
`` I should think it would n't !
Those poor men must have been thankful to die .
`` I heard Gertrude walking up and down her room most of the night .
She walked like that every night .
But never so long as that night .
And once I heard her give a dreadful sudden little cry as if she had been stabbed .
I could n't sleep for suffering with her ; and I could n't help her .
I thought the night would never end .
But it did ; and then ` joy came in the morning ' as the Bible says .
Only it did n't come exactly in the morning but well along in the afternoon .
The telephone rang and I answered it .
"It was old Mrs. Grant speaking from Charlottetown , and her news was that it was all a mistake -- Robert was n't killed at all ; he had only been slightly wounded in the arm and was safe in the hospital out of harm 's way for a time anyhow ."
They had n't learned yet how the mistake had happened but supposed there must have been another Robert Grant .
`` I hung up the telephone and flew to Rainbow Valley .
I 'm sure I did fly -- I ca n't remember my feet ever touching the ground .
"I met Gertrude on her way home from school in the glade of spruces where we used to play , and I just gasped out the news to her ."
"I ought to have had more sense , of course ."
But I was so crazy with joy and excitement that I never stopped to think .
Gertrude just dropped there among the golden young ferns as if she had been shot .
The fright it gave me ought to make me sensible -- in this respect at least -- for the rest of my life .
I thought I had killed her -- I remembered that her mother had died very suddenly from heart failure when quite a young woman .
It seemed years to me before I discovered that her heart was still beating .
A pretty time I had !
"I never saw anybody faint before , and I knew there was nobody up at the house to help , because everybody else had gone to the station to meet Di and Nan coming home from Redmond ."
"But I knew -- theoretically -- how people in a faint should be treated , and now I know it practically ."
"Luckily the brook was handy , and after I had worked frantically over her for a while Gertrude came back to life ."
She never said one word about my news and I did n't dare to refer to it again .
Dick bounded to his side and raised him .
His face desperately worked ; his whole body was shaken by contorting spasms .
`` Is the arrow black ? ''
he gasped .
"`` It is black , '' replied Dick , gravely ."
"And then , before he could add one word , a desperate seizure of pain shook the wounded man from head to foot , so that his body leaped in Dick 's supporting arms , and with the extremity of that pang his spirit fled in silence ."
"The young man laid him back gently on the snow and prayed for that unprepared and guilty spirit , and as he prayed the sun came up at a bound , and the robins began chirping in the ivy ."
"When he rose to his feet , he found another man upon his knees but a few steps behind him , and , still with uncovered head , he waited until that prayer also should be over ."
"It took long ; the man , with his head bowed and his face covered with his hands , prayed like one in a great disorder or distress of mind ; and by the bow that lay beside him , Dick judged that he was no other than the archer who had laid Sir Daniel low ."
"At length he , also , rose , and showed the countenance of Ellis Duckworth ."
"`` Richard , '' he said , very gravely , `` I heard you ."
"Ye took the better part and pardoned ; I took the worse , and there lies the clay of mine enemy ."
Pray for me . ''
And he wrung him by the hand .
"`` Sir , '' said Richard , `` I will pray for you , indeed ; though how I may prevail I wot not ."
"But if ye have so long pursued revenge , and find it now of such a sorry flavour , bethink ye , were it not well to pardon others ?"
"Hatch -- he is dead , poor shrew !"
"I would have spared a better ; and for Sir Daniel , here lies his body ."
"But for the priest , if I might anywise prevail , I would have you let him go . ''"
A flash came into the eyes of Ellis Duckworth .
"`` Nay , '' he said , `` the devil is still strong within me ."
But be at rest ; the Black Arrow flieth nevermore -- the fellowship is broken .
"They that still live shall come to their quiet and ripe end , in Heaven 's good time , for me ; and for yourself , go where your better fortune calls you , and think no more of Ellis . ''"
"CHAPTER VIII -- CONCLUSION About nine in the morning , Lord Foxham was leading his ward , once more dressed as befitted her sex , and followed by Alicia Risingham , to the church of Holywood , when Richard Crookback , his brow already heavy with cares , crossed their path and paused ."
`` Is this the maid ? ''
"he asked ; and when Lord Foxham had replied in the affirmative , `` Minion , '' he added , `` hold up your face until I see its favour . ''"
He looked upon her sourly for a little .
"`` Ye are fair , '' he said at last , `` and , as they tell me , dowered ."
"How if I offered you a brave marriage , as became your face and parentage ? ''"
"`` My lord duke , '' replied Joanna , `` may it please your grace , I had rather wed with Sir Richard . ''"
`` How so ? ''
"he asked , harshly ."
I met another clever man a few evenings ago .
A lot of us went for a sail on the harbour .
Mrs. Braddon 's house party came too .
We had three big white boats that skimmed down the moonlit channel like great white sea birds .
"There was another boat far across the harbour , and the people in it were singing ."
"The music drifted over the water to us , so sad and sweet and beguiling that I could have cried for very pleasure ."
One of Mrs. Braddon 's guests said to me : `` That is the soul of music with all its sense and earthliness refined away . ''
I had n't thought about him before -- I had n't even caught his name in the general introduction .
"He was a tall , slight man , with a worn , sensitive face and iron-grey hair -- a quiet man who had n't laughed or talked ."
"But he began to talk to me then , and I forgot all about the others ."
I never had listened to anybody in the least like him .
"He talked of books and music , of art and travel ."
"He had been all over the world , and had seen everything everybody else had seen and everything they had n't too , I think ."
"I seemed to be looking into an enchanted mirror where all my own dreams and ideals were reflected back to me , but made , oh , so much more beautiful !"
On my way home after the Braddon people had left us somebody asked me how I liked Paul Moore !
"The man I had been talking with was Paul Moore , the great novelist !"
I was almost glad I had n't known it while he was talking to me -- I should have been too awed and reverential to have really enjoyed his conversation .
"As it was , I had contradicted him twice , and he had laughed and liked it ."
"But his books will always have a new meaning to me henceforth , through the insight he himself has given me ."
It is such meetings as these that give life its sparkle for me .
But much of its abiding sweetness comes from my friendship with Margaret Raleigh .
You will be weary of my rhapsodies over her .
"But she is such a rare and wonderful woman ; much older then I am , but so young in heart and soul and freshness of feeling !"
"She is to me mother and sister and wise , clear-sighted friend ."
To her I go with all my perplexities and hopes and triumphs .
She has sympathy and understanding for my every mood .
I love life so much for giving me such a friendship !
This morning I wakened at dawn and stole away to the shore before anyone else was up .
I had a delightful run-away .
"The long , low-lying meadows between `` The Evergreens '' and the shore were dewy and fresh in that first light , that was as fine and purely tinted as the heart of one of my white roses ."
"On the beach the water was purring in little blue ripples , and , oh , the sunrise out there beyond the harbour !"
All the eastern Heaven was abloom with it .
"He could sleep in the air without falling , by merely lying on his back and floating , but this was , partly at least , because he was so light that if you got behind him and blew he went faster ."
"` Do be more polite to him , ' Wendy whispered to John , when they were playing ` Follow my Leader . '"
"` Then tell him to stop showing off , ' said John ."
"When playing Follow my Leader , Peter would fly close to the water and touch each shark 's tail in passing , just as in the street you may run your finger along an iron railing ."
"They could not follow him in this with much success , so perhaps it was rather like showing off , especially as he kept looking behind to see how many tails they missed ."
"` You must be nice to him , ' Wendy impressed on her brothers ."
` What could we do if he were to leave us ? '
"` We could go back , ' Michael said ."
` How could we ever find our way back without him ? '
"` Well , then , we could go on , ' said John ."
"` That is the awful thing , John ."
"We should have to go on , for we do n't know how to stop . '"
This was true ; Peter had forgotten to show them how to stop .
"John said that if the worst came to the worst , all they had to do was to go straight on , for the world was round , and so in time they must come back to their own window ."
"` And who is to get food for us , John ? ' '"
"I nipped a bit out of that eagle 's mouth pretty neatly , Wendy . '"
"` After the twentieth try , ' Wendy reminded him ."
"` And even though we became good at picking up food , see how we bump against clouds and things if he is not near to give us a hand . '"
Indeed they were constantly bumping .
"They could now fly strongly , though they still kicked far too much ; but if they saw a cloud in front of them , the more they tried to avoid it , the more certainly did they bump into it ."
"If Nana had been with them , she would have had a bandage round Michael 's forehead by this time ."
"Peter was not with them for the moment , and they felt rather lonely up there by themselves ."
"He could go so much faster than they that he would suddenly shoot out of sight , to have some adventure in which they had no share ."
"He would come down laughing over something fearfully funny he had been saying to a star , but he had already forgotten what it was , or he would come up with mermaid scales still sticking to him , and yet not be able to say for certain what had been happening ."
It was really rather irritating to children who had never seen a mermaid .
"` And if he forgets them , so quickly , ' Wendy argued , ` how can we expect that he will go on remembering us ? '"
"Indeed , sometimes when he returned he did not remember them , at least not well ."
Wendy was sure of it .
She saw recognition come into his eyes as he was about to pass them the time of day and go on ; once even she had to tell him her name .
"` I 'm Wendy , ' she said agitatedly ."
He was very sorry . '
"I say , Wendy , ' he whispered to her , ` always if you see me forgetting you , just keep on saying `` I 'm Wendy , '' and then I 'll remember . '"
"As we went , he stopped and spoke with all the wayfarers and workers that we met or passed ; and though of course I could not tell what they discoursed about , yet I judged Mr. Henderland must be well liked in the countryside , for I observed many of them to bring out their mulls and share a pinch of snuff with him ."
"I told him as far in my affairs as I judged wise ; as far , that is , as they were none of Alan 's ; and gave Balachulish as the place I was travelling to , to meet a friend ; for I thought Aucharn , or even Duror , would be too particular , and might put him on the scent ."
"On his part , he told me much of his work and the people he worked among , the hiding priests and Jacobites , the Disarming Act , the dress , and many other curiosities of the time and place ."
"He seemed moderate ; blaming Parliament in several points , and especially because they had framed the Act more severely against those who wore the dress than against those who carried weapons ."
"This moderation put it in my mind to question him of the Red Fox and the Appin tenants ; questions which , I thought , would seem natural enough in the mouth of one travelling to that country ."
He said it was a bad business .
"`` It 's wonderful , '' said he , `` where the tenants find the money , for their life is mere starvation ."
"-LRB- Ye do n't carry such a thing as snuff , do ye , Mr. Balfour ?"
No .
"Well , I 'm better wanting it . -RRB-"
But these tenants -LRB- as I was saying -RRB- are doubtless partly driven to it .
"James Stewart in Duror -LRB- that 's him they call James of the Glens -RRB- is half-brother to Ardshiel , the captain of the clan ; and he is a man much looked up to , and drives very hard ."
And then there 's one they call Alan Breck -- '' `` Ah ! ''
"I cried , `` what of him ? ''"
`` What of the wind that bloweth where it listeth ? ''
said Henderland .
`` He 's here and awa ; here to-day and gone to-morrow : a fair heather-cat .
"He might be glowering at the two of us out of yon whin-bush , and I wouldnae wonder !"
"Ye 'll no carry such a thing as snuff , will ye ? ''"
"I told him no , and that he had asked the same thing more than once ."
"`` It 's highly possible , '' said he , sighing ."
`` But it seems strange ye shouldnae carry it .
"However , as I was saying , this Alan Breck is a bold , desperate customer , and well kent to be James 's right hand ."
"His life is forfeit already ; he would boggle at naething ; and maybe , if a tenant-body was to hang back he would get a dirk in his wame . ''"
"`` You make a poor story of it all , Mr. Henderland , '' said I. `` If it is all fear upon both sides , I care to hear no more of it . ''"
"`` Na , '' said Mr. Henderland , `` but there 's love too , and self-denial that should put the like of you and me to shame ."
"There 's something fine about it ; no perhaps Christian , but humanly fine ."
"Even Alan Breck , by all that I hear , is a chield to be respected ."
"There 's many a lying sneck-draw sits close in kirk in our own part of the country , and stands well in the world 's eye , and maybe is a far worse man , Mr. Balfour , than yon misguided shedder of man 's blood ."
"Ay , ay , we might take a lesson by them ."
-- Ye 'll perhaps think I 've been too long in the Hielands ? ''
"he added , smiling to me ."
I hung on to my blue straw sailor as long as I could .
How I hate the green velvet hat !
It is so elaborate and conspicuous .
I do n't see how I could ever have liked it .
But I vowed to wear it and wear it I will .
`` Shirley and I went down to the station this morning to take Little Dog Monday a bang-up Christmas dinner .
"Dog Monday waits and watches there still , with just as much hope and confidence as ever ."
Sometimes he hangs around the station house and talks to people and the rest of his time he sits at his little kennel door and watches the track unwinkingly .
We never try to coax him home now : we know it is of no use .
"When Jem comes back , Monday will come home with him ; and if Jem -- never comes back -- Monday will wait there for him as long as his dear dog heart goes on beating ."
`` Fred Arnold was here last night .
He was eighteen in November and is going to enlist just as soon as his mother is over an operation she has to have .
"He has been coming here very often lately and though I like him so much it makes me uncomfortable , because I am afraid he is thinking that perhaps I could care something for him ."
"I ca n't tell him about Ken -- because , after all , what is there to tell ?"
And yet I do n't like to behave coldly and distantly when he will be going away so soon .
It is very perplexing .
I remember I used to think it would be such fun to have dozens of beaux -- and now I 'm worried to death because two are too many .
`` I am learning to cook .
Susan is teaching me .
"I tried to learn long ago -- but no , let me be honest -- Susan tried to teach me , which is a very different thing ."
I never seemed to succeed with anything and I got discouraged .
But since the boys have gone away I wanted to be able to make cake and things for them myself and so I started in again and this time I 'm getting on surprisingly well .
"Susan says it is all in the way I hold my mouth and father says my subconscious mind is desirous of learning now , and I dare say they 're both right ."
"Anyhow , I can make dandy short-bread and fruitcake ."
"I got ambitious last week and attempted cream puffs , but made an awful failure of them ."
They came out of the oven flat as flukes .
I thought maybe the cream would fill them up again and make them plump but it did n't .
I think Susan was secretly pleased .
She is past mistress in the art of making cream puffs and it would break her heart if anyone else here could make them as well .
"I wonder if Susan tampered -- but no , I wo n't suspect her of such a thing ."
"`` Miranda Pryor spent an afternoon here a few days ago , helping me cut out certain Red Cross garments known by the charming name of ` vermin shirts . '"
"Susan thinks that name is not quite decent , so I suggested she call them ` cootie sarks , ' which is old Highland Sandy 's version of it ."
"`` It may be what it will , '' returned Dick ; `` and it must be as heaven please ."
"Reck we not a jot , but push on the livelier , and put it to the touch ."
"Up , friends -- enough breathed . ''"
"As they advanced , the snow became more and more trampled with hoof-marks , and it was plain that they were drawing near to the encampment of a considerable force of mounted men ."
"Presently they could see the smoke pouring from among the trees , ruddily coloured on its lower edge and scattering bright sparks ."
"And here , pursuant to Dick 's orders , his men began to open out , creeping stealthily in the covert , to surround on every side the camp of their opponents ."
"He himself , placing Alicia in the shelter of a bulky oak , stole straight forth in the direction of the fire ."
"At last , through an opening of the wood , his eye embraced the scene of the encampment ."
"The fire had been built upon a heathy hummock of the ground , surrounded on three sides by thicket , and it now burned very strong , roaring aloud and brandishing flames ."
"Around it there sat not quite a dozen people , warmly cloaked ; but though the neighbouring snow was trampled down as by a regiment , Dick looked in vain for any horse ."
He began to have a terrible misgiving that he was out-manoeuvred .
"At the same time , in a tall man with a steel salet , who was spreading his hands before the blaze , he recognised his old friend and still kindly enemy , Bennet Hatch ; and in two others , sitting a little back , he made out , even in their male disguise , Joanna Sedley and Sir Daniel 's wife ."
"`` Well , '' thought he to himself , `` even if I lose my horses , let me get my Joanna , and why should I complain ? ''"
"And then , from the further side of the encampment , there came a little whistle , announcing that his men had joined , and the investment was complete ."
"Bennet , at the sound , started to his feet ; but ere he had time to spring upon his arms , Dick hailed him ."
"`` Bennet , '' he said -- `` Bennet , old friend , yield ye ."
"Ye will but spill men 's lives in vain , if ye resist . '' ''"
"'T is Master Shelton , by St. Barbary ! ''"
cried Hatch .
`` Yield me ?
Ye ask much .
What force have ye ? ''
"`` I tell you , Bennet , ye are both outnumbered and begirt , '' said Dick ."
`` Caesar and Charlemagne would cry for quarter .
"I have two score men at my whistle , and with one shoot of arrows I could answer for you all . ''"
"`` Master Dick , '' said Bennet , `` it goes against my heart ; but I must do my duty ."
The saints help you ! ''
And therewith he raised a little tucket to his mouth and wound a rousing call .
"Then followed a moment of confusion ; for while Dick , fearing for the ladies , still hesitated to give the word to shoot , Hatch 's little band sprang to their weapons and formed back to back as for a fierce resistance ."
"In the hurry of their change of place , Joanna sprang from her seat and ran like an arrow to her lover 's side ."
"`` Here , Dick ! ''"
"she cried , as she clasped his hand in hers ."
"All are keeping a sharp look-out in front , but none suspects that the danger may be creeping up from behind ."
This shows how real the island was .
The first to fall out of the moving circle was the boys .
"They flung themselves down on the sward , close to their underground home . '"
"I do wish Peter would come back , ' every one of them said nervously , though in height and still more in breadth they were all larger than their captain . '"
"I am the only one who is not afraid of the pirates , ' Slightly said , in the tone that prevented his being a general favourite ; but perhaps some distant sound disturbed him , for he added hastily , ` but I wish he would come back , and tell us whether he has heard anything more about Cinderella . '"
"They talked of Cinderella , and Tootles was confident that his mother must have been very like her ."
"It was only in Peter 's absence that they could speak of mothers , the subject being forbidden by him as silly ."
"` All I remember about my mother , ' Nibs told them , ` is that she often said to father , `` Oh , how I wish I had a cheque-book of my own . ''"
"I do n't know what a cheque-book is , but I should just love to give my mother one . '"
While they talked they heard a distant sound .
"You or I , not being wild things of the woods , would have heard nothing , but they heard it , and it was the grim song : ` Yo ho , yo ho , the pirate life , The flag o ' skull and bones , A merry hour , a hempen rope , And hey for Davy Jones . '"
At once the lost boys -- but where are they ?
They are no longer there .
Rabbits could not have disappeared more quickly .
I will tell you where they are .
"With the exception of Nibs , who has darted away to reconnoitre , they are already in their home under the ground , a very delightful residence of which we shall see a good deal presently ."
But how have they reached it ?
"for there is no entrance to be seen , not so much as a pile of brushwood , which if removed would disclose the mouth of a cave ."
"Look closely , however , and you may note that there are here seven large trees , each having in its hollow trunk a hole as large as a boy ."
"These are the seven entrances to the home under the ground , for which Hook has been searching in vain these many moons ."
Will he find it to-night ?
"As the pirates advanced , the quick eye of Starkey sighted Nibs disappearing through the wood , and at once his pistol flashed out ."
But an iron claw gripped his shoulder .
"` Captain , let go , ' he cried , writhing ."
Now for the first time we hear the voice of Hook .
It was a black voice .
"` Put back that pistol first , ' it said threateningly ."
` It was one of those boys you hate .
I could have shot him dead . '
"` Ay , and the sound would have brought Tiger Lily 's redskins upon us ."
Do you want to lose your scalp ? '
he said .
`` Dinner ? ''
"`` Ay , sot , '' replied the cook , `` dinner it is , and a dry dinner , too , with neither ale nor bread ."
"But there is little pleasure in the greenwood now ; time was when a good fellow could live here like a mitred abbot , set aside the rain and the white frosts ; he had his heart 's desire both of ale and wine ."
"But now are men 's spirits dead ; and this John Amend-All , save us and guard us !"
but a stuffed booby to scare crows withal . ''
"`` Nay , '' returned the other , `` y ' are too set on meat and drinking , Lawless ."
Bide ye a bit ; the good time cometh . ''
"`` Look ye , '' returned the cook , `` I have even waited for this good time sith that I was so high ."
"I have been a grey friar ; I have been a king 's archer ; I have been a shipman , and sailed the salt seas ; and I have been in greenwood before this , forsooth !"
and shot the king 's deer .
What cometh of it ?
Naught !
I were better to have bided in the cloister .
John Abbot availeth more than John Amend-All .
By ' r Lady !
here they come . ''
"One after another , tall , likely fellows began to stroll into the lawn ."
"Each as he came produced a knife and a horn cup , helped himself from the caldron , and sat down upon the grass to eat ."
"They were very variously equipped and armed ; some in rusty smocks , and with nothing but a knife and an old bow ; others in the height of forest gallantry , all in Lincoln green , both hood and jerkin , with dainty peacock arrows in their belts , a horn upon a baldrick , and a sword and dagger at their sides ."
"They came in the silence of hunger , and scarce growled a salutation , but fell instantly to meat ."
"There were , perhaps , a score of them already gathered , when a sound of suppressed cheering arose close by among the hawthorns , and immediately after five or six woodmen carrying a stretcher debauched upon the lawn ."
"A tall , lusty fellow , somewhat grizzled , and as brown as a smoked ham , walked before them with an air of some authority , his bow at his back , a bright boar-spear in his hand ."
`` Lads ! ''
"he cried , `` good fellows all , and my right merry friends , y ' have sung this while on a dry whistle and lived at little ease ."
But what said I ever ?
"Abide Fortune constantly ; she turneth , turneth swift ."
And lo !
"here is her little firstling -- even that good creature , ale ! ''"
There was a murmur of applause as the bearers set down the stretcher and displayed a goodly cask .
"`` And now haste ye , boys , '' the man continued ."
`` There is work toward .
"`` Now , men , '' said he , `` do you hear me ? ''"
There was no answer from the forecastle .
"`` It 's to you , Abraham Gray -- it 's to you I am speaking . ''"
Still no reply .
"`` Gray , '' resumed Mr. Smollett , a little louder , `` I am leaving this ship , and I order you to follow your captain ."
"I know you are a good man at bottom , and I dare say not one of the lot of you 's as bad as he makes out ."
I have my watch here in my hand ; I give you thirty seconds to join me in . ''
There was a pause .
"`` Come , my fine fellow , '' continued the captain ; `` do n't hang so long in stays ."
I 'm risking my life and the lives of these good gentlemen every second . ''
"There was a sudden scuffle , a sound of blows , and out burst Abraham Gray with a knife cut on the side of the cheek , and came running to the captain like a dog to the whistle ."
"`` I 'm with you , sir , '' said he ."
"And the next moment he and the captain had dropped aboard of us , and we had shoved off and given way ."
"We were clear out of the ship , but not yet ashore in our stockade ."
17 Narrative Continued by the Doctor : The Jolly-boat 's Last Trip THIS fifth trip was quite different from any of the others .
"In the first place , the little gallipot of a boat that we were in was gravely overloaded ."
"Five grown men , and three of them -- Trelawney , Redruth , and the captain -- over six feet high , was already more than she was meant to carry ."
"Add to that the powder , pork , and bread-bags ."
The gunwale was lipping astern .
"Several times we shipped a little water , and my breeches and the tails of my coat were all soaking wet before we had gone a hundred yards ."
"The captain made us trim the boat , and we got her to lie a little more evenly ."
"All the same , we were afraid to breathe ."
"In the second place , the ebb was now making -- a strong rippling current running westward through the basin , and then south ` ard and seaward down the straits by which we had entered in the morning ."
"Even the ripples were a danger to our overloaded craft , but the worst of it was that we were swept out of our true course and away from our proper landing-place behind the point ."
"If we let the current have its way we should come ashore beside the gigs , where the pirates might appear at any moment ."
"`` I can not keep her head for the stockade , sir , '' said I to the captain ."
"I was steering , while he and Redruth , two fresh men , were at the oars ."
`` The tide keeps washing her down .
Could you pull a little stronger ? ''
"`` Not without swamping the boat , '' said he ."
"`` You must bear up , sir , if you please -- bear up until you see you 're gaining . ''"
"I tried and found by experiment that the tide kept sweeping us westward until I had laid her head due east , or just about right angles to the way we ought to go ."
I have lost my favourite ring ; DO stop for a moment and look if you can see it . '
But Jose answered : ` You will find plenty of rings where you are going . '
And the horse galloped on .
"At last they entered the palace gates , and the king 's heart bounded with joy at beholding his beloved Princess Bella-Flor ."
"But the princess brushed him aside as if he had been a fly , and locked herself into the nearest room , which she would not open for all his entreaties ."
"` Bring me the three things I lost on the way , and perhaps I may think about it , ' was all she would say ."
"And , in despair , the king was driven to take counsel of Jose ."
"` There is no remedy that I can see , ' said his majesty , ` but that you , who know where they are , should go and bring them back ."
And if you return without them I will have you drowned . '
Poor Jose was much troubled at these words .
"He thought that he had done all that was required of him , and that his life was safe ."
"However , he bowed low , and went out to consult his friend the horse ."
"` Do not vex yourself , ' said the horse , when he had heard the story ; ` jump up , and we will go and look for the things . '"
And Jose mounted at once .
"They rode on till they came to the ant-hill , and then the horse asked : ` Would you like to have the bran ? '"
` What is the use of liking ? '
answered Jose .
"` Well , call the ants , and tell them to fetch it for you ; and , if some of it has been scattered by the wind , to bring in its stead the grains that were in the cakes you gave them . '"
Jose listened in surprise .
"He did not much believe in the horse 's plan ; but he could not think of anything better , so he called to the ants , and bade them collect the bran as fast as they could ."
"Then he saw under a tree and waited , while his horse cropped the green turf ."
` Look there ! '
"said the animal , suddenly raising its head ; and Jose looked behind him and saw a little mountain of bran , which he put into a bag that was hung over his saddle ."
"` Good deeds bear fruit sooner or later , ' observed the horse ; ` but mount again , as we have far to go . '"
"When they arrived at the tree , they saw the handkerchief fluttering like a flag from the topmost branch , and Jose 's spirits sank again ."
` How am I to get that handkerchief ? '
cried he ; ` why I should need Jacob 's ladder ! '
"But the horse answered : ` Do not be frightened ; call to the eagle you set free from the net , he will bring it to you . '"
"So Jose called to the eagle , and the eagle flew to the top of the tree and brought back the handkerchief in its beak ."
"Jose thanked him , and vaulting on his horse they rode on to the river ."
"A great deal of rain had fallen in the night , and the river , instead of being clear as it was before , was dark and troubled ."
"` How am I to fetch the ring from the bottom of this river when I do not know exactly where it was dropped , and can not even see it ? '"
Kettley was one such place ; it had come very lately into his clutches ; he still met with opposition from the tenants ; and it was to overawe discontent that he had led his troops that way .
"By two in the morning , Sir Daniel sat in the inn room , close by the fireside , for it was cold at that hour among the fens of Kettley ."
By his elbow stood a pottle of spiced ale .
"He had taken off his visored headpiece , and sat with his bald head and thin , dark visage resting on one hand , wrapped warmly in a sanguine-coloured cloak ."
"At the lower end of the room about a dozen of his men stood sentry over the door or lay asleep on benches ; and somewhat nearer hand , a young lad , apparently of twelve or thirteen , was stretched in a mantle on the floor ."
The host of the Sun stood before the great man .
"`` Now , mark me , mine host , '' Sir Daniel said , `` follow but mine orders , and I shall be your good lord ever ."
"I must have good men for head boroughs , and I will have Adam-a-More high constable ; see to it narrowly ."
"If other men be chosen , it shall avail you nothing ; rather it shall be found to your sore cost ."
"For those that have paid rent to Walsingham I shall take good measure -- you among the rest , mine host . ''"
"`` Good knight , '' said the host , `` I will swear upon the cross of Holywood I did but pay to Walsingham upon compulsion ."
"Nay , bully knight , I love not the rogue Walsinghams ; they were as poor as thieves , bully knight ."
Give me a great lord like you .
"Nay ; ask me among the neighbours , I am stout for Brackley . ''"
"`` It may be , '' said Sir Daniel , dryly ."
`` Ye shall then pay twice . ''
"The innkeeper made a horrid grimace ; but this was a piece of bad luck that might readily befall a tenant in these unruly times , and he was perhaps glad to make his peace so easily ."
"`` Bring up yon fellow , Selden ! ''"
cried the knight .
"And one of his retainers led up a poor , cringing old man , as pale as a candle , and all shaking with the fen fever ."
"`` Sirrah , '' said Sir Daniel , `` your name ? ''"
"`` A n't please your worship , '' replied the man , `` my name is Condall -- Condall of Shoreby , at your good worship 's pleasure . ''"
"`` I have heard you ill reported on , '' returned the knight ."
"`` Ye deal in treason , rogue ; ye trudge the country leasing ; y ' are heavily suspicioned of the death of severals ."
"How , fellow , are ye so bold ?"
But I will bring you down . ''
"`` Right honourable and my reverend lord , '' the man cried , `` here is some hodge-podge , saving your good presence ."
"I am but a poor private man , and have hurt none . ''"
"`` The under-sheriff did report of you most vilely , '' said the knight . ''"
"` Seize me , ' saith he , ` that Tyndal of Shoreby . ' ''"
"`` Condall , my good lord ; Condall is my poor name , '' said the unfortunate ."
"`` Condall or Tyndal , it is all one , '' replied Sir Daniel , coolly ."
Ride -- ride fast ! ''
And then the poor young lady fainted once again .
"One of Dick 's men carried a flask of some strong cordial , and with this Dick succeeded in reviving consciousness ."
"Then he took Joanna 's friend upon his saddlebow , and once more pushed toward the forest ."
`` Why do ye take me ? ''
said the girl .
`` Ye but delay your speed . ''
"`` Nay , Mistress Risingham , '' replied Dick ."
`` Shoreby is full of blood and drunkenness and riot .
Here ye are safe ; content ye . ''
"`` I will not be beholden to any of your faction , '' she cried ; `` set me down . ''"
"`` Madam , ye know not what ye say , '' returned Dick ."
"`` Y ' are hurt '' -- `` I am not , '' she said ."
`` It was my horse was slain . ''
"`` It matters not one jot , '' replied Richard ."
"`` Ye are here in the midst of open snow , and compassed about with enemies ."
"Whether ye will or not , I carry you with me ."
Glad am I to have the occasion ; for thus shall I repay some portion of our debt . ''
For a little while she was silent .
"Then , very suddenly , she asked : `` My uncle ? ''"
`` My Lord Risingham ? ''
returned Dick .
"`` I would I had good news to give you , madam ; but I have none ."
"I saw him once in the battle , and once only ."
Let us hope the best . ''
"CHAPTER V -- NIGHT IN THE WOODS : ALICIA RISINGHAM It was almost certain that Sir Daniel had made for the Moat House ; but , considering the heavy snow , the lateness of the hour , and the necessity under which he would lie of avoiding the few roads and striking across the wood , it was equally certain that he could not hope to reach it ere the morrow ."
"There were two courses open to Dick ; either to continue to follow in the knight 's trail , and , if he were able , to fall upon him that very night in camp , or to strike out a path of his own , and seek to place himself between Sir Daniel and his destination ."
"Either scheme was open to serious objection , and Dick , who feared to expose Joanna to the hazards of a fight , had not yet decided between them when he reached the borders of the wood ."
"At this point Sir Daniel had turned a little to his left , and then plunged straight under a grove of very lofty timber ."
"His party had then formed to a narrower front , in order to pass between the trees , and the track was trod proportionally deeper in the snow ."
"The eye followed it under the leafless tracery of the oaks , running direct and narrow ; the trees stood over it , with knotty joints and the great , uplifted forest of their boughs ; there was no sound , whether of man or beast -- not so much as the stirring of a robin ; and over the field of snow the winter sun lay golden among netted shadows ."
"`` How say ye , '' asked Dick of one of the men , `` to follow straight on , or strike across for Tunstall ? ''"
"Any day , any hour , might bring John Lincoln to Plainfield ."
What should she do ?
Hide from him ?
Refuse to see him ?
But he would find out the truth just the same ; she would lose his friendships and respect just as surely .
"Sidney trod the way of the transgressor , and found that its thorns pierced to bone and marrow ."
Everything had come to an end -- nothing was left to her !
In the untried recklessness of twenty untempered years she wished she could die before John Lincoln came to Plainfield .
The eyes of youth could not see how she could possibly live afterward .
* * * * * Some days later a young man stepped from the C.P.R. train at Plainfield station and found his way to the one small hotel the place boasted .
After getting his supper he asked the proprietor if he could direct him to `` The Evergreens . ''
Caleb Williams looked at his guest in bewilderment .
"`` Never heerd o ' such a place , '' he said ."
"`` It is the name of Mr. Conway 's estate -- Mr. James Conway , '' explained John Lincoln ."
"`` Oh , Jim Conway 's place ! ''"
said Caleb .
`` Did n't know that was what he called it .
Sartin I kin tell you whar ' to find it .
You see that road out thar ' ?
"Well , just follow it straight along for a mile and a half till you come to a blacksmith 's forge ."
Jim Conway 's house is just this side of it on the right -- back from the road a smart piece and no other handy .
You ca n't mistake it . ''
"John Lincoln did not expect to mistake it , once he found it ; he knew by heart what it appeared like from Sidney 's description : an old stately mansion of mellowed brick , covered with ivy and set back from the highway amid fine ancestral trees , with a pine-grove behind it , a river to the left , and a harbour beyond ."
"He strode along the road in the warm , ruddy sunshine of early evening ."
It was not a bad-looking road at all ; the farmsteads sprinkled along it were for the most part snug and wholesome enough ; yet somehow it was different from what he had expected it to be .
And there was no harbour or glimpse of distant sea visible .
Had the hotel-keeper made a mistake ?
Perhaps he had meant some other James Conway .
Presently he found himself before the blacksmith 's forge .
"Beside it was a rickety , unpainted gate opening into a snake-fenced lane feathered here and there with scrubby little spruces ."
"It ran down a bare hill , crossed a little ravine full of young white-stemmed birches , and up another bare hill to an equally bare crest where a farmhouse was perched -- a farmhouse painted a stark , staring yellow and the ugliest thing in farmhouses that John Lincoln had ever seen , even among the log shacks of the west ."
"He knew now that he had been misdirected , but as there seemed to be nobody about the forge he concluded that he had better go to the yellow house and inquire within ."
did he ?
I declare I should n't wonder !
It would be just like the dear old blunder-head . ''
"`` I never thought of it till you told me where Bob was , and then it all sort of burst upon me in one minute ! ''"
"cried Jill , waving her arms about to express the intellectual explosion which had thrown light upon the mystery , like sky-rockets in a dark night ."
`` You are as bright as a button .
"No time to lose ; I 'm off ; '' and off he was , splashing through the mud to post the letter , on the back of which he added , to make the thing sure , `` Hurry up ."
"F.M. '' Both felt rather guilty next day , but enjoyed themselves very much nevertheless , and kept chuckling over the mine they were making under Jack 's unconscious feet ."
"They hardly expected an answer at noon , as the Hill people were not very eager for their mail , but at night Jill was sure of a letter , and to her great delight it came ."
"Jack brought it himself , which added to the fun , and while she eagerly read it he sat calmly poring over the latest number of his own private and particular `` Youth 's Companion . ''"
"Bob was not a `` complete letter-writer '' by any means , and with great labor and much ink had produced the following brief but highly satisfactory epistle ."
"Not knowing how to address his fair correspondent he let it alone , and went at once to the point in the frankest possible way : -- `` Jack did come up Friday ."
Sorry he got into a mess .
"It was real kind of him , and I shall pay him back soon ."
Jack paid Jerry for me and I made him promise not to tell .
Jerry said he 'd come here and make a row if I did n't cash up .
"I was afraid I 'd lose the place if he did , for the Capt. is awful strict ."
"If Jack do n't tell now , I will ."
I ai n't mean .
Glad you wrote .
`` R.O.W. '' `` Hurrah ! ''
"cried Jill , waving the letter over her head in great triumph ."
"`` Call everybody and read it out , '' she added , as Frank snatched it , and ran for his mother , seeing at a glance that the news was good ."
"Jill was so afraid she should tell before the others came that she burst out singing `` Pretty Bobby Shafto '' at the top of her voice , to Jack 's great disgust , for he considered the song very personal , as he was rather fond of `` combing down his yellow hair , '' and Jill often plagued him by singing it when he came in with the golden quirls very smooth and nice to hide the scar on his forehead ."
"In about five minutes the door flew open and in came Mamma , making straight for bewildered Jack , who thought the family had gone crazy when his parent caught him in her arms , saying tenderly , -- `` My good , generous boy !"
I knew he was right all the time ! ''
"while Frank worked his hand up and down like a pump-handle , exclaiming heartily , -- `` You 're a trump , sir , and I 'm proud of you ! ''"
"Jill meantime calling out , in wild delight , -- `` I told you so !"
I told you so !
"I did find out ; ha , ha , I did ! ''"
"`` Come , I say !"
What 's the matter ?
Stephen went off to the States and went into business with his uncle and married a Yankee .
"He 's never been home since , though his mother has been up to see him once or twice ."
His wife died two years ago and he 's sending the boy home to his mother for a spell .
He 's ten years old and I do n't know if he 'll be a very desirable pupil .
You can never tell about those Yankees . ''
Mrs Lynde looked upon all people who had the misfortune to be born or brought up elsewhere than in Prince Edward Island with a decided can-any-good-thing-come-out-of-Nazareth air .
"They MIGHT be good people , of course ; but you were on the safe side in doubting it ."
She had a special prejudice against `` Yankees . ''
Her husband had been cheated out of ten dollars by an employer for whom he had once worked in Boston and neither angels nor principalities nor powers could have convinced Mrs. Rachel that the whole United States was not responsible for it .
"`` Avonlea school wo n't be the worse for a little new blood , '' said Marilla drily , `` and if this boy is anything like his father he 'll be all right ."
"Steve Irving was the nicest boy that was ever raised in these parts , though some people did call him proud ."
I should think Mrs. Irving would be very glad to have the child .
She has been very lonesome since her husband died . ''
"`` Oh , the boy may be well enough , but he 'll be different from Avonlea children , '' said Mrs. Rachel , as if that clinched the matter ."
"Mrs. Rachel 's opinions concerning any person , place , or thing , were always warranted to wear ."
"`` What 's this I hear about your going to start up a Village Improvement Society , Anne ? ''"
"`` I was just talking it over with some of the girls and boys at the last Debating Club , '' said Anne , flushing ."
`` They thought it would be rather nice ... and so do Mr. and Mrs. Allan .
Lots of villages have them now . ''
"`` Well , you 'll get into no end of hot water if you do ."
"Better leave it alone , Anne , that 's what ."
People do n't like being improved . ''
"`` Oh , we are not going to try to improve the PEOPLE ."
It is Avonlea itself .
There are lots of things which might be done to make it prettier .
"For instance , if we could coax Mr. Levi Boulter to pull down that dreadful old house on his upper farm would n't that be an improvement ? ''"
"`` It certainly would , '' admitted Mrs. Rachel ."
`` That old ruin has been an eyesore to the settlement for years .
"But if you Improvers can coax Levi Boulter to do anything for the public that he is n't to be paid for doing , may I be there to see and hear the process , that 's what ."
"I do n't want to discourage you , Anne , for there may be something in your idea , though I suppose you did get it out of some rubbishy Yankee magazine ; but you 'll have your hands full with your school and I advise you as a friend not to bother with your improvements , that 's what ."
"But there , I know you 'll go ahead with it if you 've set your mind on it ."
You were always one to carry a thing through somehow . ''
At first my only feeling was one of annoyance .
Then a thought flashed into my mind that made me dizzy with fear .
The tide would be high that night .
If I could not escape from Island Rock I would inevitably be drowned .
I sat down limply on a ledge and tried to look matters fairly in the face .
I could not swim ; calls for help could not reach anybody ; my only hope lay in the chance of somebody passing down the shore or of some boat appearing .
I looked at my watch .
It was a quarter past three .
"The tide would begin to turn about five , but it would be at least ten before the rock would be covered ."
"I had , then , little more than six hours to live unless rescued ."
The flat was by this time out of sight around the point .
I hoped that the sight of an empty flat drifting down shore might attract someone 's attention and lead to investigation .
That seemed to be my only hope .
No alarm would be felt at Uncle Richard 's because of my non-appearance .
They would suppose I had gone to Uncle Adam 's .
"I have heard of time seeming long to a person in my predicament , but to me it seemed fairly to fly , for every moment decreased my chance of rescue ."
"I determined I would not give way to cowardly fear , so , with a murmured prayer for help , I set myself to the task of waiting for death as bravely as possible ."
"At intervals I shouted as loudly as I could and , when the sun came to the proper angle for the best view of the `` Hole in the Wall , '' I took the picture ."
"It afterwards turned out to be a great success , but I have never been able to look at it without a shudder ."
At five the tide began to come in .
"Very , very slowly the water rose around Island Rock ."
"Up , up , up it came , while I watched it with fascinated eyes , feeling like a rat in a trap ."
"The sun fell lower and lower ; at eight o'clock the moon rose large and bright ; at nine it was a lovely night , dear , calm , bright as day , and the water was swishing over the highest ledge of the rock ."
With some difficulty I climbed to the top and sat there to await the end .
"I had no longer any hope of rescue but , by a great effort , I preserved self-control ."
"If I had to die , I would at least face death staunchly ."
"But when I thought of my mother at home , it tasked all my energies to keep from breaking down utterly ."
Suddenly I heard a whistle .
Never was sound so sweet .
I stood up and peered eagerly shoreward .
"Coming around the `` Hole in the Wall '' headland , on top of the cliffs , I saw a boy and a dog ."
I sent a wild halloo ringing shoreward .
"Ask my man Tom , if ye misdoubt me ."
"Seven pieces of good Gascon wine , a ship that was mine own , and was my father 's before me , a Blessed Mary of plane-tree wood and parcel-gilt , and thirteen pounds in gold and silver ."
Hey !
what say ye ?
"A man that fought the French , too ; for I have fought the French ; I have cut more French throats upon the high seas than ever a man that sails out of Dartmouth ."
"Come , a penny piece . ''"
"Neither Dick nor Lawless durst answer him a word , lest he should recognise their voices ; and they stood there as helpless as a ship ashore , not knowing where to turn nor what to hope ."
"`` Are ye dumb , boy ? ''"
inquired the skipper .
"`` Mates , '' he added , with a hiccup , `` they be dumb ."
"I like not this manner of discourtesy ; for an a man be dumb , so be as he 's courteous , he will still speak when he was spoken to , methinks . ''"
"By this time the sailor , Tom , who was a man of great personal strength , seemed to have conceived some suspicion of these two speechless figures ; and being soberer than his captain , stepped suddenly before him , took Lawless roughly by the shoulder , and asked him , with an oath , what ailed him that he held his tongue ."
"To this the outlaw , thinking all was over , made answer by a wrestling feint that stretched the sailor on the sand , and , calling upon Dick to follow him , took to his heels among the lumber ."
The affair passed in a second .
"Before Dick could run at all , Arblaster had him in his arms ; Tom , crawling on his face , had caught him by one foot , and the third man had a drawn cutlass brandishing above his head ."
"It was not so much the danger , it was not so much the annoyance , that now bowed down the spirits of young Shelton ; it was the profound humiliation to have escaped Sir Daniel , convinced Lord Risingham , and now fall helpless in the hands of this old , drunken sailor ; and not merely helpless , but , as his conscience loudly told him when it was too late , actually guilty -- actually the bankrupt debtor of the man whose ship he had stolen and lost ."
"`` Bring me him back into the alehouse , till I see his face , '' said Arblaster ."
"`` Nay , nay , '' returned Tom ; `` but let us first unload his wallet , lest the other lads cry share . ''"
"But though he was searched from head to foot , not a penny was found upon him ; nothing but Lord Foxham 's signet , which they plucked savagely from his finger ."
"`` Turn me him to the moon , '' said the skipper ; and taking Dick by the chin , he cruelly jerked his head into the air ."
`` Blessed Virgin ! ''
"he cried , `` it is the pirate ! ''"
`` Hey ! ''
cried Tom .
"`` By the Virgin of Bordeaux , it is the man himself ! ''"
repeated Arblaster .
"`` What , sea-thief , do I hold you ? ''"
he cried .
`` Where is my ship ?
Where is my wine ?
Hey !
have I you in my hands ?
`` The innocent should surely come before the guilty . ''
"`` Why , David , '' said he , `` the innocent have aye a chance to get assoiled in court ; but for the lad that shot the bullet , I think the best place for him will be the heather ."
"Them that havenae dipped their hands in any little difficulty , should be very mindful of the case of them that have ."
And that is the good Christianity .
"For if it was the other way round about , and the lad whom I couldnae just clearly see had been in our shoes , and we in his -LRB- as might very well have been -RRB- , I think we would be a good deal obliged to him oursel 's if he would draw the soldiers . ''"
"When it came to this , I gave Alan up ."
"But he looked so innocent all the time , and was in such clear good faith in what he said , and so ready to sacrifice himself for what he deemed his duty , that my mouth was closed ."
Mr. Henderland 's words came back to me : that we ourselves might take a lesson by these wild Highlanders .
"Well , here I had taken mine ."
"Alan 's morals were all tail-first ; but he was ready to give his life for them , such as they were ."
"`` Alan , '' said I , `` I 'll not say it 's the good Christianity as I understand it , but it 's good enough ."
And here I offer ye my hand for the second time . ''
"Whereupon he gave me both of his , saying surely I had cast a spell upon him , for he could forgive me anything ."
"Then he grew very grave , and said we had not much time to throw away , but must both flee that country : he , because he was a deserter , and the whole of Appin would now be searched like a chamber , and every one obliged to give a good account of himself ; and I , because I was certainly involved in the murder ."
`` O ! ''
"says I , willing to give him a little lesson , `` I have no fear of the justice of my country . ''"
`` As if this was your country ! ''
said he .
"`` Or as if ye would be tried here , in a country of Stewarts ! ''"
"`` It 's all Scotland , '' said I. `` Man , I whiles wonder at ye , '' said Alan ."
`` This is a Campbell that 's been killed .
"Well , it 'll be tried in Inverara , the Campbells ' head place ; with fifteen Campbells in the jury-box and the biggest Campbell of all -LRB- and that 's the Duke -RRB- sitting cocking on the bench ."
"Justice , David ?"
"The same justice , by all the world , as Glenure found awhile ago at the roadside . ''"
"This frightened me a little , I confess , and would have frightened me more if I had known how nearly exact were Alan 's predictions ; indeed it was but in one point that he exaggerated , there being but eleven Campbells on the jury ; though as the other four were equally in the Duke 's dependence , it mattered less than might appear ."
"Still , I cried out that he was unjust to the Duke of Argyle , who -LRB- for all he was a Whig -RRB- was yet a wise and honest nobleman ."
`` Hoot ! ''
"said Alan , `` the man 's a Whig , nae doubt ; but I would never deny he was a good chieftain to his clan ."
"And what would the clan think if there was a Campbell shot , and naebody hanged , and their own chief the Justice General ?"
"But I have often observed , '' says Alan , `` that you Low-country bodies have no clear idea of what 's right and wrong . ''"
"At this I did at last laugh out aloud , when to my surprise , Alan joined in , and laughed as merrily as myself ."
"`` Na , na , '' said he , `` we 're in the Hielands , David ; and when I tell ye to run , take my word and run ."
"Very gently he patted the little mound that her feet made , and he could see by her face that she liked it ."
"He knew he had but to say `` Mother '' ever so softly , and she would wake up ."
They always wake up at once if it is you that says their name .
Then she would give such a joyous cry and squeeze him tight .
"How nice that would be to him , but oh , how exquisitely delicious it would be to her ."
That I am afraid is how Peter regarded it .
In returning to his mother he never doubted that he was giving her the greatest treat a woman can have .
"Nothing can be more splendid , he thought , than to have a little boy of your own ."
"How proud of him they are ; and very right and proper , too ."
"But why does Peter sit so long on the rail , why does he not tell his mother that he has come back ?"
"I quite shrink from the truth , which is that he sat there in two minds ."
"Sometimes he looked longingly at his mother , and sometimes he looked longingly at the window ."
"Certainly it would be pleasant to be her boy again , but , on the other hand , what times those had been in the Gardens !"
Was he so sure that he would enjoy wearing clothes again ?
He popped off the bed and opened some drawers to have a look at his old garments .
"They were still there , but he could not remember how you put them on ."
"The socks , for instance , were they worn on the hands or on the feet ?"
"He was about to try one of them on his hand , when he had a great adventure ."
"Perhaps the drawer had creaked ; at any rate , his mother woke up , for he heard her say `` Peter , '' as if it was the most lovely word in the language ."
"He remained sitting on the floor and held his breath , wondering how she knew that he had come back ."
"If she said `` Peter '' again , he meant to cry `` Mother '' and run to her ."
"But she spoke no more , she made little moans only , and when next he peeped at her she was once more asleep , with tears on her face ."
"It made Peter very miserable , and what do you think was the first thing he did ?"
"Sitting on the rail at the foot of the bed , he played a beautiful lullaby to his mother on his pipe ."
"He had made it up himself out of the way she said `` Peter , '' and he never stopped playing until she looked happy ."
"He thought this so clever of him that he could scarcely resist wakening her to hear her say , `` Oh , Peter , how exquisitely you play . ''"
"However , as she now seemed comfortable , he again cast looks at the window ."
You must not think that he meditated flying away and never coming back .
"He had quite decided to be his mother 's boy , but hesitated about beginning to-night ."
It was the second wish which troubled him .
"He no longer meant to make it a wish to be a bird , but not to ask for a second wish seemed wasteful , and , of course , he could not ask for it without returning to the fairies ."
"Also , if he put off asking for his wish too long it might go bad ."
`` Will you please wipe your feet carefully on the grass and then walk on these papers ? ''
she said anxiously .
`` I 've just swept the house all over and I ca n't have any more dust tracked in .
The path 's been real muddy since the rain yesterday . ''
"`` Do n't you dare laugh , '' warned Anne in a whisper , as they marched along the newspapers ."
"`` And I implore you , Diana , not to look at me , no matter what she says , or I shall not be able to keep a sober face . ''"
"The papers extended across the hall and into a prim , fleckless parlor ."
Anne and Diana sat down gingerly on the nearest chairs and explained their errand .
"Mrs. White heard them politely , interrupting only twice , once to chase out an adventurous fly , and once to pick up a tiny wisp of grass that had fallen on the carpet from Anne 's dress ."
"Anne felt wretchedly guilty ; but Mrs. White subscribed two dollars and paid the money down ... `` to prevent us from having to go back for it , '' Diana said when they got away ."
Mrs. White had the newspapers gathered up before they had their horse untied and as they drove out of the yard they saw her busily wielding a broom in the hall .
"`` I 've always heard that Mrs. Theodore White was the neatest woman alive and I 'll believe it after this , '' said Diana , giving way to her suppressed laughter as soon as it was safe ."
"`` I am glad she has no children , '' said Anne solemnly ."
`` It would be dreadful beyond words for them if she had . ''
At the Spencers ' Mrs. Isabella Spencer made them miserable by saying something ill-natured about everyone in Avonlea .
"Mr. Thomas Boulter refused to give anything because the hall , when it had been built , twenty years before , had n't been built on the site he recommended ."
"Mrs. Esther Bell , who was the picture of health , took half an hour to detail all her aches and pains , and sadly put down fifty cents because she would n't be there that time next year to do it ... no , she would be in her grave ."
"Their worst reception , however , was at Simon Fletcher 's ."
When they drove into the yard they saw two faces peering at them through the porch window .
But although they rapped and waited patiently and persistently nobody came to the door .
Two decidedly ruffled and indignant girls drove away from Simon Fletcher 's .
Even Anne admitted that she was beginning to feel discouraged .
But the tide turned after that .
"Several Sloane homesteads came next , where they got liberal subscriptions , and from that to the end they fared well , with only an occasional snub ."
Their last place of call was at Robert Dickson 's by the pond bridge .
"They stayed to tea here , although they were nearly home , rather than risk offending Mrs. Dickson , who had the reputation of being a very `` touchy '' woman ."
While they were there old Mrs. James White called in .
"`` I 've just been down to Lorenzo 's , '' she announced ."
`` He 's the proudest man in Avonlea this minute .
What do you think ?
"There 's a brand new boy there ... and after seven girls that 's quite an event , I can tell you . ''"
"Anne pricked up her ears , and when they drove away she said ."
"No! They are placed right for you to look at other people, and are where they help you hunt for food."""
"""How often may I look at my own feathers?"" asked the young Woodpecker."
"He was wondering at that minute how his tail looked, but he was determined not to turn his head."
"The old Woodpecker's eyes twinkled. ""I should think,"" he said, ""that since you are young and have no family to look after, you might preen your feathers in the morning and in the afternoon and when you go to sleep. Then, of course, when it is stormy, you will have to take your waterproof out of the pocket under your tail, and put it on one feather at a time, as all birds do. That would be often enough unless something happened to rumple them."""
"""I will not look at them any oftener,"" said the young Red-headed Woodpecker, firmly. ""I will not be called a silly fellow."" And he was as good as his word."
"His mother sighed when she heard of the change. ""I am very glad,"" said she. ""But isn't that always the way? His father and I have talked and talked, and it made no difference; but let somebody else say he is silly and vain, and behold!"""
THE NIGHT MOTH WITH A CROOKED FEELER
"The beautiful, brilliant Butterflies of the Meadow had many cousins living in the forest, most of whom were Night Moths. They also were very beautiful creatures, but they dressed in duller colors and did not have slender waists. Some of the Butterflies, you know, wear whole gowns of black and yellow, others have stripes of black and white, while some have clear yellow with only a bit of black trimming the edges of the wings."
"The Moths usually wear brown and have it brightened with touches of buff or dull blue. If they do wear bright colors, it is only on the back pair of wings, and when the Moth alights, he slides his front pair of wings over these and covers all the brightness. They do not rest with their wings folded over their heads like the Butterflies, but leave them flat."
"All the day long, when the sun is shining, the Moths have to rest on trees and dead leaves. If they were dressed in yellow or red, any passing bird would see them, and there is no telling what might happen."
"As it is, their brown wings are so nearly the color of dead leaves or bark that you might often look right at them without seeing them."
"Yet even among Moths there are some more brightly colored than others, and when you find part of the family quietly dressed you can know it is because they have to lay the eggs. Moths are safer in dull colors, and the egg-layers should always be the safest of all. If anything happened to them, you know, there would be no Caterpillar babies."
"One day a fine-looking Cecropia Moth came out of her chrysalis and clung to the nearest twig while her wings grew and dried and flattened. At first they had looked like tiny brown leaves all drenched with rain and wrinkled by somebody's stepping on them. The fur on her fat body was matted and wet, and even her feelers were damp and stuck to her head."
"Her six beautiful legs were weak and trembling, and she moved her body restlessly while she tried again and again to raise her crumpled wings."
"She had not been there so very long before she noticed another Cecropia Moth near her, clinging to the under side of a leaf. He was also just out of the chrysalis and was drying himself. ""Good morning!"" he cried."
"""I think I knew you when we were Caterpillars. Fine day to break the chrysalis, isn't it?"""
"""Lovely,"" she answered. ""I remember you very well. You were the Caterpillar who showed me where to find food last summer when the hot weather had withered so many of the plants."""
"""I thought you would recall me,"" he said. ""And when we were spinning our chrysalides we visited together. Do you remember that also?"""
"Miss Cecropia did. She had been thinking of that when she first spoke, but she hoped he had forgotten. To tell the truth, he had been rather fond of her the fall before, and she, thinking him the handsomest Caterpillar of her acquaintance, had smiled upon him and suggested that they spin their cocoons near together. During the long winter she had regretted this. ""I was very foolish,"" she thought, ""to encourage him."
"When I get my wings I may meet people who are better off than he. Now I shall have to be polite to him for the sake of old friendship. I only hope that he will make other acquaintances and leave me free. I must get into the best society."""
"All this time her neighbor was thinking, ""I am so glad to see her again, so glad, so glad! When my wings are dry I will fly over to her and we will go through the forest together."" He was a kind, warm-hearted fellow, who cared more for friendship than for beauty or family."
"Meanwhile their wings were growing fast, and drying, and flattening, so that by noon they could begin to raise them above their heads. They were very large Moths and their wings were of a soft dust color with little clear, transparent places in them and touches of the most beautiful blue, quite the shade worn by the Peacock, who lived on the farm. There was a brown and white border to their wings, and on their bodies and legs the fur was white and dark orange. When the Cecropias rest, they spread their wings out flat, and do not slide the front pair over the others as their cousins, the Sphinxes, do. The most wonderful of all, though, are their feelers."
"The Butterflies have stiff feelers on their heads with little knobs on the ends, or sometimes with part of them thick like tiny clubs. The Night Moths have many kinds of feelers, most of them being curved, and those of the Cecropias look like reddish-brown feathers pointed at the end."
"Miss Cecropia's feelers were perfect, and she waved them happily to and fro. Those of her friend, she was troubled to see, were not what they should have been. One of them was all right, the other was small and crooked. ""Oh dear,"" she said to herself, ""how that does look! I hope he will not try to be attentive to me."" He did not mind it much. He thought about other things than looks."
"As night came, a Polyphemus Moth fluttered past. ""Good evening!"" cried he. ""Are you just out? There are a lot of Cecropias coming out to-day."""
"Miss Cecropia felt quite agitated when she heard this, and wondered if she looked all right. Her friend flew over to her just as she raised her wings for flight. ""Let me go with you,"" he said."
"While she was wondering how she could answer him, several other Cecropias came along. They were all more brightly colered than she."
"""Hullo!"" cried one of them, as he alighted beside her. ""First-rate night, isn't it?"""
"He was a handsome fellow, and his feelers were perfect; but Miss Cecropia did not like his ways, and she drew away from him just as her friend knocked him off the branch. While they were fighting, another of the strangers flew to her. ""May I sit here?"" he asked."
"""Yes,"" she murmured, thinking her chance had come to get into society."
"""I must say that it served the fellow right for his rudeness to you,"""
"And to her husband she said, ""My dear, why do you go on worrying about it? Our daughter is not a boy, it is true but she may marry a clever man who could rule your kingdom after you, and learn as much magic as ever you cared to teach him."""
Then the King found his tongue.
"""If she does marry,"" he said, slowly, ""her husband will have to be a very clever man oh, yes, very clever indeed! And he will have to know a very great deal more magic than I shall ever care to teach him."""
The Queen knew at once by the King's tone that he was going to be disagreeable.
"""Ah,"" she said, ""don't punish the child because she loves her mother."""
"""I'm not going to punish her for that,"" said he. ""I'm only going to teach her to respect her father."""
"And without another word he went off to his laboratory and worked all night, boiling different-colored things in crucibles, and copying charms in curious twisted letters from old brown books with mold stains on their yellowy pages."
"The next day his plan was all arranged. He took the poor Princess to the Lone Tower, which stands on an island in the sea, a thousand miles from everywhere. He gave her a dowry, and settled a handsome income on her."
"He engaged a competent dragon to look after her, and also a respectable griffin whose birth and upbringing he knew all about. And he said: ""Here you shall stay, my dear, respectful daughter, till the clever man comes to marry you. He'll have to be clever enough to sail a ship through the Nine Whirlpools that spin around the island, and to kill the dragon and the griffin. Till he comes you'll never get any older or any wiser. No doubt he will soon come. You can employ yourself in embroidering your wedding gown. I wish you joy, my dutiful child."""
"And his carriage, drawn by live thunderbolts (thunder travels very fast), rose in the air and disappeared, and the poor Princess was left, with the dragon and the griffin, on the Island of the Nine Whirlpools."
"The Queen, left at home, cried for a day and a night, and then she remembered the witch and called to her. And the witch came, and the Queen told her all."
"""For the sake of the twice twenty-five kisses you gave me,"" said the witch, ""I will help you. But it is the last thing I can do, and it is not much. Your daughter is under a spell, and I can take you to her."
"But, if I do, you will have to be turned to stone, and to stay so till the spell is taken off the child."""
"""I would be a stone for a thousand years,"" said the poor Queen, ""if at the end of them I could see my dear again."""
"So the witch took the Queen in a carriage drawn by live sunbeams (which travel more quickly than anything else in the world, and much quicker than thunder), and so away and away to the Lone Tower on the Island of the Nine Whirlpools. And there was the Princess sitting on the floor in the best room of the Lone Tower, crying as if her heart would break, and the dragon and the griffin were sitting primly on each side of her."
"""Oh, Mother, Mother, Mother,"" she cried, and hung around the Queen's neck as if she would never let go."
"""Now,"" said the witch, when they had all cried as much as was good for them, ""I can do one or two other little things for you. Time shall not make the Princess sad. All days will be like one day till her deliverer comes. And you and I, dear Queen, will sit in stone at the gate of the tower. In doing this for you I lose all my witch's powers, and when I say the spell that changes you to stone, I shall change with you, and if ever we come out of the stone, I shall be a witch no more, but only a happy old woman."""
"Then the three kissed one another again and again, and the witch said the spell, and on each side of the door there was now a stone lady. One of them had a stone crown on its head and a stone scepter in its hand; but the other held a stone tablet with words on it, which the griffin and the dragon could not read, though they had both had a very good education."
"And now all days seemed like one day to the Princess, and the next day always seemed the day when her mother would come out of the stone and kiss her again. And the years went slowly by. The wicked King died, and some one else took his kingdom, and many things were changed in the world; but the island did not change, nor the Nine Whirlpools, nor the griffin, nor the dragon, nor the two stone ladies. And all the time, from the very first, the day of the Princess's deliverance was coming, creeping nearer, and nearer, and nearer. But no one saw it coming except the Princess, and she only in dreams. And the years went by in tens and in hundreds, and still the Nine Whirlpools spun around, roaring in triumph the story of many a good ship that had gone down in their swirl, bearing with it some Prince who had tried to win the Princess and her dowry. And the great sea knew all the other stories of the Princes who had come from very far, and had seen the whirlpools, and had shaken their wise young heads and said: ""'Bout ship!"" and gone discreetly home to their nice, safe, comfortable kingdoms."
But no one told the story of the deliverer who was to come. And the years went by.
"Now, after more scores of years than you would like to add up on your slate, a certain sailor-boy sailed on the high seas with his uncle, who was a skilled skipper. And the boy could reef a sail and coil a rope and keep the ship's nose steady before the wind. And he was as good a boy as you would find in a month of Sundays, and worthy to be a Prince."
"Now there is Something which is wiser than all the world and it knows when people are worthy to be Princes. And this Something came from the farther side of the seventh world, and whispered in the boy's ear."
"And the boy heard, though he did not know he heard, and he looked out over the black sea with the white foam-horses galloping over it, and far away he saw a light. And he said to the skipper, his uncle: ""What light is that?"""
"Then the skipper said: ""All good things defend you, Nigel, from sailing near that light. It is not mentioned in all charts; but it is marked in the old chart I steer by, which was my father's father's before me, and his father's father's before him. It is the light that shines from the Lone Tower that stands above the Nine Whirlpools. And when my father's father was young he heard from the very old man, his great-great-grandfather, that in that tower an enchanted Princess, fairer than the day, waits to be delivered. But there is no deliverance, so never steer that way; and think no more of the Princess, for that is only an idle tale. But the whirlpools are quite real."""
"So, of course, from that day Nigel thought of nothing else. And as he sailed hither and thither upon the high seas he saw from time to time the light that shone out to sea across the wild swirl of the Nine Whirlpools. And one night, when the ship was at anchor and the skipper asleep in his bunk, Nigel launched the ship's boat and steered alone over the dark sea towards the light. He dared not go very near till daylight should show him what, indeed, were the whirlpools he had to dread."
"But when the dawn came he saw the Lone Tower standing dark against the pink and primrose of the East, and about its base the sullen swirl of black water, and he heard the wonderful roar of it. So he hung off and on, all that day and for six days besides. And when he had watched seven days he knew something. For you are certain to know something if you give for seven days your whole thought to it, even though it be only the first declension, or the nine-times table, or the dates of the Norman Kings."
"What he knew was this: that for five minutes out of the 1,440 minutes that make up a day the whirlpools slipped into silence, while the tide went down and left the yellow sand bare. And every day this happened, but every day it was five minutes earlier than it had been the day before. He made sure of this by the ship's chronometer, which he had thoughtfully brought with him."
See page 88.]
"So on the eighth day, at five minutes before noon, Nigel got ready. And when the whirlpools suddenly stopped whirling and the tide sank, like water in a basin that has a hole in it, he stuck to his oars and put his back into his stroke, and presently beached the boat on the yellow sand. Then he dragged it into a cave, and sat down to wait."
"By five minutes and one second past noon, the whirlpools were black and busy again, and Nigel peeped out of his cave. And on the rocky ledge overhanging the sea he saw a Princess as beautiful as the day, with golden hair and a green gown and he went out to meet her."
"""I've come to save you,"" he said. ""How darling and beautiful you are!"""
"Once he was hard pressed for means, as he was trying to run a farm, and running a farm costs money: so he went to a bank to borrow. He hated to do it, because he had no special inducements to offer a bank or to make it hilariously loan him money."
"""How much did you think you would need, Mr. Webster?"" asked the President, cutting off some coupons as he spoke and making paper dolls of them."
"""Well, I could get along very well,"" said Webster, in that deep, resinous voice of his, ""if I could have two thousand dollars."""
"""Well, you remember,"" said the banker, ""do you not, that you have two thousand dollars here, that you deposited five years ago, after you had dined with the Governor of North Carolina?"""
"""No, I had forgotten about that,"" said Webster. ""Give me a blank check without unnecessary delay."""
We may learn from this that Mr. Webster was not a careful man in the matter of detail.
"His speech on the two-hundredth anniversary of the landing of the Pilgrims was a good thing, and found its way into the press of the time."
"His speech at the laying of the corner-stone of the Bunker Hill Monument, and his eulogy of Adams and Jefferson, were beautiful and thrilling."
"Daniel Webster had a very large brain, and used to loan his hat to brother Senators now and then when their heads were paining them, provided he did not want it himself."
"His reply to Robert Y. Hayne, of South Carolina, in 1830, was regarded as one of his ablest parliamentary efforts. Hayne attacked New England, and first advanced the doctrine of nullification, which was even more dangerous than secession, Jefferson Davis in 1860 denying that he had ever advocated or favored such a doctrine."
"Webster spoke extempore, and people sent out for their lunch rather than go away in the midst of his remarks."
"Webster married twice, but did not let that make any difference with his duty to his country."
"He tried to farm it some, but did not amass a large sum, owing to his heavy losses in trying year after year to grow Saratoga potatoes for the Boston market."
"No American, foreign or domestic, ever made a greater name for himself than Daniel Webster, but he was not so good a penman as Noah; Noah was the better pen-writer."
"Noah Webster also had the better command of language of the two. Those who have read his great work entitled ""Webster's Elementary Spelling-Book, or, How One Word Led to Another,"" will agree with me that he was smart. Noah never lacked for a word by which to express himself."
He was a brainy man and a good speller.
One by one our eminent men are passing away. Mr. Webster has passed away; Napoleon Bonaparte is no more; and Dr. Mary Walker is fading away.
This has been a severe winter on Red Shirt; and I have to guard against the night air a good deal myself.
"It would ill become me, at this late date, to criticise Mr. Webster's work, a work that is now, I may say, in nearly every home and school-room in the land. It is a great book. I only hope that had Mr."
Webster lived he would have been equally fair in his criticism of my books.
"I hate to compare my books with Mr. Webster's, because it looks egotistical in me; but, although Noah's book is larger than mine, and has more literary attractions as a book to set a child on at the table, it does not hold the interest of the reader all the way through."
"He has introduced too many characters into his book at the expense of the plot. It is a good book to pick up and while away a leisure hour, perhaps, but it is not a work that could rivet your interest till midnight, while the fire went out and the thermometer stepped down to 47° below zero. You do not hurry through the pages to see whether Reginald married the girl or not. Mr. Webster did not seem to care how the affair turned out."
"Therein consists the great difference between Noah and myself. He doesn't keep up the interest. A friend of mine at Sing Sing, who secured one of my books, said he never left his room till he had devoured it. He said he seemed chained to the spot; and if you can't believe a convict who is entirely out of politics, whom, in the name of George Washington, can you trust?"
"Mr. Webster was certainly a most brilliant writer, though a little inclined, perhaps, to be wordy. I have discovered in some of his later books one hundred and eighteen thousand words no two of which are alike."
"This shows great fluency and versatility, it is true, but we need something else. The reader waits in vain to be thrilled by the author's wonderful word-painting. There is not a thrill in the whole tome."
"I had heard so much of Mr. Webster that when I read his book I confess I was disappointed. It is cold, methodical, dry, and dispassionate in the extreme, and one cannot help comparing it with the works of James Fenimore Cooper and Horace."
"As I said, however, it is a good book to pick up for the purpose of whiling away an idle hour. No one should travel without Mr. Webster's tale. Those who examine this tale will readily see why there were no flies on the author. He kept them off with this tale."
"It is a good book, as I say, to take up for a moment, or to read on the train, or to hold the door open on a hot day. I would never take a long railroad ride without it, eyether. I would as soon forget my bottle of cough-medicine."
"Mr. Webster's Speller had an immense sale. Ten years ago he had sold forty million copies. And yet it had this same defect. It was cold, dull, disconnected, and verbose. There was only one good thing in the book, and that was a little literary gem regarding a boy who broke in and stole the apples of a total stranger. The story was so good that I have often wondered whom Mr. Webster got to write it for him."
"The old man, it seems, at first told the boy that he had better come down, as there was a draught in the tree; but the young sass-box apple-sass-box, I presume told him to avaunt."
"For some time they had fair wind and fine weather, but after that they lay wind-bound under a rocky island. So the sailors went ashore and strolled about to spend the time, and there they found a huge egg, almost as big as a little house. So they began to knock it about with large stones, but, after all, they couldn't crack the shell. Then the lad came up with his sword to see what all the noise was about, and when he saw the egg, he thought it a trifle to crack it; so he gave it one blow and the egg split, and out came a chicken as big as an elephant."
"""Now we have done wrong,"" said the lad; ""this can cost us all our lives;"" and then he asked his sailors if they were men enough to sail to Arabia in four-and-twenty hours if they got a fine breeze. Yes!"
"they were good to do that, they said, so they set sail with a fine breeze, and got to Arabia in three-and-twenty hours. As soon as they landed, the lad ordered all the sailors to go and bury themselves up to the eyes in a sandhill, so that they could barely see the ships."
The lad and the captains climbed a high crag and sate down under a fir.
"In a little while came a great bird flying with an island in its claws, and let it fall down on the fleet, and sunk every ship. After it had done that, it flew up to the sandhill and flapped its wings, so that the wind nearly took off the heads of the sailors, and it flew past the fir with such force that it turned the lad right about, but he was ready with his sword, and gave the bird one blow and brought it down dead."
"After that he went to the town, where every one was glad because the King had got his daughter back; but now the King had hidden her away somewhere himself, and promised her hand as a reward to any one who could find her, and this though she was betrothed before. Now as the lad went along he met a man who had white bear-skins for sale, so he bought one of the hides and put it on; and one of the captains was to take an iron chain and lead him about, and so he went into the town and began to play pranks. At last the news came to the King's ears, that there never had been such fun in the town before, for here was a white bear that danced and cut capers just as it was bid. So a messenger came to say the bear must come to the castle at once, for the King wanted to see its tricks. So when it got to the castle every one was afraid, for such a beast they had never seen before; but the captain said there was no danger unless they laughed at it. They mustn't do that, else it would tear them to pieces. When the King heard that, he warned all the court not to laugh. But while the fun was going on, in came one of the King's maids, and began to laugh and make game of the bear, and the bear flew at her and tore her, so that there was scarce a rag of her left. Then all the court began to bewail, and the captain most of all."
"""Stuff and nonsense,"" said the King; ""she's only a maid, besides it's more my affair than yours."""
"When the show was over, it was late at night. ""It's no good your going away, when it's so late,"" said the King. ""The bear had best sleep here."""
"""Perhaps it might sleep in the ingle by the kitchen fire,"" said the captain."
"""Nay,"" said the King, ""it shall sleep up here, and it shall have pillows and cushions to sleep on."" So a whole heap of pillows and cushions was brought, and the captain had a bed in a side room."
"But at midnight the King came with a lamp in his hand and a big bunch of keys, and carried off the white bear. He passed along gallery after gallery through doors and rooms, up-stairs and down-stairs, till at last he came to a pier which ran out into the sea. Then the King began to pull and haul at posts and pins, this one up and that one down, till at last a little house floated up to the water's edge."
"There he kept his daughter, for she was so dear to him that he had hid her, so that no one could find her out. He left the white bear outside while he went in and told her how it had danced and played its pranks."
"She said she was afraid, and dared not look at it; but he talked her over, saying there was no danger if she only wouldn't laugh. So they brought the bear in, and locked the door, and it danced and played its tricks; but just when the fun was at its height, the Princess's maid began to laugh. Then the lad flew at her and tore her to bits, and the Princess began to cry and sob."
"""Stuff and nonsense,"" cried the King; ""all this fuss about a maid!"
"I'll get you just as good a one again. But now I think the bear had best stay here till morning, for I don't care to have to go and lead it along all those galleries and stairs at this time of night."""
"""Well!"" said the Princess, ""if it sleeps here, I'm sure I won't."""
"But just then the bear curled himself up and lay down by the stove; and it was settled at last that the Princess should sleep there too, with a light burning. But as soon as the King had well gone, the white bear came and begged her to undo his collar. The Princess was so scared she almost swooned away; but she felt about till she found the collar, and she had scarce undone it before the bear pulled his head off. Then she knew him again, and was so glad there was no end to her joy, and she wanted to tell her father at once that her deliverer was come. But the lad would not hear of it; he would earn her once more, he said. So in the morning when they heard the King rattling at the posts outside, the lad drew on the hide and lay down by the stove."
"""Well, has it lain still?"" the king asked."
"""I should think so,"" said the Princess; ""it hasn't so much as turned or stretched itself once."""
"When they got up to the castle again, the captain took the bear and led it away, and then the lad threw off the hide, and went to a tailor and ordered clothes fit for a prince; and when they were fitted on he went to the King, and said he wanted to find the Princess."
"""You're not the first who has wished the same thing,"" said the King, ""but they have all lost their lives; for if any one who tries can't find her in four-and-twenty hours his life is forfeited."""
"Yes; the lad knew all that. Still he wished to try, and if he couldn't find her, 'twas his look-out. Now in the castle there was a band that played sweet tunes, and there were fair maids to dance with, and so the lad danced away."
"When twelve hours were gone, the King said:"
"""I pity you with all my heart. You're so poor a hand at seeking; you will surely lose your life."""
"""Stuff!"" said the lad; ""while there's life there's hope! So long as there's breath in the body there's no fear; we have lots of time!"" and so he went on dancing till there was only one hour left."
Then he said he would begin to search.
"""It's no use now,"" said the King; ""time's up."""
"""Light your lamp; out with your big bunch of keys,"" said the lad, ""and follow me whither I wish to go. There is still a whole hour left."""
"So the lad went the same way which the King had led him the night before, and he bade the King unlock door after door till they came down to the pier which ran out into the sea."
"""It's all no use, I tell you,"" said the King; ""time's up, and this will only lead you right out into the sea."""
"""Still five minutes more,"" said the lad, as he pulled and pushed at the posts and pins, and the house floated up."
"Some of them were moved even to tears, for the fiddle seemed to wail as one in bitter anguish. The elder brother wished to purchase it, and offered to support the Jogi for a whole year if he would consent to part with his wonderful instrument. The Jogi, however, knew its value, and refused to sell it."
"It so happened that the Jogi some time after went to the house of a village chief, and after playing a tune or two on his fiddle asked for something to eat. They offered to buy his fiddle and promised a high price for it, but he refused to sell it, as his fiddle brought to him his means of livelihood. When they saw that he was not to be prevailed upon, they gave him food and a plentiful supply of liquor. Of the latter he drank so freely that he presently became intoxicated. While he was in this condition, they took away his fiddle, and substituted their own old one for it. When the Jogi recovered, he missed his instrument, and suspecting that it had been stolen asked them to return it to him. They denied having taken it, so he had to depart, leaving his fiddle behind him. The chief's son, being a musician, used to play on the Jogi's fiddle, and in his hands the music it gave forth delighted the ears of all who heard it."
"When all the household were absent at their labours in the fields, the Bonga girl used to come out of the bamboo fiddle, and prepared the family meal. Having eaten her own share, she placed that of the chief's son under his bed, and covering it up to keep off the dust, re-entered the fiddle. This happening every day, the other members of the household thought that some girl friend of theirs was in this manner showing her interest in the young man, so they did not trouble themselves to find out how it came about. The young chief, however, was determined to watch, and see which of his girl friends was so attentive to his comfort. He said in his own mind, ""I will catch her to-day, and give her a sound beating; she is causing me to be ashamed before the others."" So saying, he hid himself in a corner in a pile of firewood. In a short time the girl came out of the bamboo fiddle, and began to dress her hair. Having completed her toilet, she cooked the meal of rice as usual, and having eaten some herself, she placed the young man's portion under his bed, as before, and was about to enter the fiddle again, when he, running out from his hiding-place, caught her in his arms. The Bonga girl exclaimed, ""Fie! Fie! you may be a Dom, or you may be a Hadi of some other caste with whom I cannot marry."" He said, ""No. But from to-day, you and I are one."" So they began lovingly to hold converse with each other. When the others returned home in the evening, they saw that she was both a human being and a Bonga, and they rejoiced exceedingly."
"Now in course of time the Bonga girl's family became very poor, and her brothers on one occasion came to the chief's house on a visit."
"The Bonga girl recognised them at once, but they did not know who she was. She brought them water on their arrival, and afterwards set cooked rice before them. Then sitting down near them, she began in wailing tones to upbraid them on account of the treatment she had been subjected to by their wives. She related all that had befallen her, and wound up by saying, ""You must have known it all, and yet you did not interfere to save me."" And that was all the revenge she took."
The Cruel Crane Outwitted
Long ago the Bodisat was born to a forest life as the Genius of a tree standing near a certain lotus pond.
"Now at that time the water used to run short at the dry season in a certain pond, not over large, in which there were a good many fish."
And a crane thought on seeing the fish:
"""I must outwit these fish somehow or other and make a prey of them."""
"And he went and sat down at the edge of the water, thinking how he should do it."
"When the fish saw him, they asked him, ""What are you sitting there for, lost in thought?"""
"""I am sitting thinking about you,"" said he."
"""Oh, sir! what are you thinking about us?"" said they."
"""Why,"" he replied; ""there is very little water in this pond, and but little for you to eat; and the heat is so great! So I was thinking, 'What in the world will these fish do now?'"""
"""Yes, indeed, sir! what are we to do?"" said they."
"""If you will only do as I bid you, I will take you in my beak to a fine large pond, covered with all the kinds of lotuses, and put you into it,"" answered the crane."
"""That a crane should take thought for the fishes is a thing unheard of, sir, since the world began. It's eating us, one after the other, that you're aiming at."""
"""Not I! So long as you trust me, I won't eat you. But if you don't believe me that there is such a pond, send one of you with me to go and see it."""
"Then they trusted him, and handed over to him one of their number a big fellow, blind of one eye, whom they thought sharp enough in any emergency, afloat or ashore."
"Him the crane took with him, let him go in the pond, showed him the whole of it, brought him back, and let him go again close to the other fish. And he told them all the glories of the pond."
"And when they heard what he said, they exclaimed, ""All right, sir! You may take us with you."""
"Then the crane took the old purblind fish first to the bank of the other pond, and alighted in a Varana-tree growing on the bank there."
"But he threw it into a fork of the tree, struck it with his beak, and killed it; and then ate its flesh, and threw its bones away at the foot of the tree. Then he went back and called out:"
"""I've thrown that fish in; let another one come."""
"And in that manner he took all the fish, one by one, and ate them, till he came back and found no more!"
"But there was still a crab left behind there; and the crane thought he would eat him too, and called out:"
"""I say, good crab, I've taken all the fish away, and put them into a fine large pond. Come along. I'll take you too!"""
"""But how will you take hold of me to carry me along?"""
"""I'll bite hold of you with my beak."""
"They began one nest and had it nearly done, when Mr. Goldfinch said it was not in a good place, and tore it all to pieces. Mrs. Goldfinch felt very badly about this and talked it over with some of her Goldfinch neighbors. They told her not to mind it at all, that their husbands often did the same thing, and that sometimes they came to like the new place much better than the old. At any rate, there was no use in getting cross about it, because that was something she would have to expect."
"Mr. Goldfinch was sure that they had built too near the ground, and he had chosen a crotch above. Toward this he was dragging the bits of grape-vine and cedar-bark which were woven into their first nest. He said they could also use some of the grasses and mosses which they had gotten together, and he even told his wife of some fine thistle-down which he could bring for the inside, where the eggs were to be laid."
"Mrs. Goldfinch watched him tugging with bill and both feet to loosen the bits of bark, and she said to herself: ""Dear fellow! what a helper he is! I won't mind rebuilding if it makes him happy,"" and she went to work with a will."
"When the sun went down in the west the next night the second nest was done, and it was the last thing at which the Goldfinches looked before tucking their heads under their wings and going to sleep. It was the first thing that they saw the next morning, too, and they hopped all around it and twittered with pride, and gave it little tweaks here and little pokes there before they flew away to get breakfast."
"While they were gone, Mrs. Cowbird came walking over the grass and dry leaves to the foot of the tree. She wagged her head at every step, and put on as many airs as though she were showily dressed, instead of wearing, as she always does, a robe of dull brownish gray. She had seen the Goldfinches fly away, and she was looking for their home. She was a lazy creature in spite of her stirring ways, and she wished to find a nice little nest in which to lay an egg. You know Cowbirds never think of building nests. They want all of their time to take care of themselves, which is a very foolish way of living; but then, you could never make a Cowbird think so!"
"""That nest is exactly right,"" said Mrs. Cowbird. ""I will lay my egg there at once, and when Mrs. Goldfinch has laid hers she will have to hatch them all together and take care of my baby for me. What an easy way this is to bring up one's family! It is really no work at all! And I am sure that my children will get along well, because I am always careful to choose the nests of small birds for them. Then they are larger and stronger than the other babies, and can get more than their share of food."""
"So she laid a big white egg with gray and brown spots on it in the Goldfinches' new home, and then she flew off to the Cowbird flock, as gay and careless as you please. When the Goldfinches came back, they saw the egg in their nest and called all their neighbors to talk it over."
"""What shall I ever do?"" said Mrs. Goldfinch. ""I wanted my nest for my own eggs, and I meant to lay them to-morrow. I suppose I shall have to sit on this one too, but it won't be at all comfortable."""
"""I wouldn't,"" said one of her neighbors, a Yellow Warbler. ""I left my nest once when such a thing happened to me, and built a new one for my own eggs."""
"""Oh dear!"" cried Mrs. Goldfinch, ""we have built two already, and I cannot build another."""
"""Well, whatever you do,"" said a Vireo, ""don't hatch the big egg out with your own. I did once, and such a time as I had! The young Cowbird pushed two of my little Vireos out onto the ground, and ate so much that I was quite worn out by the work of hunting for him."""
"""My dear,"" said Mr. Goldfinch, ""I have an excellent plan. We will put another floor in our nest, right over this egg, and then by adding a bit all around the sides we can have plenty of room for our own children. It will be much less work than beginning all over again, and then the Cowbird's egg will be too cool to hatch."""
"Everybody called this a most clever plan, and Mr. Goldfinch was very proud to have thought of it. They went to work once more, and it was not so very long before the new floor was done and the new walls raised."
"Then, oh, wonder of wonders! there were soon four tiny, pearly eggs of their own lying on the thistle-down lining of the nest."
"Mrs. Goldfinch had to stay very closely at home now, but her husband went off with his friends a great deal. He bathed and sang and preened his feathers and talked about his queer nest and his bright little wife, after the manner of Goldfinches everywhere."
"His friends laughed at him for helping so much about the nest, for, you know, Goldfinches do not often help their wives about home. He cocked his handsome head on one side and answered: ""My wife seemed to need me then. She is not so very strong. And I do not know what she would ever have done about the strange egg, if I had not been there to advise her."""
"When he got back to his home that night, Mrs. Goldfinch said: ""I have been wondering why we did not roll the Cowbird's egg out on the ground, instead of going to all that trouble of building around it."""
"And Mr. Goldfinch declared that he believed she was the only bird who had ever thought of such a thing. ""It could have been done just as well as not,"" he said. ""I must tell that to the other birds in the morning."
"How lucky I am to have such a bright wife! It would be dreadful if such a clever fellow as I had a dull mate!"""
MRS. MOURNING DOVE'S HOUSEKEEPING
"Strange as it may seem, there had never been any Mourning Doves in the forest until this year, and when a pair came there to live, the people were much excited. They talked about the Doves' song, so sweet and sad, and about their soft coats of brown and gray, and they wondered very much what kind of home they would build. Would it be a swinging pocket of hairs, strings, and down, like that of the Orioles? Would it be stout and heavy like the nests of the Robins? Or would it be a ball of leaves and grasses on the ground, with a tiny doorway in one side, like that of the Ovenbird?"
"You can see that the forest people were really very much interested in the Mourning Doves, and so, perhaps, it is not strange that, when the new couple built their nest in the lower branches of a spruce tree, everybody watched it and talked about it."
"""Really,"" said one of the Blackbirds, who had flown over from the swamp near by, ""I never should think of calling that thing a nest! It is nothing but a few twigs and sticks laid together. It is just as flat as a maple-leaf, and what is to keep those poor little Doves from tumbling to the ground I can't see."""
"""I wouldn't worry about the little Doves yet,"" said a Warbler. ""I don't think there will ever be any little Doves in that nest. The eggs will roll off of it long before they are ready to hatch, and the nest will blow to pieces in the first storm we have."""
"""Well,"" said the Blackbird, as she started for home, ""I shall want to know how the Mourning Doves get on. If any of you are over my way, stop and tell me the news."""
"Some days after this, a Quail, passing under the Doves' home, happened to look up and see two white eggs in the nest. It was so very thin that she could see them quite plainly through the openings between the twigs."
"Later in the day, she spoke of this to a Grouse, saying, ""I came by the Mourning Doves' nest and saw two white eggs through the bottom."""
"After she went away, the Grouse said to a wild Rabbit: ""The Quail told me that the Mourning Dove's eggs went right through the bottom of her nest, and I don't wonder. It wasn't strong enough to hold anything."""
"At sunset, the Rabbit had a short visit with Mrs. Goldfinch, as she pulled a great thistle-head to pieces and made her supper from its seeds. He told her he had heard that the Mourning Dove's eggs had fallen through the bottom of the nest and broken on the ground, and Mrs."
"Goldfinch said: ""Oh, that poor Mrs. Mourning Dove! I must go to see her in the morning."" Then she fled home to her own four pearly treasures."
"Now, of course the Rabbit was mistaken when he said anybody had told him that those two eggs were broken; just as much mistaken as the Grouse was when she said somebody had told her that the eggs had fallen. They both thought they were right, but they were careless listeners and careless talkers, and so each one had changed it a bit in the telling."
repeated Punchkin.
"""Not so fast, my master,"" rejoined the Prince; ""I must first beg that you will restore to life all whom you have thus imprisoned."""
"The Magician immediately waved his wand again; and, whilst he cried, in an imploring voice, ""Give me my parrot!"" the whole garden became suddenly alive: where rocks, and stones, and trees had been before, stood Rajas, and Punts, and Sirdars, and mighty men on prancing horses, and jewelled pages, and troops of armed attendants."
"""Give me my parrot!"" cried Punchkin. Then the boy took hold of the parrot, and tore off one of its wings; and as he did so the Magician's right arm fell off."
"Punchkin then stretched out his left arm, crying, ""Give me my parrot!"""
"The Prince pulled off the parrot's second wing, and the Magician's left arm tumbled off."
"""Give me my parrot!"" cried he, and fell on his knees. The Prince pulled off the parrot's right leg, the Magician's right leg fell off:"
"the Prince pulled off the parrot's left leg, down fell the Magician's left."
"Nothing remained of him save the limbless body and the head; but still he rolled his eyes, and cried, ""Give me my parrot!"" ""Take your parrot, then,"" cried the boy, and with that he wrung the bird's neck, and threw it at the Magician; and, as he did so, Punchkin's head twisted round, and, with a fearful groan, he died!"
"Then they let Balna out of the tower; and she, her son, and the seven Princes went to their own country, and lived very happily ever afterwards. And as to the rest of the world, every one went to his own house."
The Broken Pot
"There lived in a certain place a Brahman, whose name was Svabhavakripana, which means ""a born miser."" He had collected a quantity of rice by begging, and after having dined off it, he filled a pot with what was left over. He hung the pot on a peg on the wall, placed his couch beneath, and looking intently at it all the night, he thought, ""Ah, that pot is indeed brimful of rice. Now, if there should be a famine, I should certainly make a hundred rupees by it. With this I shall buy a couple of goats. They will have young ones every six months, and thus I shall have a whole herd of goats. Then, with the goats, I shall buy cows. As soon as they have calved, I shall sell the calves. Then, with the calves, I shall buy buffaloes; with the buffaloes, mares. When the mares have foaled, I shall have plenty of horses; and when I sell them, plenty of gold. With that gold I shall get a house with four wings. And then a Brahman will come to my house, and will give me his beautiful daughter, with a large dowry. She will have a son, and I shall call him Somasarman."
"When he is old enough to be danced on his father's knee, I shall sit with a book at the back of the stable, and while I am reading, the boy will see me, jump from his mother's lap, and run towards me to be danced on my knee. He will come too near the horse's hoof, and, full of anger, I shall call to my wife, 'Take the baby; take him!' But she, distracted by some domestic work, does not hear me. Then I get up, and give her such a kick with my foot."" While he thought this, he gave a kick with his foot, and broke the pot. All the rice fell over him, and made him quite white. Therefore, I say, ""He who makes foolish plans for the future will be white all over, like the father of Somasarman."""
The Magic Fiddle
"Once upon a time there lived seven brothers and a sister. The brothers were married, but their wives did not do the cooking for the family."
"It was done by their sister, who stopped at home to cook. The wives for this reason bore their sister-in-law much ill-will, and at length they combined together to oust her from the office of cook and general provider, so that one of themselves might obtain it. They said, ""She does not go out to the fields to work, but remains quietly at home, and yet she has not the meals ready at the proper time."" They then called upon their Bonga, and vowing vows unto him they secured his good-will and assistance; then they said to the Bonga, ""At midday when our sister-in-law goes to bring water, cause it thus to happen, that on seeing her pitcher the water shall vanish, and again slowly re-appear. In this way she will be delayed. Let the water not flow into her pitcher, and you may keep the maiden as your own."""
"At noon when she went to bring water, it suddenly dried up before her, and she began to weep. Then after a while the water began slowly to rise. When it reached her ankles she tried to fill her pitcher, but it would not go under the water. Being frightened she began to wail and cry to her brother:"
"""Oh! my brother, the water reaches to my ankles,     Still, Oh! my brother, the pitcher will not dip."""
"The water continued to rise until it reached her knee, when she began to wail again:"
"""Oh! my brother, the water reaches to my knee,     Still, Oh! my brother, the pitcher will not dip."""
"The water continued to rise, and when it reached her waist, she cried again:"
"""Oh! my brother, the water reaches to my waist,     Still, Oh! my brother, the pitcher will not dip."""
"The water still rose, and when it reached her neck she kept on crying:"
"""Oh! my brother, the water reaches to my neck,     Still, Oh! my brother, the pitcher will not dip."""
"At length the water became so deep that she felt herself drowning, then she cried aloud:"
"""Oh! my brother, the water measures a man's height,     Oh! my brother, the pitcher begins to fill."""
"The pitcher filled with water, and along with it she sank and was drowned. The Bonga then transformed her into a Bonga like himself, and carried her off."
"After a time she re-appeared as a bamboo growing on the embankment of the tank in which she had been drowned. When the bamboo had grown to an immense size, a Jogi, who was in the habit of passing that way, seeing it, said to himself, ""This will make a splendid fiddle."" So one day he brought an axe to cut it down; but when he was about to begin, the bamboo called out, ""Do not cut at the root, cut higher up."" When he lifted his axe to cut high up the stem, the bamboo cried out, ""Do not cut near the top, cut at the root."" When the Jogi again prepared himself to cut at the root as requested, the bamboo said, ""Do not cut at the root, cut higher up;"" and when he was about to cut higher up, it again called out to him, ""Do not cut high up, cut at the root."" The Jogi by this time felt sure that a Bonga was trying to frighten him, so becoming angry he cut down the bamboo at the root, and taking it away made a fiddle out of it. The instrument had a superior tone and delighted all who heard it. The Jogi carried it with him when he went a-begging, and through the influence of its sweet music he returned home every evening with a full wallet."
"He now and then visited, when on his rounds, the house of the Bonga girl's brothers, and the strains of the fiddle affected them greatly."
"Well, the story soon spread, and came up to the castle; and when the King heard the woman's grief and its cause, he sent down to say he would take care of the child, and see if he couldn't save it."
"So the months went on and on, and when her time came the fisher's wife had a boy; so the king took it at once, and brought it up as his own son, until the lad grew up. Then he begged leave one day to go out fishing with his father; he had such a mind to go, he said. At first the King wouldn't hear of it, but at last the lad had his way, and went. So he and his father were out the whole day, and all went right and well till they landed at night. Then the lad remembered he had left his handkerchief, and went to look for it; but as soon as ever he got into the boat, it began to move off with him at such speed that the water roared under the bow, and all the lad could do in rowing against it with the oars was no use; so he went and went the whole night, and at last he came to a white strand, far far away."
"There he went ashore, and when he had walked about a bit, an old, old man met him, with a long white beard."
"""What's the name of this land?"" asked the lad."
"""Whiteland,"" said the man, who went on to ask the lad whence he came, and what he was going to do. So the lad told him all."
"""Aye, aye!"" said the man; ""now when you have walked a little farther along the strand here, you'll come to three Princesses, whom you will see standing in the earth up to their necks, with only their heads out. Then the first she is the eldest will call out and beg you so prettily to come and help her; and the second will do the same; to neither of these shall you go; make haste past them, as if you neither saw nor heard anything. But the third you shall go to, and do what she asks. If you do this, you'll have good luck that's all."""
"When the lad came to the first Princess, she called out to him, and begged him so prettily to come to her, but he passed on as though he saw her not. In the same way he passed by the second; but to the third he went straight up."
"""If you'll do what I bid you,"" she said, ""you may have which of us you please."""
"""Yes;"" he was willing enough; so she told him how three Trolls had set them down in the earth there; but before they had lived in the castle up among the trees."
"""Now,"" she said, ""you must go into that castle, and let the Trolls whip you each one night for each of us. If you can bear that, you'll set us free."""
"Well, the lad said he was ready to try."
"""When you go in,"" the Princess went on to say, ""you'll see two lions standing at the gate; but if you'll only go right in the middle between them they'll do you no harm. Then go straight on into a little dark room, and make your bed. Then the Troll will come to whip you; but if you take the flask which hangs on the wall, and rub yourself with the ointment that's in it, wherever his lash falls, you'll be as sound as ever. Then grasp the sword that hangs by the side of the flask and strike the Troll dead."""
"Yes, he did as the Princess told him; he passed in the midst between the lions, as if he hadn't seen them, and went straight into the little room, and there he lay down to sleep. The first night there came a Troll with three heads and three rods, and whipped the lad soundly; but he stood it till the Troll was done; then he took the flask and rubbed himself, and grasped the sword and slew the Troll."
"So, when he went out next morning, the Princesses stood out of the earth up to their waists."
"The next night 'twas the same story over again, only this time the Troll had six heads and six rods, and he whipped him far worse than the first; but when he went out next morning, the Princesses stood out of the earth as far as the knee."
"The third night there came a Troll that had nine heads and nine rods, and he whipped and flogged the lad so long that he fainted away; then the Troll took him up and dashed him against the wall; but the shock brought down the flask, which fell on the lad, burst, and spilled the ointment all over him, and so he became as strong and sound as ever again. Then he wasn't slow; he grasped the sword and slew the Troll; and next morning when he went out of the castle the Princesses stood before him with all their bodies out of the earth."
"So he took the youngest for his Queen, and lived well and happily with her for some time."
At last he began to long to go home for a little to see his parents.
"His Queen did not like this; but at last his heart was so set on it, and he longed and longed so much, there was no holding him back, so she said:"
"""One thing you must promise me. This only to do what your father begs you to do, and not what mother wishes;"" and that he promised."
"Then she gave him a ring, which was of that kind that any one who wore it might wish two wishes. So he wished himself home, and when he got home his parents could not wonder enough what a grand man their son had become."
"Now, when he had been at home some days, his mother wished him to go up to the palace and show the King what a fine fellow he had come to be. But his father said:"
"""No! don't let him do that; if he does, we shan't have any more joy of him this time."""
"But it was no good, the mother begged and prayed so long that at last he went. So when he got up to the palace he was far braver, both in clothes and array, than the other king, who didn't quite like this, and at last he said:"
"""All very fine; but here you can see my Queen, what like she is, but I can't see yours: that I can't. Do you know, I scarce think she's so good-looking as mine."""
"""Would to Heaven,"" said the young King, ""she were standing here, then you'd see what she was like."" And that instant there she stood before them."
"But she was very woeful, and said to him:"
"""Why did you not mind what I told you; and why did you not listen to what your father said? Now, I must away home, and as for you, you have had both your wishes."""
"With that she knitted a ring among his hair with her name on it, and wished herself home, and was off."
"Then the young King was cut to the heart, and went, day out day in, thinking and thinking how he should get back to his Queen. ""I'll just try,"" he thought, ""if I can't learn where Whiteland lies;"" and so he went out into the world to ask. So when he had gone a good way, he came to a high hill, and there he met one who was lord over all the beasts of the wood, for they all came home to him when he blew his horn; so the King asked if he knew where Whiteland was."
"""No, I don't,"" said he, ""but I'll ask my beasts."" Then he blew his horn and called them, and asked if any of them knew where Whiteland lay. But there was no beast that knew."
"""Nay, but you have been in here,"" said he; ""and now you shall lose your life."""
"Then the lad begged and prayed so hard that he got off with his life, but the man gave him a good thrashing. And when it was over, they were as good friends as ever."
"Some time after the man set off again, and said he should be away fourteen days; but before he went he forbade the lad to go into any of the rooms he had not been in before; as for that he had been in, he might go into that, and welcome. Well, it was the same story over again, except that the lad stood out eight days before he went in. In this room, too, he saw nothing but a shelf over the door, and a big stone, and a pitcher of water on it. Well, after all, there's not much to be afraid of my seeing here, thought the lad."
"But when the man came back, he asked if he had been into any of the rooms. No, the lad hadn't done anything of the kind."
"""Well, well; I'll soon see that,"" said the man; and when he saw the lad had been in them after all, he said:"
"""Ah! now I'll spare you no longer; now you must lose your life."""
"But the lad begged and prayed for himself again, and so this time too he got off with stripes; though he got as many as his skin would carry. But when he got sound and well again, he led just as easy a life as ever, and he and the man were just as good friends."
"So a while after the man was to take another journey, and now he said he should be away three weeks, and he forbade the lad anew to go into the third room, for if he went in there he might just make up his mind at once to lose his life. Then after fourteen days the lad couldn't bear it, but crept into the room, but he saw nothing at all in there but a trap door on the floor; and when he lifted it up and looked down, there stood a great copper cauldron which bubbled up and boiled away down there; but he saw no fire under it."
"""Well, I should just like to know if it's hot,"" thought the lad, and struck his finger down into the broth, and when he pulled it out again, lo! it was gilded all over. So the lad scraped and scrubbed it, but the gilding wouldn't go off, so he bound a piece of rag round it; and when the man came back, and asked what was the matter with his finger, the lad said he'd given it such a bad cut. But the man tore off the rag, and then he soon saw what was the matter with the finger."
"First he wanted to kill the lad outright, but when he wept, and begged, he only gave him such a thrashing that he had to keep his bed three days. After that the man took down a pot from the wall, and rubbed him over with some stuff out of it, and so the lad was as sound and fresh as ever."
"So after a while the man started off again, and this time he was to be away a month. But before he went, he said to the lad, if he went into the fourth room he might give up all hope of saving his life."
"Well, the lad stood out for two or three weeks, but then he couldn't hold out any longer; he must and would go into that room, and so in he stole. There stood a great black horse tied up in a stall by himself, with a manger of red-hot coals at his head and a truss of hay at his tail. Then the lad thought this all wrong, so he changed them about, and put the hay at his head. Then said the Horse:"
"""Since you are so good at heart as to let me have some food, I'll set you free, that I will. For if the Troll comes back and finds you here, he'll kill you outright. But now you must go up to the room which lies just over this, and take a coat of mail out of those that hang there; and mind, whatever you do, don't take any of the bright ones, but the most rusty of all you see, that's the one to take; and sword and saddle you must choose for yourself just in the same way."""
So the lad did all that; but it was a heavy load for him to carry them all down at once.
"When he came back, the Horse told him to pull off his clothes and get into the cauldron which stood and boiled in the other room, and bathe himself there. ""If I do,"" thought the lad, ""I shall look an awful fright;"" but for all that, he did as he was told. So when he had taken his bath, he became so handsome and sleek, and as red and white as milk and blood, and much stronger than he had been before."
"""Do you feel any change?"" asked the Horse."
"""Yes,"" said the lad."
"""Try and lift me, then,"" said the Horse."
"Oh yes! he could do that, and as for the sword, he brandished it like a feather."
"""Now saddle me,"" said the Horse, ""and put on the coat of mail, and then take the bramble-bush rod, and the stone, and the pitcher of water, and the pot of ointment, and then we'll be off as fast as we can."""
"So when the lad had got on the horse, off they went at such a rate, he couldn't at all tell how they went. But when he had ridden awhile, the Horse said, ""I think I hear a noise; look round! can you see anything?"""
"""Yes; there are ever so many coming after us, at least a score,"" said the lad."
"""Aye, aye, that's the Troll coming,"" said the Horse; ""now he's after us with his pack."""
"So they rode on a while, until those who followed were close behind them."
"""Now throw your bramble-bush rod behind you, over your shoulder,"" said the Horse; ""but mind you throw it a good way off my back."""
"So the lad did that, and all at once a close, thick bramblewood grew up behind them. So the lad rode on a long, long time, while the Troll and his crew had to go home to fetch something to hew their way through the wood. But at last the Horse said again:"
"""Look behind you! can you see anything now?"""
"""Yes, ever so many,"" said the lad, ""as many as would fill a large church."""
"""Aye, aye, that's the Troll and his crew,"" said the Horse; ""now he's got more to back him; but now throw down the stone, and mind you throw it far behind me."""
"And as soon as the lad did what the Horse said, up rose a great black hill of rock behind him. So the Troll had to be off home to fetch something to mine his way through the rock; and while the Troll did that, the lad rode a good bit further on. But still the Horse begged him to look behind him, and then he saw a troop like a whole army behind him, and they glistened in the sunbeams."
"""Aye, aye,"" said the Horse, ""that's the Troll, and now he's got his whole band with him, so throw the pitcher of water behind you, but mind you don't spill any of it upon me."""
This teacher had once taught at an institution in one of the towns on
"the Volga, but in consequence of some story was dismissed.  After this"
"he was a clerk in a tannery, but again had to leave.  Then he became a"
"librarian in some private library, subsequently following other"
"professions.  Finally, after passing examinations in law he became a"
"lawyer, but drink reduced him to the Captain's dosshouse.  He was tall,"
"round-shouldered, with a long sharp nose and bald head.  In his bony"
"and yellow face, on which grew a wedge-shaped beard, shone large,"
"restless eyes, deeply sunk in their sockets, and the corners of his"
"mouth drooped sadly down.  He earned his bread, or rather his drink, by"
reporting for the local papers.  He sometimes earned as much as fifteen
roubles.  These he gave to the Captain and said:
"""It is enough.  I am going back into the bosom of culture. Another"
"week's hard work and I shall dress respectably, and then Addio, mio"
"caro!"""
"""Very exemplary!  As I heartily sympathise with your decision, Philip,"
"I shall not give you another glass all this week,"" the Captain warned"
him sternly.
"""I shall be thankful! .... You will not give me one drop?"""
The Captain heard in his voice a beseeching note to which he turned a
deaf ear.
"""Even though you roar, I shall not give it you!"""
"""As you like, then,"" sighed the teacher, and went away to continue his"
"reporting.  But after a day or two he would return tired and thirsty,"
and would look at the Captain with a beseeching glance out of the
"corners of his eyes, hoping that his friend's heart would soften."
"Upon my insistence, he accepted the gold and gave me the ten guineas he"
"had borrowed from Lilly, asking me to return them."
Frances was making an entire failure of her effort to hold herself in
"check, and George was having difficulty in restraining himself, so, to"
"bring the interview to an end, he gave me his hand, saying:--"
"""Thank you, Ned, and good-by. I wish I could hope ever to see you again,"
"but if Le Grand fails me, I shall go to the new world and lose myself in"
"the Canadian woods."""
"""No, no!"" cried Frances, imploringly."
"""I hope not,"" began George, but he could not finish, so he took Frances"
"in his arms for a moment, and when he released her, thrust us both out"
"the door, saying: ""Please leave me at once. If you do not, I fear I shall"
"never let her go. Take care of her, Ned. Good-by!"""
"The door closed on us, and when Frances had put on her vizard, she"
followed me upstairs to see Betty.
"I was not admitted to Betty's room, so I went back to the printing shop"
"for a moment, and George gave me the key to the cipher, in which we were"
"to write to each other. His letters were to be sent under cover to Lilly,"
and mine were to go to an address in Paris which George would send to me.
"Long afterwards George told me of his adventures in making his escape,"
but I shall give them now in the order of their happening rather than in
the order of time in which I learned them.
"Leaving the Old Swan within ten minutes after I had said good-by to him,"
"""Oh, there's nothing in it,"" said the watchmaker reassuringly. He had"
not a letter in his pocket.
"The doorkeeper opened his mouth to speak, but seeing his wife"
"approaching, he shut it again and busied himself with his meal."
"""What was the letter, Ned?"""
"""Oh, about the procession,"" he answered."
"""Then you got it too late. Who was it from?"""
"""If you'd give us the tea,"" he broke out roughly, ""and let the damned"
"letter alone, it 'ud be a deal better."""
"""La, you needn't fly out at a woman so,"" said Mrs. Evans. ""It ain't the"
"way to treat his wife, is it, mister?"""
"""Mister"" gallantly reproved his friend, but pleaded that they were both"
"weary, and weary legs made short tempers. Giving them the tea, she left"
them to themselves; her work was not finished till three small children
were safely in bed.
The sensation of having one's neck for the first time within measurable
"distance of a rope must needs be somewhat disquieting. The doorkeeper,"
"in spite of his secret society doings, was a timid man, with a vastly"
"respectful fear of the law. To talk about things, to vapour idly about"
"them over the cups, is very different from being actually, even though"
"remotely, mixed up in them. Ned Evans was a man of some education: he"
"read the papers, accounts of crimes and reports of trials; he had heard"
of accessories after and before the fact. Was he not an accessory after
"the fact? He fancied they did not hang such; but if they caught him, and"
"shut his mouth by and by, when I have more time to attend to such"
"matters."""
"""How much do you want?"" Slyne inquired with a frown evidently meant to"
warn his friend to be modest.
"""Can you spare twenty pounds--to go on with?"""
"Slyne hesitated, but only for a few seconds. Then he pulled out a"
pocket-book and surreptitiously passed that sum to the penniless man of
"law, who accepted it with no more than a nod of thanks."
"""I'll pay Mullins now,"" he remarked, and immediately hurried out of the"
room. Captain Dove was gasping for breath and showed every other symptom
of a forthcoming explosion.
"As soon as the door shut behind him, the old man gave open vent to his"
wrath. And a most furious quarrel followed between Slyne and him.
"Sallie, too, learned then, for the first time, of the vast inheritance"
"which would be hers, of Slyne's cunning plan to buy Captain Dove out for"
"a mere pittance, and how he himself expected to profit through marrying"
her.
But she was not overwhelmed with surprise by that belated discovery. She
had almost anticipated the final disclosure of some such latent motive
behind all Slyne's professions to her. The only difference it might make
would be to Captain Dove. Slyne and he were still snarling at each other
when Mr. Jobling walked jauntily in again. But at sight of him Captain
Dove began to subside.
"""We mustn't be late. Mr. Spettigrew will be expecting us now. I've sent"
"Mullins on ahead with my papers,"" observed Mr. Jobling breezily, and"
For him also there seemed no other escape. He pointed to the revolver.
"""For whom is that?"" he asked."
"""I do not know--but I will make them kill me."""
"""Why do you not shoot me, then?"" he demanded, between despair and"
"bitterness. ""That would save you all. If I fell, they would turn and"
fly. They think I am Vishnu. Haven't you thought of that? I am in your
power. Why don't you make yourself the benefactress of your country?
"Why don't you shoot her enemy?"""
"She made no answer, but her eyes met his steadily and calmly. He"
"turned away, groaning. In vain he fought against it, in vain stung"
himself to action by the memory of all that she had done to him. His
love remained triumphant. In that supreme moment his faith burst
"through the darkness, and again he believed in her, believed in her"
"against reason, against the world, against the ineffaceable past, and"
against himself. And it was too late. He no longer stood alone. His
word was given.
"""Have pity on me!"" he said, once more facing her. ""Let me save you!"""
"""I should despise myself, and you would despise me--even more than you"
do now. I can not do less than share the fate of those whose lives my
"folly has jeopardized."""
"""At least go back to them--do not stay here. Beatrice, for God's"
"sake!--I can not turn back. You have made me suffer enough--."" He"
"stood before her now as an incoherent pleader, and her heart burned"
with an exultation in which the thought of life and death played no
part. She knew that he still loved her. It seemed for the moment all
"""And what's more,"" said Slyne, playing a trump card with great outward"
"indifference, ""you can make him pay you for your time instead of you"
paying him. I told you I came back here to do you a good turn. There's
more than a hundred thousand dollars of easy money for you in this
deal--if you go the right way about it.
"""But--don't take my word for anything."""
Captain Dove had palpable difficulty in suppressing the obvious repartee
to that last bit of advice. But cupidity and cunning kept him quiet for
a space.
"""All right. I'll go with you,"" he agreed very gruffly at last. And Slyne"
heaved a silent sigh of relief; he had feared more than once that the
contest of wills would after all go against him.
"""You're wise,"" he commented carelessly. ""It will pay you."
"""You'd better see Sallie now, don't you think, and tell her--"""
"""I'm not going to interfere between you and her--till I get my money"
"from you,"" declared the old man with a crafty grin. ""You must tackle her"
"yourself. She'll be up by now, but breakfast won't be ready for half an"
hour. If I were you I'd take that coat off and let her have a sight of
"those diamonds of yours."""
"Slyne did not wait to hear any more. He was already on his way aft, a"
somewhat incongruous figure on the decks of the _Olive Branch_. When he
reached the companion-hatch on the poop he was smiling sardonically.
"""I do believe it was my 'diamonds' that finally fetched that old"

CHAPTER VI.
HOW TO OBTAIN AND MAINTAIN THE EFFECT OF THE STORY.
WE are now coming to the most important part of the question of
"Story-Telling, to which all the foregoing remarks have been gradually"
"leading, and that is the Effects of these stories upon the child, apart"
"from the dramatic joy he experiences in listening to them, which would"
"in itself be quite enough to justify us in the telling. But, since I"
have urged upon teachers the extreme importance of giving so much time
to the manner of telling and of bestowing so much care on the selection
"of the material, it is right that they should expect some permanent"
"results, or else those who are not satisfied with the mere enjoyment of"
the children will seek other methods of appeal--and it is to them that
I most specially dedicate this chapter.
"I think we are on the threshold of the re-discovery of an old truth,"
"that the Dramatic Presentation is the quickest and surest, because"
it is the only one with which memory plays no tricks. If a thing has
from above.  No sound of the dogs.  He would go up and see the baby.
"While he was crossing the hall, there came a ring.  He opened the door"
himself.  A telegram!  He tore the envelope.
"""Gyp and the baby are with me letter follows.--WINTON."""
"He gave a short laugh, shut the door in the boy's face, and ran upstairs;"
why--heaven knew!  There was nobody there now!  Nobody! Did it mean that
she had really left him--was not coming back?  He stopped by the side of
"Gyp's bed, and flinging himself forward, lay across it, burying his face."
"And he sobbed, as men will, unmanned by drink.  Had he lost her?  Never"
to see her eyes closing and press his lips against them!  Never to soak
"his senses in her loveliness!  He leaped up, with the tears still wet on"
"his face. Lost her?  Absurd!  That calm, prim, devilish Englishman, her"
father--he was to blame--he had worked it all--stealing the baby!
He went down-stairs and drank some brandy.  It steadied him a little.
"What should he do?  ""Letter follows.""  Drink, and wait? Go to Bury"
Street?  No.  Drink!  Enjoy himself!
"He laughed, and, catching up his hat, went out, walking furiously at"
"first, then slower and slower, for his head began to whirl, and, taking a"
"cab, was driven to a restaurant in Soho.  He had eaten nothing but a"
"biscuit since his breakfast, always a small matter, and ordered soup and"
a flask of their best Chianti--solids he could not face.  More than two
"hours he sat, white and silent, perspiration on his forehead, now and"
"then grinning and flourishing his fingers, to the amusement and sometimes"
"the alarm of those sitting near.  But for being known there, he would"
"have been regarded with suspicion.  About half-past nine, there being no"
"more wine, he got up, put a piece of gold on the table, and went out"
without waiting for his change.
and turned her five cards face upwards.
"""No, Jack, it's because I've won,--three aces and a pair."""
"The Sheriff shot one glance at the girl, keen, searching. Then, without"
"so much as the twitch of an eyelid, he accepted his defeat, took a cigar"
"from his pocket and lit it, the flame of the match revealing no"
"expression other than the nonchalance for which he was noted; then,"
picking up his hat and coat he walked slowly to the door. Here he halted
and wished her a polite good-night--so ceremoniously polite that at any
other time it would have compelled her admiration.
"Pale as death and almost on the point of collapse, the Girl staggered"
"back to the table where the wounded road agent was half-sitting,"
half-lying.
Thrusting her hand now into the stocking from which she had obtained the
"winning, if incriminating, cards, she drew forth those that remained and"
"scattered them in the air, crying out hysterically:"
"""Three aces an' a pair an' a stockin' full o' pictures--but his life"
"belongs to me!"""
XIV.
"Conscious-stricken at the fraud that she had imposed upon the gambler,"
the Girl lived a lifetime in the moments that followed his departure.
With her face buried in her hands she stood lost in contemplation of her
"Panama is divided into seven provinces, Bocas del Toro, Cocle, Colon,"
"Chiriqui, Los Santos, Panama and Veragua. Its total population by the"
"census of 1911 was 386,749, a trifle more than the District of Columbia"
"which has about one five-thousandth of its area, and almost precisely"
the same population as Montana which has less than half its size. So it
"is clearly not over-populated. Of its population 51,323 are set down by"
"its own census takers as white, 191,933 as mestizo, or a cross between"
"white and Indian, 48,967 as negro; 2313 Mongol, and 14,128 Indian. The"
"census takers estimated that other Indians, living in barbarism remote"
"from civilization and unapproachable by the enumerators, numbered"
"36,138."
[Illustration: NATIVE FAMILY IN CHORRERA]
All these figures have to be qualified somewhat. The mestizos are
"theoretically a cross between whites and Indians, but the negro blood is"
"very generally present. It is doubtful, too, whether those classed as"
white are not often of mixed blood.
A singularly large proportion of the population lives in the towns. In
"12 towns, exceeding 7000 inhabitants each, are more than 150,000 people."
"More than one-third of the people therefore are town dwellers, which is"
to say they are unproductive citizens. Meanwhile more than five-eighths
of the arable land in the country is not under cultivation.
The five chief towns of Panama with their population in 1911 are:
"Panama             37,505"
"Colon              17,748"
"David              15,059"
"Santiago           13,081"
"Bocas del Toro      9,759"
"The little withered lady, all pleased excitement, said: “_Quite_"
"thrilling, James!”"
"Pangbutt seeing awkwardness at the door, and missing the loud"
"announcement of names, went a few paces closer to it to meet his"
newly-arrived guests.
"The little old gentleman entered the room vaguely, the dandruff of"
"the philosophic habit upon his coat-collar, and his wig full of"
reasons--very markedly a professor. He had the air of cataloguing
"ideas. The little old lady, a couple of paces behind him, followed him."
Pangbutt exchanged greetings with him.
Said the professor:
"“Good-evening, sir; my sister’s husband’s brother-in-law, Sir Gilders"
"Persimmon, was good enough to say that you would allow me to meet"
Mr. Anthony Bickersteth here.... I am writing a work to disprove
the insanity of genius.... It is a part of my theory that the human
personality cannot be hidden by artifice--that the strong temperament
shows itself in the vigorous growth of the hair--and so on.... I
"am, sir, I may have forgotten to say, Professor Curtis.... I am an"
"inveterate novel-reader.... My wife keeps a diary.... Where are you,"
"Charlotte? Ah, yes. But, fervently as I admire Mr. Bickersteth’s prose,"
I should like to suggest to him that in his next work he might make
"more of that unworked mine, the folk-lore of the London coster--or"
greengrocer.... I am most anxious that Mr. Bickersteth should be a
virile person whose moustache springs out strongly from under the
"nostrils, with a tendency towards ruddiness in the colouring.... But"
"I fear that on this--what I may call his--er,” he tittered--“his"
plainly ill at ease at this open defiance of the supposedly infallible
check-stations.
"""Not that baby,"" returned the computer confidently. ""I'll bet you a"
small farm against a plugged nickel that right now he's working his
goniometer so hard that it's pivots are getting hot. He'll sneak back
"into position as soon as he can calculate his results, and pretend he's"
"always been there."""
"""The others will be all right, then, probably, by the time we get to"
"them?"""
"""Gosh, no--you're unusually dumb today, Breck. He won't tell anybody"
"anything--he doesn't want to be the only goat, does he?"""
"""Oh, I see. How could you dope this out, with only the recorder charts?"""
"""Because I know the kind of stuff you pilots are--and those humps are"
altogether too big to be accounted for by anything I know about you.
"Another thing--the next station, P6, I think is keeping himself all x."
"If so, when you corrected for E2, which was wrong, it'd throw you all"
"off on P6, which was right, and so on--a bad hump at almost every"
"check-station. See?"""
*       *       *       *       *
"True to prediction, the pilot ray of P6 came in almost upon the exact"
"center of the micrometer screen, and Breckenridge smiled in relief as he"
began really to enjoy the trip.
"""How do we check on chronometers?"" asked P6 when Stevens had been"
"introduced. ""By my time you seem to be about two and a half seconds"
so damned easy?”
"“Tell us why you say that, Stellamaris,” said Herold."
"John rose suddenly and stood by the west window, which was closed."
Stella's high bed had been drawn next to the window open to the south.
"The room was warm, for a great fire blazed in the tall chimneypiece. He"
"rose to hide his eyes from Stella, confounding Herold for a marplot. Was"
this the way to make his task easier? He heard Stella say in her sweet
contralto:
“Do you imagine it 's just for silly foolishness I call you Great High
"Belovedest and Great High Favourite? You see, Walter dear, I gave John"
"his title before I knew you, so I had to make some difference in yours."
"But they mean everything to me. I live in the sky such a lot, and it's"
a beautiful life; but I know there 's another life in the great world--a
"beautiful life, too.” She wrinkled her forehead. “Oh, it 's so difficult"
"to explain! It's so hard to talk about feelings, because the moment you"
"begin to talk about them, the feelings become so vague. It's like trying"
to tell any one the shape of a sunset.” She paused for a moment or two;
Herold smiled at her and nodded encouragingly. Presently she went on:
"“I 'll try to put it this way. Often a gull, you see, comes hovering"
"outside here and looks in at me, oh, for a long time, with his round,"
"yellow eyes; and my heart beats, and I love him, for he tells me all"
"about the sea and sky and clouds, where I'll never go,--not really,--and"
"I live the sky life through him, and more than ever since you sent me"
that poem--I know it by heart--about the sea-gull. Who wrote it?”
"“Swinburne,” said Herold."
“Did he write anything else?”
"""Now, Miss Sparling, no hoopla. I'm saying let's get married, and you"
know it. You figured out from what the boy told you that I was chewing
"on you for a wife. You're healthy and strong, got good heredity, you"
"know how to operate sub-surface machinery, you've lived underwater, and"
your disposition's no worse than most of the anura I've seen. Prolific
"stock, too."""
"I was so excited I just had to yell: ""Gee, Sis, say _yes_!"""
*       *       *       *       *
"My sister's voice was steaming with scorn. ""And what makes you think"
"that I'd consider you a desirable husband?"""
"He spread his hands genially. ""Figure if you wanted a poodle, you're"
pretty enough to pick one up on Earth. Figure if you charge off to
"Venus, you don't want a poodle, you want a man. I'm one. I own three"
islands in the Galertan Archipelago that'll be good oozing mudgrape
land when they're cleared. Not to mention the rich berzeliot beds
offshore. I got no bad habits outside of having my own way. I'm also
"passable good-looking for a slaptoe planter. Besides, if you marry"
me you'll be the first mated on this ship--and that's a splash most
"nesting females like to make."""
There was a longish stretch of quiet. Sis stepped back and measured him
slowly with her eyes; there was a lot to look at. He waited patiently
while she covered the distance from his peculiar green boots to that
head of hair. I was so excited I was gulping instead of breathing.
Imagine having Butt for a brother-in-law and living on a wet-plantation
in Flatfolk country!
But then I remembered Sis's level head and I didn't have much hope any
the dynasty [will come to an end].

"If it is a double foetus and encompassed like an enclosure, confusion"

The Lady’s Maid
_Eleven o’clock. A knock at the door._
"... I hope I haven’t disturbed you, madam. You weren’t asleep—were you?"
"But I’ve just given my lady her tea, and there was such a nice cup"
"over, I thought, perhaps...."
"... Not at all, madam. I always make a cup of tea last thing. She"
drinks it in bed after her prayers to warm her up. I put the kettle on
"when she kneels down and I say to it, “Now you needn’t be in too much"
of a hurry to say _your_ prayers.” But it’s always boiling before my
"lady is half through. You see, madam, we know such a lot of people, and"
they’ve all got to be prayed for—every one. My lady keeps a list of the
names in a little red book. Oh dear! whenever some one new has been to
"see us and my lady says afterwards, “Ellen, give me my little red"
"book,” I feel quite wild, I do. “There’s another,” I think, “keeping"
"her out of her bed in all weathers.” And she won’t have a cushion, you"
"know, madam; she kneels on the hard carpet. It fidgets me something"
"dreadful to see her, knowing her as I do. I’ve tried to cheat her; I’ve"
"spread out the eiderdown. But the first time I did it—oh, she gave me"
"such a look—holy it was, madam. “Did our Lord have an eiderdown,"
"Ellen?” she said. But—I was younger at the time—I felt inclined to say,"
"“No, but our Lord wasn’t your age, and he didn’t know what it was to"
"have your lumbago.” Wicked—wasn’t it? But she’s _too_ good, you know,"
"madam. When I tucked her up just now and seen—saw her lying back, her"
hands outside and her head on the pillow—so pretty—I couldn’t help
"thinking, “Now you look just like your dear mother when I laid her"
out!”
"""Yes. He is coming up soon for instructions. It's his last chance, as"
it is mine. He sees that he must be held responsible for the wire
"cutting in the _Antinous_, and to some slight extent also in the"
"_Antigone_, and that if anything goes wrong with the _Malplaquet_ he"
"will be dismissed. I shall be sorry to lose him, for he is an"
"exceptionally good man, but we can't allow failures in petty officer"
"detectives any more than we can in chief inspectors."""
"""Where does Trehayne come from? His name sounds Cornish,"" I asked."
"""Falmouth, I believe. He is quite young, but he has had nearly three"
years in the _Vernon_ at Portsmouth and in the torpedo factory at
Greenock. A first-class engineer and electrician and a sound
detective. He has been with me for some twelve months. You will see
"him if he calls soon."""
I had been thinking hard over the details of Dawson's plans while the
"talk went on, and then ventured to offer some comments."
"""It is fortunate that you have grown a moustache since you were in the"
"north; you could not have been a Marine as a clean-shaven man."""
"""I often have to shave it,"" said Dawson, ""but I always grow it again"
between whiles. One can take it off quicker than one can put it on
again. False hair is the devil; I have never used it yet and never
will. So whenever I have a spell of leisure I grow a moustache against
"emergencies--like this one."""
"My next comment was rather difficult to make, for I did not wish"
"either Cary or Dawson to divine its purpose. ""If I may make a"
suggestion to a man of your experience it would be that none of your
was glad to see Frances.
*       *       *       *       *
"During the first week of Bettina's illness she was too sick to talk,"
therefore we did not remain long with her. But as she grew better our
"visits lengthened, and my poor resolutions grew weaker day by day because"
my love for the girl was growing stronger and stronger hour by hour.
"On one occasion while Frances's back was turned, Betty impulsively"
"snatched up my hand and kissed it, dropping it instantly, blushing"
intensely and covering her tracks by humming the refrain of a French
"lullaby. I longed to return the caress, but did not, and took great"
credit to myself because of my self-denial. Betty understood my sacrifice
"and appreciated it, feeling sure that she need not thereafter restrain"
herself for the purpose of restraining me.
During those times I was making an honest effort to do the right by this
beautiful child-woman and to save my own honor unsullied from the sin of
making her unhappy for life through winning her love beyond her power to
"recall; and my effort toward the right, like all such efforts, achieved"
at least a part of the good for which I strove.
"One day after our visit to Betty's room, Frances asked me to take her to"
"see George. I suspected that she had seen him frequently, but was not"
"sure. I objected, but changed my mind when she said:--"
"""Very well. I prefer going alone."""
I shall not try to describe the scene between them. We found George
"alone, and she sprang to him as the iron springs to the magnet."
Louis XIV because of a too great friendliness for one of the king's
"sweethearts, and was living in exile in London till Louis should forgive"
his interference. The French king really liked De Grammont and trusted
"him when his Majesty's lady-loves were not concerned, so the count had"
"been sent to England in honorable exile, and was employed in certain"
cases as a spy and in others as a means of secret communication between
the French king and persons connected with the court of Charles II.
"When De Grammont saw me, he came forward, holding out both hands in his"
"effusive French manner, apparently overjoyed at finding a long-lost"
brother.
"""Come with me, my dear baron,"" he cried, bending so close to me that I"
"feared he was going to kiss me. ""Come with me! You are the very man of"
"all the world I want, I need, I must have!"""
"""You have me, my dear count,"" said I, ""but I cannot go with you. I am"
"engaged elsewhere."""
"""No, no, let me whisper!"" He brought his lips close to my ear and"
"continued almost inaudibly: ""You may please me. You may help a friend."
"You may oblige--a king."""
"The last, of course, was the _ne plus ultra_ of inducement according to"
"the count's way of thinking, and he supposed the mere suggestion would"
"vanquish me. Still I pleaded my engagement. He insisted, however,"
repeating in my ear:--
"""Oblige a king! A real king! Not a flimsy fool of bourgeois, who makes of"
"himself the laughing-stock of his people, but a real king. I cannot name"
"him now, but you must know."""
"you."" And he fell to polishing his furry, old-fashioned top-hat with a"
"tail of the scanty, ill-fitting frock-coat he had donned along with a"
noisome waistcoat in honour of the occasion.
"Slyne shrugged his shoulders, despairingly, and, having made an end of"
"his unappetising meal, prepared for the road. Then he lighted a cigar"
"very much at his leisure, while Captain Dove regarded him grimly, and"
led the way on deck without further words.
"Sallie was ready and waiting at the companion-hatch on the poop, as"
pretty as a picture in the sables Captain Dove had given her a year
before--after a very lucrative season of poaching on the Siberian coast.
"As soon as she caught sight of them she came forward, followed by"
"Ambrizette, whose appearance, in cloak and turban, was even a worse"
offence to Slyne's fastidious taste than Captain Dove's had been.
"""What a calamitous circus!"" he muttered between set teeth. ""I must get"
rid of those two somehow--and soon. But till then--
"""My car's at the back of those coal-wagons there,"" he told Captain Dove"
"with great dignity, and Captain Dove turned to the engine-room hatch."
"""Below there!"" he called down. ""Is that Mr. Brasse? I'm off now, Brasse."
"You'll carry out all my instructions, eh? And--don't quarrel with Da"
"Costa, d'ye hear?"""
"""Ay, ay, sir,"" answered a dreary voice from the depths below, and"
"Captain Dove faced about again to find Sallie, flushed and anxious,"
waiting with Ambrizette at the gangway.
"""Come on,"" he ordered irascibly, and Sallie followed him down the"
"plank. Ambrizette shuffled fearfully after her, and Slyne came last, his"
"girl's arm and whispered in her ear that she must be brave, a true"
"Andaluse, and not compromise the expedition by any spoken word."
"Concha turned indignantly upon her, shaking off her restraining hand as"
she did so.
"""Do you think I am a fool?"" she whispered. ""I will do nothing to spoil"
"their chances. But oh, Giralda, at any moment he might be shot!"""
"""Trust José Maria. He hath taken risks far greater than this,"" said La"
"Giralda in a low voice, wilfully mistaking her meaning. But Concha,"
"quite unconsoled, did nothing but clasp her hands and quicken her"
supplications to the Virgin.
"The ladder was reared against the gilded iron railing and Rollo mounted,"
immediately dropping lightly down on the further side. The Sergeant
"followed, and presently both were on the ground. At a word from Rollo,"
El Sarria pushed the ladder over and the two received it and laid it
along the parapet in a place where it would remain completely hidden
till wanted.
"The two moved off together in the direction of the porter's lodge, at"
"the door of which the Sergeant knocked lightly, and then, obtaining no"
"answer, with more vehemence. A window was lifted and a frightened voice"
asked who came there at that time of night.
The Sergeant answered with some sharpness that they wished for the key
of the great gate.
Upon this the same old woman who had ushered out La Giralda appeared
"trembling at the lattice, and was but little relieved when the Sergeant,"
"putting on his most serious air, informed her that her life was in the"
"“It was only natural on my part,” she said amiably. “I shall never"
"forget when poor Flossie died. You remember Flossie, don't you? She used"
"to look so pretty, with her blue bow in her hair, and no one will ever"
persuade me that she was n't poisoned by the people next door; they were
dreadful people. I wish I could remember their name; it was something
"like Blunks. Anyhow, I was inconsolable, and Mrs. Tawley asked me to"
stay with her to get over it. I shall never forget how grateful I
"was. I'm sure you 're looking quite poorly, John,” she added in her"
inconsequent way. “Let me get you a cup of tea. It will do you good.”
"John declined. He wanted to accomplish his errand, but the longer he"
"remained in the company of this lady devoid of the sense of values, the"
more absurd did that errand seem. A less obstinate man than he would
"have abandoned it, but John had made up his mind to act on Herold's"
"suggestion, although he mentally bespattered the suggester with varied"
"malediction. He rose and, making his way between the flimsy chairs and"
"tables, stood on the hearth-rug, his hands in his pockets. Unconsciously"
"he scowled at his placid and smiling aunt, who remained seated on the"
"couch, her helpless hands loosely folded on her lap."
“Did you ever hear of a child called Unity Blake?”
“Was that the girl--”
“Yes.”
“What an outlandish name! I often wonder how people come to give such
names to children.”
"“Never mind her name, my dear aunt,” said John, gruffly. “I want to tell"
you about her.”
"“I see what you mean,” said he."
"“I should hope so,” said Herold."
"He looked at his watch and jumped to his feet. “Star of the Sea,” said"
"he, “to talk with you is the most fascinating occupation on earth; but"
"managers are desperate fellows, and I 'll get into boiling water if I"
miss my rehearsal.” He turned to John. “I don't see how you are going to
catch this train.”
"“Neither do I,” said John. “I shall go by the one after.”"
"Herold took his leave, promising to run down for the week-end. Constable"
"accompanied him to the door in a dignified way, and this ceremony of"
"politeness accomplished, stalked back to the hearth-rug, where he threw"
"himself down, his head on his paws, and his faithful eyes fixed on his"
mistress. John sat down again by the bedside. There was a short silence
during which Stellamaris smiled at him and he smiled at Stellamaris.
“Does n't the Great High Belovedest want to smoke?”
"“Badly,” said John."
She held out her hand for the pipe and tobacco-pouch. He gave them to
"her, and she filled the pipe. For a while he smoked peacefully. From"
where he sat all he could see of the outside world was the waste of
sun-kissed waters stretching away and melting into a band of pearly
cloud on the horizon. He might have been out at sea. Possibly this time
"next week he would be, and the salt air would be playing, as now, about"
his head. But on board that ship would be no spacious sea-chamber like
"this, so gracious in its appointments--its old oak and silver, its"
"bright chintzes, its quiet old engravings, its dainty dressing-table"
to the minute. In his earlier days he had frequently felt the same
"nervousness, the same intense mental activity, just prior to an"
"important race or game, and he was familiar with those disquieting,"
"panicky moments when, for no apparent reason, his heart thumped and a"
"physical sickness mastered him. He knew that the fever would leave him,"
"once the salmon began to run, just as it had always vanished at the"
crack of the starter's pistol or the shrill note of the referee's
"whistle. He was eager for action, eager to find himself possessed of"
"that gloating, gruelling fury that drives men through to the finish"
"line. Meanwhile, he was anxious to divert his mind into other channels."
Cherry's house was situated a short distance above the cannery which
"served as Willis Marsh's headquarters, and Boyd's path necessarily took"
him past his enemy's very stronghold. Finding the tide too high to
"permit of passing beneath the dock, he turned up among the buildings,"
"where, to his surprise, he encountered his own day-foreman talking"
earnestly with a stranger.
"The fisherman started guiltily as he saw him, and Boyd questioned him"
sharply.
"""What are you doing here, Larsen?"""
"""I just walked up after supper to have a talk with an old mate."""
"""Who is he?"" Boyd glanced suspiciously at Larsen's companion."
"""He's Mr. Marsh's foreman."""
"Emerson spoke out bluntly: ""See here. I don't like this. These people"
"have caused me a lot of trouble already, and I don't want my men"
"hanging around here."""
whilst I settle the bill and ask for food for the journey. The brown
woman fishes out from a huge black pot in the background sundry hunks of
"coarse boiled pork, and gives me two of these, hot, with bread and salt."
This is the luncheon. I pay the bill: which amounts to twenty-four
"francs, for everything. (One says francs or liras, irrespective, in"
"Italy.) At that moment arrives the train from Cagliari, and men rush in,"
"roaring for the soup--or rather, for the broth. ""Ready, ready!"" she"
"cries, going to the black pot."
V.
TO SORGONO.
"The various trains in the junction squatted side by side and had long,"
long talks before at last we were off. It was wonderful to be running in
"the bright morning towards the heart of Sardinia, in the little train"
"that seemed so familiar. We were still going third class, rather to the"
disgust of the railway officials at Mandas.
"At first the country was rather open: always the long spurs of hills,"
"steep-sided, but not high. And from our little train we looked across"
"the country, across hill and dale. In the distance was a little town, on"
"a low slope. But for its compact, fortified look it might have been a"
town on the English downs. A man in the carriage leaned out of the
"window holding out a white cloth, as a signal to someone in the far off"
"town that he was coming. The wind blew the white cloth, the town in the"
distance glimmered small and alone in its hollow. And the little train
pelted along.
"Alicia huddled herself in a heap on the sofa, turning her face to the"
wall. She felt Lady Eynesford's scornful rebuke like the stroke of a
"whip. She had descended to a vulgar wrangle, and had been worsted in it:"
the one thing of all which it concerned her to hide had by her own act
been opened to the jeer of a stranger; she had violated every rule of
good breeding and self-respect. No words--not even Lady
Eynesford's--were too strong to describe what she had done. Yet she
could not help it; she could not hear a creature like that abuse or
"condemn a man like Medland--though all that he had said she had said,"
"and more, to Medland himself. She was too miserable to think; she lay"
"with closed eyes and parted lips, breathing quickly, and restlessly"
moving her limbs in that strange physical discomfort which great
unhappiness brings with it.
"A footstep roused her; she sat up, hurriedly smoothing her hair and"
clutching at a book that lay on the table by her. The intruder was her
"brother, and fortunately he was too intent on the tidings he brought to"
notice her confusion.
"""Great news, Al!"" he cried. ""They've offered me Ireland. We shall start"
"home in a month."""
"""Home in a month?"" she echoed."
"""Yes. Splendid, isn't it?"""
"""You're pleased, Willie?"""
"The Governor was very pleased. He liked the promotion, he liked going"
"home; and finally, pleasant as his stay in New Lindsey had been on the"
"whole, there were features in the present position which made him not"
sorry to depart.
Three months--and in this state of misery!
"""I think I shall do something desperate.  Now that I can't dance, and"
"THEY know, it's too awful!  If I could see him, I wouldn't mind anything."
"But I know--I know he'll never want me again.  Oh, Mrs. Fiorsen, I wish I"
"was dead!  I do!"""
"A heavy sigh escaped Gyp, and, bending suddenly, she kissed the girl's"
"forehead.  Still that scent of orange blossom about her skin or hair, as"
"when she asked whether she ought to love or not; as when she came,"
"moth-like, from the tree-shade into the moonlight, spun, and fluttered,"
"with her shadow spinning and fluttering before her.  Gyp turned away,"
"feeling that she must relieve the strain and pointing to the bowl, said:"
"""YOU put that there, I'm sure.  It's beautiful."""
"The girl answered, with piteous eagerness:"
"""Oh, would you like it?  Do take it.  Count Rosek gave it me.""  She"
"started away from the door.  ""Oh, that's papa.  He'll be coming in!"""
"Gyp heard a man clear his throat, and the rattle of an umbrella falling"
into a stand; the sight of the girl wilting and shrinking against the
"sideboard steadied her.  Then the door opened, and Mr. Wagge entered."
"Short and thick, in black frock coat and trousers, and a greyish beard,"
"he stared from one to the other.  He looked what he was, an Englishman"
"and a chapelgoer, nourished on sherry and mutton, who could and did make"
"his own way in the world.  His features, coloured, as from a deep"
"liverishness, were thick, like his body, and not ill-natured, except for"
"a sort of anger in his small, rather piggy grey eyes.  He said in a voice"
"permanently gruff, but impregnated with a species of professional"
ingratiation:
"she had reached the great dramatic moment, the child raised his hands"
"in terror and said: “Oh! Auntie, don't let the bear _really_ eat the"
boy!”
"“Don't you know,” said an impatient boy who had been listening to a"
"mild adventure story considered suitable to his years, “that I don't"
take any interest in the story until the decks are dripping with gore?”
Here we have no opportunity of deciding whether or not the actual
description demanded would be more alarming than the listener had
realised.
"Here is a poem of James Stephens, showing a child's taste for"
sensational things:--
A man was sitting underneath a tree
"Outside the village, and he asked me"
"What name was upon this place, and said he"
Was never here before. He told a
Lot of stories to me too. His nose was flat.
"I asked him how it happened, and he said,"
"The first mate of the  “Mary Ann”  done that,"
"With a marling-spike one day, but he was dead,"
"And a jolly job too, but he'd have gone a long way to have"
killed him.
"A gold ring in one ear, and the other was bit off by a crocodile,"
"bedad,"
That's what he said: He taught me how to chew.
He was a real nice man. He liked me too.
The taste that is fed by the sensational contents of the newspapers
"and the dramatic excitement of street life, and some of the lurid"

"returned to their owners. To prevent Searle's doing such things again, he"
"was deprived of his ship's rudder and sails. In 1666, Searle, in company"
"with a Captain Stedman and a party of only eighty men, took the Island of"
"Tobago, near Trinidad, from the Dutch, destroying everything they could"
not carry away.
"SELKIRK, ALEXANDER. The original Robinson Crusoe."
"Born in 1676 at Largo in Fifeshire, he was the seventh son of John"
"Selcraig, a shoemaker. In 1695 he was cited to appear before the Session"
"for ""indecent conduct in church,"" but ran away to sea. In 1701 he was back"
"again in Largo, and was rebuked in the face of the congregation for"
"quarrelling with his brothers. A year later Selkirk sailed to England, and"
in 1703 joined Dampier's expedition to the South Seas. Appointed
"sailing-master to the _Cinque Ports_, commanded by Captain Stradling."
"In September, 1704, he arrived at the uninhabited island of Juan"
"Fernandez, in the South Pacific. Selkirk, having quarrelled with the"
"captain, insisted on being landed on the island with all his belongings."
"He lived alone here for nearly four years, building himself two cabins,"
"hunting the goats which abounded, and taming young goats and cats to be"
his companions.
"On the night of January 31st, 1709, seeing two ships, Selkirk lit a fire,"
and a boat was sent ashore. These ships were the _Duke_ and _Duchess_ of
"Bristol, under the command of Captain Woodes Rogers, while his old friend"
Dampier was acting as pilot. Selkirk was at once appointed sailing-master
"of the _Duchess_, and eventually arrived back in the Thames on October"
"14th, 1711, with booty worth £800, having been away from England for eight"
"years. While in England he met Steele, who described Selkirk as a ""man of"
"good sense, with strong but cheerful expression."" Whether Selkirk ever met"
"that we have Ned Nestor, the alleged juvenile detective, at our camp. He"
"seems inclined to keep what information he possesses to himself, and,"
"before proceeding to extreme measures with him, we decided to lay the"
case before you. I am afraid Nestor will receive rough treatment at the
hands of my allies unless the information they demand is given them.”
"“So that was a lying message you sent Nestor, was it?”"
"“There’s no use in discussing the matter at length,” the other stated."
“I think I’d better take you boys into camp and let the boss talk with
"you. And let me warn you now, before anything more is said, not to"
"attempt resistance. If you do, there’ll be shooting done, and it won’t"
"be my men who will get hurt! Now, face about to the north and march away"
"to camp, like good little boys. We don’t want to hurt you, but we insist"
on having our way in the matter of this information. Perhaps Nestor may
be able to convince you that you ought not to be so obstinate.”
"“I don’t think Nestor will attempt anything of the kind,” replied Jack,"
“and I think that you are a great big bluff!”
CHAPTER X
GILROY AND THE BEAR
"When, at last, Ned and Jimmie, still watching about for hostile forces,"
"came to the barricaded camp, the fire had burned down and no one was in"
sight. Ned regarded the wall of rock with a smile.
“Isn’t that great?” Jimmie asked.
"if you wish to make sure whether it is a good auspice or a bad, you kill"
"the spider and count its legs. If they are an even number, it is a good"
"omen; if uneven, bad.”"
"“But I believe spiders always have an even number of legs,” said Cæsar."
"“Certainly,” responded the old man; “but my wife swears they do not;"
that she has seen many with seven and nine legs. It is religious
unreasonableness.”
"“Are there many people like that, so credulous?” asked Cæsar."
"“Oh, lots,” replied Lanza; “in the shops you will find amulets, horns,"
"hands made of coral or horseshoes, all to keep away bad luck. My wife"
"and the neighbour women play the lottery, by combining the numbers of"
"their birthdays, and the ages of their fathers, their mothers, and their"
"children. When some relative dies, they make a magic combination of"
"the dates of birth and death, the day and the month, and buy a lottery"
ticket. They never win; and instead of realizing that their systems
"are of no avail, they say that they omitted to count in the number of"
"letters in the name or something of that sort. It is comical, so much"
religion and so much superstition.”
"“But you confuse religion and superstition, my friend,” said Kennedy."
"“It’s all the same,” answered the old man, smiling his suavely ironical"
smile. “There is nothing except Nature.”
"“You do not believe in miracles, Giovanni Battista?” asked the"
Englishman.
"“Yes, I believe in the earth’s miracles, making trees and flowers grow,"
and talking together. They were greatly agitated.
The old woman sniffed and wiped her eyes. The elder daughter was
"packing a few things in a bundle. One of the officers asked: ""What about"
"our coffee?"" but she took no notice. Her sister had gone out in search"
of further information.
"She soon returned. Yes, they would all have to leave at once, but, if"
"they liked to take the risk, they could come back to-morrow with a"
"wagon, if they could get one, and fetch their belongings."
They were comforted. They knew where they would be able to get a wagon.
They would cart their stock and their household property away on the
morrow. They would start another estaminet somewhere. They would suffer
"loss and inconvenience, but they would not be ruined--their valuable"
stock of wines would save them from that.
The bundle was made up and they prepared to leave. We paid our bill and
went out into the street. Numbers of soldiers were straggling past. They
looked wretched and exhausted. Their boots and puttees were caked with
mud. They had neither rifles nor packs. Three men were lying up against
"a garden wall. We asked them for news. They could not tell us much,"
except that the Germans were still advancing.
"""We was at Dickebusch when 'e started slingin' stuff over--gorblimy, 'e"
don't 'alf wallop yer--umpteen of our mates got bleed'n' well biffed. We
"cleared out afore it got too 'ot."""
"Several famished ""battle-stragglers"" had entered our camp in order to"
beg for food. They sat round the cook-house and ate in gloomy silence.
In the adjoining field a number of tents had sprung up. Blue figures

"Of course, I never pay much attention to Sis when she says such dumb"
"things. I'm old enough, I guess, to know that it isn't what _Women_"
like and appreciate that counts when it comes to people getting
"married. If it were, Sis and three hundred other pretty girls like her"
wouldn't be on their way to Venus to hook husbands.
"Still, if I wasn't a passenger, the sign didn't have anything to do"
"with me. I knew what Sis could say to _that_, but at least it was an"
argument I could use if it ever came up. So I broke the law.
"I was glad I did. The stars were exciting enough, but away off to"
"the left, about five times as big as I'd ever seen it, except in the"
"movies, was the Moon, a great blob of gray and white pockmarks holding"
"off the black of space. I was hoping to see the Earth, but I figured it"
must be on the other side of the ship or behind us. I pressed my nose
"against the port and saw the tiny flicker of a spaceliner taking off,"
Marsbound. I wished I was on that one!
"Then I noticed, a little farther down the companionway, a stretch of"
blank wall where there should have been portholes. High up on the
"wall in glowing red letters were the words, ""Lifeboat 47. Passengers:"
"Thirty-two. Crew: Eleven. Unauthorized personnel keep away!"""
Another one of those signs.
*       *       *       *       *
I crept up to the porthole nearest it and could just barely make out
the stern jets where it was plastered against the hull. Then I walked
under the sign and tried to figure the way you were supposed to get
into it. There was a very thin line going around in a big circle that I

"shut in, I was happy; and here, sound and strong, when toward nightfall,"
"I look at the splendid skies, the palaces, the yellow walls that take an"
"extraordinary tone, I feel that I am one of the most miserable men on"
the planet....”
_ONE SUNDAY AFTERNOON_
His lack of tranquillity led Cæsar to make absurd resolutions which he
didn’t carry out.
"One Sunday in the beginning of April, he went out into the street,"
"disposed to take a walk outside of Rome, following the road anywhere it"
"led. A hard, fine rain was falling, the sky was grey, the air mild, the"
"streets were full of puddles, the shops closed; a few flower merchants"
were offering branches of almond in blossom.
Cæsar was very depressed. He went into a church to get out of the rain.
The church was full; there were many people in the centre of it; he
didn’t know what they were doing. Doubtless they were gathered there for
"some reason, although Cæsar didn’t understand what. Cæsar sat down on"
"a bench, worn out; he would have liked to listen to organ music, to a"
boy choir. No ideas occurred to him but sentimental ones. Some time
"passed, and a priest began to preach. Cæsar got up and went into the"
street.
"“I must get rid of these miserable impressions, get back to noble ideas."
I must fight this sentimental leprosy.”

"RINGROSE, BASIL. Buccaneer, pirate, and author."
Sailed in 1679 to the West Indies. A year later Ringrose had joined the
"buccaneers at their rendezvous in the Gulf of Darien, where they were"
preparing for a bold enterprise on the Spanish Main. They landed and
"marched to the town of Santa Maria, which they plundered and burnt."
Thence they travelled in canoes down the river to the Bay of Panama. After
"attacking the Spanish fleet and laying siege to the city, the buccaneers"
"cruised up and down the West Coast of South America for eighteen months,"
sacking towns and attacking Spanish ships. All this while Ringrose kept a
"very full and graphic journal, in which he recorded not only their"
"exploits, but also their hardships and quarrels, and gave descriptions as"
"well of the various natives and their customs, and drew charts and"
sketches.
"In 1681 Ringrose was still with Captain Sharp, and sailed through the"
"Straits of Magellan, and on January 30th of the same year anchored off"
"Antigua. Here he got a passage in a ship to England, landing safely at"
Dartmouth on March 26th.
"A year later he published an account of his voyage, as a second volume to"
"Esquemeling's, ""Bucaniers of America."" In 1684 he went to sea again in the"
"_Cygnet_ (Captain Swan), to traffic with the Spanish colonies. But the"
"Spaniards refused to trade with them. In October, 1684, they met the"
"famous Captain Edward Davis at that favourite haunt of the buccaneers, the"
Isle of Plate. The two captains agreed to join forces and to go together
"""on the account,"" so all the cargo was thrown overboard the _Cygnet_, and"
the ships set out to make war on any Spanish ships they might meet with.
"""Stand aside,"" Peasley ordered, gruffly; but the other held his ground,"
"saying, quietly:"
"""I warn you. I am desperate."""
"""Shall I stop her, sir?"" the quartermaster asked from the shadows of"
the wheel-house.
"""No!"" Emerson commanded, sharply, and in the glow from the"
"binnacle-light they saw he had drawn his revolver, while on the instant"
"up from the void beneath heaved the massive figure of Big George Balt,"
"a behemoth, more colossal and threatening than ever in the dim light."
"Rumbling curses as he came, he leaped up the pilot-house steps,"
"wrenched open the door, and with one sweep of his hairy paw flung the"
"helmsman from his post, panting,"
"""Keep her going, Cap', or I'll run them down!"""
"""We stood by you, old man,"" Emerson urged; ""you stand by us. They can't"
"make you stop. They can't come aboard."""
"The launch was abreast of them now, and skimming along so close that"
one might have tossed a biscuit aboard of her. For an instant Captain
Peasley hesitated; then Emerson saw the ends of his bristly mustache
rise above an expansive grin as he winked portentously. But his voice
was convincingly loud and wrathful as he replied:
"""What do you mean, sir? I'll have my blooming ship libelled for this."""
"""I'll make good your losses,"" Emerson volunteered, quickly, realizing"
that other ears were open.
clover; and that was the reason he had the second sight. He could see
"those who are invisible, but they could not see him."
"And as he was sitting there in the forward cabin, he heard voices"
"within the ship. He peered through a crack, and there were three"
"coal-black crows sitting inside the deck-beams, and they were talking"
"about their husbands. All three were tired of them, and were planning"
"their death. One could see at once that they were witches, who had"
assumed another form.
"""But is it certain that there is no one here who can overhear us?"" said"
one of the crows. And by the way she spoke the cabin-boy knew her for
the captain's wife.
"""No, you can see there's not,"" said the others, the wives of the first"
"and second quartermasters. ""There is not a soul aboard."""
"""Well, then I do not mind saying that I know of a good way to get rid of"
"them,"" said the captain's wife once more, and hopped closer to the two"
"others. ""We will turn ourselves into breakers, wash them into the sea,"
"and sink the ship with every man on board."""
"That pleased the others, and they sat there a long time discussing the"
"day and the fairway. ""But is it certain that no one can overhear us?"""
once more asked the captain's wife.
"""You know that such is the case,"" said the two others."
"""Well, there is a counter-spell for what we wish to do, and if it is"
"used, it will go hard with us, for it will cost us nothing less than our"
"lives!"""
"so, never fear. No power on earth could make me take up the old life"
"again."""
The Girl said nothing in reply; instead she put both her arms around his
"neck and remained a long time in his embrace. At last, summoning up all"
"her fortitude she put him resolutely from her, and whispered:"
"""When you are ready, come. You must leave me now."" And with a curt"
command to the Indian she fled back into the darkness.
For an instant the road agent's eyes followed the direction that she had
"taken; then, his spirits rising at the thought that his escape was now"
"well-nigh assured, he turned and plunged down the ravine."
"As a strong David, at the voice of verity,"
"Great Goliah, the pope, he struck down with his sling,"
Restoring again to a Christian liberty
"His land and people, like a most victorious king;"
To his first beauty intending the Church to bring
From ceremonies dead to the living word of the Lord.
This the second act will plenteously record.
"As put into the mouth of the king himself, these other lines are hard to"
beat for deliberate partisan misrepresentation. The king feels himself
about to die.

"For the office sake that God hath me appointed,"
But now I perceive that sin and wickedness
"In this wretched world, like as Christ prophesied,"
I'm afraid the door of this little paradise might be shut to me after--
"Let's say this is my one hour--the hour that gave me--that kiss I want."""
"""Go long! You go to grass!"" returned the Girl with a nervous little"
laugh.
"Johnson made one more effort and won out; that is, he succeeded, at"
"last, in getting her in his grasp."
"""Listen,"" said the determined lover, pleading for a kiss as he would"
have pleaded for his very life.
"It was at this juncture that Wowkle, silently, stealthily, emerged from"
the cupboard and made her way over to the door. Her feet were heavily
moccasined and she was blanketed in a stout blanket of gay colouring.
"""Ugh--some snow!"" she muttered, as a gust of wind beat against her face"
"and drove great snow-flakes into the room, fairly taking her breath"
"away. But her words fell on deaf ears. For, oblivious to the storm that"
"was now raging outside, the youthful pair of lovers continued to"
concentrate their thoughts upon the storm that was raging within their
"own breasts, the Girl keeping up the struggle with herself, while the"
man urged her on as only he knew how.
"""Why, if I let you take one you'd take two,"" denied the Girl,"
"half-yielding by her very words, if she but knew it."
"""No, I wouldn't--I swear I wouldn't,"" promised the man with great"
earnestness.
"""Ugh--very bad!"" was the Indian woman's muffled ejaculation as she"
peered out into the night. But she had promised her lover to come to him
"Rollo was about to speak, but the Sergeant whispered that the old lady"
"was now in such good case to admit them, that she might be frighted by"
his foreign accent.
In a few moments the woman could be heard stiffly and grumblingly
"descending the stairs, the door was opened, and Rebeca appeared with the"
key in her hand.
"""How many are there of your party?"" she asked, her poor hand shaking so"
"that she could scarcely fit the key in the lock, and her voice sunk to a"
quavering whisper.
"""There are five men of us and two women,"" said the Sergeant, quickly."
"""Now we are all within, pray give me the key and show us the road to the"
"Queen's apartments."""
"""Two women!"" grumbled the poor old creature, whose mind appeared to be"
"somewhat unhinged; ""that will never suit her Royal Highness the Regent,"
"especially if they are young and well-looking. She loves not such, any"
"more than I love the hussy of the pork-shop. Though, indeed, my man hath"
"not the roving eye in his head as her Señor Muñoz hath. Ah, the saints"
have mercy on all poor deserted women! But what am I saying? If the
"Lady Cristina heard me speak ill of him, she would set my poor old neck"
"in the garrote. Then--crack--all would be over!"""
"The party now advanced towards the palace, which in the gloom of a"
"starless night was still entirely hidden from their sight, save as a"
darker mass set square against the black vault of heaven.
By this time Concha and La Giralda had taken the trembling portress by
"the arms, and were bringing her along in the van, whispering comfort in"
the fact that at one time I thought this passage beautiful. But the beat
of the blank verse carried me on. Sometimes it seemed to blend with the
buzzing of those angry wasps above and sometimes the two rhythms would
"vie with each other for speed, so that they hurried along each"
alternately ahead of the other. I came to a line where my memory failed
"me. I faltered for a moment, but the droning sound seemed to grow into"
"an enormous roar, and I leapt back to the beginning:"
"""He above the rest...."""
and then on and on a second time until my head throbbed with the double
pulsation.
Suddenly a man who had been lying on the far side of the marquee got up
and said:
"""I've had enough of this, I'm going to sleep in a ditch."""
"He went off. The wasps were still buzzing, but the interruption had"
broken the spell. I felt a sense of relief. I became conscious of
intense weariness and felt ashamed of my fears. I cursed the German
"aeroplanes and thought, ""Let them do their worst, I don't care."" I made"
up my mind to go to sleep and resolutely buried my face in my pillow.
Then it occurred to me that I would never be able to enjoy _Paradise
"Lost_ again, and I was half-amused and agreeably distracted by the"
trivial thought.
But the wasps were still buzzing. Another man began to groan loudly:
"""Gawd--this is bloody awful--why the bloody 'ell can't they leave us"
"alone!"""

CHAPTER II
THE MYSTERIOUS MONSIEUR
"Ten days later Tommy and I--and Bilkins, whom I had begged of my father"
"at the eleventh hour--stepped off the train at Miami, stretched our arms"
"and breathed deep breaths of balmy air. Gates, his ruddy face an augury"
"of good cheer, was there to meet us, and as he started off well laden"
"with a portion of our bags, Tommy whispered:"
"""Reminds me of the old chap in that picture 'The Fisherman's Daughter'!"""
"wood-louse!  You nose out every evil thing.  Yes, the face of that"
young swindler shows that he has got what he wanted...  I wonder how
much Egorka has got out of them.  He has evidently taken something...
He is just the same sort of rogue that they are ... they are all tarred
"with the same brush.  He has got some money, and I'm damned if I did"
not arrange the whole thing for him!  It is best to own my folly...
"Yes, life is against us all, brothers ... and even when you spit upon"
"those nearest to you, the spittle rebounds and hits your own face."""
"Having satisfied himself with this reflection, the worthy Captain"
"looked round upon his staff.  Every one of them was disappointed,"
because they all knew that something they did not expect had taken
"place between Petunikoff and Vaviloff, and they all felt that they had"
been insulted.  The feeling that one is unable to injure anyone is
"worse than the feeling that one is unable to do good, because to do"
harm is far easier and simpler.
"""Well, why are we loitering here?  We have nothing more to wait for ..."
"except the reward that I shall get out--out of Egorka,..."" said the"
"Captain, looking angrily at the eating-house. ""So our peaceful life"
under the roof of Judas has come to an end. Judas will now turn us
"out....  So do not say that I have not warned you."""
Kanets smiled sadly.
"""What are you laughing at, jailer?"" Kuvalda asked."
"""Where shall I go then?"""
"""That, my soul, is a question that fate will settle for you, so do not"
"worry,"" said the Captain, thoughtfully, entering the dosshouse.  ""The"
"creatures that once were men"" followed him."
"""Uncanonical!"" roared the Abbot. ""I scorn the charge! I"
"scorn it with my heels! Two masses daily,--morning and"
"evening--Primes,--Nones,--Vespers,--Aves,--Credos,--Paters--"""
"""Excepting on moonlight nights,"" the duke blinked."
"""Exceptis excipiendis,"" replied the Abbot."
"""Sheer heresy!"" roared the duke. ""The devil is apt to keep an eye on"
"such exceptions. Does he not go about like a roaring lion?"""
"""Let him roar!"" shouted the Abbot, bringing his fist down upon the"
"table, and looking about in canonical ire, when the door opened"
noiselessly and in its dark frame stood Francesco.
He had waited at the camp for the return of the duke until his misery
"and restlessness had mastered every other sensation. Sleep, he felt,"
"would not come to his eyes, and he craved for action. He should have"
"liked nothing better than to mount his steed on the spot, ride"
single-handed into Anjou's camp and redeem his honor in the eyes of
those who regarded him a bought instrument of the Church. The memory
of Ilaria wailed through the dark chambers of his heart. He felt at
"this moment, more than ever, what she had been to him, and to himself"
"he appeared as a derelict, tossed on a vast and shoreless sea."
"For a moment he gazed as one spellbound at the drinkers, then he"
strode up to the duke and shook him soundly.
"""To the rescue, my lord duke!"" he shouted, in the excess of his"
"frenzy, till the vaults re-echoed his cry from their farthest"
"recesses. ""Conradino has been betrayed by the Frangipani!"""
"The Girl felt the colour leave her cheeks, though she made a gesture for"
him to proceed.
"""Pedro not 'ere any longer,"" smiled the Mexican. ""Me senda 'im to the"
"devil. Serva 'im right."""
"""An' the woman?"" gasped the Girl."
"""She gone--got away--Monterey by this time,"" replied Castro with evident"
"disappointment. ""But Meester Ashby 'e know too much--'ees men everywhere"
"searched the camp--no safa 'ere now. To-norrow--"" Castro stopped short;"
the next instant with a joyful gleam in his eyes he cried out:
"""_Maestro_!"""
"""Castro's right, Girl,"" said Johnson, who had waked and heard the"
"Mexican's last words; ""it is not safe a moment more here, and I must"
"go."""
With a little cry of loving protest the Girl abruptly left the men to
"talk over the situation and sought the opposite side of the room. There,"
her eyes half-closed and her lips pressed tightly together she gave
herself up to her distressing fears. After a while it was made plain to
"her that she was being brought into the conversation, for every now and"
"then Castro would look curiously at her; at length, as if it had been"
"determined by them that nothing should be undertaken without her advice,"
"Johnson, followed by his subordinate, came over to her and related in"
detail all the startling information that Castro had brought.
"Quietly the Girl listened and, in the end, it was agreed between them"
"that it would be safer for the men not to leave the cabin together, but"
that Castro should go at once with the understanding that he should
procure horses and wait for the master at a given point across the
9. English Hymnody.
"The youthful, courageous Isaac Watts, 1674-1748, an ardent dissenter,"
pioneered the movement which resulted in a flood of hymns and hymnbooks
in the English churches. Watts was not satisfied with the psalm singing
"of his time, which by now had become formal and lifeless. Parts of the"
"psalter, he pointed out, were obviously not written in the spirit of the"
"Gospel. “By keeping too close to David,” he wrote in one of his"
"Prefaces, “the vail of Moses is thrown over our hearts.” Watts removed"
"that “vail,” Christianizing the psalms and composing during his lifetime"
"more than 600 original hymns, expressing in the language of the time,"
"the thoughts of the worshippers. Through his influence, his age, the"
"18th century, became the first age of hymn singing in England."
"John and Charles Wesley, following Watts, made enormous use of hymn"
"singing in their evangelistic work, giving the movement for"
congregational singing a powerful impetus. Charles is said to have
"composed over 6,000 hymns."
"From the Wesleys onward through the 19th century, the hymn writers in"
England became numerous. The restrictive shackles of psalm singing had
been broken and the creative urge to worship in new forms resulted in a
vast number of original religious lyrics and the publication of hundreds
of hymnbooks. The development can be summarized here only in outline
form.

CHAPTER VI
RETRIBUTION
Beneath the dark cornices of a thicket of wind-stunted pines stood a
"small company of men, looking out into the hastening night. The"
"half-light of evening lay over the scene, rolling wood and valley into"
"a misty mass, while the horizon stood curbed by a belt of heavy"
"thunder-clouds. In the western vault, a vast rent in the wall of gray"
shot out a blaze of translucent gold that slanted like a spear shaft
to a sullen sea.
The walls of Astura shone white and ghostly athwart the plains.
Sea-gulls came screaming to the cliffs. Presently out of the blue
"bosom of an unearthly twilight a vague wind arose. Gusts came,"
"clamored, and died into nothingness. The world seemed to shudder. A"
red sword flashed sudden out of the skies and smote the hills. Thunder
"followed, growling over the world. The lurid crater of Vesuvius poured"
"gold upon the sea, whose hoarse underchant mingled with the fitful"
wind.
A storm came creeping black out of the west. The sea grew dark. The
forests began to weave the twilight into their columned halls. A
sudden gust came clamoring through the woods. The myriad boughs tossed
"and jerked against the sky, while a mysterious gloom of trees rolled"
back against the oncoming night.
"The men upon the hill strained their eyes towards the sea, where the"
CHAPTER V
BAFFLED
"When at last I arrived at Cary's flat it was very late, and I was"
exceedingly tired and out of temper. A squadron of Zeppelins had been
"reported from the sea, the air-defence control at Newcastle had sent"
"out the preliminary warning ""F.M.W.,"" and the speed of my train had"
been reduced to about fifteen miles an hour. I had expected to get in
"to dinner, but it was eleven o'clock before I reached my destination."
"I had not even the satisfaction of seeing a raid, for the Zepps, made"
"cautious by recent heavy losses, had turned back before crossing the"
"line of the coast. Cary and his wife fell upon my neck, for we were"
"old friends, condoled with me, fed me, and prescribed a tall glass of"
mulled port flavoured with cloves. My stern views upon the need for
Prohibition in time of war became lamentably weakened.
"By midnight I had recovered my philosophic outlook upon life, and Cary"
began to enlighten me upon the details of the grave problem which had
brought me eagerly curious to his city.
"""I expect that Dawson will drop in some time to-night,"" he said. ""All"
"hours are the same to him. I told him that you were on the way, and he"
"wants to give you the latest news himself. He is dead set upon you,"
"Copplestone. I can't imagine why."""
"""Am I then so very unattractive?"" I inquired drily. ""It seems to me"
"that Dawson is a man of sound judgment."""
"""I confess that I do not understand why he lavishes so much attention"
There was nothing more to be done till day-break. They had played their
"last card, and now they must wait to see what cards were out against"
"them, and who should win the final trick at the hour of sunrise."
"Rollo fell asleep again. And so soundly this time, that he only woke to"
consciousness when a soldier in a white _boina_ pulled roughly at his
"elbow, and ordered him to get up."
"All about the granary the Carlists were stamping feet, pulling on boots,"
and flapping arms.
"""It's a cold morning to be shot in,"" said the man, with rough"
"kindliness; ""but I will get you some hot chocolate in a moment. That"
"will warm your blood for you, and in any case you will have a quick"
passage. I will pick you a firing party of the best shots in the three
"provinces. The general will be here in a quarter of an hour, and the sun"
will rise in another quarter. One is just as punctual as the other. A
"cigarette?--thank you. Well, you are a cool hand! I'm off to see about"
"the chocolate!"""
"And Rollo Blair, with a slight singing in his ears, and a chill"
"emptiness about the pit of his stomach, stood on his feet critically"
rolling a cigarette in a leaf of Etienne's Alcoy paper.
"John Mortimer said nothing, but looked after the man who had gone for"
the chocolate.
"""I wish it had been coffee,"" he said; ""chocolate is always bad for my"
"digestion!"""
Then he smiled a little grimly. His sufferings from indigestion produced
by indulgence in this particular chocolate would in all probability not
Now Aunt Achsa hesitated. One tear separated itself from its fellows
and rolled down her withered cheek and dropped upon her withered hand.
"She looked at it, startled, then lifted her hand and dashed it across"
her eyes.
"""I swum, I'm cryin'. Don't know as I know when I've cried before. And"
"cryin' before I have anything as I can see to cry for. But Sidney, I"
set such a lot on that boy--it's like I was his mother and his father
"and his brothers and his sisters all mixed up in one--gran'ma, too. He"
"was such a little mite when I took him, y'see and then he's not like"
other boys and I've had to do a heap of lovin' to make up to him. I've
prayed every day of my life for the Lord to keep him happy in spite of
things and that was a pretty big prayer for I don't suppose the Lord
"wants us all to be happy all the time, that ain't His way of bringing"
"us up. But I thought He might make an exception for Lav. Land sakes,"
"how I go on--and you nigh to cryin' yourself."" For she had caught"
Sidney blinking back something glistening from her own eyes.
"""Aunt Achsa, Lavender is wonderful. He's talked to me a lot and he's"
"going to be a great man some day, I know. He has the grandest plans"
"shut away in his heart and he _is_ happy--"""
"Aunt Achsa looked at her, startled. ""Plans--how _can_ he when he's--"""
She bit off the words. Her lips trembled.
"""Aunt Achsa, it doesn't matter what one's like on the outside!"" Now"
Sidney floundered for the second time in one day under the pressure of
"her own thoughts. ""I mean--Lav can do anything he wants to do, anyway."
"And he's working hard reading and studying and some day, after awhile,"
"he'll go away somewhere and study more--"""
pillowed on her arm. Her hair spread as in a dusky halo beneath it.
Her bosom moved with the rhythmic calm of dreamless sleep. Her lips
were parted in a smile. One hand was hid in the dark folds of her
robe.
"Francesco knelt with upturned face, his eyes shut to the sky. He"
seemed like one faint with pain; his lips moved as in prayer. A
hundred inarticulate pleadings surged heavenward from his heart.
Again he bent over her and watched the pure girlish face as she slept.
A strange calm fell for a time upon him; his eyes never wavered from
the white arm and the glimmering hair. Vast awe held him in thrall. He
"was as one who broods tearless and amazed over the dead, calm face of"
one beloved above all on earth.
"Hours passed and Francesco found no sustenance, save in prayer. The"
unuttered yearnings of a world seemed molten in his soul. The moon
waned. The stars grew dim. Strange sounds stirred in the forest-deeps;
the mysterious breathing of a thousand trees. Life ebbed and flowed
with the sigh of a moon-stupored sea. Visions blazed in the night-sky
and faded away.
Hours passed. Neither sleeper nor watcher stirred. The night grew
faint. The water flickered in the mere. The very stars seemed to gaze
upon the destinies of two wearied souls.
Far and faint came the quaver of a bird's note. Gray and mysterious
stood the forest spires. Light! Light at last! Spears of amber darting
in the east. A shudder seemed to shake the universe. The great vault
kindled. The sky grew luminous with gold.
It was the dawn.
"Stellamaris. You see, John, it all comes to the same thing. Whether you"
"call her Ariel, or Syrinx, or a Sprite of the Sea, or a Wunderkind whose"
original trail of glory-cloud has not faded into the light of common
"day, she belongs to the Other People. You must believe in the Other"
"People, Julia; you can't help it.”"
"Lady Blount turned to him severely. Despite her affection for him,"
"she more than suspected him of a pagan pantheism, which she termed"
atheistical. His talk about belief in spirits and hobgoblins irritated
"her. She kept a limited intelligence together by means of formulas, as"
she kept her scanty reddish-gray hair together by means of a rigid false
front.
"“I believe in God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost,” she"
"said, with an air of cutting reproof."
"Sir Oliver pushed his plate from him, but not the fraction of a"
millimetre beyond that caused by the impatient push sanctioned by good
manners.
"“Don't be a fool, Julia!”"
“I don't see how a Christian woman declaring the elements of her faith
"can be a fool,” said Lady Blount, drawing herself up."
"“There are times and seasons for everything,” said Sir Oliver. “If you"
"were having a political argument, and any one asked you whether you"
"believed in tariff reform, and you glared at him and said, I believe in"
"Pontius Pilate,' you'd be professing Christianity, but showing yourself"
an idiot.”
"“But I don't believe in Pontius Pilate,” retorted Lady Blount."
"of the populous city, and its smoky shadow slowly followed it. The"
lights of the lamps paled in the dawn; the stars went out; and out of
the daffodil east the day came up--and there was light in the world.
"Before the day was well begun, Noll went home."
*       *       *       *       *
"In the still grey dawn, in dripping drizzle, Gavroche the anarchist"
slouched forth from prison-cell to his harsh doom.
He was dejected.
"He missed the band, the public eye, the shouts of the comrades."
"What, Gavroche! this is thy dramatic moment--thou hast the stage all to"
thy sole swaggering self--and though thou roused at daybreak from thy
broodings to lilt a braggart song with all thy best intent to play the
"reckless swashbuckler, the florid eager pressman can only report that"
thou didst sing “somewhat palsily.”
"Tush, man! Is it thus thou goest to thy end? Hath thy desire to be"
Ruthless Overman brought only this about--that thou art to become no
"better than manure? Where is now thy dream of Ruthless Overman? Nay,"
"what avails at all now thy Overmanhood, Gavroche? does not thy neck"
feel rather with unpleasant shiver of discomfort the overlordship
"of the Commonweal? The aristocrat despised it yesterday, and thou"
"to-day. Hast thou, even thus late, a glimmering that thy vaunted"
"Ruthless Brutality is to be snipped by the might of this Commonweal,"
thy unspeakable windpipe slit at a stroke of the ordered shear that
falls on the bidding of that overwhelming force which is the public
"profession.""--Ibid."
Appendix Q.
"1. ""The five writers to whose genius we owe the first attempt at"
"comprehensive views of history were Bolingbroke, Montesquieu, Voltaire,"
"Hume, and Gibbon. Of these the second was but a cold believer in"
"Christianity, if, indeed, he believed in it at all; and the other four"
"were avowed and notorious infidels.""--Buckle."
"2 ""Here, then, we have the starting-point of progress--_scepticism_...."
"All, therefore, that men want is _no hindrance_ from their political and"
religious rulers.... Until common minds doubt respecting religion they
can never receive any new scientific conclusion at variance with it--as
"Joshua and Copernicus.""--Ibid."
"3. ""The immortal work of Gibbon, of which the sagacity is, if possible,"
"equal to the learning, did find readers, but the illustrious author"
"was so cruelly reviled by men who called themselves Christians, that"
"it seemed doubtful if, after such an example, subsequent writers would"
hazard their comfort and happiness by attempting to write philosophic
history. Middleton wrote in 1750.... As long as the theological spirit
"was alive nothing could be effected.""--Ibid."
"4. ""The questions which presented themselves to the acuter minds of a"
hundred years ago were present to the acuter minds who lived hundreds
of years before that.... But the Church had known how to deal with

"Bruno and Vanini in the seventeenth. They were isolated, and for the"
A MISTAKEN IDEA
'Yet Australia has been talking freely enough about the Japanese
menace.'
'I know. It is quite a mistaken idea of the Australians that if Japan
triumphs in the present war she would be a menace to Australia. They say
that if we win we shall be masters of the East and the paramount power
"in Eastern waters. What, they ask, is to become of Australia, if we take"
it into our heads to make a descent upon their shores?'
"Baron Suyematsu again laughed boisterously, as one who can afford to"
make merry at an extravagant idea.
"'The whole thing is so utterly preposterous,' he went on, 'that it"
would not be worth considering were it not typical of what is being said
all over Europe. Our fight for national existence against Russia has
been misconstrued everywhere. We seem to have filled the Western world
"with all sorts of vague fears, France is saying that we shall soon"
deprive her of Indo-China. Germany declares we have designs on
Kiao-chau. The Dutch say that Java is no longer safe from our
"machinations. Never was such nonsense talked of a country which, after"
"all, is but fighting to preserve its national existence.'"
'And you say Japan has no intention of arming the Asiatics against the
Europeans?'
'The whole idea is absurd. Japan wishes to become one with the European
nations. I might even say she aspires to become a member of the European
family. It is a mistake to think that Japan is going to form a
Pan-Asiatic Association. Japan is the only country in the East that can
rise on European lines. Her example could not be followed by other
Thereupon his neighbour tried to create an impression by appearing calm
"and philosophical. He said in a strained, breaking voice:"
"""Think of all the waste in life and treasure this frightful war"
involves. Think of the moral degradation. Think of the widows and
"orphans. Think of the...."" He was unequal to the effort and his voice"
trailed away and then seemed to catch in his throat. But he recovered
"and with a kind of gasp he squeezed out a few more words: ""Bill, forgive"
"me for insulting you to-day--I didn't mean it, Bill. Forget it, Bill,"
"forget it! If you get killed without forgiving me, my conscience will"
"always torture...."""
"""For Christ's sake shut up, yer bleed'n' 'ypocrite,"" interrupted the"
"gruff voice of ""Bill"" somewhere out of the darkness. ""Yer always"
bleed'n' well preachin'--it's bad enough 'avin' Fritz over us without
"you bloody well rubbin' it in. If yer don't shut yer mouth, I'll come"
"over an' shut it for yer, 'struth I will."""
"The philosopher said no more, but another voice made itself heard, that"
"of a good-natured, elderly bachelor, who said with melancholy"
resignation:
"""It's jolly hard, all the same, to be knocked out like this. You're so"
"helpless--no dug-outs, no shelters anywhere...."""
"""It's doubly hard when you're married,"" said another. ""I haven't got the"
"wind up about myself at all, but I can't help thinking about my wife...."
"They're going away now, thank the Lord. You never know when they won't"
"be coming back though--that's just the worst of it."""
The noise of the propellers was indeed dying away.
may be stated that love is but one of the bodily passions that dies with
"it; however, even in some of the stories themselves, this explanation is"
used to clear certain difficulties; however opposed eternal love may be
"to one of the central doctrines of Buddhism, it seems to me that the"
very essence of this story is the belief that love does not die with the
"body, that it lives for ever and ever, through incarnation after"
incarnation. Such a story is the very cry of the agony of humanity.
"'Love is strong as death; many waters cannot quench love;' ay, and love"
"is stronger than death. Not any dogmas of any religion, not any"
"philosophy, nothing in this world, nothing in the next, shall prevent"
him who loves from the certainty of rejoining some time the soul he
loves.

CHAPTER XXIV
THE FOREST OF TIME
'The gate of that forest was Death.'
There was a great forest. It was full of giant trees that grew so high
and were so thick overhead that the sunshine could not get down below.
"And there were huge creepers that ran from tree to tree climbing there,"
"“If you can explain,” he began rather stiffly, “why you—”"
"“Dear,” she interrupted, “listen. It was an hour’s pain and trial to"
you. I did it for her—I mean the girl who spoke to me on the coach. I
"was so happy, Jim—so happy with you that I didn’t dare to refuse that"
"happiness to another. Jim, they were married only this morning—those"
two; and I wanted him to get away. While they were struggling with you
I saw him slip from behind his tree and hurry across the park. That’s
"all of it, dear—I had to do it.”"
Thus does one sister of the plain gold band know another who stands in
the enchanted light that shines but once and briefly for each one. By
rice and satin bows does mere man become aware of weddings. But bride
knoweth bride at the glance of an eye. And between them swiftly passes
comfort and meaning in a language that man and widows wot not of.
THE ROMANCE OF A BUSY BROKER
"Pitcher, confidential clerk in the office of Harvey Maxwell, broker,"
allowed a look of mild interest and surprise to visit his usually
expressionless countenance when his employer briskly entered at half
past nine in company with his young lady stenographer. With a snappy
"“Good-morning, Pitcher,” Maxwell dashed at his desk as though he were"
"intending to leap over it, and then plunged into the great heap of"
letters and telegrams waiting there for him.
The young lady had been Maxwell’s stenographer for a year. She was
beautiful in a way that was decidedly unstenographic. She forewent the
the Austrian Navy. My next two years were spent afloat. Although I did
"not know it, I had already been marked out by my superiors for the"
"Secret Service. My perfect acquaintance with English, my education at"
"Blundell's, my knowledge of your thoughts and your queer ways, and"
"twists of mind, had equipped me conspicuously for Secret Service work"
in your midst.
"As a youth of twenty, in the first flush of manhood, I was seconded"
"for service here, and I returned to England. That was five years ago."
*       *       *       *       *
"[I paused, for my throat was dry, and looked up. Cary was leaning"
forward intent upon every word. Dawson's face was still turned away;
he had not moved. It seemed to me that to our party of three had been
"added a fourth, the spirit of Trehayne, and that he anxiously waited"
there yonder in the shadows for the deliverance of our judgment. Had
"he, an English public school boy, played the game according to the"
immemorial English rules? I went on.]

It was extraordinarily easy for me to obtain employment in the heart
of your naval mysteries. Few questions were asked; you admitted me as
one of yourselves. I took the broad open path of full acceptance of
your conditions. I first obtained employment in a marine engineering
"shop at Southampton, joined a trade union, attended Socialist"
"meetings--I, a member of one of the oldest families in Trieste. Though"
"a Catholic, I bent my knee in the English Church, and this was not"
"difficult, for I had always attended service in the chapel at"
"Blundell's. To you, my friend, I can say this, for you are of some"
strange sect which consigns to the lowest Hell both Catholics and
"""No, thanks. I'm going to do something lots more exciting than sitting"
"_there_! And I'm in a hurry, too."" And with that Mart swung on past"
"them, her head high."
"Sidney had a moment's longing to run after her and coax her to come,"
"but Pola's light giggle checked her. ""Isn't she a riot? I'd have _died_"
"if she'd come with us!"""
"""Oh, Pola--she'll hear you!"" pleaded Sidney."
She hated herself because she did not tell Pola at once how bravely
"Mart shouldered her responsibilities, about gran'ma, who looked to Mart"
for everything. Instead she simply walked along with Pola and let Pola
"giggle. Pola, sensing Sidney's feelings, slipped her arm through hers"
and gave it an affectionate little squeeze.
"""You're such a funny child,"" she said softly. ""You'd be nice to"
"anything. I can't, of course, for I go around to so many places and"
"mother's warned me often about strangers. Anyway, it's lots nicer for"
"just us two to be together, isn't it?"""
But in spite of Pola's soft flattery and countless lumps of sugar the
"tea tasted bitter to Sidney and the Green Lantern, with its futurist"
"awnings, its bizarre hangings and cushions, had no allure. The thought"
came suddenly to Sidney that it had been a whole week since she had
even seen Mart; in that time she had scarcely exchanged more than a
half dozen words with Lavender.
To the tune of Pola's ceaseless chatter Sidney's thoughts kept darting
back to that uncomfortable fact. Pola always talked of things she had
"done at home, abroad, at school, of her boy friends whom she called"
"""men."" She liked to hint of countless ""affairs"" which simply must not"
"afterthought, ""that I promised to take for a run in your car, if--"""
"""You'll have time enough after lunch,"" Slyne suggested, and drew the"
noble marquis toward the window.
"""The Marquis of Ingoldsby!"" muttered Captain Dove. ""A run in Slyne's"
"car! And--_Lady Josceline Justice!_"" He dug his knuckles forcibly into"
"his blinking eyes, and, ""I seem to be wide enough awake,"" said he in a"
stage aside as several waiters arrived on the scene.
While they were setting the table Sallie tried to collect her thoughts.
"Slyne had told her nothing till then, but that he had found out who her"
"folk were. And she had come away from the _Olive Branch_ blindly, only a"
little less distrustful of him than of Captain Dove's cruel intentions
"toward her if she had remained on board. Even now, she scarcely dared to"
believe--
In response to a sign from Slyne she took her place at the flower-decked
table. The Marquis of Ingoldsby immediately settled himself at her side;
"he also was obviously a young man who knew what he wanted, and meant to"
"have that at all hazards and, while the others were seating themselves,"
he ogled her killingly.
"Slyne had sat down at her other hand, leaving Mr. Jobling and Captain"
Dove to keep one another company behind the great silver centre-piece
"which adorned the circular table. The marquis, leaning on one elbow, had"
"turned his back on Mr. Jobling, and Slyne turned his on Captain Dove."
"""This is a little bit of all right!"" his lordship remarked to Sallie,"
"with a confidential grin. ""Only--I wish--How is it that we haven't met"
"before, Lady Josephine? But never mind that. Let's be pals now. Shall"
"we, eh?"""
cheek glared at the duke from under his upreared arm. So close were
they that blood spattered in the duke's face as the Frangipani blew
the red stream from his mouth and beard.
"[Illustration: ""'They lied,' he cried. 'Give me but life.'""]"
"The duke broke away, wheeled and came again. He lashed home, split the"
Frangipani's collar-bone even through the rags of his hauberk. The
"Frangipani yelped like a gored hound. Rabid, dazed, he began to make"
blind rushes that boded ill for him. The swords began to leap and to
"sing, while blinding flashes of lightning followed each other in quick"
succession and thunder rolled in deafening echoes through the heavens.
"Cut and counter-cut rang through the night, like the cry of axes,"
whirled by woodmen's hands.
Suddenly the Frangipani parried an upper cut and stabbed at the duke.
The sword point missed him a hair's breadth. Before he could guard the
"duke was upon him like a leopard. Both men smote together, both swords"
met with a sound that seemed to shake the rocks. The Frangipani's
blade snapped at the hilt.
"He stood still for a moment as one dazed, then plucked out his poniard"
"and made a spring. A merciless down cut beat him back. His courage,"
"his assurance seemed to ebb from him on a sudden, as though the blow"
"had broken his soul. He fell on his knees and held up his hands, with"
"a thick, choking cry."
"""Mercy! God's mercy!"""
"""Curse you! Had you pity on your victims?"""
Thunder crashed overhead; the girdles of the sky were loosed. A
"heat of the water, the pungent smell of the mustard, and that droning hum"
slowly soothed and drowsed away the vehemence of feeling.  She looked at
"her body, silver-white in the yellowish water, with a dreamy sensation."
"Some day she, too, would love! Strange feeling she had never had before!"
"Strange, indeed, that it should come at such a moment, breaking through"
the old instinctive shrinking.  Yes; some day love would come to her.
"There floated before her brain the adoring look on Daphne Wing's face,"
"the shiver that had passed along her arm, and pitifulness crept into her"
"heart--a half-bitter, half-admiring pitifulness.  Why should she"
"grudge--she who did not love?  The sounds, like the humming of large"
"flies, grew deeper, more vibrating.  It was the cook, in her passion"
"swelling out her music on the phrase,"
"""Be it ne-e-ver so humble,"
"There's no-o place like home!"""

"That night, Gyp slept peacefully, as though nothing had happened, as"
though there were no future at all before her.  She woke into misery.
"Her pride would never let her show the world what she had discovered,"
would force her to keep an unmoved face and live an unmoved life.  But
the struggle between mother-instinct and revolt was still going on within
"her.  She was really afraid to see her baby, and she sent word to Betty"
that she thought it would be safer if she kept quite quiet till the
afternoon.
She got up at noon and stole downstairs.  She had not realized how
violent was her struggle over HIS child till she was passing the door of
"Rollo bowed, but did not reply, awaiting the general's pleasure."
"Presently Cabrera, recollecting the sealed letter in his hand, gave it"
unopened to the youth.
"""There,"" he said, ""that, I see, is to be opened in the camp of General"
"Cabrera. Well--where Cabrera is, there is his camp. Open it, and let us"
"see what it contains."""
"""I will, general,"" said the young Scot, ""in so far, that is, as it"
"concerns your Excellency."""
The Carlist general sat watching Rollo keenly as he broke the seal and
discovered a couple of enclosures. One was sealed and the other open.
"The first he presented to Cabrera, who, observing the handwriting of the"
"superscription, changed colour. Meanwhile, without paying any attention"
"to him, Rollo read his own communication from beginning to end. It had"
"evidently been passed on to him from a higher authority than the Abbot,"
for only the address was in the handwriting of that learned ecclesiast.
It ran as follows:
"""To the Man who shall be chosen by our trusted Councillor for"
the Mission Extraordinary in the service of Carlos
Quinto--These:
"""You will receive from General Cabrera such succour and"
assistance as may seem to you needful in pursuance of the
"project you have in hand, namely the capturing of the young"
"Princess Isabel together with her mother, the so-called Regent"
Cristina. Thereafter you will bring them with diligence within
"our lines, observing all the respect and courtesy due to their"
exalted rank and to the sex to which they belong.
"“They’re mighty good guns,” he said hesitatingly. “Seems a shame to"
throw ’em away like this.”
Bainbridge returned briefly: “I’m simply pulling the stings of this

"He watched his man fling the weapons, one after another, into the"
"stream, and then, sending the automatic splashing after the others, he"
turned suddenly back to the six humiliated individuals before him.
"“Go!” he commanded, with a momentary flare of passion. “Beat it, and"
don’t let me set eyes on you again--understand? I won’t be so easy on
"you the next time. Here, take that scum with you. He’s only stunned.”"
"He waited, staring from under lowered lids, until the gang had"
"disappeared in the bushes, half dragging, half carrying their stunned"
"leader with them. Then, with a long sigh, he turned slowly and smiled at"
Peters.
"“All right, Jack,” he said quietly. “I don’t think we’ll have any more"
trouble here. Just hustle all you can to make up for this delay.”
"Peters grinned, and snapped out some orders to the men which sent them"
flying along the bank and even out on the stream over the tumbling logs.
"But as they went they cast glances of open, unadulterated admiration at"
"the young man coolly brushing a bit of mud from one shoulder, and their"
comments to each other left no trace of doubt of their thorough approval
of everything he had said and done.
"Bob heard some of them, and when the men had gone on he smiled a bit. To"
get that drive down successfully he knew he must have the men with him.
"""Splendid!"" cry the people, approving the orator's deduction, and Tyapa"
"bellows all the time, scratching his breast.  He always bellows like"
"this as he drinks his first glass of vodki, when he has a drunken"
headache.  The Captain beams with joy.  They next read the
"correspondence.  This is, for the Captain, ""an abundance of drinks,"" as"
he himself calls it.  He always notices how the merchants make this
"life abominable, and how cleverly they spoil everything.  His speeches"
thunder at and annihilate merchants. His audience listens to him with
"the greatest pleasure, because he swears atrociously.  ""If I wrote for"
"the papers,"" he shouts, ""I would show up the merchant in his true"
"colours ...  I would show that he is a beast, playing for a time the"
"role of a man. I understand him!  He is a rough boor, does not know the"
"meaning of the words 'good taste,' has no notion of patriotism, and his"
"knowledge is not worth five kopecks."""
"Abyedok, knowing the Captain's weak point, and fond of making other"
"people angry, cunningly adds:"
"""Yes, since the nobility began to make acquaintance with hunger, men"
"have disappeared from the world ..."""
"""You are right, you son of a spider and a toad.  Yes, from the time"
"that the noblemen fell, there have been no men.  There are only"
"merchants, and I hate them."""
"""That is easy to understand, brother, because you, too, have been"
"brought down by them ..."""
"""I?  I was ruined by love of life ...  Fool that I was, I loved life,"
"but the merchant spoils it, and I cannot bear it, simply for this"
"reason, and not because I am a nobleman. But if you want to know the"
“Cardinal Spada is a very intelligent man and a very amiable one. At
"heart he is a Liberal and fond of the French. As to the Abbé Tardieu, he"
is a very influential priest at the church of San Luigi.”
After lunch they went direct to a solitary street in the old part of
"Rome. At the door of the big, sad palace where Cardinal Spada lived, a"
"porter with a cocked hat, a grey greatcoat, and a staff with a silver"
"knob, was watching the few passers-by."
"They went in by the broad entry-way, as far as a dark colonnaded court,"
paved with big flags which had grass between them.
In the middle of the court a fountain shot up a little way and fell into
a stone basin covered with moss.
Kennedy and Cæsar mounted the wide monumental stairway; on the first
floor a handsome glassed-in gallery ran around the court. The whole
house had an air of solemnity and sadness. They entered the Cardinal’s
"office, which was a large, sad, severe room."
"Monsignor Spada was a vigorous man, despite his age. He looked frank"
"and intelligent, but one guessed that there was a hidden bitterness and"
desolation in him. He wore a black cassock with red edges and buttons.
"Kennedy went close and was about to kneel to the Cardinal, but he"
prevented him.
Cæsar explained his ideas to the Cardinal with modesty. He felt that
this man was worthy of all his respect.
"Monsignor Spada listened attentively, and then said that he understood"
"nothing about financial matters, but that on principle he was in favour"
"rowing. A little later I got up and looked again--oh, yes, they were"
getting on. I took up my post by the window. It was really quite
interesting to watch the boat getting smaller and smaller; finally I
"opened the window, even looked through my field-glasses. As it was not yet"
"quite light, I could not see them very clearly, but the red hat was still"
discernible. Then the boat disappeared behind an island. I dressed and
"went down. The children were all still in bed, but the wife, Regine, was"
up. How calmly and naturally she took everything!
"""Do you know where your husband is?"" I asked her."
"""Yes--funny, aren't they?"" she replied. ""I never saw them till after"
they'd left--gone down to the fjord. Where do you suppose they're going?
"Haddock fishing?"""
"""Maybe,"" was all I said. But I thought to myself: ""They're leaving, all"
"right. They had their knapsacks on their backs."""
"""Funny couple,"" Regine resumed. ""Nothing to eat, no coffee, not a thing!"
"And the missis not wanting anything to eat last night, neither!"""
I merely shook my head and went out. Regine called to me that coffee was
"nearly ready, so if I'd like a cup--"
Of course the only thing I could do in the face of such foolishness was to
shake my head and go away. One must take the sensible view. How was it
"possible to understand such behavior? Nevertheless I, the undersigned,"
"should have gone on to Olaus yesterday, instead of going fishing. That"
would have been still more sensible. What business had I at this house?
"Very likely she found it embarrassing to be called the ""missis,"" and this"
was why she could neither eat last night nor stay here today. So she had
"beaten a retreat, with her friend and her knapsack."
"""I suspect the informant is a wretched little hussy of whom I have"
"heard--the daughter of the innkeeper,"" remarked Mary, looking up to"
me for confirmation.
"""Suspect no longer,"" I answered, with sharper emphasis than I should have"
used.
"""Do you know her?"" she asked."
"""I do not know a 'wretched hussy' who is the daughter of the innkeeper,"""
"I answered sullenly. ""I know a beautiful girl who watched devotedly at"
"your brother's bedside, day and night, and probably saved his life at a"
"time when he was deserted by his sisters and his mother."""
"""We often find that sort of kindness in those low creatures,"" she"
"answered, unaware of the tender spot she was touching, and ignoring"
my reference to George's sisters and his mother.
"Naturally Mary was kind of heart, but her mother was a hard, painted"
"old Jezebel, whose teachings would have led her daughter away from every"
"gentle truth and up to all that was hard, cruel, and selfish in life. A"
woman in the higher walks of life is liable to become enamelled before
her twentieth year.
"While I did not blame Mary for what she had said relating to Bettina,"
still I was angry and longed to do battle with any one who could fight.
"After we had been together perhaps ten minutes, some one claimed her for"
"a dance, and she left me, saying hurriedly in my ear:--"
"""I'll see you soon again. I want to ask you further about George."" She"
had not a question to ask about me.
disappointed when the smile with which she greeted me was the same she
would have given to any other man. But Mary was Mary. Nature and art had
"made her what she was--charming, quiescent, and calm, not cold, simply"
lukewarm.
"""I have seen little of you this last month,"" said Mary, taking my arm and"
walking with me away from De Grammont's group. She might have remarked
with equal emotion that Cromwell was dead or the weather fine. She did
"not wait for an explanation of my absence, but continued with a touch of"
"eager hesitancy and a fluttering show of anxiety, ""Have you had news"
"recently of my brother George?"""
"Of course I could not tell her the truth, so I answered evasively: ""I"
suppose you have heard the news spread throughout the court that he has
"gone to Canada? Doubtless you can tell me more than I know."""
"""That is all I know,"" she answered. ""When he went, or where, I have been"
"unable to learn, for George is a forbidden topic in our household and"
"seems to be the same at court. What has he done, baron? I have heard it"
hinted that he threatened to take the king's life. Surely he did nothing
"of the sort."""
"""If he did, it was in a delirium of fever,"" I answered, hoping that she"
would cease speaking of George and would ask a question or two concerning
myself.
"But no. She turned again to me, asking, ""Did you hear him?"""
"""I have been told that the accusation comes from his physician, and"
"perhaps from one who was listening at his door,"" I answered, avoiding a"
direct reply.

"We paraded, and marched off to work. The continuous roar gradually gave"
"place to irregular, though frequent, outbursts of firing along the"
entire front.
The next day the sound seemed to have come nearer. Rumours began to
"circulate--it was said that Armentières had fallen, that the Portuguese"
"had been annihilated at Merville, that the British had counter-attacked"
and taken Lille.
"Rations, newspapers and letters were delayed. Large bodies of troops"
"passed through the village. We got no definite or official news, and"
nobody had any clear notion of what was happening.
But the sound of firing grew louder and louder and our anxiety deepened.
There could no longer be any doubt about it--the Germans were advancing
on our front.
The sickening certainty transcended all other considerations. A few
miles from us thousands were being slaughtered. I ceased to ponder the
problems of failure and success. I forgot the politicians and was
"conscious of only one despairing wish, that the terrible thing might"
come to an end. Victory and defeat seemed irrelevant considerations. If
only the end would come quickly--nothing else really mattered.
I often wondered what was in the minds of the other men. Many of them
"looked anxious, but on the whole they were normal in their behaviour."
They grumbled and quarrelled much as usual and talked rather more than
"usual--but so did I, in spite of my intense mental agitation."
The sound of firing grew louder.
"""Hello, white folks! Here we are, all together again."""
They turned to behold a villanous-looking man beaming benignly upon
"them. He was dirty, his clothes were in rags, and through a riotous"
bristle of beard that hid his thin features a mangy patch showed on
"either cheek. It was undeniably ""Fingerless"" Fraser, but how changed,"
how altered from that radiant flower of indolence they had known! He
"was pallid, emaciated, and bedraggled; his attitude showed hunger and"
"abuse, and his bony joints seemed about to pierce through their"
"tattered covering. As they stood speechless with amazement, he made his"
identification complete by protruding his tongue from the corner of his
mouth and gravely closing one eye in a wink of exceeding wisdom.
"""Fraser!"" they cried in chorus, then fell upon him noisily, shaking his"
grimy hands and slapping his back until he coughed weakly. Summoned by
"their shouts, Big George broke in upon the incoherent greeting, and at"
sight of his late comrade began to laugh hoarsely.
"""Glad to see you, old man!"" he cried, ""but how did you get here?"""
"Fraser drew himself up with injured dignity, then spoke in dramatic"
"accents. ""I worked my way!"" He showed the whites of his eyes,"
tragically.
"""You look like you'd walked in from Kansas,"" George declared."
"""Yes, sir, I _worked! Me!""_"
"""How? Where?"""
"""On that bloody wind-jammer."" He stretched a long arm toward the harbor"
in a theatrical gesture.
"""You have need of better marksmen,"" he said; ""even the Migueletes could"
"not do worse than that!"""
"""Who are you?"" demanded a tall grey-headed gipsy, who like the Sergeant"
"had remained apparently unarmed; ""what is your right to be here?"""
The Sergeant had by this time seated himself on a detached boulder and
was rolling a cigarette. He did not trouble to look up as he answered
"carelessly, ""To the Gitano my name is José Maria of Ronda!"""
The effect of his words was instantaneous. The men who had been ready to
"kill him a moment before almost fell at his feet, though here and there"
some remained apparently unconvinced.
Prominent among these was the elderly man who had put the question to
the Sergeant. Without taking his eyes from those of the Carlist soldier
"he exclaimed, ""Our great José Maria you cannot be. For with these eyes I"
"saw him garrotted in the Plaza Mayor of Salamanca!"""
The Sergeant undid his stock and pointed to a blood-red band about his
"neck, indented deeply into the skin, and more apparent at the back and"
sides than in front.
"""Garrotted in good faith I was in the Plaza of Salamanca, as this"
"gentleman says,"" he remarked with great coolness. ""But not to death. The"
"executioner was as good a _Gitano_ as myself, and removed the spike"
which strikes inward from the back. So you see I am still José Maria of
"Ronda in the flesh, and able to strike a blow for myself!"""
The gipsies set up a wild yell. The name of the most celebrated and most
lawless of their race stirred them to their souls.
"""That boy--there!"" she gasped, ""he frightens me--oh hateful! make him go"
"away!"" And she clutched the young man's arm with such a quick nervous"
"grasp, that a crimson flush rose quickly to Rollo's cheek."
"""No,"" muttered Etienne to himself as he watched the performance"
"critically, ""she was never in love with you, sir! She never did as much"
"for you as that. But on the whole, with a temper like Mistress Concha's,"
"I think you are well out of it, Monsieur Etienne!"" Which wise dictum"
might or might not be based on the fox's opinion as to sour grapes.
All unconsciously Rollo reached a protecting hand across to the little
white fingers which gripped his arm so tightly.
"""Go away, boy,"" he commanded; ""do you not see that you terrify the"
"Señorita?"""
"""I see--that is why I stay!"" cried the amiable youth gleefully,"
flourishing his crutch about his head as if on the point of launching it
at the party.
Rollo laid his hand on the hilt of Killiecrankie with a threatening
gesture.
"""If you come an inch nearer, I will give you plague!"" cried the boy,"
"showing his teeth wickedly, ""and your wench also. You will grow"
"black--yes, and swell! Then you will die, both of you. And there will be"
"no one to bury you, like those in the houses back there. Then all you"
"possess shall be mine, ha, ha!"""
And he laughed and danced till a fit of coughing came upon him so that
he actually crowed in a kind of fiendish exaltation. But Rollo Blair was
"not a man to be jested with, either by devil or devil's imp. He drew a"
and to the last possessed that loftiness of spirit wedded to sombre
fatalism which is the heritage of the Latins. He was at war with his
"kindred of Italy and France, and with the English among whom he had"
"been brought up, and whom he loved. He was their enemy by accident of"
"birth, but though he might and did love his foes better than his"
"German friends of Austria and Prussia, yet he had taken the oath of"
"faithful service, and kept it to the end. I could understand why"
"Dawson--that strange human bloodhound, in whom the ruthless will"
continually struggled with and kept under the very tender heart--would
allow no one to slander Trehayne.
"Cary was watching me eagerly, waiting for me to read the letter."
"Dawson's head was resting on one hand, and his face was turned away,"
"so that I could not see it. He could not wholly conceal his emotion,"
but he would not let us see more of it than he could help. He did not
move once during my reading.

"Officer John Trehayne, R.N.V.R., am at this moment upon the books of"
"the Austrian Navy as a sub-lieutenant, seconded for Secret Service?"
Have you ever been surprised by anything? I don't know. You have said
often in my hearing that you suspect every one. Have you suspected me?
"Sometimes when I have caught that sidelong squint of yours, that"
"""You cannot?  Why?""  I demanded, taken somewhat aback by her sudden"
attitude of determination.
"""I will not allow you to ruin yourself, Gerald, on my account,"" she"
declared in a very low but calm voice.
"""But why should my love for you prove my ruin?""  I cried madly.  ""The"
"truth is that you do not love me.  Why not admit it at once?"""
"""You are in error,"" she hastened to protest.  ""I do love you.  I love"
you to-day with the same fond affection as I entertained for you until
that day--fatal to me--when you turned your back upon me and left me.
"But, alas! we can never now be the same to one another as we were then."""
"She paused for a moment to regain breath; then, pale-faced, with eyes"
"filled with tears, she gripped my arm frantically, crying: ""Gerald, my"
"love, hear me!  These are my last words, but I pronounce them--I make"
confession--so that you may understand the barrier that now lies between
"us."""
"""Well,"" I said, ""speak--tell me!"""
"""Ah!"" she cried hoarsely, covering her face with her hands, ""you wring"
this confession from me.  I am the most unhappy girl in all the world.
"Would that I were dead that it was all ended!  If I did not love you,"
"Gerald, I should deceive you, and leave you to discover the truth after"
our marriage.  But I cannot--I cannot!  Even though we shall part to-day
"for ever, I have resolved to be frank with you because I still have one"

Sis had insisted I come along to the geography lecture. Most of the
"accents, eloquently addressed to the fair Aileen. They writhed in their"
"chairs to gaze around and over the impending form of Tildy, that"
Aileen’s pulchritude might season and make ambrosia of their bacon and
eggs.
And Tildy was content to be the unwooed drudge if Aileen could receive
the flattery and the homage. The blunt nose was loyal to the short
Grecian. She was Aileen’s friend; and she was glad to see her rule
hearts and wean the attention of men from smoking pot-pie and lemon
meringue. But deep below our freckles and hay-coloured hair the
"unhandsomest of us dream of a prince or a princess, not vicarious, but"
coming to us alone.
There was a morning when Aileen tripped in to work with a slightly
bruised eye; and Tildy’s solicitude was almost enough to heal any
optic.
"“Fresh guy,” explained Aileen, “last night as I was going home at"
"Twenty-third and Sixth. Sashayed up, so he did, and made a break. I"
"turned him down, cold, and he made a sneak; but followed me down to"
"Eighteenth, and tried his hot air again. Gee! but I slapped him a good"
"one, side of the face. Then he give me that eye. Does it look real"
"awful, Til? I should hate that Mr. Nicholson should see it when he"
comes in for his tea and toast at ten.”
Tildy listened to the adventure with breathless admiration. No man had
ever tried to follow her. She was safe abroad at any hour of the
twenty-four. What bliss it must have been to have had a man follow one
and black one’s eye for love!
"Among the customers at Bogle’s was a young man named Seeders, who"
"worked in a laundry office. Mr. Seeders was thin and had light hair,"
"""The depth ... seventy-three feet."""
"""What?  Have you guessed, you shaved ugly face?"""
"""Of course, Aristid Fomich!  If you have eyes you can see a thing or"
"two,"" shouted Vaviloff, joyfully."
"A few minutes afterwards they sat side by side in Vaviloff's parlour,"
and the Captain was engaged in drinking large quantities of beer.
"""And so all the walls of the factory stand on your ground,"" said he to"
"the eating-house keeper.  ""Now, mind you show no mercy! The teacher"
"will be here presently, and we will get him to draw up a petition to"
the court.  As to the amount of the damages you will name a very
"moderate sum in order not to waste money in deed stamps, but we will"
"ask to have the factory knocked down.  This, you see, donkey, is the"
result of trespassing on other people's property.  It is a splendid
"piece of luck for you. We will force him to have the place smashed, and"
I can tell you it will be an expensive job for him.  Off with you to
the court.  Bring pressure to bear on Judas.  We will calculate how
much it will take to break the factory down to its very foundations.
"We will make an estimate of it all, counting the time it will take too,"
"and we will make honest Judas pay two thousand roubles besides."""
"""He will never give it!"" cried Vaviloff, but his eyes shone with a"
greedy light.
"""You lie!  He will give it ...  Use your brains... What else can he do?"
"But look here, Egorka, mind you don't go in for doing it on the cheap."
They are sure to try to buy you off.  Don't sell yourself cheap.  They
"will probably use threats, but rely upon us..."""
"""That is simple,"" comments Captain Kuvalda.  ""It continues to serve."
"That is ridiculous.  To the merchant who is moving about in the city,"
it is profitable that it should continue to serve. Therefore it does
"continue."""
"""The article, in fact, is written on the subject,"" says the teacher."
"""Is it?  That is strange, it is more a subject for a feuilleton..."""
"""Such a subject must be treated with plenty of pepper...."""
"Then a short discussion begins.  The people listen attentively, as only"
one bottle of vodki has been drunk.
"After the leader, they read the local events, then the court"
"proceedings, and, if in the police court it reports that the defendant"
"or plaintiff is a merchant, then Aristid Kuvalda sincerely rejoices."
"If someone has robbed the merchant, ""That is good,"" says he.  ""Only it"
"is a pity they robbed him of so little.""  If his horses have broken"
"down, ""It is sad that he is still alive.""  If the merchant has lost his"
"suit in court, ""It is a pity that the costs were not double the amount."""
"""That would have been illegal,"" remarks the teacher"
"""Illegal!  But is the merchant himself legal?"" inquires Kuvalda,"
"bitterly.  ""What is the merchant?  Let us investigate this rough and"
"uncouth phenomenon.  First of all, every merchant is a mujik. He comes"
"from a village, and in course of time becomes a merchant.  In order to"
"be a merchant, one must have money.  Where can the mujik get the money"
"from?  It is well known that he does not get it by honest hard work,"
"and that means that the mujik, somehow or other, has been swindling."
"That is to say, a merchant is simply a dishonest mujik."""
"Yashka was ""touched with paint"" after two glasses of vodki, and was in"
a slightly uplifted condition.
"The people looked at him, expecting him to make a row, and all were"
silent.
"""Did you see me?  And how did it please you?"" asks Yashka."
The people control their laughter.
"""No; it did not please me,"" replies the teacher.  His tone is so"
serious that the people are silent.
"""You see I was just trying it,"" said Yashka, with bravado, fearing that"
"the teacher would rebuke him. ""The wife is satisfied....  She has not"
"got up yet to-day...."""
"The teacher, who was drawing absently with his fingers on the table,"
"said, ""Do you see, Yakov, why this did not please me? ... Let us go"
"into the matter thoroughly, and understand what you are really doing,"
and what the result may be.  Your wife is pregnant.  You struck her
last night on her sides and breast. That means that you beat not only
"her but the child too.  You may have killed him, and your wife might"
have died or else have become seriously ill.  To have the trouble of
"looking after a sick woman is not pleasant.  It is wearing, and would"
"cost you dear, because illness requires medicine, and medicine money."
"If you have not killed the child, you may have crippled him, and he"
"will be born deformed, lop-sided, or hunch-backed.  That means that he"
"will not be able to work, and it is only too important to you that he"
"should be a good workman.  Even if he be born ill, it will be bad"
"enough, because he will keep his mother from work, and will require"
medicine.  Do you see what you are doing to yourself?  Men who live by
she 'll have to earn her living as a little slave in some squalid
Household. But what's going to become of that human creature morally and
spiritually? That's what I want to know.”
"“It's an interesting problem,” said Herold. “She may be either a"
"benumbed half-idiot or a vicious, vindictive she-brute.”"
"“Just so,” said John. “That is, if she goes to slave in some squalid"
household. But suppose she were transferred to different surroundings
"altogether? Suppose she had ease of life, loving care, and all the rest"
of it?”
The senile travesty of Herold laughed.
“You want me to say that she may develop into some sort of flower of
womanhood.”
"“Do you think she might?” John asked seriously. “My dear fellow,” said"
"Herold, “there are Heaven knows how many hundred million human beings"
"on the face of the earth, and every one of them is different from the"
others. How can one tell what any particular young woman whom one does
n't know might or might not do in given circumstances? But if you want
me to say whether I think it right for you to step in and look after the
"poor little devil's future, then I do say it's right. It 's stunning of"
you. It's the very best thing you can do. It will give the poor little
"wretch a chance, at any rate, and will give you something outside"
yourself to think of.”

"Greca relayed the message in the whistling, piping Rogan tongue. The"

"With flights of fancy he hadn't known he was capable of, he described"
"great airships, steered automatically and bristling with guns that"
discharged explosives powerful enough to kill everything within a
range of a thousand miles. He told of billions of thirty-foot giants
sheathed in an alloy that would make them invulnerable to any feeble
rays the Rogans might have developed. He touched on the certain
wholesale death that must overtake any hostile force that tried to
invade the planet.
"""The Rogan shock-tubes are toys compared with the ray-weapons of"
"Earth,"" he concluded. ""We have arms that can nullify the effects of"
"yours and kill at the same instant. We have--"""

"Astura poured boiling pitch upon the heads of the attacking party,"
hurled rocks of huge dimensions down upon them which crushed into a
"mangled mass scores of men, unable to retain the vantage they had"
"gained under the avalanche of arrows, rocks and fire."
In a moment's time the situation was changed.
"Noiselessly as leopards, the duke's men fell upon their rear, raising"
"their war-cry as they leaped from the shadows. Those on the ramparts,"
"forced to grapple with the nearer enemy, abandoned their tasks. The"
"Pisans, profiting by the lull, swarmed over the walls. Taken between"
"two parties, a deadly hand-to-hand conflict ensued. Above the din and"
"the roar of the hurricane, of the clashing of arms, above the cries"
"of the wounded, the death-rattle of the dying, sounded the voice of"
the Duke of Spoleto.
"""Onward, my men! Kill and slay!"""
Side by side the duke and Francesco leaped into the thickest of the
"fray, both animated by the same desire to come face to face with the"
"lords of Astura, spurning a lesser enemy."
For a time they seemed doomed to disappointment. Had the Frangipani
been slain?
The zest of the conflict pointed rather to their directing the
defence. Else their mercenaries would have left Astura to its fate.
Suddenly an unearthly voice startled the combatants.
"""Guard, devil, guard!"""
"It was by no means a difficult task to replace the stone, as it was thin"
"and had been nicely fitted into the opening. In a short time the boys,"
"proceeding mostly on their hands and knees, came to the end of the"
tunnel and looked out over a valley tucked in between two great summits.
"The snow-line was not far away and the air was cold, notwithstanding the"
direct rays of the sun.
"There was no one in sight, no moving object anywhere, as the boys paused"
at the mouth of the passage and gazed about. Judging from the location
"of the sun, they were looking straight west."
"“Now,” Ned said after a pause, “if we follow this little valley straight"
"to the south, we’ll come out somewhere near our camp.”"
"“Yes,” Jimmie answered, “I have a pious notion that our brownstone front"
is carved into the face of a continuation of that ridge on the other
side of the little valley.”
"“Perhaps we’ll find the Boy Scout messenger at the camp,” Ned suggested."
"“If we do,” Jimmie declared, “I’ll change his face for him!”"
"“I can’t understand the fellow,” Ned admitted."
"“Gee!” cried Jimmie, “He came out into the woods and told Frank and I to"
"beat it, then went up into the camp and led you into the clutches of"
"these outlaws. If I had his head in chancery right now, I’d ‘beat it’,"
all right! He ought to get a thousand years!”
"“I hope the boys are all safe,” said Ned."
"""I am going as one of the Marine sentries."""
"""It's no use, Dawson,"" protested I emphatically. ""You are a wonder at"
"disguise, and will look, I do not doubt, the very spit of a Marine."
But you can't pass among the men for half an hour without discovery.
"They are a class apart, they talk their own language, cherish their"
"own secret traditions, live in a world to which no stranger ever"
penetrates. You could pass as a naval officer more easily than you
"could as a Pongo. It is sheer madness, Dawson."""
"He gave a short laugh. ""Much you know about it. I have served in the"
"Red Corps myself. I was a recruit at Deal, passed two years at"
"Plymouth, and served afloat for three years. I was then drafted into"
the Naval Police. Afterwards I was recommended for detective work in
"the dockyards, and at the end of my Marine service joined the Yard. My"
"good man, I was a sergeant before I left the Corps."""
"""I give up, Dawson,"" said I. ""Nothing about you will ever surprise me"
"again. Not even if you claim to have been a Cabinet Minister."""
"A queer smile stole over his face. ""No, I have not been a minister,"
"but I have attended a meeting of the Cabinet."""
"Cary interposed at this point. ""Yours is a fine idea, Mr. Dawson. As a"
Marine sentry you can get yourself posted by the Major wherever you
"please, and the Guard will not talk even though they may wonder that"
any man should want to do twenty-four hours of duty per day. The
"Marines are the closest, faith-fullest, and best disciplined force in"

"""And now you'll have to return with the boy. I'm sorry, Miss Sparling."
"But as you explained to me, a man who has been honored with an"
important official position should stay close to the letter of the law
for the sake of other men who are trying to break down terrestrial
"anti-male prejudice. Of course, there's a way out."""
"""There is? Tell me, please!"""
"""Can I lower my hands a minute?"" I asked."
"""No, you can't, son--not according to the armed surveillance provisions"

The Captain shrugged and spread his arms wide.

happiest moment in my life. I lost the sensation of weariness for the
time being. But my foot began to hurt very badly and I got someone to
help me along. My wound was dressed. I got on to a stretcher and I
didn't know anything more until I was taken out of the motor ambulance
"here at the C.C.S. Anyhow, I'm all right now and I'm going to try and"
"get across to Blighty and swing the lead as long as I can."""
There was silence for a while. It had grown dark outside. But the call
from the theatre sounded again. Gradually the waiting-room emptied
itself until at last there were only two men left sitting in front of
the fire. They both seemed depressed and gloomy. Then one of them broke
the silence and said:
"""We was goin' over when a 'eavy one burst. I didn't 'alf cop a packet in"
"me shoulder. It's the third time too, an' I've got the wind up about"

"his right ear. ""If yer've got ter die yer've got ter die, an' it's no"
"use worryin' about it."""
Their turn came before long and I helped each one to get on to a table.
Then I went over to the Prep. to see if any more walking wounded had
"arrived, but there were none at all."
I stood out in the open for a few minutes in order to breathe the fresh
air. There was a roar and rumble of distant drum-fire. The trees behind
the C.C.S. stood out blackly against the pallid flashes that lit up the
entire horizon.

HISTORY OF A DISCOVERY
Substance of a Lecture delivered by Prof. J. C. Bose on the 20th
"November 1915, at the Ram Mohan Library, under the Presidency of the"
"Hon'ble Mr. P. C. Lyon, and published at p. 693, Vol. xviii, of the"
"""Modern Review"" (July to December, 1915)."
"At the tournament held before the court at Hastinapur, more than"
"twenty-five centuries ago, Karna, the reputed son of a Charioteer, had"
challenged the supremacy of Prince Arjuna. To this challenge Arjuna had
returned a scornful answer; a prince could not cross swords with one who
"could claim no nobility of descent. ""I am my own ancestor,"" replied"
"Karna, and this perhaps the earliest assertion of the right of man to"
choose and determine his own destiny. In the realm of knowledge also the
great achievements have been won only by men with determined purpose and
without any adventitious aids. Undismayed by human limitations they had
struggled in spite of many a failure. In their inquiry after truth they
"regarded nothing as too laborious, nothing too insignificant, nothing"
too painful. This is the process which all must follow; there is no
easier path.
The lecturer's research on the properties of Electric Waves was begun
just twenty-one years ago. In this he was greatly encouraged by the
"appreciation shown by the Royal Society, which not only published his"
"researches, but also offered a Parliamentary grant for the continuance"
"From 1 to 2¹⁄₂ months, ¹⁄₁₆ dose."
DOGS.
"From ¹⁄₂ to 1 year old, full dose."
"From 3 to 6 months, ¹⁄₂ dose."
"From 1¹⁄₂ to 3 months, ¹⁄₄ dose."
"From 20 to 45 days, ¹⁄₈ dose."
"From 10 to 20 days, ¹⁄₁₆ dose."
THE ART OF PRESCRIBING
The prescription should be as brief and simple as possible. It should be
explicit and clearly written. It may be expressed either in Latin or in
English. The manner in which the medicine is to be used should be
"specified. Important instructions as to the rule, systematic regulations"
or diet of the patient are sometimes necessary.
Prescriptions usually contain two or more of the following four
representative constituents: (1) The _basis_ or active ingredients. The
practice of conjoining several active medicines has wisely been
"abandoned. Occasionally, however, it may be advantageous to give"
together two medicines producing their effects in somewhat different
"ways. Thus, spasms of the bowels are more often effectually controlled"
by the conjunction of a stimulant like ether and an anodyne like opium
than by either given alone. Pain which is not alleviated by either
morphine or atropine is sometimes abated by giving them together. (2)
"The _adjuvant_ is introduced in order to increase, moderate or modify"
the action of the basis. Frequently its chief object is to insure
solubility and ready absorption. (3) A _corrective_ is occasionally

"_Antigone_? What about her? She is a sister ship of the _Antinous_,"
"and was in with damage to her forefoot, which had been ripped up when"
"she ran down that big German submarine north of the Orkneys--Yes, I"
know; she was due to go out some time to-day. What do you say? Wires

"Cary hung up the receiver and glared at me. ""It has happened again,"""
"he groaned. ""The _Antigone_ this time. She has been in dry dock for"
the past fortnight and was floated out yesterday. Her full complement
joined her last night. Dawson says that he was called up at
eight-o'clock by the news that her gun-wires have been cut exactly
like those of the _Antinous_ and in the same incomprehensible way. He
"seems, curiously enough, to be quite cheerful about it."""
"""He has had a few hours sleep. And, besides, he sees that this second"
"case, so exactly like the first, makes the solution of his problem"
"very much more easy. I am glad that he is cheerful, for I feel"
exuberantly happy myself. I was kept awake half the night by a
persistent notion which seemed the more idiotic the more I thought all
"round it. But now--now, there may be something in it."""
"""What is your idea? Tell me quick."""
"""No, thank you, Dr. Watson. We amateur masters of intuition don't work"
our thrilling effects in that way. We keep our notions to ourselves
"until they turn out to be right, and then we declare that we saw"
"through the problem from the first. When we have been wrong, we say"
"nothing. So you observe, Cary, that whatever happens our reputations"
attract the surly pair who played at cards.
"""Now you might try Airedale and Pekinese,"" Tommy suggested, but this was"
lost on the serious little man. Yet he did call in another strangely
"sounding tongue, then with a sigh laid the megaphone down, saying:"
"""They must be stuffies!"""
"""Dummies, sir, dummies,"" Tommy corrected. ""Nice people don't say"
"stuffies, ever!"""
"""Your Tommy does so much cut-upping, eh!"" he smiled at me. I had noticed"
that when preoccupied or excited the idioms of his various languages got
tumbled into a rather hopeless potpourri.
Quarantine and customs were passed in the leisurely fashion of Cuban
"officials, and Monsieur asked to be sent immediately ashore, promising"
"to return at sundown. There was a man, the secret agent, he explained,"
who held important information.
"""I'll have the launch for you at Machina wharf, sir,"" Gates told him,"
"but he refused to consider this, declaring that he could hire any of the"
boatmen thereabout to bring him out.
"""He's that considerate, sir,"" Gates later confided to me. ""But I carn't"
make head nor tail of him. Bilkins says he went in to lay out his
"clothes, and the things he's got stuck in those bags would astonish"
"you!"""
"Nearing six o'clock a skiff drew alongside, being propelled by one"

CHAPTER XXII
HIS MOTHER'S ROSARY
"It was, as the soldier had said most truly, a cold morning to be shot"
"in. But the Carlists, accustomed to Cabrera's summary methods, appeared"
"to think but little of the matter, and jested as the firing parties were"
selected and drawn out. Ragged and desolate they looked as they stood on
"a slight slope between the foreigners and the red dawn, biting their"
cartridges and fingering the pulls of their rifles with hands numbed
with cold. At elbow and knee their rags of uniforms flapped like bunches
of ribbons at a fair.
"""In the garden!"" whispered Luis Fernandez to Cabrera."
"""To the garden!"" commanded the general, lighting a new cigarette and"
"puffing vigorously, ""and at this point I may as well bid you good-bye. I"
"wish our acquaintance had been pleasanter. But the fortune of war,"
gentlemen! My mother had not so long time to say her prayers at the
"hands of your friend Nogueras--and she was a woman and old, gentlemen. I"
"doubt not you know as well how to die as she?"""
"And they did. Not one of them uttered a word. John Mortimer, seeing"
"there was now no chance of making his thousand pounds, set an example"
"of unbending dignity. He comported himself, indeed, exactly as he would"
"have done on his marriage day. That is, he knew that the eyes of many"
"were upon him, and he resolved not to shame the performance. So he went"
through his part with the exact English mixture of awkward shyness and
"consolation we can find lies in the fact that we know it."""
"""Most fools lack that flattering unction,"" returned Frances, musingly."
"""Perhaps you will take more interest in this matter when I tell you"
"that it is not Betty I propose to see,"" I answered. ""I am deliberately"
"offering to take you to see some one else who is about to leave England."""
"She stood on tiptoe and kissed my lips for answer, then sank into a"
"chair, covering her face with her hands to hide the sudden tears."
I went to the window and waited till she was calm. I longed to comfort
her by telling of the faint prospect of good fortune that lay in Le
"Grand's letter, but I hesitated raising a hope which might never be"
realized.
"At the end of five minutes I went to her and said: ""Let me ask the"
"duchess to excuse you for to-night, and in the morning I'll meet you on"
"Bowling Green stairs, at, say, seven o'clock."""
"""I'll be there,"" she answered, smiling through her tears."
"The next morning we took boat, and the tide running out, made good speed"
"to the Bridge, hastened to the Old Swan, and found George in his printing"
"shop awaiting us. I remained in the old tapestried room, leaving Frances"
and George to say their farewells. In the course of a few minutes he
"called me in. He had donned his Quaker disguise, and on the floor near"
"him was a small bundle of linen. Frances was weeping, and George's voice"
was choked with emotion.
"""Well, at last, Baron Ned, you are to be rid of me,"" he said, glancing"
toward the bundle at his feet.
"smooth, the delicate tracery of veins could be distinctly seen, and each"
"muscle stood out hard and taut; there was no superfluous flesh, but a"
firmness and excellence of condition that brought a smile of
"satisfaction to Grey’s face.  He turned with a smile to Dick, who stood"
by beaming.
"""Not much fear of him to-day, eh, Dicon?"""
"""He would jump the moon, master, if you asked it of him,"" was the proud"
and confident answer.
"""How do the others look?  Have you seen them?"""
"""Pretty bits of horseflesh every one; and there is a black stallion of"
Mr. Artheret’s that will take some beating.  But he’s too heavy for some
of the jumps. He don’t take off fast enough.  And he’s a nasty temper
"too.  There’s a gray Arab with pace; but he falls away behind, as they"
all do.  I don’t think Don Carlos will be troubled long by him.  None of
"the others will take much beating.  Pretty to look at, but not trained"
"for what they’ve got to do.  Lord Sandford was here yesterday early,"
"looking at the jumps, and he had several of them made stiffer; but"
"there’s nothing Don Carlos cannot sail over like a bird!"""
"""Let us go and see,"" said Grey.  ""I will take a canter on the turf to"
"warm myself to the saddle. Soh, boy, soh!"" as he lightly vaulted to his"
"seat, and the horse curveted beneath him.  ""We will take a look at these"
"obstructions.  The stiffer they are, the better you and I will be"
"pleased—eh, my beauty?"""
"Dick mounted his nag, and rode beside his master to the course, where"
the horses were to be matched against each other when Lord Sandford and
"his friends should have finished their merry meal, and be ready to"
TOXICOLOGY.--Dogs and cats are especially susceptible to the action of
"carbolic acid, therefore great care must be exercised when washing,"
"especially cats, with any preparation containing carbolic acid."
Disinfecting and deodorizing cat’s quarters with any preparation
containing carbolic acid makes them sick.
ANTIDOTE.--Sulphates of soda or magnesia. Atropine sulphate
hypodermically is a very valuable antidote. Alcohol and vinegar have
"been used with good results, both internally and externally."
ACIDUM SALICYLICUM--SALICYLIC ACID
"An organic acid, existing naturally in combination in various plants,"
but largely prepared synthetically from carbolic acid.
DERIVATION.--Made by passing carbonic dioxide through sodium carbolate
at a temperature of 428° F. (220° C.). 2 NaC₆H₅O (sodium carbolate) +
CO₂ = Na₂C₇H₄O₃ (sodium salicylate) + C₆H₆O (phenol). Sodium salicylate
is treated with hydrochloric acid when salicylic acid is precipitated.
"PROPERTIES.--Light, fine, white, needle-shaped crystals, odorless,"
"having a sweetish, afterwards acrid taste; permanent in air. Soluble in"
"alcohol, ether and hot water; borax increases its solubility."
"DOSE.--Horses, 2 to 6 drs.; cattle, ¹⁄₂ to 1 oz.; sheep, 1 to 2 drs.;"
"pigs, 30 to 40 grs.; dogs, 5 to 20 grs.; should be given well diluted;"
"large doses are recommended for fevers, but smaller doses more often"
repeated in rheumatism.

"“Oh my!” laughed Jimmie, as the fat confidential clerk struggled under"
difficulties to make himself more presentable. “If you think you’re in a
"muss, just look at this beautiful new khaki uniform I put on only a day"
"or two ago! It’s a peach, ain’t it?”"
"“It certainly is in a mess,” admitted Gilroy."
"“Of course,” grinned Jimmie. “I fell down a chute, and rolled into the"
"basement of a mountain, and climbed up a smutty chimney, and fell into a"
secret passage and had all kinds of sport! Ned and I have had a glorious
morning. You should have been with us.”
"The confidential clerk frowned slightly, but made no reply."
"When the boys reached the camp, after giving a great deal of mental and"

the camp like this?” Jimmie asked.

encounter with the half-breeds.

they had some good reason for doing so.”

in the wind.
"Three times he circled it above his head, then he flung it into the"
sea.
"""Bernardo Sarriano and the Pisan galleys,"" he turned to Francesco."
"""They are heading for the Cape of Circé."""
A shout of command rang through the woods.
As with phantom cohorts the forest-aisles teemed with moving shadows.
A ride of some five miles lay between them and the Cape of Circé. Much
of that region was wild forest land and moor; bleak rocky wastes let
"into woods and gloom. Great oaks, gnarled, vast, terrible, held giant"
sway amid the huddled masses of the underbrush. Here the wild boar
lurked and the wolf hunted. But for the most it was dark and
"calamitous, a ghostly wilderness forsaken by man."
As they rode along they struck the occasional trail of the Crusaders
"of the Church. A burnt hamlet, a smoking farmhouse with a dun mist"
"hanging over it like a shroud, and once they stumbled upon the body of"
a dead girl. They halted for a brief space to give her burial. The
duke's men dug a shallow grave under an oak and they left her there
and went on their way with greater caution.
"""There is one man on earth to whom I owe a debt,"" the duke, leading"
"the van beside Francesco, turned to the latter, ""a debt that shall be"
"paid this night, principal and interest."""

"""You speak in enigmas, Yolande.  Why not be more explicit?"""

"said in a low, tremulous voice half choked by emotion:"
"""Once you loved me, Gerald,--of that I feel confident; and I"
"reciprocated your affection, God knows!  Our love was, perhaps, curious,"
inasmuch as you were English and I was of a different creed and held
different ideas from those which you considered right.  It is always the
same with a man and woman of different nationality--there must be a
"give-and-take principle between them.  Between us, however, there was"
"perfect confidence until, by a strange combination of circumstances--by"
a stroke of the sword of Fate--that incident occurred which led to our
"estrangement."""
"She paused, her blanched lips shut tight.  ""Well?""  I asked, ""I am all"
attention.  Why is it too late now for me to make reparation for the
"past?"""
I loved her with all my soul.  I was heedless of those words of the old
"Baronne, of Anderson's suspicions, and Kaye's denunciation.  Even if she"
"were a spy, I adored her.  The fire of that old love had swept upon me,"
"and I could not hold back, even though her touch might be as that of a"
leper and her lips venomous.
"""Reparation is impossible,"" she answered hoarsely.  ""Is not that"
"sufficient?"""
"""No, it is not sufficient,"" I answered clearly.  ""I will not be put off"
"by such an answer."""

"Lampert, as it breezed up again."
"And five minutes' later, while Lampert was lighting his pipe half-way"
"down the cabin stairs, he heard a bellow forward which made him drop"
thoughts of tobacco.
"""Breakers ahead!"""
The watch came out on deck and ran aft; and were followed by the
"watch below in various articles of attire, not calculated to keep"
them very warm.
The _Potluck_ had been running with the wind nearly dead aft.
"""Starboard, starboard!"" roared Lampert.  ""Oh, steady; hold her there!"""
The vessel ran off to port at a sharp angle to her wake.
"""Up here some,"" yelled the mate, ""and set the spanker!  Stand by"
"the----  My God!"""
"And, as old Jones and Simcox came on deck, the _Potluck_ was hard and"
fast ashore.  With one simultaneous crack the three topmasts went
"over the side, and as the men and officers jumped under the shelter"
"of the weather rail, Lampert and those of the watch who were with him"
came tumbling down from the poop.  They reckoned on a boiling sea
coming after and sweeping them away.  But though the malignity native
"to matter had set the _Potluck_ ashore, by good luck she was hard and"
fast in the one sheltered cove on the island.  When Lampert by
"instinct altered her course to port, as he heard the coast breakers"
"at the starboard bow, he had run her in between two ledges of rock,"
of which the outer or more westerly one acted as a complete
"everything close to the chest, but still. He would have felt better if"
"Michael Vance, Jr., had favored him with a little more trust."
"On the other hand, keeping the details of the operation under wraps as"
long as possible was probably wise. It minimized the chance for some
inadvertent slip-up.
"Yes, it was definitely best. Because he was staring across his desk at"
"four of Tanzan Mino's Tokyo _kobun_, all dressed in shiny black leather"
"jackets. They'd arrived at the Docklands office just after dawn,"
announcing they were there to hand-deliver the money to Tokyo. Jiro
Sato had directed them to Westminster Union.
"The four all carried black briefcases, which did not contain business"
papers. They intended to accomplish their mission by whatever means
"necessary. Jiro Sato, the London _oyabun_, had not been invited to send"
his people along with them this morning. He was now humiliated and dis-
"graced, officially removed from the operation, on Tokyo's orders. The"
"regional office had failed, so Tokyo had sent in a _Mino-gumi_ version"
of the Delta Force. They clearly had orders concerning what to do with
Michael Vance.
"He didn't like this new twist. For everything to go according to plan,"
violence had to be kept out of it. There was no way he and Michael
could go head to head with street enforcers. If Michael was thinking of
"doing that, the man was crazy."
"He glanced at his gold Omega, noting that it read ten- nineteen. In"
eleven more minutes he'd know how Michael intended to run the scenario.
"But whatever happened, he wasn't going to be intimidated by these"
"_kobun_ hoods, dark sunglasses and automatics notwithstanding. Those"

"thankful I'll be, on your account as well as my own, when we're married"
"and safely settled down, with a home of our own to feel safe in!"
"""Look, there's where we'll live when we're in London."""
Sallie looked out. They were whirling past one of the most imposing
"houses in Grosvenor Square. ""Is it an hotel?"" she asked, and observed"
that all but one or two of its topmost windows were dark.
"""It's the Earl of Jura's town house,"" said Slyne, apparently somewhat"
"piqued by her seeming indifference. ""It's yours now--or will be as soon"
"as the Chancery Court wakes up again."""
Sallie glanced back and caught another glimpse of it as the taxicab
slowed again to take the corner of the square. Slyne had picked up the
speaking-tube.
"""Get us to the station now, as fast as you can,"" he told the driver: and"
"then, having glanced at his watch, lighted a cigarette. He seemed to"
"have no more to say at the moment, and Sallie was busy with thoughts of"
her own. She was wondering whether Justin Carthew could be living in
that great house. She could not understand.... But she did not dare to
"ask Jasper Slyne for any information, since he had shown her more than"
once already that he did not intend to tell her any more than he thought
fit.
When they finally reached the station they found Mr. Jobling awaiting
them there and very anxious over their late arrival.
"""We drove round by Grosvenor Square,"" Slyne told the lawyer"
"""Ah!  Vraiment!  Voyons!  Donnez--un instant--vous verrez."""
"The fiddler, doubting but hypnotized, handed him the fiddle; his dark"
face changed when he saw this stranger fling it up to his shoulder and

"up the street, his eyes searching for the flower-boxes.  He saw them,"
"stopped, and began playing ""Che faro?""  He played it wonderfully on that"
"poor fiddle; and the fiddler, who had followed at his elbow, stood"
"watching him, uneasy, envious, but a little entranced.  Sapristi!  This"
"tall, pale monsieur with the strange face and the eyes that looked drunk"
"and the hollow chest, played like an angel!  Ah, but it was not so easy"
as all that to make money in the streets of this sacred town!  You might
play like forty angels and not a copper!  He had begun another tune--like
"little pluckings at your heart--tres joli--tout a fait ecoeurant! Ah,"
"there it was--a monsieur as usual closing the window, drawing the"
curtains!  Always same thing!  The violin and the bow were thrust back
into his hands; and the tall strange monsieur was off as if devils were
"after him--not badly drunk, that one!  And not a sou thrown down!  With"
an uneasy feeling that he had been involved in something that he did not
"understand, the lame, dark fiddler limped his way round the nearest"
"corner, and for two streets at least did not stop.  Then, counting the"
"silver Fiorsen had put into his hand and carefully examining his fiddle,"
"he used the word, ""Bigre!"" and started for home."

10. American Hymns.
The English speaking colonists who settled in America during the 17th
century continued the psalm singing traditions of their forebears in
England. The practice prevailed in their churches for two hundred years.
"The first book printed by them was the _Bay Psalm Book_, in 1640, at"
"Cambridge, Massachusetts. It contained no original hymns. The singing of"
"psalms, and later of hymns borrowed from England made up nearly the"
entire repertory of church music until the middle of the 19th century.
"On the other hand, the German speaking colonists, including the"
"Mennonites, had brought with them the hymn books of the Lutheran"
tradition and continued the use of the German chorales in their worship.
"The two streams of hymnody, English psalms and German chorales, went"
"their independent courses for two centuries, scarcely influencing each"
other.
In the meantime there was very little original hymnody produced in
"America, with the exception of the work of the Wesleys during their"
"brief experiment in Georgia, and the composition of certain hymns and"
"tunes by the German people of Pennsylvania, which have remained, until"
"recently, in manuscript form. Timothy Dwight’s hymn on the church, “I"
"love Thy Kingdom, Lord” (275) is probably the earliest American hymn"
still in use.
After the middle of the 19th century the number of hymn writers became
"large and their works came into increasing use, some choice examples"
finding their way into English hymnbooks. America’s original

CHAPTER XXIII
THE POTTER'S WHEEL
'Life is like a great whirlpool wherein we are dashed to and fro by
our passions.'--_Saying of the Buddha._
"It is a hard teaching, this of the Buddha about death. It is a teaching"
"that may appeal to the reason, but not to the soul, that when life goes"
"out, this thing which we call 'I' goes out with it, and that love and"
remembrance are dead for ever.
It is so hard a teaching that in its purity the people cannot believe
"it. They accept it, but they have added on to it a belief which changes"
"the whole form of it, a belief that is the outcome of that weakness of"
humanity which insists that death is not and cannot be all.
"Though to the strict Buddhist death is the end of all worldly passion,"
"to the Burmese villager that is not so. He cannot grasp, he cannot"
"endure that it should be so, and he has made for himself out of Buddhism"
a belief that is opposed to all Buddhism in this matter.
"He believes in the transmigration of souls, in the survival of the 'I.'"
"The teaching that what survives is not the 'I,' but only the result of"
"its action, is too deep for him to hold. True, if a flame dies the"
"effects that it has caused remain, and the flame is dead for ever. A new"
"flame is a new flame. But the 'I' of man cannot die, he thinks; it lives"
and loves for all time.
"""No,"" he answered breathlessly.  ""But we must not lose a single"
"instant.""  And I saw that with a lancet he had made an incision in her"
"delicate wrist, and there was blood there.  ""She is in a state of"
"catalepsy, and we must do all in our power to bring her round."""
"""But do you think you can?""  I cried."
"""I hope so."""
"""Do your best, Dick,"" I implored.  ""Save her, for my sake."""
"""Rely upon me,"" he answered calmly, adding: ""Run along to Number 18 in"
the boulevard--the corner house on the right--and bring Doctor Trepard
"at once.  He lives au troisieme.  Tell him that I sent you, and that the"
"matter is one of life or death.""  He scribbled some words on a card,"
"and, giving it me, added: ""Tell him to bring this.  Meanwhile, I will"
"commence artificial respiration.  Go!"""
"""But do you think she will really recover?""  I demanded."
"""I can't tell.  We have already lost so much time.  I had no idea of the"
truth.  It has surprised me just as it has surprised you.  This moment
"is not one for words, but for actions.  Don't lose an instant."""
"Thus urged, I snatched up my hat and tore along the boulevard like a"
"madman.  Without difficulty I found Trepard's appartement, and on being"
"admitted found him a grave-faced, rather stout old Frenchman, who, on"
the instant I mentioned Dick's name and gave him the card with the words
"upon it, naming some drugs he required, went into an adjoining room, and"
"fetched a phial of tiny red pillules, which he held up to the light."
"Then he put on his hat, and descended with me to the street.  A fiacre"
"was passing, which we took, and five minutes later we were standing"
"surely do as much for a mountain gipsy if, as you said just now, the"
"range is likely to be a short one!"""
Rollo began somewhat to change his opinion about the husband of the
"Queen. At first he had seemed both dandy and coward, a combination which"
Rollo held in the utmost contempt. But when Rollo had once seen him
"handle a gun, he began to have more respect for his recent Excellency"
the Duke of Rianzares.
"""Can you tell us, from your military experience,"" Rollo asked, ""which is"
"the most easily vulnerable part of this palace."""
"""It is easily vulnerable in every part,"" answered Muñoz, carelessly"
snapping the lock of a rifle again and again.
"""Nay, but be good enough to listen, sir,"" cried Rollo, with some heat."
"""There are women and children here. You do not know the gipsies. You do"
not know by whom they are led. You do not know the oaths of death and
"torture they have sworn----"""
"""By whom are they led?"" said Muñoz, still playing carelessly with the"
"rifle. ""I thought such fellows were mere savages from the hills, and"
"might be slaughtered like sheep."""
"""Perhaps--at any rate they are led by your own daughter!"" said Rollo,"
"briefly, growing nettled at the parvenu grandee's seeming indifference."
"""_My daughter!_"" cried Muñoz, losing in a moment his bright complexion,"
"and becoming of a slaty pallor, ""my daughter, that mad imp of hell--who"
"thrice has tried to assassinate me!"""
"And as he spoke, he let the gun fall upon the floor at his feet. Then he"
"""Hope to goodness you are,"" declared his lordship. ""Stay for a week or"
"two, anyhow: and,""--he lowered his voice to a husky whisper, leaning"
"toward her--""let _me_ trot you about a bit, eh? You'll maybe see more"
"than enough of _him_ by and by!"" He indicated Slyne with an eloquent"
"elbow, and further expressed his sentiments by means of an ardent sigh."
"Beyond the blossom-laden épergne, Mr. Jobling and Captain Dove, almost"
"cut off from other intercourse by that barrier, were exchanging coldly"
"critical glances. Neither seemed to be quite at his ease with the other,"
"and both had, of course, a great many urgent questions to put to Slyne"
as soon as the Marquis of Ingoldsby should be gone. So that the
"luncheon-party must have proved a very dull affair to them, and they"
were no doubt glad when it was over.
"Slyne signalled to Sallie as soon as coffee was served, and she rose to"
leave the room. She was quite accustomed to being promptly dispensed
with whenever her company might have been inconvenient.
"""Oh, I say!"" protested Lord Ingoldsby. ""You're not goin' yet, Lady J."
Half a mo'. Won't you come for a spin with me now that the car's mine?
Just say the word and I'll drop my other engagement. And then we could
"dine at--"""
"""Lady Josceline will be engaged with her lawyer all afternoon,"" Slyne"
"cut him short with the utmost coolness, ""and she's leaving Monte Carlo"
"again to-night."""
The Marquis of Ingoldsby glowered at him.
"""I'll see you in Paris, then, Lady J.,"" he went on, pointedly ignoring"
"Slyne, ""or in London, at least, later on. Well, good-bye--if you must be"
complete and solemn silence. Only in front of the door several
"she-goats, with bunching, over-full udders, waited to be milked with"
plaintive whimperings and tokens of unrest.
La Giralda looked at her companion. The Sergeant looked at La Giralda.
The same thought was in the heart of each.
"La Giralda went up quickly to the door, and knocked loudly. At"
"farmhouses in Old Castile it is necessary to knock loudly, for the"
"family lives on the second floor, while the first is given up to bundles"
"of fuel, trusses of hay, household provender of the more indestructible"
"sort, and one large dog which invariably answers the door first and"
expresses in an unmistakable manner his intention of making his
breakfast off the stranger's calves.
But not even the dog responded to the clang of La Giralda's oaken cudgel
"on the stout door panels. Accordingly she stepped within, and without"
"ceremony ascended the stairs. In the house-place, extended on a bed, lay"
"a woman of her own age, dead, her face wearing an expression of the"
utmost agony.
In a low trundle-bed by the side of the other was a little girl of four.

He had just begun to work into a wonderful anecdote about his brother
when the dinner gong rang. Butt told me to scat. He said I was a
"growing tadpole and needed my vitamins. And he mentioned, very"
"off-hand, that he wouldn't at all object if I brought him some fresh"
fruit. It seemed there was nothing but processed foods in the lifeboat
and Butt was used to a farmer's diet.
"Trouble was, he was a special kind of farmer. Ordinary fruit would have"
been pretty easy to sneak into my pockets at meals. I even found a way
"to handle the kelp and giant watercress Mr. Brown liked, but things"
like seaweed salt and Venusian mud-grapes just had too strong a smell.
"Twice, the mechanical hamper refused to accept my jacket for laundering"
and I had to wash it myself. But I learned so many wonderful things
about Venus every time I visited that stowaway....
I learned three wild-wave songs of the Flatfolk and what it is that the
native Venusians hate so much; I learned how you tell the difference
between a lousy government paddlefoot from New Kalamazoo and the
"slaptoe slinker who is the planter's friend. After a lot of begging,"
"Butt Lee Brown explained the workings of his blaster, explained it"
so carefully that I could name every part and tell what it did from
the tiny round electrodes to the long spirals of transformer. But no

"emphatic gesture.  ""The Duchess has changed, and she seeks to use her"
"influence with the Queen to make her change also, and give up her Tory"
advisers altogether.  But she will not succeed.  The Queen may be timid
"and gentle, but she has all her father’s tenacity and obstinacy.  Let my"
Lady of Marlborough look to it!  She may strain the cord to breaking
"point.  Already they say that the new favourite, Mrs. Masham, is ousting"
"her kinswoman, the Duchess, from the foremost place in the Queen’s"
affections.  Favourites have fallen ere this through too great
"arrogance.  The victories of Ramillies and Oudenarde, and the successes"
"that have followed, make the Duke the idol of the nation and the"
"favourite of the Queen yet; but the day may come when this may change,"
"and then the high Tories may come in once more with a rush."""
"""I should be sorry for the Duke to lose favour,"" spoke Grey"
"thoughtfully.  ""I did see him once, and had speech with him after the"
"battle of Ramillies, and a more gracious and courtly gentleman it has"
"never been my lot to meet."""
Suddenly the Old Lion’s eyes flashed fire.
"""You have seen and had speech with the Duke on the field of Ramillies?"
"You saw the battle, or something of it?  Speak!  Tell me all!  I must"
"hear this tale.  It may mean much to us both."""
"""In sooth it is little I can tell you of the battle, for I was in the"
thick of it myself.  It was by accident that my servant and I came upon
the rival armies; and another happy accident gave me the chance of doing
"a small service for the Duke.  After the battle, when we were hard by"

ADMINISTRATION OF MEDICINES
The following methods of administering medicines in order of their
"rapidity of absorption, beginning with the method by which absorption is"
"most rapid, and following with those by which absorption is less rapid"
"and finally least rapid: 1. Intravenous, by injection into veins. 2. By"
"inhalation (volatile drugs). 3. Subcutaneous, by injection into"
"subcutaneous tissue. 4. Intratracheal, by injection into the trachea (or"
"wind pipe). 5. Oral, by the mouth. 6. Rectal, by the rectum. 7."
"Inunction, by the skin. 8. Intramammary injections."
WHEN MEDICINES SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED
"The curative effects of medicines may be restrained, changed in form or"
prevented by untimely administration.
Medicines intended to act on the mucous membrane of the stomach should
only be given when that organ is empty. If distant parts are to be
affected in the most prompt and efficient manner and the medicine is
"""I will undertake that no one of them hath ever been further South than"
"this village of Sarria,"" said Concha, somewhat hastily, and without"
sufficient authority.
Cabrera looked at the papers. There was a Carlist commission in the name
"of Don Rollo Blair duly made out, a letter from General Elio, chief of"
"the staff, commending all the four by name and description to all good"
"servants of Don Carlos, as trustworthy persons engaged on a dangerous"
"and secret mission. Most of all, however, he seemed to be impressed with"
"the ring belonging to Etienne, with its revolving gem and concealed"
portrait of Carlos the Fifth.
"He placed it on his finger and gazing intently, asked to whom it"
"belonged. As soon as he understood, he summoned the little Frenchman to"
"his presence. Etienne came at the word, calm as usual, and twirling his"
moustache in the manner of Rollo.
"""This is your ring?"" he demanded of the prisoner. Concha tried to catch"
Etienne's eye to signal to him that he must give Cabrera that upon which
his fancy had lighted. But her former lover stubbornly avoided her eye.
"""That is my ring,"" he answered dryly, after a cursory inspection of the"
article in question as it lay in the palm of the _guerillero's_ hand.
"""It is very precious to you?"" asked the butcher of Tortosa,"
suggestively.
"""It was given to me by my cousin, the king,"" answered Etienne, briefly."
"""Then I presume you do not care to part with it?"" said Cabrera, turning"
"it about on his finger, and holding it this way and that to the light."
"“And then,” Frank went on, “Dad might take a notion to send an"
"expedition out here to round up these dirty greasers. If he does, I’m"
coming out just on purpose to see them hanged.”
“Cut it out!” advised Jack.
"“Of all the rotten, unwashed specimens of humanity I ever came across,”"
"Frank continued, speaking in a still louder tone, “this escort of ours"
takes the bun. They’re imitation bad-men all right.”
"“A little of that goes a long way, young man,” the leader of the party"
"said. “It makes no difference to me what you say, but several of these"
men understand the English language and can speak it fluently.”
"“I presume so,” returned Frank. “I’ve seen just such a collection as"
"that in jail in New York. Say, honest, Captain,” he went on, “if a bunch"
"like this should run up against the strong-arm squad in New York, they’d"
get their heads beaten off just because of their ugly mugs.”
"“Aw, what’s the use!” demanded Harry."
"By this time several of the guards were casting ugly glances at Frank,"
who seemed to regard their disfavor with great joy.
"“You’d better come on ahead and walk with me, young fellow,” the leader"
"said, taking Frank roughly by the arm and jerking him to a position in"
"front. “If you get back there where those ugly ones are, they’ll put a"
couple of bullets into your back and swear that you were trying to
escape.”
"On his way to the front of the party, Frank passed Jack and paused for a"
"He stopped her at last, and they talked in the half-light, floating"
"along together half dreamily, as if upon the bosom of some great"
current that bore them into strange regions which they dreaded yet
longed to explore.
"They heard a child crying somewhere in the rear of the house, and"
"Chakawana's voice soothing, then in a moment the Indian girl appeared"
in the doorway saying something about going out with Constantine.
"Cherry acquiesced half consciously, impatient of the intrusion."
"For a long time they talked, so completely in concord that for the most"
part their voices were low and their sentences so incomplete that they
would have sounded incoherent and foolish to other ears. They were
roused finally by the appreciation that it had grown very late and a
"storm was brewing. Boyd rose, and going to the door, saw that the sky"
"was deeply overcast, rendering the night as dark as in a far lower"
latitude.
"""I've overstayed my welcome,"" he ventured, and smiled at her answering"
laugh.
"With a trace of solicitude, she said:"
"""Wait! I'll get you a rain-coat,"" but he reached out a detaining hand."
In the darkness it encountered the bare flesh of her arm.
"""Please don't! You'd have to strike a light to find it, and I don't"
"want a light now."""

that he heard her sharp-drawn breath.
himself outside.
There was little to be discerned clearly when he emerged into the cool
"damp darkness, only a dim heap of writhing bodies as in some combat of"
hounds or of the denizens of the midnight forest. But Rollo once and
again saw a flash of steel and a hand uplifted to strike. Without
waiting to think he gripped that which was topmost and therefore nearest
"to him, and finding it unexpectedly light, he swung the thing clear by"
the garment he had clutched. As he did so he felt a pain in his right
"shoulder, which at the time appeared no more than the bite of a squirrel"
"or the sting of a bee. With one heave he threw the object, human or not"
"he could not for the moment determine, behind him into the blackness of"
the hall.

CHAPTER I
The IPV _Arcturus_ Sets Out for Mars
"A narrow football of steel, the Interplanetary Vessel _Arcturus_ stood"
upright in her berth in the dock like an egg in its cup. A hundred feet
"across and a hundred and seventy feet deep was that gigantic bowl, its"
walls supported by the structural steel and concrete of the dock and
Laura found herself besieged by the Englishman; she couldn’t decide to
"discourage him entirely, and at critical moments she would take the"
"train, go off to Naples, and come back two or three days later,"
doubtless with more strength for withstanding the siege.
"“As a matter of reciprocal justice, since he makes love to my sister,"
"I ought to make love to his wife,” thought Cæsar, and he went several"
times to the Hotel Excelsior to call on Susanna.
The Yankee wife was full of complaints against her husband. Her father
"had advised her simply to get a divorce, but she didn’t want to."
"She found such a solution lacking in distinction, and no doubt she"
"considered the advice of an author in her own country very true, who had"
given this triple injunction to the students of a woman’s college: “Do
"not drink, that is, do not drink too much; do not smoke, that is, do not"
"smoke too much; and do not get married, that is, do not get married too"
much.”
It did not seem quite right to Susanna to get married too much. Besides
she had a desire to become a Catholic. One day she questioned Cæsar
about it:
"“You want to change your religion!” exclaimed Cæsar, “What for? I don’t"
believe you are going to find your lost faith by becoming a Catholic.”
"“And what do you think about it, Kennedy?” Susanna asked the young"
"Englishman, who was there too."
“To me a Catholic woman seems doubly enchanting.”
“You would not marry a woman who wasn’t a Catholic?”
"plate. She fears--"""

Germans! The French stuff you up with lies. But we are better than
you think. You shall take them in two--three days to Brussels when
"things are quiet, and put them in some bank. Here I fear I must"
stay. I must intrude myself on your hospitality. But better for you
perhaps if I stay here at present. I will put a few of my men in
your--your--buildings. Most of them shall go with their officers to
"Tervueren for billet."" (Turning to Mrs. Warren.) ""Madam, you must"
cheer up. I foresee your daughter and I will be great friends. Let
us now look through the rooms and see what disposition we can make.

"see you have telephone here. _Gut_!"""
"Leaving Mrs. Warren still seated, but a little less stertorous in"
"breathing, a little reassured, Vivie and Oberst von Giesselin then"
"went over the Villa, apportioning the rooms. The Colonel and his"
orderly would be lodged in two of the bedrooms. Vivie and her mother
would share Mrs. Warren's large bedroom and retain the salon for
their exclusive occupation. They would use the dining-room in common
with their guest.
"Vivie looking out of the windows occasionally, as they passed from"
"room to room, saw the remainder of the soldiery strolling off to be"
"lodged at their nearest neighbour's, the farmer who had driven them"
"in to Brussels that morning. There were perhaps thirty, accompanying"
"a young lieutenant. How would he find room for them, poor man? They"
were more fortunate in being asked only to lodge six or seven in
"addition to the Colonel's orderly and soldier-clerk. Before sunset,"
"the Villa Beau-séjour was clear of soldiers, except the few that had"
gone to the barn and the outhouses. The morning room had been fitted
It was the maid’s turn to look surprised.
"“I didn’t think he was to be here,” she said. “He’s had some—”"
"“Trouble at the office,” supplied Kennedy. “That’s what it was about."
Perhaps he hasn’t been able to get away yet. But I had the appointment.
"Ah, I see a telephone in the hall. May I?”"
"He had stepped politely in, and by dint of cleverly keeping his finger"
"on the hook in the half light, he carried on a one-sided conversation"
with himself long enough to get a good chance to look about.
There was an air of quiet and refinement about the apartment in the
Recherche. It was darkened to give the little glowing electric bulbs in
their silken shades a full chance to simulate right. The deep velvety
"carpets were noiseless to the foot, and the draperies, the pictures,"
"the bronzes, all bespoke taste."
But the chief objects of interest to Craig were the little square green
baize-covered tables on one of which lay neatly stacked a pile of
"gilt-edged cards and a mahogany box full of ivory chips of red, white"
and blue.
"It was none of the old-time gambling places, like Danfield’s, with its"
steel door which Craig had once cut through with an oxyacetylene
blowpipe in order to rescue a young spendthrift from himself.
Kennedy seemed perfectly well satisfied merely with a cursory view of
"the place, as he hung up the receiver and thanked the maid politely for"
allowing him to use it.

"social behavior and make him give himself up. Then he--he--"""

"sigh at the door. ""Then he kissed me! Oh, it was a good enough"
kiss--Mr. Brown has evidently had a varied and colorful background--but
"the galling idiocy of the man, trying that! I was just getting over the"
colossal impudence involved in _his_ proposing marriage--as if _he_ had
"to bear the children!--and was considering the offer seriously, on its"
"merits, as one should consider _all_ suggestions, when he deliberately"
dropped the pretense of reason. He appealed to me as most of the savage
"ancients appealed to their women, as an emotional machine. Throw the"
"correct sexual switches, says this theory, and the female surrenders"
herself ecstatically to the doubtful and bloody murk of masculine
"plans."""

There was a double knock on the door and the Captain walked in without
waiting for an invitation. He was still holding Butt's blaster. He
"pointed it at me. ""Get your hands up, Ferdinand Sparling,"" he said."
I did.
"""I hereby order your detention for the duration of this voyage, for"
"aiding and abetting a stowaway, as set forth in Sections Forty-one and"
"Forty-five--"""
"""Forty-three and Forty-five,"" Sis interrupted him, her eyes getting"
"larger and rounder. ""But you gave me your word of honor that no charges"
"would be lodged against the boy!"""
XVII. EVIL DAYS
"Accompanied by Kennedy, Cæsar called repeatedly on the most auspicious"
"members of the French clerical element living in Rome, and found persons"
"more cultivated than among the rough Spanish monks; but, as was natural,"
nobody gave him any useful information offering the possibility of his
putting his financial talents to the proof.
"“Something must turn up,” he used to say to himself, “and at the least"
opening we will dive into the work.”
Cæsar kept gathering notes about people who had connections in Spain
with the Black party in Rome; he called several times on Father
"Herreros, despite his uncle’s prohibition, and succeeded in getting the"
"monk to write to the Marquesa de Montsagro, asking if there were no"
"means of making Cæsar Moneada, Cardinal Fort’s nephew, Conservative"
Deputy for her district.
The Marquesa wrote back that it was impossible; the Conservative Deputy
for the district was very popular and a man with large properties there.
"When Holy Week was over, Laura and the Countess Brenda and her daughter"
"decided to spend a while at Florence, and invited Cæsar to accompany"
"them; but he was quite out of harmony with the Brenda lady, and said"
that he had to stay on in Rome.
"A few days later Mme. Dawson and her daughters left, and the San"
Martinos and the Marchesa Sciacca; and an avalanche of English people
"and Germans, armed with their red Baedekers, took the hotel by storm."
Susanna Marchmont had gone to spend some days at Corfu.
"""We have one last chance here to deal with this problem. Tomorrow the"
"_oyabun's_ people arrive, and then they will be in control. The"
decisions will no longer be ours. Tonight I attempted to salvage the
"situation and failed. Surely you know what that means, for us both. But"
"if you will give me Vance, perhaps we can both still be saved. If you"
"refuse to cooperate, the _oyabun _will destroy you as well as Vance. We"
"both know that. I am offering you a way out."""
"""With deepest gratitude, I must tell you it is too late, Sato-sama,"
"which I am sure you realize,"" Nogami said, drawing on his cigar and"
"taking care not to disturb the ash. ""So with due respect I must inquire"
"concerning the purpose of this meeting."""
"""I need to locate this man Vance. Before the _kobun _from Tokyo arrive."
"If you care about his well-being, then you should remember that his"
"treatment at my hands will be more understanding than--"""
"""When do they arrive?"""
"""As I said, we received word that they will be here tomorrow, Nogami-"
"san. With respect, you have befriended a man who is attempting to"
"blackmail the Tokyo _oyabun_. That is a career decision which, I assure"
"you, is most unwise."""
"""It is made. And I am aware of the consequences. So it would appear we"
"both know all there is to know about the future."""
"""Perhaps not entirely. Someone has attempted to make us think Vance and"
"the woman were kidnapped, that they are being held somewhere beyond our"
"reach. Perhaps it is true, perhaps it is not. But if the transaction"
"for the hundred million is to take place tomorrow, then he must appear"
"good-sized table, and lays out his materials in front of him. After"
"testing every possible method, the present writer strongly urges the"
"use of individual slips of paper, about 2½ inches by 4 inches. Arranged"
"within easy reach in front of the indexer, but leaving room for the"
"proof-sheets, should be twenty small pasteboard boxes,[48] a little"
larger than the slips themselves.[48] On the inside bottom of each
"box mark a letter of the alphabet, combining O and Q, U and V, and X"
"Y Z. As soon as a slip is written, throw it into its proper box, and"
continue throughout the work. It is a false economy to search out the
"slips for subsequent entries, unless they can be easily found, as it is"
a simple matter at the end to combine the several slips which belong to
the same heading.
"Here are sample slips, showing a heading which requires full entries"
and one to which the text contains fewer references. The first shows a
slip on which the various entries have been combined:
+-------------------------------------------------------+
"| Andastes, the, 5; location and characteristics of,    |"
"|   36; synonyms of, 36; plans for converting, 130;     |"
"|   war with Mohawks, 147; Hurons ask aid from,         |"
"|   162; mortal quarrel with Mohawks, 163; promise      |"
"|   to aid Hurons, 163; Huron fugitives try to reach,   |"
"|   240, 250; Mohawks first to bear brunt of war        |"
"|   with, 268; receive aid from Swedish colonists, 268; |"
"|   attack Senecas, 269; courage their only strength    |"
"|   270; finally overborne by Senecas, 270.             |"

This slip shows the method of indexing a work in more than one volume:

"Silence, intense, sardonic silence had intervened. The three looked at"
one another and made a sour joke about Mandas. Then the black-cap turned
to me.
"""Can you understand Sardinian?"" he said."
"""Somewhat. More than Sicilian, anyhow."""
"""But Sardinian is more difficult than Sicilian. It is full of words"
"utterly unknown to Italian--"""
"""Yes, but,"" say I, ""it is spoken openly, in plain words, and Sicilian is"
"spoken all stuck together, none of the words there at all."""
He looks at me as if I were an imposter. Yet it is true. I find it quite
"easy to understand Sardinian. As a matter of fact, it is more a question"
of human approach than of sound. Sardinian seems open and manly and
"downright. Sicilian is gluey and evasive, as if the Sicilian didn't want"
"to speak straight to you. As a matter of fact, he doesn't. He is an"
"over-cultured, sensitive, ancient soul, and he has so many sides to his"
mind that he hasn't got any definite one mind at all. He's got a dozen
"minds, and uneasily he's aware of it, and to commit himself to anyone of"
them is merely playing a trick on himself and his interlocutor. The
"Sardinian, on the other hand, still seems to have one downright mind. I"
"bump up against a downright, smack-out belief in Socialism, for"
example. The Sicilian is much too old in our culture to swallow
Socialism whole: much too ancient and rusé not to be sophisticated about
any and every belief. He'll go off like a squib: and then he'll smoulder
acridly and sceptically even against his own fire. One sympathizes with
him in retrospect. But in daily life it is unbearable.
"""Where do you find such white bread?"" say I to the black cap, because he"
"What a coincidence: another barn on my road, just as in the days of the"
golden horn! It offers me plenty of straw and shelter for the night; but
"where is the girl who gave me the letter? How warm her breath was, coming"
"between lips a little parted! She will come again, of course; let us wait,"
"we have plenty of time, another twenty years--oh, yes, she will come...."
I must be on my guard against such traps. I have entered upon the
honorable years; I am weak and quite capable of believing that a barn is a
"gift from above: thou well-deserving old man, here is a barn for thee!"
"No, thank you, I'm only just in my seventies."
And so in my errand of the head I pass by the barn.
Toward morning I find shelter under a projecting crag. It is fitting that
"I should live under crags hereafter, and I lie down in a huddle, small and"
"invisible. Anything else you please, as long as you don't flaunt your"
selfishness and your rags!
"I am comfortable now, lying with my head on another person's knapsack full"
of used clothes; I am doing this solely because it is just the right size.
But sleep will not come; there are only thoughts and dreams and lines of
"poetry and sentimentality. The sack smells human, and I fling it away,"
laying my head on my arm. My arm smells of wood--not even wood.
But the slip of paper with the address--have I got the address? And I
scratch a match to read it through and know it by heart tomorrow. Just a
"line in pencil, nothing; but perhaps there is a softness in the letters, a"
womanliness--I don't know.
It doesn't matter.
"“In return,” said he, “I hope you will allow me to send in some jellies"
"and fruits, or appliances, or whatever may be of pleasure or comfort to"
the child.”
"“Whatever you send her that is practical shall be applied to her use,”"
said the Sister superintendent.
"She was cold, unemotional; no smile, no ghost even of departed smiles,"
"seemed ever to visit the tired, gray eyes or the corners of the rigid"
mouth; coif and face and thin hands were spotless. She did not even
thank him for his forced gift to the orphanage.
"“I should like to know,” said John, regarding her beneath frowning"
"brows, “whether any one here loves the unhappy little wretch.”"
"“These children,” replied the Sister superintendent, “have naturally a"
hard battle to fight when they go from here into the world. They come
"mostly from vicious classes. Their training is uniformly kind, but it"
has to be austere.”
John rose. “I will bring what things I can think of to-morrow.”
"The Sister superintendent rose, too, and bowed icily. “You are at"
"liberty to do so, Mr. Risca; but I assure you there is no reason for"
your putting yourself to the trouble. In the circumstances I can readily
understand your solicitude; but again I say you have no cause for it.”
"“Madam,” said he, “I see that I have more cause than ever.”"
"The next day he drove to the orphanage in a cab, with a hamper of"
delicacies and a down pillow. The latter the Sister superintendent
speak; but finding nothing epigrammatic enough to say--and an epigram
alone would have saved the situation--he planted a carefully cut cigar
"between the parted lips aforesaid, and deliberately struck a match."
"“Your idea, John,” said Lady Blount, aware of victory, “is preposterous."
What would Stella do without you?”
"“Yes,” said Sir Oliver, after lighting his cigar; “Stella has to be"
considered before everything.”
Risca frowned on the unblushing turncoat. Stella! Stella! Everything
"was Stella. Here were three ordinary, sane, grown-up people seriously"
putting forward the proposition that he had no right to go and mend his
own broken life in his own fashion because he happened to be the favored
playmate of a little invalid girl!
"On the one side was the driving force of Furies of a myriad hell-power,"
and on the other the disappointment of Stella Blount. It was ludicrous.
"Even Walter Herold, who had a sense of humour, did not see the grotesque"
incongruity. Risca frowned upon each in turn--upon three serene faces
smilingly aware of the absurd. Was it worth while trying to convince
them?
"“Our dear friends are quite right, John,” said Herold. “What would"
become of Stella if you went away?”
"“None of you seems to consider what would happen to me if I stayed,”"
"said John, in the quiet tone of a man who is talking to charming but"
"unreasonable children. “It will go to my heart to leave Stella, more"
"than any of you can realize; but to Australia I go, and there's an end"
of it.”
"Lynn Moulton made no fight and Kennedy did not pursue the case, for,"
"with the rescue of Antoinette Moulton, his interest ceased."
"Blackmail takes various forms, and the Moulton affair was only one"
phase of it. It was not long before we had to meet a much stranger
attempt.
"“Read the letter, Professor Kennedy. Then I will tell you the sequel.”"
Mrs. Hunter Blake lay back in the cushions of her invalid chair in the
"sun parlor of the great Blake mansion on Riverside Drive, facing the"
Hudson with its continuous reel of maritime life framed against the
green-hilled background of the Jersey shore.
"Her nurse, Miss Dora Sears, gently smoothed out the pillows and"
adjusted them so that the invalid could more easily watch us. Mrs.
"Blake, wealthy, known as a philanthropist, was not an old woman, but"
had been for years a great sufferer from rheumatism.
"I watched Miss Sears eagerly. Full-bosomed, fine of face and figure,"
she was something more than a nurse; she was a companion. She had
"bright, sparkling black eyes and an expression about her well-cut mouth"
which made one want to laugh with her. It seemed to say that the world
was a huge joke and she invited you to enjoy the joke with her.
"Kennedy took the letter which Miss Sears proffered him, and as he did"
"so I could not help noticing her full, plump forearm on which gleamed a"
handsome plain gold bracelet. He spread the letter out on a dainty
wicker table in such a way that we both could see it.
"""Don't be afraid, Sidney,"" Mart spoke calmly. ""You sort o' belong to"
the Cape and we Cape folks don't think anything of drowning. We sort of
"expect to, sometime--"" But here her voice broke with a tremble. ""I--I"
was thinking of gran'ma. I wish I'd been better to her. I talk back to
"her lots of times when I shouldn't."""
"""But you _are_ good to her, Mart. And--_I_ was thinking of Aunt Achsa."
I shouldn't have deceived her--about coming out here. I fooled myself
into thinking that even a lie didn't matter considering what we were
trying to do. But the honor of Cape Cod isn't worth anything happening
to Lav. And if anything does happen there won't be anyone to tell about
"Jed Starrow, anyway! Oh, Mart, I can't bear to _think_ about Lav. Why"
"did we let him do it? Dear old Lav. I've been mean to him, too. He"
adores poetry and I--I never even told him that my father was a poet
and that I know lots and lots of poems and--and--that I've written most
"a book myself."""
"""Honest, Sid, was your father a poet? And you can write it yourself?"
"Gee,"" softly. ""I wish I could do something like that. I'd rather be"
like that than anything else. I just pretend that I hate school and
books and such things--it's because I had to stop going to school to
stay with gran'ma that I've put on that I didn't have any use for it.
"Even when I was sort of laughing at you, Sid, down in my heart I was"
feeling aw'fly proud that you'd want to fool 'round with anyone like
"me--I'll _always_ be proud."""
"""Oh, Mart--"" Sidney faltered. ""I wish I could put into words what Mr."
Dugald taught me when I first came here. That it's the big inside
things that really count. He told me so's I'd see Aunt Achsa and Lav as
"they really are. And, Mart, your giving up school to take care of your"
"grandmother is a big thing, a real thing! You don't want to forget it."""
FAMILY 225. GOODENIACEAE
"Shrubs or trees. Juice not milky. Leaves alternate, undivided, without"
"stipules. Flowers in axillary cymes, irregular, hermaphrodite. Calyx"
"truncate or 5-toothed. Corolla 5-lobed, slit open behind, with folded"
"aestivation. Stamens 5, alternating with the corolla-lobes, free from"
"the corolla. Anthers free, turned inwards. Ovary inferior, 2-celled."
"Ovules solitary in each cell, erect. Style simple. Stigma capitate,"
surrounded by a fringed cup. Fruit a drupe. Seeds with fleshy albumen;
embryo straight.
"Genus 1, species 2. Tropical and South Africa. They yield wood for"
"carpenters’ work, pith used in the manufacture of paper, vegetables,"
and medicaments. =Scaevola= L.
FAMILY 226. COMPOSITAE
"Leaves simple and exstipulate, but sometimes dissected or provided"
with stipule-like auricles. Flowers seated upon a dilated or elevated
receptacle and arranged in sometimes spike-like or one-flowered
heads which are surrounded by an involucre. Heads either containing
"only hermaphrodite flowers, several of which are sometimes sterile"
"(male), or consisting of hermaphrodite or male central (disc-) flowers"
"and female or neuter marginal (ray-) flowers, more rarely heads"
unisexual or reduced to a single flower. Calyx-limb (pappus) formed
"of sometimes connate scales or hairs, fully developed only in fruit,"
"or wanting. Corolla of united petals, in the hermaphrodite and male"
"flowers 3-5-lobed with valvate aestivation, regular (tube-, funnel-,"
"or bell-shaped) or 2-lipped or 1-lipped (strap-shaped), in the female"
of the people settled down to a lively _conversazione_. It is much
"nicest, on the whole, to travel third class on the railway. There is"
"space, there is air, and it is like being in a lively inn, everybody in"
good spirits.
At our end was plenty of room. Just across the gangway was an elderly
"couple, like two children, coming home very happily. He was fat, fat all"
"over, with a white moustache and a little not-unamiable frown. She was a"
"tall lean, brown woman, in a brown full-skirted dress and black apron,"
"with huge pocket. She wore no head covering, and her iron grey hair was"
parted smoothly. They were rather pleased and excited being in the
"train. She took all her money out of her big pocket, and counted it and"
"gave it to him: all the ten Lira notes, and the five Lira and the two"
"and the one, peering at the dirty scraps of pink-backed one-lira notes"
to see if they were good. Then she gave him her half-pennies. And he
"stowed them away in the trouser pocket, standing up to push them down"
"his fat leg. And then one saw, to one's amazement, that the whole of his"
"shirt-tail was left out behind, like a sort of apron worn backwards."
"Why--a mystery. He was one of those fat, good-natured, unheeding men"
"with a little masterful frown, such as usually have tall, lean,"
"hard-faced, obedient wives."
They were very happy. With amazement he watched us taking hot tea from
the Thermos flask. I think he too had suspected it might be a bomb. He
had blue eyes and standing-up white eyebrows.
"""Beautiful hot--!"" he said, seeing the tea steam. It is the inevitable"
"exclamation. ""Does it do you good?"""
"""Yes,"" said the q-b. ""Much good."" And they both nodded complacently."
They were going home.
and Francesco loosened the sword in the scabbard anticipating an
"ambush, when he pushed it back with a puzzled look. Before a wayside"
"shrine, almost entirely concealed by weeds, there knelt a grotesque"
figure at orisons. He either had not heard the tramp of Francesco's
"steed, or ignored it on purpose, for not until the latter called to"
"him did he turn, and with much relief Francesco recognized his former"
guide from the camp of the Duke of Spoleto.
"""Where is the camp of the duke?"" he queried curtly, impatient with the"
man's exhibition of secular godliness.
"""Many miles away,"" replied he of the goat's-beard, as he arose and"
kissed a little holly-wood cross that he carried.
"""Lead me to it!"""
"The godly little man flopped again, scraped some dust together with"
"his two hands, spat upon it, then smeared his forehead with the stuff,"
uttering the names of sundry saints.
Francesco had come to the end of his patience.
"""Get up, my friend,"" he said, ""we have had enough praying for one"
"day!"""
"The goatherd offered to anoint him with dust and spittle, pointing a"
"stumpy forefinger, but Francesco was filled with disgust. He caught"
the man by the girdle and lifted him to his feet.
"""Enough of this!"" he said. ""Is the devil so much your master?"""
"The goatherd blinked red-lidded and pious eyes, while he scanned the"
"""Then my name can't seem very odd to you, Miss Graham!"""
She was regarding me as though trying to discover what kind of a species
"I was that had got on her father's yacht, when the sailor came back"
followed by a husky brute in uniform. Intuitively I stiffened to meet
"the crisis, but even at this eleventh hour a respite came."
"""He ain't aboard,"" the other Jack whispered, and the captain--for the"
"burly one was only the captain, after all--saluted, saying:"
"""I've just now found out, ma'am, he ain't aboard!"""
"""Not aboard? What do you mean?"""
"""After bringing you on last night he went ashore again to get a little"
below was the bed-chamber of as many more.
"Cast back upon his own thoughts, Rollo reviewed many things--his short"
"life, the reckless ups-and-downs in which he had spent it--but all"
without remorse or regret.
"""I might have been a lawyer, and lived to a hundred!"" he said to"
"himself. ""It is better as it is. If I have done little good, perhaps I"
"have not had time to do a great deal of harm."""
"Then very contentedly he curled himself up to sleep as best he might,"
only dreamily wondering if little Concha would be sorry when she heard.
Ramon Garcia sat with his eyes fixed on the sentry who had ceased his
"to-and-fro tramp up the centre, and now leaned gloomily against the"
"wall, his hands crossed about the cross-bar of his sword-bayonet."
THE HAT OF THE _HULDRES_
"Once upon a time there was a big wedding at a certain farmstead, and a"
certain cottager was on his way to the wedding-feast. As he chanced to
"cross a field, he found a milk-strainer, such as are usually made of"
"cows' tails, and looking just like an old brown rag. He picked it up,"
"for he thought it could be washed, and then he would give it to his"
wife for a dish-rag. But when he came to the house where they were
"celebrating the wedding, it seemed as though no one saw him. The bride"
"and groom nodded to the rest of the guests, they spoke to them and"
poured for them; but he got neither greeting nor drink. Then the chief
cook came and asked the other folk to sit down to the table; but he was
"not asked, nor did he get anything to eat. For he did not care to sit"
down of his own accord when no one had asked him. At last he grew angry
"and thought: ""I might as well go home, for not a soul pays a bit of"
"attention to me here."" When he reached home, he said: ""Good evening,"
"here I am back again."""
"""For heaven's sake, are you back again?"" asked his wife."
"""Yes, there was no one there who paid any attention to me, or even so"
"much as looked at me,"" said the man, ""and when people show me so little"
"consideration, it seems as though I have nothing to look for there."""
"""But where are you? I can hear you, but I cannot see you!"" cried his"
wife.
"The man was invisible, for what he had found was a _huldre_ hat."
"""What are you talking about? Can't you see me? Have you lost your wits?"""
CHAPTER XX.
THE LAW _VERSUS_ RULE 3.
Among the many tired but satisfied lovers of liberty who sought their
"houses that night, while an enthusiastic remnant was still parading the"
"streets, illuminations yet shining from windows, and weary police"
"treading their unending beats, was the doorkeeper, who had borne a"
banner in Company A of Procession 1. His friend the watchmaker came with
"him, to have a bit of supper and exchange congratulations and"
"fulminations. Hardly, however, had the doorkeeper pledged the cause in a"
first draught when his wife broke in on his oration by handing him a
"letter, which she said a boy in a blue jersey had left for him about ten"
"o'clock in the morning, just after he had started to join his company."
The envelope was cheap and coarse; there was no direction outside. The
doorkeeper opened it. It was addressed to no named person and it bore no
"signature. It was very brief, being confined to these simple words--""You"
"did not see me last night. Remember Rule 3."""
"The doorkeeper laid the letter down, with a hurried glance at his"
"friend, whose face was buried in a mug. He knew the handwriting; he knew"
"who it was that he had not seen; he remembered Rule 3, the rule that"
"said--""The only and inevitable penalty of treachery is death."" He turned"
white and took a hasty gulp at his liquor.
"""Who brought this?"" he asked."
"""I told you,"" answered his wife; ""a lad in a blue jersey; he looked as"
"if he might be from the harbour."" She put food before them, adding as"
two-franc piece in change as I paid the admission fees to see certain
paintings and sculptures behind the high altar.
"However, I am wandering from my subject; I may conclude my eulogy"
"on the baby above mentioned by saying that, young as she is, she"
sits through the seventy or eighty minutes of the customary tedious
"European dinner almost as circumspectly as a graven image might, but"
reminding us of one of Raphael's cherubs in her blue-eyed combination
"of sweetness, archness and dignity."
Next time we will resume our account of matters of more general
interest.
CHAPTER XXIX.
"RELICS IN GENERAL, AND THE IRON CROWN OF LOMBARDY IN PARTICULAR."
"ROME, _December 23, 1902_."
I had heard of relics before. Years ago I had read Mark Twain's account
of the large piece of the true cross which he had seen in a church in
the Azores; and of another piece which he had seen in the Cathedral
"of Notre Dame in Paris, besides some nails of the true cross and a"
part of the crown of thorns; and of the marble chest in the Cathedral
"of San Lorenzo at Genoa, which he was told contained the ashes of St."
"John, and was wound about with the chain that had confined St. John"
when he was in prison; and of the interesting collection shown him in
"the Cathedral of Milan, including two of St. Paul's fingers and one"
the table-cloth.
... But one day I managed to get a pair of scissors and—would you
"believe it, madam? I cut off all my hair; snipped it off all in bits,"
like the little monkey I was. Grandfather was _furious_! He caught hold
of the tongs—I shall never forget it—grabbed me by the hand and shut my
fingers in them. “That’ll teach you!” he said. It was a fearful burn.
I’ve got the mark of it to-day.
"... Well, you see, madam, he’d taken such pride in my hair. He used to"
"sit me up on the counter, before the customers came, and do it"
"something beautiful—big, soft curls and waved over the top. I remember"
"the assistants standing round, and me ever so solemn with the penny"
grandfather gave me to hold while it was being done.... But he always
"took the penny back afterwards. Poor grandfather! Wild, he was, at the"
fright I’d made of myself. But he frightened me that time. Do you know
"what I did, madam? I ran away. Yes, I did, round the corners, in and"
"out, I don’t know how far I didn’t run. Oh, dear, I must have looked a"
"sight, with my hand rolled up in my pinny and my hair sticking out."
People must have laughed when they saw me....
"... No, madam, grandfather never got over it. He couldn’t bear the"
"sight of me after. Couldn’t eat his dinner, even, if I was there. So my"
"aunt took me. She was a cripple, an upholstress. Tiny! She had to stand"
on the sofas when she wanted to cut out the backs. And it was helping
her I met my lady....
"... Not so very, madam. I was thirteen, turned. And I don’t remember"
"ever feeling—well—a child, as you might say. You see there was my"
"uniform, and one thing and another. My lady put me into collars and"
cuffs from the first. Oh yes—once I did! That was—funny! It was like
this. My lady had her two little nieces staying with her—we were at
"dairy--I have a kitchen. Milk the goats here, I command you, nowhere but"
"here!"""
"And thrusting the bucket into the old woman's hand, she watched"
carefully and eagerly as La Giralda pressed the milk downwards in
hissing streams. The she-goat operated upon expressed her gratitude by
turning to lick the hand which relieved her.
At this the little girl danced with delight.
"""It looks so easy--I could do it myself! I am sure of it. I tell you,"
"Susana, I will do it. Stand still, _cabra_! Do you not know that I am"
"Isabel the Second, Queen of all the Spains!"""
"But the she-goat, having no very strong monarchial sentiments, or"
"perhaps being inclined to Carlist opinions, as soon as she felt the grip"
of unaccustomed fingers promptly kicked over in the dust the Queen of
all the Spains.
The little girl had not time to gather herself up or even to emit the
"howl of disappointment and anger which hovered upon her lips, before her"
attendant rushed at her with pitiful cries:
"""Oh, the wicked goat! The devil-possessed emblem of Satan! Let it be"
slain! Did not your poor Susana warn you to have nothing to do with such
"evil things--thus to overturn in the dust the best, the sweetest, the"
"noblest of Princesses!"""
"But the best and sweetest of Princesses, having violent objections to"
"being gathered up into the capacious embrace of her nurse, especially"
"before company, vigorously objected in much the same manner as the goat"
"had done, and at last compelled Doña Susana to deposit her once more on"
"""I can not trust you,"" he said again, ""nor can I turn back. But there"
is one thing from the past which can not be changed. I love you. It
seems that must remain through all my life. And because of that love I
"must save you from the death that awaits your countrymen."" He smiled"
"in faint self-contempt. ""It is not for your sake that I shall save"
"you; it is because I am too great a coward, and can not face the"
"thought that anything so horrible should come near you."" He turned to"
two native soldiers behind him and gave an order. When he faced
Beatrice again he saw that she held a revolver in her hand.
"""You do not understand,"" she said. ""You say you mean to save me, but"
"that is not in your power. It is in your power to save us all, but not"
"one alone. I know what my people have resolved to do. There are weak,"
"frightened women among them, but not one of them will fall into your"
"hands alive. Whatever happens, I shall share their fate."""
"Though her tone was quiet and free from all bravado, he knew that she"
"was not boasting. He knew, too, that she was desperate."
"""You can not force me to kill you,"" he said sternly."
"""I think it possible,"" she answered. She was breathing quickly, and"
"her eyes were bright with a reckless, feverish excitement. But the"
hand that held the revolver pointed at the men behind him was
steady--steadier than his own.
Nehal Singh motioned back the two natives who had advanced at his
order.
"""You play a dangerous game,"" he said, ""and, as before, your strength"
lies in my weakness--in my folly. But this time you can not win. My
Kuvalda in such cases came to their assistance with his philosophy.
"""Don't lose your temper, brothers, everything has an end, this is the"
"chief characteristic of life.  The winter will pass, summer will follow"
"... a glorious time, when the very sparrows are filled with rejoicing."""
But his speeches did not have any effect--a mouthful of even the
freshest and purest water will not satisfy a hungry man.
Deacon Taras also tried to amuse the people by singing his songs and
"relating his tales.  He was more successful, and sometimes his"
endeavours ended in a wild and glorious orgy at the eating-house.  They
"sang, laughed and danced, and for hours behaved like madmen.  After"
"this they again fell into a despairing mood, sitting at the tables of"
"the eating-house, in the black smoke of the lamp and the tobacco; sad"
"and tattered, speaking lazily to each other, listening to the wild"
"howling of the wind, and thinking how they could get enough vodki to"
deaden their senses.
"And their hand was against every man, and every man's hand against them."
PART II.
"All things are relative in this world, and a man cannot sink into any"
"condition so bad that it could not be worse. One day, towards the end"
"of September, Captain Aristid Kuvalda was sitting, as was his custom,"
"on the bench near the door of the dosshouse, looking at the stone"
building built by the merchant Petunikoff close to Vaviloff's
"eatinghouse, and thinking deeply.  This building, which was partly"
"surrounded by woods, served the purpose of a candle factory."
"The sun is already setting. Far up the mountainside are the cattle, but"
they are moving homeward now; I can hear by their bells that they are
"moving. Tinkling bells and deep-mouthed bells, sometimes sounding together"
"as though there were a meaning in it, a pattern of tones, a rapture."
"And rapture, too, to see all the blades of grass and the tiny flowers and"
"plants. Beside me where I lie is a small pod plant, wonderfully meek, with"
"tiny seeds pushing out of the pod--God bless it, it's becoming a mother!"
It has got caught in a dry twig and I liberate it. Life quivers within it;
"the sun has warmed it today and called it to its destiny. A tiny, gigantic"
miracle.
"Now it is sunset, and the woods bend under a rustling that passes"
through them sweet and heavy; it is the evening.
"I lie for another hour or two; the birds have long since gone to rest, and"
"darkness falls thick and soft.... As I walk homeward, my feet feel their"
"way and I hold my hands before me till I reach the field, where it is a"
little lighter. I walk on the hay that has been left outdoors; it is tough
"and black, and I slip on it because it is already rotting. As I approach"
"the houses, bats fly noiselessly past me, as though on wings of foam. A"
slight shudder convulses me whenever they pass.
Suddenly I stop.
A man is walking here. I can see him against the wall of the new house. He
"has on a coat that looks like the actor's raincoat, but it is not the"
"little comedian himself. There he goes, into the house, right into the"
house. It is Solem.
"""Why, that's where she sleeps!"" I think. ""Ah, well. Alone in the building,"
"in the south wing, Miss Torsen alone--yes, quite alone. And Solem has just"
"defenders, roused from their feast of blood, had poured all their"
"defences towards the point of attack, leaving the northern slope to"
look to itself.
As they rode down the ravine there came from the bottom of the valley
the sharp yelp of a dog. It was instantly answered by a similar bark
from the very top of the castello.
"""No two dogs ever had the same voice,"" the duke turned to Francesco."
"""They must be hell-hounds, whom the fiend has trained to one tune. But"
"what is that yonder? A goat picking its way?"""
"""A goat walking on its hind legs!"""
"""Are there horns on its head?"""
"""No!""--"
"""Then it is not the Evil One! Forward, my men!"""
The pause that preceded the breaking of the storm had been unnaturally
"long. Save for the gleam of the lightnings, the waters had grown to an"
"inky blackness. There came one long moment, when the atmosphere sank"
under the weight of a sudden heat. Then the ever increasing thunder
"rushed upon the silence with a mighty roar and out of the west, driven"
"by the hurricane, came a long line of white waves, that rose as they"
"advanced, till the very Tritons beat their heads and the nymphs"
scurried down to greener depths.
"And now a sudden streak of fire hissed from the clouds, followed by a"
crash as if all the bolts of heaven had been let off at once. From the
"ramparts of Astura came cries of alarm, the din of battle, the blaring"
punishment for your impertinence in opening my friend Copplestone's
"private letters. You have had the lesson; profit by it."""
"Dawson flushed angrily. ""Punishment! Impertinence! This to me!"""
"""Yes,"" returned the Admiral stiffly, ""beastly impertinence."""
CHAPTER IV
SABOTAGE
Dawson showed no malice towards the Admiral or myself for our
treatment of him. I do not think that he felt any; he was too fully
occupied in collecting the spoils of victory to trouble his head about
what a Scribbler or a Salt Horse might think of him. He gathered to
himself every scrap of credit which the affair could be induced to
"yield, and received--I admit quite deservedly--the most handsome"
encomiums from his superiors in office. During the two weeks he passed
in my city after the capture--weeks occupied in tracing out the
threads connecting his wretch of a prisoner with the German agents
"upon what Dawson called his ""little list""--he paid several visits both"
to my house and my office. His happiness demanded that he should read
to me the many letters which poured in from high officials of the
"C.I.D., from the Chief Commissioner, and on one day--a day of days in"
the chronicles of Dawson--from the Home Secretary himself. To me it
seemed that all these astute potentates knew their Dawson very
"thoroughly, and lubricated, as it were, with judicious flattery the"
machinery of his energies. I could not but admire Dawson's truly royal
"“Runs through a pass, foolish!” answered Jack."
"“But there’s no break in the formation,” Frank insisted."
“Then it runs through a tunnel manufactured by itself!” Jack explained.
"“Anyway, it gets out somehow.”"
“What a dandy place to catch mountain trout!” shouted Harry.
fourteen hours at a stretch. They must be swift as lightning in their
"movements, and possessed of judgment, ability, and nerve."
"It was impossible, of course, for Bob to pick out an ideal rear crew"
from merely having seen the men in action for a scant few minutes. He
"did not try. He simply used his very excellent judgment, reserving"
"mentally the right to change his mind whenever he felt like it, and"
juggle the men around as he chose.
"The principal necessity was to start things moving. When he had done so,"
Bainbridge returned to camp with the twofold object of giving the cook
"his orders, and having a final settlement with Schaeffer. The latter was"
"not particularly pleasant, but it was important. The man must quit the"
crew at once. Bob had made up his mind not to let the fellow spend even
the night where he would have a chance to talk with and perhaps
"influence the others. With this determination uppermost, he passed by"
"the mess tent to the other where the men slept, pulled aside the flap,"
and stepped inside.
"The place was a mess of blankets and half-dried clothes, but to Bob’s"
surprise it was vacant of anything in the nature of a man. Evidently
"Schaeffer had recovered and vamoosed. Thoughtfully he sought the cook,"
and put the question.
"""Nehal--turn back! Turn back!"""
He did not understand her. He thought she was still pleading with him.
"""I can not--God have pity on us both!"""
Then she too set her lips. She could not betray the last hope of that
heroic handful of men and women behind her. He must go to his
"death--and she to hers. She fired,--whether with success or not, she"
never knew. In that same instant another sound broke upon their
"ears--the sound of distant firing, the rattle of drums and the high"
clear call of a trumpet. Nehal Singh swung around. She caught a
"glimpse of his face through the smoke, and she saw something written"
there which she could not understand. She only knew that his features
"seemed to bear a new familiarity, as though a mask had been torn from"
"them, revealing the face of another man, of a man whom she had seen"
"before, when and where she could not tell. She had no time to analyze"
her emotions nor the sense of violent shock which passed over her. She
"heard Nehal Singh giving sharp, rapid orders in Hindustani. The room"
emptied. She saw him follow the retreating natives. At the door he
turned and looked back at her. At no time had his love for her
revealed itself more clearly than in that last glance.
"""The English regiment has come to help you,"" he said. ""Fate has"
"intervened between us this time. May we never meet again!"""
"He passed out through the shattered doorway, but she stood where he"
"had left her, motionless, almost unconscious. It was thus Nicholson"
"and the Colonel found her when, a moment later, they entered the room"
by the verandah. Colonel Carmichael's passionate reproaches died away
as he saw her face.
within his lines.
"But at the sight of little Concha, her dark eyes full of light, her"
"hands clapping together in innocent delight, her white teeth disclosed"
"in gay and dainty laughter, a certain _maja_ note of daring unconvention"
"in her costume, she was so exactly all that would have sent him into"
"raptures twenty years before when he was an apprentice in Tortosa, that"
the grim man only smiled and turned again to the unwilling spokesman of
the municipality of Sarria.
A voice from the press before the burning house announced the delegate's
quality.
"""Don Raphael de Flores, son of our _alcalde_."""
"""Speak on, Don Raphael,"" cried Cabrera; ""I will not shoot you unless it"
"should be necessary."""
Thus encouraged the trembling youth began.
"""Your Excellency,"" he quavered, ""we of Sarria have nothing to do with"
the family of Fernandez. We would not give any one of them a handful of
maize or a plate of lentil broth if he were starving. We are loyal men
and women--well-wishers to the cause of the only true and absolute King
"Carlos Quinto."""
"""I am credibly informed that it is otherwise,"" said Cabrera, ""and that"
you are a den of red-hot nationals. I therefore impose a fine of two
"thousand _duros_ on the municipality, and as you are the alcalde's son,"
"we will keep you in durance till they be paid."""
Don Raphael fell on his knees. His pale face was reddened by the flames
"""Yes, we were fortunate in getting such good ones."""
"""You were fortunate in many ways. In fact you are a very lucky young"
"man."""
"""Indeed! How?"""
"""Well, don't you think you were lucky to beat that strike?"""
"""It wasn't altogether luck. However, I do consider myself fortunate in"
"escaping at the last moment,"" Boyd laughed easily. ""By the way, what"
"happened to the man they mistook for me?"""
"""Let him go, I believe. I didn't pay much attention to the matter."""
"Marsh had been using his eyes to good advantage, and, seeing the work"
"even better in hand than he had supposed, he was moved by irritation"
and the desire to goad his opponent to say more than he had intended:
"""I rather think you will have a lot to explain, one of these days,"" he"
"said, with deliberate menace."
"""With fifty thousand cases of salmon aboard _The Bedford Castle_ I will"
"explain anything. Meanwhile the police may go to the devil!"" The cool"
assurance of the young man's tone roused his would-be tormentor like a
personal affront.
"""You got away from Seattle, but there is a commissioner at Dutch"
"Harbor, also a deputy marshal, who may have better success with a"
"warrant than those policemen had."" The Trust's manager could not keep"
"down the angry tremor in his voice, and the other, perceiving it,"
replied in a manner designed to inflame him still more:
"""Yes, I have heard of those officers. I understand they are both in"
"""The Magic Apples"" (_Norske Eventyr og Sagn_, optegnet av Sophus"
"Bugge og Rikard Berge, Christiania, 1909, p. 61) is probably a"
somewhat original version of one of the cycles of tales in which
"people acquire asses' ears, long noses, humped backs and other"
"adornments, through eating some enchanted fruit. The British Isles"
"are believed to be the home-land of this tale, and it is thought"
to have emigrated to Scandinavia by way of France and Germany.
XIV
SELF DID IT
"Once upon a time there was a mill, in which it was impossible to grind"
"flour, because such strange things kept happening there. But there was a"
"poor woman who was in urgent need of a little meal one evening, and she"
asked whether they would not allow her to grind a little flour during
"the night. ""For heaven's sake,"" said the mill-owner, ""that is quite"
"impossible! There are ghosts enough in the mill as it is."" But the woman"
said that she must grind a little; for she did not have a pinch of flour
"in the house with which to make mush, and there was nothing for her"
children to eat. So at last he allowed her to go to the mill at night
"and grind some flour. When she came, she lit a fire under a big"
"tar-barrel that was standing there; got the mill going, sat down by the"
"fire, and began to knit. After a time a girl came in and nodded to her."
"""Good evening!"" said she to the woman. ""Good evening!"" said the woman;"
"kept her seat, and went on knitting. But then the girl who had come in"
began to pull apart the fire on the hearth. The woman built it up again.
Even Aileen had not been shot at with a pistol. And then Tildy rather
"hoped that he would not shoot at her, for she was always loyal to"
Aileen; and she did not want to overshadow her friend.
At 4 o’clock on the afternoon of the third day Mr. Seeders came in.
There were no customers at the tables. At the back end of the
restaurant Tildy was refilling the mustard pots and Aileen was
quartering pies. Mr. Seeders walked back to where they stood.
"Tildy looked up and saw him, gasped, and pressed the mustard spoon"
against her heart. A red hair-bow was in her hair; she wore Venus’s
"Eighth Avenue badge, the blue bead necklace with the swinging silver"
symbolic heart.
Mr. Seeders was flushed and embarrassed. He plunged one hand into his
hip pocket and the other into a fresh pumpkin pie.
"“Miss Tildy,” said he, “I want to apologise for what I done the other"
"evenin’. Tell you the truth, I was pretty well tanked up or I wouldn’t"
of done it. I wouldn’t do no lady that a-way when I was sober. So I
"hope, Miss Tildy, you’ll accept my ’pology, and believe that I wouldn’t"
of done it if I’d known what I was doin’ and hadn’t of been drunk.”
"With this handsome plea Mr. Seeders backed away, and departed, feeling"
that reparation had been made.
But behind the convenient screen Tildy had thrown herself flat upon a
"table among the butter chips and the coffee cups, and was sobbing her"
heart out—out and back again to the grey plain wherein travel they with
blunt noses and hay-coloured hair. From her knot she had torn the red
hair-bow and cast it upon the floor. Seeders she despised utterly; she
had but taken his kiss as that of a pioneer and prophetic prince who
"""Everyman can WILL his own destiny,""--returned Alwyn firmly. ""That is"
"just it. But here we are getting into a serious discussion, and I had"
"determined to talk no more on such subjects till to-night."""
"""And to-night we are to go in for them thoroughly, I"
"suppose?""--inquired Villiers with a quick look. ""To-night, my dear boy,"
"you will have to decide whether you consider me mad or sane,"" said"
"Alwyn cheerfully--""I shall tell you truths that seem like romances--and"
"facts that sound like fables,--moreover, I shall have to assure you"
"that miracles DO happen whenever God chooses, in spite of all human"
denial of their possibility. Do you remember Whately's clever
skit--'Historical Doubts of Napoleon I'?--showing how easy it was to
logically prove that Napoleon never existed?--That ought to enlighten
"people as to the very precise and convincing manner in which we can, if"
"we choose, argue away what is nevertheless an incontestible FACT. Thus"
do skeptics deny miracles--yet we live surrounded by miracles! ... do
"you think me crazed for saying so?"""
"Villiers laughed. ""Crazed! No, indeed!--I wish every man in London were"
"as sane and sound as you are!"""
"""Ah, but wait till to-night!"" and Alwyn's eyes sparkled"
"mirthfully--""Perhaps you will alter your opinion then!""--Here,"
"collecting his scattered manuscripts, he put them by--""I've done work"
"for the present,""--he said--""Shall we go for a walk somewhere?"""
"Villiers assented, and they left the room together."
CHAPTER XXXV.
"his side, with relaxed, enormous limbs, on the hearth-rug, lifted his"
"massive head for a second and glanced at John. Then with a half-grunt,"
"half-sigh, he dropped his head, and twitched his limbs and went to sleep"
again.
"“Now and then when you 're not looking at me,” said Stellamaris, “there"
is a strange look in your eyes: it is when you 're not speaking and you
stare out of window without seeming to see anything.”
For a moment Risca was assailed by a temptation to break the Unwritten
"Law and tell her something of his misery. She, with her superfine"
"intelligence, would understand, and her sympathy would be sweet. But he"
put the temptation roughly from him.
"“I am the happiest fellow in the world, Stellamaris,” said he."
“It would be difficult not to be happy in such a world.”
She pointed out to sea. The blustering wind of the day before had
"fallen, and a light breeze shook the tips of the waves to the"
"morning sunshine, which turned them into diamonds. The sails of the"
fishing-fleet of the tiny port flashed merrily against the kindly blue.
On the horizon a great steamer was visible steaming up Channel. The
salt air came in through the open windows. The laughter of fishermen's
children rose faintly from the beach far below.
"“And there's spring, too, dancing over everything,” she said. “Don't you"
feel it?”
"He acknowledged the vernal influence, and, careful lest his eyes should"
"betray him, talked of the many things she loved. He had not seen her for"
"a fortnight, so there were the apocryphal doings of Lilias and Niphetos"
detectives watching all over the city and country for any car that
looks suspicious.”
"Kennedy thanked him for his courtesy, and we rose to go. “I shall be"
"glad to keep you informed of anything that turns up,” he promised."
CHAPTER XX
THE ARTIFICIAL KIDNEY
"In the laboratory, Kennedy quietly set to work. He began by tearing"
from the germ letter the piece of gelatine and first examining it with
"a pocket lens. Then, with a sterile platinum wire, he picked out"
several minute sections of the black spot on the gelatine and placed
"them in agar, blood serum, and other media on which they would be"
likely to grow.
"“I shall have to wait until to-morrow to examine them properly,” he"
"remarked. “There are colonies of something there, all right, but I must"
have them more fully developed.”
"WHAT to read. This is like giving a loaded gun to a boy and saying,"
"'Shoot away! ... No matter in which direction you point your aim, . ."
"shoot yourself if you like, and others too,--anyhow, you've GOT the"
gun!' Of course there are a few fellows who have occasionally drawn up
"a list of books as suitable for everybody's perusal,--but then these"
"lists cannot be taken as true criterions, as they all differ from one"
another as much as church sects. One would-be instructor in the art of
reading says we ought all to study 'Tom Jones'--now I don't see the
the regular service and do so under efficient supervision. And there
was created the Government bureau designated as the Planetary
"Exploration Control Board, which was headed by Commander Stone."
*       *       *       *       *
Under this Board the exploration of the planets was undertaken
"methodically and efficiently, with a minimum of lives sacrificed."
"Mercury was charted, tested for essential minerals, and found to be a"
valueless rock heap too near the sun to support life.
Venus was visited and explored segment by segment; and friendly
relations were established with the rather stupid but peaceable people
found there.
Mars was mapped. Here the explorers had lingered a long time: and all
over this planet's surface were found remnants of a vast and intricate
"civilization--from the canals that laced its surface, to great cities"
with mighty buildings still standing. But of life there was none. The
atmosphere was too rare to support it; and the theory was that it had
constantly thinned through thousands of years till the last Martian
had gasped and died in air too attenuated to support life even in
creatures that must have grown greater and greater chested in eons of
adaptation.
Then Jupiter had been reached: and here the methodical planet by
"planet work promised to be checked for a long time to come. Jupiter,"
"with its mighty surface area, was going to take some exploring! It"
would be years before it could be plotted even superficially.

I answered in a low tone that I thought she must.
'No!' my lady cried harshly--she could be cruel sometimes--'not with
"us. She does not belong to our party. Let her stay with her paymaster,"
and to-morrow he will doubtless reward her.'
What reward she was likely to get Fraulein Max knew well. She flung
"herself at my lady's feet in an agony of fear, and clutching her"
"skirts, cried abjectly for mercy; she would carry, she would help, she"
"would do anything, if she might go! Knowing that we dared not leave"
her since she would be certain to release the general as soon as our
"backs were turned, I was glad when Marie, whose heart was touched,"
joined her prayers to the culprit's and won a reluctant consent.
It has taken long to tell these things. They passed very quickly. I
suppose not more than a quarter of an hour elapsed between our first
"appearance and this juncture, which saw us all standing in the"
"lamplight, laden and ready to be gone; while the general glowered at"
"us in sullen rage, and my lady, with a new thought in her mind, looked"
round in dismay.
"She drew me aside. 'Martin,' she said, 'his orderly is waiting in the"
road with his horse. The moment we are gone he will shout to him.'
"'We have provided for that,' I answered, nodding. Then assuring myself"
"by a last look round that all were ready, I gave the word. 'Now,"
Steve!' I said sharply.
In a twinkling he flung over the general's head a small sack doubled
inwards. We heard a stifled oath and a cry of rage. The bars of the
"strong chair creaked as our prisoner struggled, and for a moment it"
The repulsive creature outside made an authoritative gesture. He
"seemed to be beckoning to them, his huge dull eyes glaring"
threateningly at the same moment.
"""Our beanpole friend is suggesting that we get out of the shell and"
"stay awhile,"" said Dex with grim humor. ""They seem anxious to"
"entertain us--_ouch!_"""
"As the two men made no move to obey the beckoning gesture, the"
"creature had raised the tube again; and again the sharp, unpleasant"
shock shot through them.
"""What the devil are we going to do?"" exclaimed Brand. ""If we go out in"
that mob of nightmare things--it's going to be messy. As long as we
"stay in the shell we have some measure of protection."""
"""Not much protection when they can sting us through metal and glass at"
"will,"" growled Dex. ""Do you suppose they can turn the juice on harder?"
"Or is that bee-sting their best effort?"""
"As though in direct answer to his words, the blob-like face of the"
being who seemed in authority convulsed with anger and he raised the
tube again. This time the shock that came from it was sufficient to
throw the two men to the floor.
"""Well, we can't stay in the ship, that's certain,"" said Brand. ""I"
"guess there's only one thing to do."""
"Dex nodded. ""Climb out of here and take as many of these skinny"
"horrors with us into hell as we can,"" he agreed."
"Once more the shock stung them, as a reminder not to keep their"
"The door opened suddenly, the draught blowing down a fan and a"
"photograph-frame, and Miss Lindon entered."
"“My dear John, how good of you to come and see me!”"
"She was a fat, dumpy woman of fifty, lymphatic and, at first sight,"
"characterless. She lacked colour. Her eyes were light, but neither blue"
nor green nor hazel; her straight hair was of the nondescript hue of
"light-brown hair turning gray. Her face was fleshy and sallow, marked by"
"singularly few lines. She had lived a contented life, unscarred by care"
and unruffled by desire. Her dreams of the possibilities of existence
did not pierce beyond the gimcrackeries of Tregarthion Villas. As
"for the doings of the great world,--wars, politics, art, social"
"upheavals,--she bestowed on them, when they were obtruded on her notice,"
the same polite and unintelligent interest as she had bestowed on her
nephew's athletic feats in the days gone by.
"However, she smiled very amiably at John, and reached up to kiss him"
"on both cheeks, her flabby, white hands lightly resting on each"
"coat-sleeve. Having done this, she caught up the barking dog, who"
continued to growl from the soft shelter of arm and bosom with the
vindictiveness of pampered old age.
"“Naughty Dandy! I hope you were n't frightened at him, John. He never"
really does bite.”
“What does he do then? Sting?” John asked with gruff sarcasm.
"“Oh, no,” said Miss Lindon, round-eyed; “he 's quite harmless, I assure"
you. Don't you remember Dandy? But it's a long time since you 've been
"to see me, John. It must be three or four years. What have you been"
doing all this time?”
for a final check-up on directions.
They clambered into the tiny control room and shut the hermetically
sealed trap-door. Brand threw the control switch and precisely at
"eleven o'clock the conical shell of metal shot heavenward, gathering"
such speed that it was soon invisible to human eyes. He set their
"course toward the blazing speck that was Jupiter, four hundred million"
miles away; and then reported their start by radio to Commander
Stone's night operator.
The investigatory expedition to the ominous red spot of the giant of
the solar system was on.
CHAPTER II
_The Pipe-like Men_
Brand began to slacken speed on the morning of the thirteenth day
"(morning, of course, being a technical term: there are no horizons in"
space for the sun to rise over). Jupiter was still an immense distance
"off; but it took a great while to slow the momentum of the space ship,"
"which, in the frictionless emptiness of space, had been traveling"
faster and faster for nearly three hundred hours.
"Behind them was the distant ball of sun, so far off that it looked no"
larger than a red-hot penny. Before them was the gigantic disk of
"Jupiter, given a white tinge by the perpetual fog blankets, its"
outlines softened by its thick layer of atmosphere and cloud banks.
"Across the granary John Mortimer reclined with his head in his hands,"
making vows never to enter Spain or trust himself under the leadership
"of a mad Scot, if this once he should get clear off."
"""It isn't the being shot,"" he moaned; ""it's not being able to tell them"
"that I'm not a fool, but a respectable merchant able to pay my way and"
"with a balance at William Deacon's Bank. But it serves me right!"" Then a"
"little inconsequently he added, ""By gum, if I get out of this I'll have"
"a Spanish clerk in the works and learn the language!"""
Which was John Mortimer's way of making a vow to the gods.
"Etienne, having his hands comparatively free, and finding himself"
"sleepless, looked enviously at Rollo's untroubled repose, and began to"
twist cigarettes for himself and the sentry who guarded his side of the
granary.
"Without, the owls circled and cried. A dog barked in the village above,"
"provoking a far-reaching chorus of his kind. Then blows fell, and he"
fled yelping out of earshot.
Rollo was not wholly comfortable on his couch of grain. The bonds about
"his feet galled him, having been more tightly drawn than those of his"
companions in virtue of his chiefship. Nevertheless he got a good deal
"of sleep, and each time that he awoke it seemed to him that El Sarria"
was staring harder at the sentry and that the man had moved a little
nearer.
"At last, turning his head a little to one side, he heard distinctly the"
low murmur of voices.
“Will it make you happy to promise?”
“Yes.”
"“Then I promise,” said Joyce, humouring him. “Now I’m not going to talk"
to you any more.”
"A few minutes later, his breathing told Joyce that he slept. The"
"newspapers fell from Joyce’s hand, and he put his elbows on his knees"
and crouched over the smouldering logs. Noakes spoke truly. There was
little chance of recovery. He would be left alone again soon. It would
be very comfortless. The poor wreck who was dragging out his last days
upon that wretched bed had been an unspeakable solace to him. Without
his womanlike devotion he would have died of fever six months back on
"the Arato goldfield. Without the influence of his calm fatalism, he"
would have given up heart long ago. Without his steadfast purity of
"soul, he would have gone recklessly to the devil. The thought of losing"
him was a great pang.
"He himself, too, was far from strong. The climate, the hard manual"
labour for which he was physically unfit were telling upon him heavily.
"He yearned for home, for civilised life, for the lost heritage of"
"honour. Yvonne’s letter, telling of the little commonplaces of the lost"
"sweet life of decent living, had revived the ever dormant longing. He"
"began to dream of her, of that last day he had seen her, of her voice"
singing Gounod’s serenade.
"It was difficult to picture her as married to his cousin Everard, whom,"
"in the days of his vanity, he had despised as a prig and now dreaded as"
a scornful benefactor. It was a strange mating. And yet she seemed happy
and unchanged.
"""I want to go to Siberia ...  I have had enough of this vile life ..."
"one learns how to live there!"""
"""Yes, they have a particularly good way of teaching in Siberia,"" agreed"
"the Captain, sadly."
"They spoke no more of Petunikoff, or of the turning out of the"
inhabitants of the dosshouse.  They all knew that they would have to
"leave soon, therefore they did not think the matter worth discussion."
"It would do no good, and besides the weather was not very cold though"
the rains had begun ... and it would be possible to sleep on the ground
anywhere outside the town.  They sat in a circle on the grass and
"conversed about all sorts of things, discussing one subject after"
"another, and listening attentively even to the poor speakers in order"
to make the time pass; keeping quiet was as dull as listening.  This
"society of ""creatures that once were men"" had one fine"
characteristic--no one of them endeavoured to make out that he was
"better than the others, nor compelled the others to acknowledge his"
superiority.
The August sun seemed to set their tatters on fire as they sat with
their backs and uncovered heads exposed to it ... a chaotic mixture of
"the vegetable, mineral, and animal kingdoms. In the corners of the yard"
the tall steppe grass grew luxuriantly....  Nothing else grew there but
"some dingy vegetables, not even attractive to those who nearly always"
felt the pangs of hunger.
*      *      *      *      *
The following was the scene that took place in Vaviloff's eating-house.
"Young Petunikoff entered slowly, took off his hat, looked around him,"
stream of hurrying vehicles in the avenue. The younger one cuddled down
with her head in her sister’s lap.
"“We will have to marry some day,” she said dreamily—“both of us. We"
have so much money that we will not be allowed to disappoint the
"public. Do you want me to tell you the kind of a man I could love,"
Sis?”
"“Go on, you scatterbrain,” smiled the other."
"“I could love a man with dark and kind blue eyes, who is gentle and"
"respectful to poor girls, who is handsome and good and does not try to"
"flirt. But I could love him only if he had an ambition, an object, some"
work to do in the world. I would not care how poor he was if I could
"help him build his way up. But, sister dear, the kind of man we always"
meet—the man who lives an idle life between society and his clubs—I
"could not love a man like that, even if his eyes were blue and he were"
ever so kind to poor girls whom he met in the street.”
BY COURIER
It was neither the season nor the hour when the Park had frequenters;
"and it is likely that the young lady, who was seated on one of the"
"benches at the side of the walk, had merely obeyed a sudden impulse to"
sit for a while and enjoy a foretaste of coming Spring.
"She rested there, pensive and still. A certain melancholy that touched"
"her countenance must have been of recent birth, for it had not yet"
"""I don't know,"" Sallie answered at random and since he seemed to expect"
"some reply to that fatuity. She had met a good many men in her time, but"
never one quite like this Lord Ingoldsby--who actually seemed anxious to
look and act like a cunning fool.
A waiter intervened between them. But his lordship waved that
functionary away.
"""Do let's,"" he implored with child-like insistence. ""It would be so"
"deevy to be pals with you. And I'm beastly dull here, all by myself,"
don't y'know. So--
"""Eh?"" He glared at Slyne, who had bluntly interrupted his _tête-à-tête_."
"""No, I _don't_ want any oysters--I told that waiter-chap so. And I"
_don't_ know any 'lady of the camellias.' I can't imagine what you're
"talkin' about at all, I'm sure."""
"""I saw her again last night, at the Casino,"" said Slyne, imperturbably,"
and went on to entertain Sallie with a long if not over-truthful account
"of his own over-night's doings there. So that, for all his lordship's"
"lack of manners, it was some time before that spoiled youth again"
succeeded in monopolising her attention. At every turn Slyne was ready
"to balk him, and, but for his native self-conceit coupled with a certain"
"blind obstinacy, he must very soon have understood what was perfectly"
"plain to Sallie, that he was there merely on sufferance, to serve some"
purpose of Slyne's.
"""Goin' to be here long, Lady Josephine?"" he managed to break in at last."
Slyne had turned to give a departing waiter some order.
"""I don't know,"" Sallie answered again, since she could say nothing else."
which I have never experienced in association with German-Austrians
"and with Prussians. I do not wish to speak evil of our Allies, the"
"Prussians, but to one of my blood they are the most detestable people"
whom God ever had the ill-judgment to create.

"I was born in Trieste, and lived there with my parents until I was"
eight years old. In our private life we always spoke Italian or
"French, German was our official language. I know that language well,"
"of course, but it is not my mother tongue. Italian or French, and"
afterwards English--I speak and write all three equally well; which of
the three I shall use when I come to die and one reverts to the speech
"of the nursery and schoolroom, I cannot say; it will depend upon whom"
those are that stand about my deathbed.
"When I was eight years old, my father, Captain ---- (no, I will not"
tell you my name; it is not Trehayne though somewhat similar in
"sound), was appointed Austrian Consul at Plymouth, and we all moved to"
that great Devonshire seaport. I was young enough to absorb the rich
"English atmosphere, nowhere so rich as in that county which is the"
"home and breeding-ground of your most splendid Navy. I was born again,"
a young Elizabethan Englishman. My story to you of my origin was true
in one particular--I really was educated at Blundell's School at
Tiverton. Whenever--and it has happened more than once--I have met as
Trehayne old schoolfellows of Blundell's they have accepted without
"comment or inquiry my tale that I had become an Englishman, and had"
"anglicised my name. Among the peoples which exist on earth to-day, you"
English are the most nobly generous and unsuspicious. The Prussians
"laugh at you; I, an Austrian-Italian, love and respect you."

"on French money, told the Abbé that he hoped to see him, with his"
"credentials, at Whitehall on the second morning following at ten o'clock,"
"and the Abbé said he would leave his credentials with my Lord Clarendon,"
"and would be at Whitehall at the hour suggested by the king, for the"
purpose of making the French king's offer.
"Most of the guests went home between two men, very late at night, but"
fortunately I was able to walk home by myself.
I was both glad and disappointed not to find George in the gown of the
Abbé. I was glad because of the risk he would have taken had he come to
"England, yet disappointed in missing what would have been the most"
"picturesque, daring personal exploit of English court history. But on the"
whole it was better as it was.
"The next morning the king sent for me to come to his closet, and asked if"
"I knew one Lilly, an astrologer. I answered that I knew little of him"
"personally, but had heard much of his wisdom and learning."
"""Yes, yes, but you know where he lives, do you not? On the Strand, a"
"dozen houses this side of Temple Bar?"" asked the king."
"""I have seen the house often, your Majesty,"" I replied."
"""Good! Now listen attentively to what I have to say,"" returned the king,"
graciously taking my arm and leading me to a window overlooking the
"river. ""I hear from De Grammont that the Abbé du Boise is a firm believer"
"in the teachings of astrology. I want you to arrange, without letting any"
"one know that my finger is in the pie, to take Lilly to see the Abbé, or"
the Abbé to see Lilly. I'll whisper a word in your ear. The stars will
"tell our friend, the Abbé, a story to suit our purposes. The French king"
"and his ambassadors will find their match in me, I warrant you. I have"
"captors waiting. With their shoulders bunched for abrupt action, and"
"their guns in hand, the two men walked to the trap-door of the ship."
"They threw the heavy bolts, drew a deep breath--and flung open the"
door to charge unexpectedly toward the thickest mass of creatures that
surrounded the ship!
*       *       *       *       *
In a measure their charge was successful. Its very suddenness caught
some of the tall monstrosities off guard. Half a dozen of them stopped
the fragile glass bullets to writhe in horrible death on the red metal
paving of the square. But that didn't last long.
"In less than a minute, thin, clammy arms were winding around the"
"Earthmen's wrists, and their guns were wrenched from them. And then"
started a hand-to-hand encounter that was all the more hideous for
being so unlike any fighting that might have occurred on Earth.
"With a furious growl Dex charged the nearest creature, whose huge"
round head swayed on its stalk of a body fully six feet above his own
"head. He gathered the long thin legs in a football grip, and sent the"
thing crashing full length on its back. The great head thumped
"resoundingly against the metal paving, and the creature lay"
motionless.
"For an instant Dex could only stare at the thing. It had been so easy,"
"like overcoming a child. But even as that thought crossed his mind,"
two of the tall thin figures closed in behind him. Four pairs of arms
"wound around him, feebly but tenaciously, like wet seaweed."
"They began to constrict and wind tighter around him. He tore at them,"
dislodged all but two. His sturdy Earth leg went back to sweep the
feel their knuckles against her.  Had he gone mad?  Would he strangle
"her?  But her eyes never moved from his, and his began to waver; his"
"hands dropped, and, with a kind of moan, he made for the door."
Monsieur Harmost's voice behind her said:
"""Before you go, monsieur, give me some explanation of this imbecility!"""
"Fiorsen spun round, shook his fist, and went out muttering.  They heard"
"the front door slam.  Gyp turned abruptly to the window, and there, in"
"her agitation, she noticed little outside things as one does in moments"
"of bewildered anger.  Even into that back yard, summer had crept.  The"
leaves of the sumach-tree were glistening; in a three-cornered little
"patch of sunlight, a black cat with a blue ribbon round its neck was"
basking.  The voice of one hawking strawberries drifted melancholy from a
side street.  She was conscious that Monsieur Harmost was standing very
"still, with a hand pressed to his mouth, and she felt a perfect passion"
of compunction and anger.  That kind and harmless old man--to be so
insulted!  This was indeed the culmination of all Gustav's outrages!  She
"would never forgive him this!  For he had insulted her as well, beyond"
"what pride or meekness could put up with.  She turned, and, running up to"
"the old man, put both her hands into his."
"""I'm so awfully sorry.  Good-bye, dear, dear Monsieur Harmost; I shall"
"come on Friday!""  And, before he could stop her, she was gone."
"She dived into the traffic; but, just as she reached the pavement on the"
"other side, felt her dress plucked and saw Fiorsen just behind her.  She"
shook herself free and walked swiftly on.  Was he going to make a scene
"in the street?  Again he caught her arm.  She stopped dead, faced round"
"on him, and said, in an icy voice:"
-How you doing?
You all right?
"-Yeah, okay."
I....
I wanted to apologize.
"Oh, no, we finished with that sorry business already."
Sorry for getting you into this situation.
"No, you didn't get me into anything."
I got myself into whatever we got into.
-I was just curious about you.
"-And I, you."
You're the least likely person in the world for me.
-Are you insulting me now?
-No.
"No, not at all."
A compliment.
I think you helped me.
"Okay, a little positivity."
"Yeah, you helped open me up."
"Yeah, and I would've opened you up further if I had my way."
-That's disgusting.
"-No, not really."
It's honest.
-You should work on your manners.
-I know.
"I'm trying, believe me."
I wanna tell you something.
All right.
It doesn't matter who's right or wrong.
"I made mistakes, a lot of them, I know that."
I live with them every day.
The hardest thing I live with is knowing how much I've disappointed you.

I have to talk to her.
"Listen, firstly I'm sorry."
"Then, my condolences."
"If someone asks for me, say you couldn't reach me."

Hello.

You sing so well.
"Go on, keep singing."
I dare not.
But why?
You're down there and I'm here.
We can't look each other in the eye.
I can't see you.
I can see you.
What are you doing down there?
I'm digging a well.
You don't dig wells on hills.
- l'm digging a ditch.
- Why a ditch?
For telecommunications.
Why are you alone?
Working alone makes things simple.

My sister preferred to studyNDominion Over Living Things.

Will you stop doing that?

(WHOOSHlNG ) I've always admired that hat.

How dare you?

It is a pity about all this.
- Philip!
"- Stay away from me, you murderous..."
"- Philip, no!"
- Tell him you did it for him.
I did it for you.
She was going to destroy you.
Have you fired.
"Your own daughter, that's how much you loved him."
My daughter.
"I killed her for, for you."
My savior.
My Siegfried.
Please don't leave me.
What would I want you for?
Look at you.
A mad cow.
Philip!
Phil...
Philip.
What's gonna happen to me?
"- Come on, Gillian."
- Who's gonna look after me?
It'll be the taxpayers of the state of New York who'll be taking care of her.
She's only got three years left to live.
"You're not gonna throw the book at her, are you?"
I'm sure she'll be receptive to a plea that lands her in the Bedford prison hospital.
You think any of those tears are for her daughter?
"Yeah, me neither."
"Um, did I not mention to you my new philosophy?"
Of saying yes.
Does that mean you want me to...
You don't want to overfeed a puppy.
- Oh.
"-Here you are, sweetheart."
- There you go.
Have a little bit of that.
"-Oh, isn't that sweet?"
- Yes.
-Aw.
Aw...
"Listen, does Ralph know about this yet?"
"Oh, no."
I haven't told him yet.
"Oh, you gonna tell him tonight?"
No.
I think I'll wait till tomorrow morning.
"'Cause, see, the man at the..."
down at the pound
-told me the dog's gonna need shots.
-Uh-huh.
"And Mrs. Manicotti's going to the vet's tonight to take her dog, so she said she'd take him along with hers."
Yeah.
"Well, once Ralph sees that sweet little face,"
-he's gonna love him.
-I hope so.
"Say, Trix, how come you never got a dog?"
On account of Ed.
"Oh, he loves dogs, but for the first few minutes Ed's around a dog, he-he itches and wheezes and sneezes."
"Ooh, it's somethin' terrible."
It's an allergy he's got to anything with fur on it.
"Oh, gee, that's too bad."
"Hey, you want me to drop the dog off at Mrs. Manicotti's for you?"
"Oh, Trix, that would be wonderful."
"Hello, doc."
"Hi, Connie."
"- Just coffee, please."
- Right.
"Who's that, doc?"
That's Mrs. MacKenzie.
She runs a dress shop.
"She has a daughter in the senior class, Allison."
Beautiful woman.
She's a widow.
"Born here, but she had ambitions, and left."
Married in New York to some ad genius.
"When he died, she came back here."
- I'd like to meet her.
- Wouldn't do you no good.
Bring your coffee.
"Connie, you haven't met Mr. Rossi, the new school principal."
- How do you do?
- Hello.
I hear about you every day from my daughter.
You've been working kind of late?
"No, I've been to the movies."
Allison's giving a party.
What does she plan to do after graduation?
She'd like to be a writer.
I'd like her in college.
It's too bad she has no brothers and sisters.
- Why do you say that?
- Just that I'm against only-child families.
Only children receive all the attention of the parents.
- Good and bad.
- I don't think Allison turned out badly.
"Oh, fun."
Unless you don't want me to go.
Are you asking my permission?
"No,"
- you-you just seem like you...
"- No, no."
Go.
Have fun.
Enjoy yourself.
Okay.
Good.
- Good.
- Good.
"Look, take a break from work later, come visit me."
You gotta eat.
Maybe I will.
What the hell are you doing here?
"Dad, Scott brought these sandwiches over as a little peace offering."
"You know, for screwing up your deal."
Wasn't that nice?
"Well, let's see..."
Sandwiches... millions of dollars.
"Sandwiches, millions of dollars..."
He also brought pickles.
"Our biggest client just fired us because that deal fell through, thanks to this idiot."
"Hey, you know, there's no need for name calling."
"This is my place of business, pal."
I can call you Roberta if I want to.
- What the hell is that?
- My cell phone.
Listen to that.
Even his phone ring pisses me off.

- Does it look good?
- Looks great!
You're still looking at the good view?
"Not any more, only at the menu!"
Lucky you!
Why?
"That's what happened to me, stared at the good view too long."
I'm weird.
I'm going crazy.
Something really does seem weird...
"What's more important, my birthday or training?"
.
"Come on, Bulma-san..."
I've known your dad for how many years now?
"That reminds me, Bulma-san, how old will you be today?"
Ouch.
How rude.
Why would I ever tell you that?
.
"Oh, dear."
Wow.
I've never been on a cruise ship before.
You can tell they're the richest family in the world.
Goku-sa's sure got some great friends.
Is it true that you've prepared a castle and an... aeroplane as prizes for today's bingo contest?
"Yep, that's right."
But the Grand Prize is even better.
"""Grand Prize:"
"Secret"""
"All right, Kuririn."
"With Maron here, that makes three of us."
Let's make sure we go home with that second place castle.
Huh?
You're fine with just the second place prize?
Is second not high enough?
"Oh, I didn't mean it like that..."
"Oh, Goku-sa..."
Why'd you have to go training' at a time like this?
.
"So, Elliott tells me you never saw the bullet coming, and that you were getting ready to paint."
"So, let's just say you were involved in a plot to blackmail the Secretary of the Navy."
"You with me, Larr?"
Is brightening up the den really the top of your priority list?
I'm pretty sure that Larr-bear here wasn't involved.
I think he just knew something that someone didn't want him telling us.
(whispers):
She's phenomenal.
But can she make assumptions like this?
"She just did, Duck."

"Yeah, Abbs."
In my lab.

That's an Unidentified Submerged Object.
Oh.
Hello.
Hello.
I'm Dr. Samantha...
Ryan.
I know.
"So, what am I thinking?"
You're thinking I can't possibly know what you're thinking.
You're good.
Abby.
- See you next trip.
"- All supplies aboard, sir."
- Thank you.
Parade the recruits.
- Parade recruits!
- On deck.
"Look lively, will you?"
"Come on, come on."
Fall in at the end of the lines.
- Where are you going?
- I must see the captain.
Get in that line.
Recruits ready for inspection.
"One wants to be put ashore, sir."
- I brought him myself.
He's a fraud.
- I'm as good as...
My antecedents are as honourable as your own.
- What's your name?
- Percival Palliser Wagstaffe.
- Are you related to Admiral Wagstaffe?
- He's a distant cousin.
He would speak for you?
How well do you know him?
- Intimately.
Often.
- You visit him?
"You claim that, do you?"
Do you also claim to be a madman?
- To visit someone who doesn't exist...
- Not exist?
My cousin?
Well...
We won't give up.
We'll just keep looking.
"Today, tomorrow..."
"Oh, not tomorrow."
The race is tomorrow.
"Well, Roger's more important than the race."
"Oh, Thomas, you know, I get this feeling down deep in my solar plexus... that if you really try..."
I mean really try real hard... you can win this race.
"And if you win, everything will be okay for Roger and me."
"I mean, the police will find him and... and he'll give back the money and we'll get married."
You know what I mean?
"Yeah, I know."
Beauty Knows No Pain.
Yeah.

My love has gone?
?
And our dreams grow old?

Someday I'll know?
?
She'll come back?
"Remember, this is your best event."
So don't go saving your energy for the other events.
Got it?
Yeah.
Don't forget.
I order you!
I order you!
You broke it!
You broke my sword!
"You've got a lot to learn about winning, Trelane."
You dare to defy me!
You've got a lot to learn about everything.
I'll fix you!
You cheated!
You haven't played the game right.
I'll show you!
[ Woman's Voice ] Trelane!
No!
No!
You said I could have this planet.
[ Man's Voice ] This has gone far enough.
But you always stop me when I'm having fun.
You're disobedient and cruel.
We've told you before.
"Time to come in now, Trelane."
"I don't want to come in, and I won't."
"I'm a general, and I won't listen to you."
"Enough, Trelane."
Come along.
But why?
I didn't do anything wrong.
I was just playing.
We said come along.
But I haven't finished studying my predators yet.
This is not studying them.
"If you cannot take proper care of your pets, you cannot have them."
"Aw, but I was winning."
"Yes, sir."
He's been here for like 20 minutes.
"Oh, god, do they suck ass?"
And you're already dressed.
And what they're gonna do is they're
"Gonna bring you out through this side,"
And we're gonna put on your shoes.
Great.
"I'm gonna shoot with this guy, who's"
Half an inch taller than Mike in the 10-year-old fucking mask?
That's brilliant.
Who's fucking idea was that?
"Oh, that looks really great."
Motherfuckers.
INTERVIEWER:
What's that?
"They got the fucking 10-year-old mask on a 6'2"" guy."
MAN:
It doesn't look anything like-- we have a stunt man.
Somebody could have asked.
Anybody could have asked.
Somebody could have asked.
I had no idea they were shooting with it.
I'm sure--
I put together pieces of this makeup for a stunt man.
They don't care.
"No, they just don't fucking care."
They could do the rest of the movie with a 10-year-old
"Mask and 6'2"" guy."
Right?
Why not?
They just don't care.
I'm sorry.
I wish I'd come to see you sooner.
Big Brother!
Did you come to see me?
You'd better hurry or you'll miss your plane.
No.
I've decided not to go.
But what about your work?
"Shinjiro, you go and see how Grandma is doing."
Is something the matter with Grandma?
There's something strange!
Grandma is sleeping.
Snoring up a storm!
How is she?
"She ate some rice porridge, but she's asleep again."
"Shall we go to bed, too?"
It looks like we're going to have some rain.
Shall we close the sliding doors?
Grandma!
The bomb!
"What's the matter, Grandma?"
Grandma!
What's going on?
It's the bomb!
"You two, quick!"
Put this over you.
This is best for the bomb!
There're many who survived because they were wearing something white!
"The sooner, the better."
Let's take her to the hospital right away!
She's sound asleep now.
Maybe we should leave her as she is a little longer.
"Moroni, stop it or I will make you regret it."
"Italia,"
You do not understand it that it makes time that I wait for each moment?
-Moroni...
-And now that we are alone...
"Moroni, be carefull..."
"Italy, I wish you, you the very many desire."
"Moroni, the request, does not do that."
"But, how you dare?"
Beauty that I...
"No, you do not have to beat to me because I am terrible..."
"Moroni, have I hurt you?"
Moroni?
Moroni?
Have i hurt you?
Moroni?
Little baby?
Little baby?
Little baby.
Call me Ben.
Idiot!
"-Eh, boys, you come here."
-You arrive behind schedule.
-Italia is done...
-What said to you?
The next time we will also do the Italians.
You speak like a politician.
"Alvaro, if your parents speak with mine, we are of excursion?"
in agreement?
"Yes, we are all in Honolulu."
You do not worry.
The suntan oil!
I've been instructed not to sell you any more.
What?
!
You're demonstrating addictive behavior.
You seem like a nice person;
I hope you get help.
No!
"You go to hell, zit-face!"

"Hey, you guys want to make a quick buck?"
"Uh, is it gay stuff?"
Do you need it to be?
No.
Good.
I didn't want to have to make that decision.
"Here, take this money and buy me..."
CLERK:
"Sir, if you don't go away,"
I'll have to call the police.

"Good-bye, Debbie."
I guess we'll never get to have ugly children together.
(grunts)
(maniacal laughter)
You checking me out?
"Well, too late."
You can't have none of this!
And I would've done anything.
Anything!
(maniacal laughter)
- [sighs] wayne.
you take care.
[engine turns over]
"- see, you could wear that to the sizzler or the prom."
that is gorgeous.
- it's growing on me.
- [sighs] okay.
- i wanted to thank you for what you did for tim.
"it pains to say this, but i've never seen him look happier."
- so is this some sort of an apology?
"- well, look, i'm sorry, too."
so...
"- uh, uh. baby steps."
- [chuckling] i agree.
[spits]
- [spits]
"- is everything okay, ladies?"
- yes.
- ah!
i knew it!
[all chuckling]
"- so, bob, i was thinking about a christmas gift for you."
"- oh, no."
this is all the gift i need.
"- since mama handed me this store, and she's your mama, too, why don't we become partners?"
- oh.
i-i don't think that would be such a good idea.
"- um... you know, it might not be a bad idea."
"look, there is -- there's a line outside the door."
"- but we can talk about that, but not today."
today is christmas.
"- well, merry christmas, you two."
Can you please tell me what's really going on?
"Nothing, Joanie."
It was fate.
"If Sophia hadn't sent me packing,"
I never would've met this adorable little equine shrinky-dink.
Those are our vows she's chewing.
Hmm?
"Uh, here."
There.
(sighs)
"Come on, Lemonade."
I'll take you back to the barn.
The trainer was nice enough to take her back.
"Evidently, this happens all the time."
"What she hadn't told me is the minute you take them off the ranch, they lose 40% of their value."
(yips)
Who are you?
This is Tank.
Tank's a Yorkie.
"Oh, my goodness."
"Hello, Tank."
I'm John.
"I was thinking about what you said, honey, and-and maybe this isn't about a horse; maybe this is about you struggling with Sophia getting older."
And so I got you a pet that's gonna stay little forever.
"Oh, thanks, Joanie."
"You're so welcome, sweetheart."
I love you.
"- (growls, barks) - (gasps)"
Seriously?
Bitches love me.
Did you get me a prostitute?
"- No, he's a dancer."

He really likes you and John.
I can tell.
Think he looks at y'all like you're some kind of heroes or something.
"Well, we're..."
We're far from that.
"You might want to tell him that then, if you know what I mean."
I've got a little girl in there who needs her daddy.
Dale doesn't know any better.
He watches TV.
I read nonfiction.
"Well, hey."
Hey.
"Hey, John, what do you say we head back?"
"Oh, no, come on, guys."
The night is young.
Y'all want some cookies?
We all do.
"No, we wouldn't dare try."
Very serious meal.
They're in here.
I got to go pee.
Pee off the porch.
Yeah.
Shit.
"You know, Dale..."
This whole case is our problem.
"I mean, what I'm saying is, you can be as involved, or uninvolved, in the actual apprehension of these guys as you want."
Assuming they show up.
"Well, if they do, I'll be there."
You got a nice spot here.
"Nice house, nice family."
You're a lucky guy.
"It's, um, hip."

Yeah.
"Yeah, no, it... it works."
"I, um..."
I work here.
"Or I used to, before..."
I am starting again next week.
I'm sorry.
"I wanted to come back, but I just..."
"I couldn't, uh, get it together."
That's my fault.
"And then, your mom said that you weren't ready to... see me, so..."
Mom told you not to come?
She has her reasons.
I missed a lot.
But when I saw on the news what happened with your... with Piper...
We don't...
We don't have to get into that.
Being a survivor is painful.
Having to remember all of your friends' faces...
This isn't...

I need to ask you this one thing.
Anything.
I understand that you and Mom couldn't make it work.
I get that.
"Sometimes, people just don't fit together."
"And, now, I know what you went through with Piper."
"The lies, all of it."
I understand why you ran away from this place... but...

was Victoria's most admired police officer.
"It was an honour to work for him, Mum said."
"It was an honour to work for him, Mum said."
But that didn't mean she had to like him.
"AII right, but you gotta get over it."
So I unwrap the paper... and there she is... with her head held high and her ears perked up.
And there I am smiling.
What happened then?
"still, I gotta be the sad clown."
"A front for my friends, my family."
"You know, a brave front."
I've heard you describe yourself this way.
-About what?
"-Well, I do need a place of my own."
So I decided to take you up on your offer.
And which offer would that be?
To check out your apartment.
"Alex, it's nearly 2 in the morning."
But you said you were a night owl like I am and you walked me home an hour ago. I just figured--
What?
"Oh, my God. I'm sorry."
-lt's okay.
-No.
You know what?
It's not okay. I misjudged this whole thing again.
I'm-- l'm just-- l'm leaving. I feel terrible.
There's nothing for you to feel terrible about.
"Yes, there is."
Okay?
"Here you have this life, this great. wonderful life."
And I keep imposing myself on it.
You are not imposing.
I know that I am.
"You're not, okay?"
It's fine.
Please.
"No, no."
Nobody did anything to me.
I just...
I'm trying to keep it spicy with Tim.
"Honey, I didn't even know people could do this, and I've had some long layovers in Bangkok."
- Mom!
- I'm sorry.
"This is a little more than I could handle, so, I-I..."
I think I'm gonna talk to my therapist.
Do you think that he can help me?
"No, no, this is for me."
You need a priest.
(car engine approaching)
(car door closes)
HEATHER:
I got this.
I got this.
(keys jingling)
I don't got this.
I don't got this.
I don't got this.
I don't got this.
(beeping) What?
"Did you know that Victoria's Secret sold their Web site to someone called ""Net Nanny""?"
"Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey."
Will you go get me a glass of water?
"I can smell Pop Tarts, so I know Tyler's in the kitchen."
"Look, I cannot keep doing this."
"If I wanted to run up and down the stairs two times a day, I'd join a gym."
You're gonna have to talk to him again at some point.
Maybe not.
"Maybe like a mama bear out in the wild,"
I got addicted to one of those things.
Almost broke up my marriage.
What?
"Oh, no, no."
Not that.
"No, no, no, I met someone, and, you know, we had a nice time-- that's all there is to it."
"Wait, you're not going to see him again?"
"Maybe I will, and maybe I won't."
You can do that?
"Apparently, I can."
"Oh, crap."
Here comes Sad Dad.
Who's Sad Dad?
"Yeah, that's the other side of divorce."
"His wife left him three years ago for her personal trainer and he's been moping around the school ever since, trying to get any woman to show him the slightest bit of attention."
"Oh, that is so pathetic."
Which one is he?
Hey!
"Oh, my God, what are you doing here?"
You looking for me?
"Uh... uh, no, my kid goes to this school."
No way.
"My daughter, Alice, goes to school here."
Wow.
You would think that that would have come up last night.
"Oh, my God."
"No, no, no, no!"
Don't answer that.
Why?
Who is it?
Hi.
We're very busy.
They looted the jewels...
- What?
!
I couldn't save Deepa either.
If you can't forget her.
If you are so attached to her.
Why am I even here?
Why is this wedding happening?
"Sadhana, please."
I did ask you.
"If you weren't able to forget her, I was ready to step away."
"You kept nodding your head and expressing interests in me, and now you are after her."
"You took the wedding chain as well, didn't you?"
"Had you saved her, Would you tied it around her neck and married her?"
"Mom, ask her to keep quiet."
Why should I stay quiet?
"Sadhana, be calm."
It's not necessary anymore.
I will leave.
I'm not ready to get mislead by him any further.
"I'm sorry, aunt."
I don't want this wedding.
- Sadhana!
"Mom, let's go."
'Who?
What?
When?
'
'Swathi was hanging out with her friends'.
'2 twilight thieves arrested.'
Sadhana.
Sadhana.
What do you do all day?
Not much.
I gotta go to the bathroom.
Is your mother back?
Not yet.
Is that your own money?
No.
- Does your mother approve?
- Sure.
She always gives a lot herself.
We don't want any trouble.
You realize ...
Normally we don't take money from children.
That's a lot of money.
"No, we can do it."
"Well, take a good look at how beautiful this house is."
They can afford it.
"As thanks for the donation, I have here a plaster."
Help!
Help!
Help!
Stop!
Please prove that you're our mother.
Ask her what my favorite song is.
What is Lukas' favorite song?
"""Good evening, good night""?"
Don't!
"Can you count the stars, shining in the night sky?"
"Can you count the clouds, hovering over the fields?"
Oh Lord watch over them.
with eyes that never doze.
He sees you and loves you.
Ellis?
You look so pale in corduroy.
Your friends are they?
I got a letter...from the Commission document bombed down in the provinces.
"An exhibition in London, straight after."
And that's for gallery.
Ellis!
Would there be Sunday trains do you think?
"Only that I need to get back to London, Monday mornings."
What are you talking about?
Coming to see you.
"You will be with me, silly."
"Yes, of course!"
After the script is finished.
Umm..get out of that actually.
I don't want to get out of it.
I don't want to let them down.
No. of course not.
"Now, I leave on Monday."
"Umm, I'll be back in London for the exhibition."
I suppose it's not very far off.
No.
It's not so very far off.
And I'll come and visit as often as I can.
"Right, then."
Veal's off.
"I ordered cutlets, Millenezi."
And Cimbalino pudding.
So...so you are Mr.Ambrose Hilliard?
Ye..yes.
I...
I'm Sophie Smith.
Stop.
Stop!
Why did you save me?
You're like my father.
But such obsession.
You forced me to sit in the car.
Otherwise I would've shown you more.
Here's an advice.
Listen carefully and follow it.
Live larger than life.
Laugh more than you can cry.
Forgo your anger.
And finish your enemies with a smile.
Get it?
There's a rage in my heart too.
They killed 10 of my men.
I'll kill 20.
But... look at the boiling point of my mind.
It's still zero!
- Name.
- I want to forget mine.
Who I am where from everything.
Still I would like to know.
You can have a little faith in the Big Boss.
What do you say Boss?
And this way Big Boss made that boy... heir to his world and his heart.
And gave that nameless boy name... that fitted his stature.
BOSS!
Boy saves Haryana's transport king's life.
Satyakant.
You're still reading 15 year old news about your son.
You know very well Raghunath.
"Zelda, didn't you used to have a crush on Stuart Ramsey?"
Maybe when I was eight.
He might be interesting now.
He's done well for himself.
Practically runs the post office.
"Then why don't you be interested, Ellie?"
"Why, I hadn't thought about it."
[gasping] [giggling]
I hadn't thought about it but I possibly could be.
Zelda's got her hands full with Mr. Sellers.
And Mr. Fitzgerald.
[sighs] Don't you two have anything better to talk about?
"No, this is Montgomery."
[laughs]
"Oh, look, it's Bucky Turner."
[horn honking]
"We see you, Bucky!"
We're gonna tell your mama!
His mother's dead.
"Sorry, Bucky, about your mama!"
[giggling]
Livy:
"I know this is awful to say, but... sometimes I miss the war."
Livy.
You have to agree it was more fun.
"More men, more falling' in love."
Fallin' in love?
"Yeah, fallin' in love, pretty near every night."
- Not me.
"- That's because your daddy didn't let you go to the dances, but Zelda and I, we participated in the war effort."
Doesn't this take the cake?
Milton Grable.
She didn't even bother packing her bags!
How she was fed up with my poor cop father!
And he with her.
It killed her.
She wallowed with those pigs.
"In their dough, their drugs, their shit!"
"Mommy, mommy, my mommy!"
I followed.
"They fed me, they dressed me, they beat me, but they never sullied me."
"I'm like her, I'm like her,"
"I'm like her, like her..."
like her...
I'm like her...
"Mommy, mommy... mommy!"
My mommy...
Now that I am King... and that the Queen is Queen...
"""Impossible"" is a French word."
I'll never marry you.
Leave the ending to me.
I need this money!
I need this money...
It's too swell.
Expatriation!
What is that?
"Oh yes, I forgot to tell you, the big surprise!"
Your mother's corset exploded.
"Ambulance, firemen, four nurses, two obstetricians."
"Nine and a half pounds on arrival, incognito for seven months!"
A triumph!
It's all your doing...
Madam's my age.
"""From each according to his faculties;"
Dave's right.
"I mean, you know, why go through with it just to get a divorce 2 weeks later?"
- Exactly.
- I think actually she just kinda got really overwhelmed.
"Uh, she saw Brian and then freaked out and left."
- Have you talked to her?
- No one has.
"So she hasn't spoken to them, and they haven't spoken to each other."
We ought to just invite Marjorie and have a really awkward barbecue.
That'd be awesome.
"Oh, that's me."
Where's my cell phone?
"Oh, uh, ooh, uh, here."
"Um, Suzanne."
Huh.
What is she doing calling on a Sunday?
"- Well, it's probably about the launch."
- Juice box.
"Leviathan's going to be calling a lot, you know."
- Hello?
"- Hey, handsome."
Hi.
"I'm, um, in the middle of a family/friend thing."
How do you know I'm not calling you about work?
I don't.
You're right.
"Um, what's up?"
- I got some ideas I want to pitch you.
- Okay.
How about tomorrow?
How about tomorrow night?
They'll probably sound better over a glass of wine.
"I'm doing this for all of us, mom."
Hi!
"No, thanks."
Are you also the pride of yourparents?
"Just like me, you're not sure."
"My fatherwas a soldier, I always wanted to be like him."
He used to say:
"""I am so proud of you, son""."
Attention!
"Combat boots on, guns ready, attack!"
One afterthe other...
They all die...
Dad would be so proud of me.
At ease!
"At ease, huh?"
Dad is dead.
My condolences.
We owe our lives to dad.
I owe everything to him.
"Soldiers are immortal, nations are indivisible."
"You'll fucking serve the army too, you pussy boy Can!"
Pussy boy!
We should leave now.
These hands were so tiny.
Size of a cat's paw.
They said you wouldn't live.
So tiny.
Now look at these...
Why don't you join a support group forfallen officers' families?
You're always at home.
It's not that.
It's the seaside I miss.
Saddle up.
What'd you do with my trailer?
- I parked it at your sponsor's tent.
- What?
Gotta make your personal appearance.
No.
No!
"No, no, no, no!"
"Yes, yes, yes!"
Lightning McQueen here.
"And I use Rust-eze Medicated Bumper Ointment, new rear end formula!"
Nothing soothes a rusty bumper like Rust-eze.
Wow!
Look at that shine!
Use Rust-eze and you too can look like me!
Ka-chow!
I met this car from Swampscott.
He was so rusty he didn't even cast a shadow.
You could see his dirty undercarriage.
I hate rusty cars.
This is not good for my image.
They did give you your big break.
"Besides, it's in your contract."
"Oh, will you stop, please?"
Just go get hooked up.
- Winter is a grand old time.
- Of this there are no ifs or buts.
"But remember, all that salt and grime..."
Can rust your bolts and freeze your...
"Hey, look!"
There he is!
Our almost champ!
Nita Caglar?
This is the name she spoke.
A Kurdish girl.
Okay.
She works a little for me.
"Without a permit visa, but that shit, I'm helping people."
How old is she?
15.
"A friend of his daughter, perhaps?"
Zana lives in Sweden with his mother.
What does this have to do with it?
When was the last time you saw her?
Six months ago.
Where is she?
She ran away from home.
Reported her as missing.
Why did she do it?
How should I know?
She contacted?
-I Would say is yes.
"If I do not get hysterical, does not mean I do not care."
Perhaps you do not have children.
Then I'll tell you something.
They are like a part of you.
But you can not make them be better.
"So if there is something more, take me to the police station."
One more thing.
I never liked cops.
No one died?
That's great!
Have you managed to track down the girl?
Let's wait for the experts.
Max?
Do not touch anything.
- He will be seen.
- Why does not this display?
Please do not touch anything.
Stop it.
Please tell ...
Please leave.
I think this is display the information.
It will take us where is electricity.
We do not have to do this.
I have it.
Caught.
What the heck?
We're not going to New York.
What?
Where do we go?
Norway?
We're going to Oslo.
What is it?
Why are they doing this?
- I do not think that should be done.
- What did you say?
It can not be them.
What do you think of everything that is legal?
- Did you talk with co pilot?
- This is a competition!
Do you think that the network Social killing people?
I have to go to pilot.
There are people dying because we are breaking the rules.
We will follow the game no one else was hurt.
They can not kill everyone.
"Mickey, grab a cab!"
"Tom, bring his clothes!"
Frankie Manila is who I am!
Frankie Manila!
See the wonders of the world!
The mysteries of Paris!
A night in the limehouse!
Exotic Cairo!
"You can't afford to miss it, folks!"
There's no charge!
Come in and stay as long as you want!
You got nothing to lose but your worries!
Come on in and have fun!
It's free on the inside!
"Lookie, lookie, lookie what we've got!"
We're having lots of fun in the Fun Palace!

"She tells your past, your present!"
What would you like to know about your future?
Step right in on the inside!
Come in!
Shoot down those little ducks and take a kewpie home!
Step right in on the inside!

"- Now, look at each other!"
Hold it!
Okay!
- Very nice!
- Never a dull moment at the Fun Palace!
"There's something for everyone, from 8 to 80!"
"Yes, sir!"
"Something to surprise the men and shock the women, or vice-versa!"
Madame Sand!
"Oh, what a great honour you do my humble salon!"
"delighted to meet you, Baroness."
"I'm looking for my publisher, Monsieur BuIoz."
"He's in the salon with the others, but you'II have to wait to go in."
I've so longed to meet you!
I knew your father when he was young.
- really?
- Yes.
We girls were enraged when we heard he'd married that dancer.
- You mean my mother?
- Oh... of course.
- Is she still living?
- Yes.
- But she's ill now.
- How sad.
And what a tragedy your father died so young.
The Count de Saxe.
So dashing.
Those idiots!
Excuse me.
Not yet!
(Baroness mutters angrily)
(souIfuI piano passage)
Madame Sand!
Is it true that you're writing a memoir?
"- Do you pray, Baroness?"
"- If you must know, I'm secretly devout."
- Do you ever hear an answer?
- To my prayers?
"well, no."
There... is the answer.
The culprit is...
Jacques Dollon.
Jacques...
"It is not possible, this man is dead."
Where's the gold?
Over there.
Thank you.
"What do you want, Sir?"
"I would like to see Mr Nanteuil, please."
Private business.
Please follow me.
It is Mr Fandor.
Ask him to enter.
"Ah, Mr Fandor."
I did not think I would meet you so fast.
Mr Nanteuil.
Hello.
Sit down.
You're probably not ignoring the excitement caused in Paris by the murder of the Baroness de Vibray.
And the important theft committed against Princess Danidoff.
And how am I concerned?
"The little I know, I learned it by reading your articles in the press, Mr Fandor."
Can you confirm that the Baroness was ruined?
"Well, I do not violate the professional secret by saying"
yes.
She had undergone irretrievable losses.
And Jacques Dollon?
You think he's guilty?
A priori.
From what I've read in the press.
Why?
Do you have any doubts?
How strange.
It's 20 past.
It's just that in Spain we aren't as punctual as you.
But are you sure about what you're saying?
Yes.
"He was speaking with Himmler, I'm sure of it."
"He said: ""Dank, Heinrich"" and hung up."
And he's accepted everything.
We'll call the Ministry.
They will know what's going on in Montserrat.
"No, we're outside Spanish territory."
Our cell phones don't work here.
We'd have to return to Irun and there's no time.
But Amelia and her team are in this time.
We could get off and call from the station.
You're right.
I'm going to get off.
No.
They could call for you at any moment.
It would be suspicious if you weren't here.
I'll take care of it.
"But where do you think you are, Ramblas street market?"
Montserrat is a spiritual retreat.
(Cell Phone)
(Cell Phone)
(Cell Phone)
Excuse me.
(Cell Phone)
Yes.
Irene.
"Well, not too well, truthfully."
"Actually, if I'm honest, things have gone to shit."
I want to know when!
Years ago?
Months ago?
Weeks ago?
It was the night of the fire.
But it was friend sex.
I swear.
He was just so desperate.
He needed someone.
He needed comforting.
So you slept with him?
"Just so we're perfectly clear, you and Ben had sex?"
And he's been trying to make me feel bad about sleeping with Adrian!
And you didn't tell me?
You just let me feel bad about it?
You let me agonize over that one stupid mistake when the two of you did something just as bad!
Or even worse!
What did I ever do to you that you did this to me?
Were you ever going to tell me?
"I mean, if you did this just to get back at me for breaking up with me I think you'd want me to know."
"Geez, Alice."
That's really low.
Henry!
"Pick me up at seven, okay?"
Seven.
I got it.
I'll be there.
What?
You're gonna go through with this?
"Oh, yeah."
Game on.
Hi.
Take it
What are you looking at?
"And you, keep quiet, eh?"
Take it
"Seba, let's go"
Let's go Seba
Let's go Seba
Let's go
Seba!
"They killed him, they killed him"
Pablo
Pablo!
What's happening to you?
"What's happening to you, Pablo?"
Is there anything wrong?
what's happening to you?
What's happening to you?
"What's happening to you, Pablo?"
My god
What's happening to you?
Pablo!
"Seba was shot, right?"
"Don't you worry about that, Pablo"
What a bad luck we had
"What are we going to do, Meca?"
If we don't take him to an hospital
-No
Not to a hospital
"The car, Meca"
You have to burn it
Don't worry Pablo I'm going to burn it right now
I swear I'll burn it right away
Let's welcome up to the...
She needs no introduction.
Vanessa from the Boogie Down!
(Cheers and applause)
Show 'em how it's done.
I'm trying something a little bit different.
I am standing right here.
Tucked in the mess of my own fear.
Far from fine.
In your eyes I seem to fall farther and faster
Than you have time to catch me.
From a boy balanced on his shoulders
Who can take on the stars.
Where were you from bedtime to dawn?
"Tucking me in, instead of ducking out."
Where are your arms when I just need them
To wrap around and hold me?
"I am standing right here, just as you left me."
I am begging right here for you to see me.
I will try and I will try.
I'll try to be whoever you need me.
See me.
(Cheering and applauding)
"Right there in front of your fucking boy,"
I don't give a shit.
Papa!
Vente.
Ven aca.
Vamanos.
Where we going?
We're going for a little ride.
(Woman) Entra.
I thought you didn't believe him.
You convinced me it was all baloney and now what are you saying?
That Morn went to Paris in order to get pregnant?
I'd better kill myself now.
Maybe
Dad and her jumped in bed every time she got back?
"That makes sense too, doesn't it?"
What did she do?
Vacation.
Just vacation?
She'd show up at my house once a year and rest.
- Did she have someone?
- What?
Did she see someone?
How dare you?
!
"Aunt Rosa, answer us."
We just want to know if Mom had someone.
Before or after Dad.
- Why?
- Because!
Why can't just you tell us?
!
- Why are you shouting?
- Because you annoy me!
"If she shouts I won't tell you anything, not about Algeria or anything."
Algeria?
What about Algeria?
Did she have someone in Algeria?
Did she go to Algeria?
How?
They wouldn't let an Israeli in.
"Morning, girls."
Someone had a late night.
What time did the cat drag you in?
I didn't exactly get dragged out.
"Molly, you didn't."
What can I say?
Jimmy is very persuasive.
And nimble.
"You got a guy, peggy?"
I'm afraid I'm married to my work at the moment.
What about mr.
Fancy?
"You know, the guy I've seen around the automat..."
"Nice suit, nice car, nice shoulders."
"Oh, no."
No.
He's just a colleague.
"Good day, ladies."
Early bird and all that.
"Ah, miss carter, please sit."
This will only be a moment.
"In 1925, the great harry houdini"
Performed at this very building.
"Ugh, houdini."
That's never good.
Women stood spellbound and watched
"As he escaped from handcuffs,"
"Straight jackets, steamer trunks."
But the one trick he could not pull off
Was ascending the stairs.
"It's a simple rule, ladies."
No men above the first floor.
I do not hit on your mom.
You always kiss her on the cheek and try to make her like you.
"You're like, ""Oh, that dress is just perfect for the season!"""
Why does your voice always get higher when you do an impression of me?
That's her.
My heart is racing.
I need that stress ball.
You can do this.
Stay calm.
Don't let her get to you.
Do it for Anna-Kat.
Do it for me.
"Okay, I can see I lost you."
Do it for Anna-Kat.
Okay.
Relax.
There's no way she can make an entire family Thanksgiving about herself.
"Oh, God."
She upped her game.
Happy Thanksgiving.
"I'll just take this heavy bag upstairs, then."
- All by myself.
"- Okay, great."
Be careful of that clicky elbow.
What happened to your mom?
Absolutely nothing.
She is looking for attention.
You didn't ask?
She could be really hurt.
"Oh, please."
That thing isn't even bolted into her head.
- I should go help her.
"I'm all right, thanks."
Just...
I'm all right.
"Built in 1972, then demolished the following year before being rebuilt in 85, the Bulwer-Lytton building is a classic example of the late modernist, post-Bauhaus development from humanist rationalist impulses from utility."
"Inspired by Alvar Aalto's signature style, the building is built..."
Psst!
In here.
Come in here.
"... Social interaction and the hyper relevance of volume as, er..."
I wanna talk to you.
"Come here, then."
What are you doing?
The idea is to walk across the room.
The room's full of shit.
This is a lab.
It's an experiment.
Come here.
For fuck's sake.
Fuck.
"Oh, shit!"
Bollocks.
Well done.
Well done?
"You got here, though."
What do you want from me?
Hey!
Who's in there?
Over here!
Better run.
Hey!
Stop!
"Come back here, you!"
"This is called ""Act like a Man""!"
The way you throw dart could be exhausting
It's my fault!
If only I knew you carried so many rusted tins
I'll kill you fast!
"Now you're prepared, it'd be a bit harder"
"You're so smart, you can learn from me... in such a short time"
Now it's my turn!
Finished?
Killed?
That's what you taught me
Act like a Man
Fan San is killed suddenly
Who possibly can kill him?
"Dad, could it be a hero... who wants to deliver justice for us all?"
Hero?
I smell trouble!
That's right.
Now that someone is killed
Don't know how he will torture us again
"Gao, running around again?"
Where've you been?
I went to pee!
Pee again!
You pee all day long
Kidney failure?
How do you know?
How dare you!
T easing me!
"No, I'm not"
"Y es, you are!"
"You are, too"
One minute and 11 seconds.
Oh.
"Oh, this is a wonder spot, Jeeves."
I bet this reeks with romance.
"- I hope not, sir."
- Yes.
"Anyway, it's a nice place for rest and quiet."
"I consider it the most peaceful spot in the whole of England, sir."
"Good egg, Jeeves, good egg."
I—
I wonder what's happened to our passenger.
That Ethiopian fellow seems to have evaporated.
"You'll probably find him down the road, sir, draped on a bush."
Do something about it because it worries me exceedingly.
I'll go and have lunch.
"Yes, sir."
Hello!
Hello!
"Yes, sir, Massa Gabriel, I's coming."
- Us plays the horn too.
"- Well, come on."
"Come, come."
We're there.
- Where?
- Here!
- Ain't I in pieces?
- You're as right as right can be.
Will y'all give me your word I ain't dead?
"Come on, come on."
Get out of the car and buzz off.
Is us in Leeds?
Leeds is many miles from here.
"Kiddo, we did it!"
What is this idiot babbling about?
"Right, as if you two didn't know, huh?"
The whole town's buzzin' about the prince gettin' hitched this afternoon!
"You know, he's getting married."
You silly side-walker.
I just wanted to wish ya luck.
I'll catch ya later.
I wouldn't miss it!
"[Grimsby] Well, now, Eric."
It appears that I was mistaken.
"This mystery maiden of yours does, in fact, exist."
[Grimsby] A-And she is lovely.
"Congratulations, my dear."
[Eric] We wish to be married as soon as possible.
"[Grimsby] Oh, yes, of course, Eric, but, uh, these things do take time, you know."
"This afternoon, Grimsby."
The wedding ship departs at sunset.
Oh.
Oh.
"Very well, Eric, uh, as you wish."

"No, no, I didn't."
"Woollahra, thanks."
Um...
"What do you think you're doing, you bastard?"

Give those back!
Have you told the school?
Shit!
Don't let him in!
"No, I don't want my son's head pixelated all over the Sunday papers."
"Crown Street, thanks."
Where are your manners?
He'll tire of this woman.
Boys can't see straight with a hard-on.
No 15-year-old boy is going to tire of a woman shoving perfect tits in his face.
"You need to know that you have ruined his life, OK?"
And you have ruined my life.

His English teacher.
Have you ever had sex with any of your teachers?
"No, neither did I."
You need a hand with the biros?

Bevan didn't mind it but...
Why don´t you try and go get some rest?
I´m on this.
"(speakerphone) Mr President, Mrs Palmer´s here to see you."
"Send her in, please."
Start waking people up.
Set up a conference call with the cabinet members -
"Homeland Security, fbi, National Health Services."
- We´re gonna need everyone on this one.
"- Yes, sir."
Wayne.
"Sherry, I asked you here to help me, not make things worse."
I did not want you going to Alan Milliken´s house.
"Relax, David. I didn´t go there."
- You didn´t go?
- No.
"When we spoke on the phone, you told me it was crucial that you speak to Julia in person."
Yes.
And I changed my mind.
I spoke to her over the phone.
- About what?
- About Kelly´s disappearance.
I asked her if she would check Alan´s cellphone for any recently made calls.
- And?
- She wouldn´t do it.
"You don´t take no for an answer, Sherry."
What aren´t you telling me?
"Nothing, David. I swear."
What have you been up to if you weren´t at Milliken´s?
- Making calls.
- You could have made them from here.
"Yes, but I didn´t."
I parked on the side of the road.
- You have pain anywhere else?
"- Scale of 1-10, how's your pain?"
- Forty.
- How you feel?
- Talk to the elephant on my chest.
- It could-
- Excuse me.
You mind?
- What are your names?
- I'm Pete and he's Derek.
Can you take Pete and Derek to the TV room.
"One, Pratt!"
"Okay, here."
Come on.
Is there any way that we can wait in the doctors' lounge?
As soon as you' re a doctor.
"- Tombstones in two, three and F."
- Better with the spray under your tongue?
No.
"What do you mean by ""tombstones? """
It's a non-medical way of describing the line tracings on an EKG.
"It's not good news, Mr. Royston."
It looks like you' re having a heart attack.
- Aspirin?
- Already gave him 80.
"Push five of Metoprolol, titrate morphine, start heparin and nitro drips."
- Call Cards and cath lab.
- What's going on?
What's he gonna do?
There's a blocked vessel.
We open it with a balloon to stop your attack.
We need your permission.
"A pneumoencephalogram, I would think, to pin down that lesion."
It will involve another spinal.
"Oh, Christ!"
"Well, what we missed in the EEG and the arteriograms could conceivably turn up there."
At least it would eliminate certain other possibilities.
Dr. Taney says the x-rays are negative.
"In other words, normal."
You keep any drugs in your house?
"No, of course not."
Nothing like that.
Are you sure?
"Well, of course, I'm sure."
I'd tell you.
"Christ, I don't even smoke grass."
Are you planning to be home soon?
"I mean, uh, to L.A., I mean."
Um....
"No, I, uh--"
I'm building a new house.
My old one has been sold.
I don't know.
I was gonna take....
I was gonna take Regan to Europe for a while after she finished school.
Why do you ask?
I think it's time we started looking for a psychiatrist.
Hello?
Sharon?
Shit.
God.
Sharon!
"What do you mean, leaving Regan by herself?"
Her window's wide open.
Landlord says she lives alone.
"And it appears that Pamela or JMJ or whoever, has a predilection for white cotton gloves."
He saw white cotton gloves?
Through her bathroom window.
12 pairs hanging on clothes pegs from her shower curtain.
It's her!
She's the killer!
She's the killer!
Yeah.
The electronic scratch on those anonymous calls?
She used a device to make her voice sound like a man's.
"Sorry about the interruption, JMJ, it was rude."
My name is Pamela.
Pamela?
Do you have a light?
Hmm.
I'm confused.
Why does the lease to your apartment read JMJ Wilgis?
My lease?
"What do your initials stand for, JMJ?"
Pamela.
It's Pamela.
Then who's JMJ?
"Is she, what, your sister?"
Why does she have 12 pairs of white cotton gloves hanging on her shower curtain?
- Answer me!
- You can't treat me like crap!
- Sit down.
- Go to hell!
- Sit down!
- No!
Sit... down!
Yeah.
It's good woodwork.
- That's this place.
- Full marks for observation.
Mm-hmm!
Yep!
"Alright, there we go."
Ah!
"- Oh, shit."
- What's up?
I just forgot I don't have my phone.
"I keep going for it, I forget it's not in my pocket."
"And there's, uh... no TV here, so..."
Welcome to the 19th century.
"No TV, no Internet, no wi-fi."
Yeah.
No wonder people were seeing shit.
Probably were just bored out of their gourds.
"Well, that's the leading theory about ghost sightings."
The mind plays tricks when less stimulated.
"Fewer distractions, people saw more ghosts."
Isn't that a nice piece of info?

"Oh, my God, I can't remember the actual last time that I read a book."
To think people used to do this on purpose.
I know.
Crazy.
Why?
"- You know, I don't think I've..."
"- Shh, alright?"
I need to get into some old-school shit here.
- I love you too.
I'm OK.
OK.
Your mom told me what happened.
I'm sorry.
- Sorry about missing dinner.
- It's OK.
I was just worried.
The last time you sounded like that...
I was with my sponsor.
Oh.
- That's good.
"- Look, I get it if you're angry at me."
I'm not angry.
I just don't know if I can handle it.
That's why they tell you not to date anyone your first year you're clean.
I never understood that before tonight because I couldn't deal with anyone or anything but me.
That's how it should be.
"Look, you weren't wrong to worry, OK?"
"I just don't think I'm ready for a relationship, Tyler."
I know.
I know.
I just want you to be OK.
"More than anything I want for us, I want that for you."
Come here.
It's OK.
Have you talked to Mom?
"I keep trying to reach her, but she's not picking up, at least not for me."
"Yeah, not for me either."
Let me be the one to kick Holly out of our lives once and for all.
"Sarah, Holly's not going anywhere."
Nor do I want her to.
Ritzy.
- I really don't want to wear a corsage.
- They're all paid for.
- Really.
It's too much.
- Your mother wants you to pick one.
"- Really, it's okay."
She'll just come back here herself.
"- This one, thanks."
- Good choice.
The cameraman said that would look best on film.
- So you're the rich girl.
- Maybe.
I'm not rich... but my parents have money.
But I'm totally self-sufficient.
I take nothing from them except this corsage and my daughter's tuition.
"So, are you gonna stone me?"
I should've guessed.
Look at her friends.
They're wearing suits that drip money.
"Hey, pal, this was 30% off."
That's why you didn't want to get pizza 'cause it's below you?
"No, Liza."
Pizza is not below me.
I love pizza.
I eat tons of pizza.
It's one of my four major food groups.
"Candy, popcorn, and pizza."
See.
It's two of my food groups.
That's how much I love pizza.
I want to believe you.
"I'm sorry, I didn't mean that."
I didn't mean it.
I know that Alex wasn't just some guy.
"Oh, it's okay."
"It's my fault, you know."
What?
"Oh, I just think I need to take responsibility for my share in the whole mess."
You know?
I forced him into getting married.
"- You know, he wasn't ready."
"- Janine, this isn't your fault."
"No, it is."
"It is, I've changed."
"I was fun, you know?"
I was fun when we first met.
You're still fun.
[SIGHS]
We don't have sex anymore.
Lots of couples go through lulls.
"No, I mean we never have sex."
[JANINE CRYING]
"I mean, realistically, what do I expect him to do, you know?"
I don't think that's really...
"God, this tile is too small."
I have to tell Javier.
- What?
- This tile is too small.
I gotta go.
"I have to take a personal day, if anyone asks."
MARIEL:
"Well, my first husband was unimpressive."
I found him in bed with his big-breasted secretary when I came home early from the Maldives.
"♪ if this is all in sight, I don't want your kind of love ♪"
"Oh, I've been on my feet so long, I've sprouted roots."
"Hello, angie, sorry."
"An 8-hour shift, and I got a whole 50 cents in tips."
The war's over.
I thought we were all spending money again.
How was your day?
Would have been a considerable improvement.
I got a bottle of schnapps and half a rhubarb pie.
Let's see which one makes us sick first.
"Oh, sounds lovely, but I was just about to go to bed."
"It's 8:00, grandma."
Come on.
Tell me about your crappy day.
I'm really tired.
M-maybe some other time.
Didn't mean to disturb you.
"No, you didn't disturb me."
I ju...
"no, it's fine."
I know a brush-off when I see it.
Angie...
oh.
"Ah, miss carter, miss martinelli,"
"May I introduce you to our new resident,"
Miss dorothy underwood?
"Oh, call me dottie."
Nice to meet you.
"This place is pretty swell, huh?"
Hmm.
"Seems like one big, happy family."
"No, it's a pleasure to meet you."
I feel a bit...
"- Yeah, yeah."
- Can you...?
Stop the car!
Stop the car!
Mm?
It's done.
So are either of the kids' fathers gonna turn up to this dance of theirs?
Abi's dad sends money and a card each birthday.
"Rob's dad, nothing at all."
I could come if you want.
To the dance.
They'd love that.
"They think you're great, you know."
Rob said you were cool.
Got some catching up to do.
"Like you said, you're not going anywhere, right?"
"They're good kids, Jess."
You've done a brilliant job with them.
I can't find my shoe.
I'll need it for the beach.
"This is freedom, isn't it?"
One simple rule worth remembering.
I call the shots.
"Not watching porn or playing one of your computer games, Calum?"
- I couldn't sleep.
"- Yeah, me neither."
"When we was in the car, my breathing went all funny."
I couldn't get air into my lungs.
It's panic.
And the best way of controlling that is singing.
"Sing to yourself - it controls stuff inside, takes your mind off stuff."
God damn it!
Shit!
Sorry I'm late.
Traffic.
Ready to go?
♫ The city street is hot ♫
♫ The heat has escalated ♫
♫ Every corner in the town ♫
♫ There's a paycheck ♫
Patty:
God damn it.
"♫ Well, they pretend they like you ♫"
♫ But man's best friend will bite you ♫
♫ Just for fun ♫
"♫ If they're gunning for you, boy ♫"
♫ You've already won ♫
All right.
This matter is now in session.
The Honorable Rosten Keller presiding.
"Oh, here we go."
"The Estate of Ryan Larson, et al, versus Borns Technology."
"Parties are present, Your Honor."
Be seated.
Ahem.
This matter is here for a status hearing.
"I'm looking at the file, but I see very little progress."
I don't like that.
"Well, Your Honor, we've been conducting depositions"
- and taking testimony--
- No.
They've been doing depositions.
"In fact, from where I sit, you've done next to nothing since we last convened other than show up at my house uninvited."
Whatever it takes.
Okay.
"Do the job, Emerson."
I don't wanna look like an ass for sticking my neck out on this one.
"'Cause I've got nothing left, nothing to keep you from the wolves."
0-7-3.
4-5-5.
8-1 -7.
6-9-0-1 -0.
Sorry.
Little last-minute broadcast come through.
I'll inform the authorities.
You do that.
- Wanna hear my latest theory?
- Sure.
We're coordinating troop movements in Afghanistan.
- Long-term tactical formations.
- Yeah.
"Illegal missions unsanctioned by the UN, that's why it's all hush-hush."
Could be.
"- It's good, right?"
- Yeah.
Maybe it's all just some sort of awful experiment.
"Stuff two people in a box, see how long it takes for one of us to kill the other."
- That's nice.
- Give me something.
We're up two hours early next shift.
- You guys been waiting long?
"- No, you're good."
- Good shift?
- Yeah.
Got to catch up on sitting alone for 70 hours.
What the hell?
Stay where you are!
"Wait, we're trapped in the house."
Stay where you are.
The pair of dead bodies inside.
"Our friends, okay."
Blair.
"I'm sorry, she does that when she's scared."
Everybody down on the ground now!
Do it.
"Officer, you're not listening to me."
"This man is a murderer, okay."
He killed both of our friends.
That's a lie.
"Just do what I say, and we'll sort this out."
Sheriff.
"I couldn't say anything before, but, they've been holding me hostage, and they're robbing' my house."
That's a fuckin' lie.
Don't believe him.
Everybody shut up!
You will talk only when I say so.
Is that clear?
"Officer, you gotta listen to me."
Shut up.
"Take these, cuff yourselves to that post right over there."
What about him?
He said shut up.
You shut up.
"No, you shut up."
Everybody shut up!
"Let me take care of him, all right?"
Just do what I say.
How's your head?
It's fine.
I heard you stopped by Med the other day to see Anna.
She wouldn't see me.
No.
It was us that wouldn't let you see her.
"At the time, you represented hope for her, Kelly."
Did something happen?
"No, no, not that."
"But yes, something did."
"Her neutrophil count came up overnight, and we started her back on chemo this morning."
We want to take another shot at the bone marrow transplant.
"I mean, assuming we still have a donor."
Not even a question.
"Yeah, in 24 hours, we think she'll be strong enough to do it."
That's... that's great news.
"Truck 81, Engine 51."
"All right, buddy."
You go be a hero.
I'm gonna schedule your donation for tomorrow.
- All right.
- 7110 South St. Lawrence.
Help!
Please!
Maggie's trapped upstairs!
- Where?
- Up there!
"- Severide, Squad!"
- On it!
- Anybody else up there?
- No.
"Casey, vent the roof."
I was thinking a 99 Euro show.
Do you want something with style or do you want to be cheap?
Who'd pay me that?
Doesn't 99 sound better than 100?
In the supermarket sure...
"But for your event, 99 sounds as stupid as 100."
Sitting up there in his hotel suite and dreaming of the whole wide world...
How much do you think I earn in this place?
Definitely more than we do in our hotel.
"That's your fault, my dear Alfons."
"Just to settle it, Toni's 500 Euro show."
And that's exactly the amount I want for each night.
You've got to be kidding.
Yes Franz?
I just wanted to check up on you.
I'm doing fine.
Are you alone?
No.
How come?
What is all this here?
Who is that?
That's my brother Franz.
Franz this is Max.
Can we talk for a moment Babette?
No.
- Would you leave please?
Why?
Why should I?
Listen this isn't the right time.
Okay?
Who the hell are you?
I don't even know you.
- [Chuckling]
"Oh, I find it fascinating, especially that you have a family business."
It all looks so fun.
"Oh, it can be."
"I guess most days we're either having fun,"
- or ready to strangle one another.
- [Laughing]
- [Overlapping dialog] - [Laughing]
Were you interested in carpets as a child?
- Well...
"- Oh, I think he came out the womb"
- with a book of swatches.
"- No, stop that."
"No, now, when we first got started, it wasn't about carpets,"
I just wanted a family business.
I just came to love carpets.
- Oh.
"- So, what are you doing in Denver?"
"Uh... um, my flight had a layover, and then it was canceled, and, uh, I was out, um, following my sons who are DJs."
- Oh.
- Uh-huh.
"Uh, they're names are Logan and Cody."
They call themselves the Loco Twins.
"Which I guess, in Spanish, means crazy."
[Laughing]
"Uh, maybe you know them?"
"Um, I don't think so."
Oh.
"Well, they opened for the Chemical Brothers."
"Oh, I think I heard of them."
"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
- They're very well respected.
"- Remember, bust them, you buy them."
"- Yeah, yeah."
"Hey, you know what you're doing?"
- We're running out of fuel.
- You're lying.
"The aircraft was topped off to tour Honolulu, not island hop."
"Take a look, you see that?"
That's ten minutes max.
- It's 15 to Molokai.
"- Look, just find a way, all right?"
"Spoke to Honolulu approach, your bird is 6 miles east-southeast heading towards Molokai."
"Okay, copy that."
"Chin, over there."
They should be in that direction.
Got them.
About three miles east.
Don't lose them.
I'm coming around.
- What's going on?
- What do you think is going on?
"All right, here we go."
"Everyone, hang on."
This is gonna get ugly.
- They just went down.
- Yeah.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
Got a single gunshot wound.
He's dead.
Family's gone.
He took them hostage.
"Look, just let my wife and my son go, I'll do..."
"None of you are going anywhere till I get off this island, all right?"
Guys!
Guys!
I'm a fucking genius.
"I know, but look at that painting."
Holy shit!
I know.
"I mean, the camera sees my work before I do it."
It's just incredible.
I don't have to be blocked anymore!
(GROANS)
(GRUNTS) I'm in.
(CHUCKLES) Yes!
Yes.
(CHUCKLES)
(HOWLS)
(SIGHS)
(GLASS CLINKS)
You're up early.
What time is it?
How about we start with what year is it?
"Oh, so you can write in a dead man's journal, but I'm not allowed to wear his hat?"
"This isn't poetry, Jasper,"
I'm making our to-do list.
"If we're really going through with this, we need to start making it look like Mr. B's still around."
"I mean, this is actually happening?"
"What are you talking about, bro?"
It already happened.
It's done.
"Well, I mean, we could just not go through with it."
"Actually, I think we have to."
"If I understand this correctly, this is how it works."
The camera spits out a photo of us in the future.
"No, I'm fine."
I'm fine.
I know exactly what I'm doing.
"OK, but we could really use your help with the new mosque, and we were hoping that you'd changed your mind."
Yeah.
It's just that I can't do something I don't believe in.
"Well, you obviously haven't totally lost your faith,"
- You're eating turkey bacon.
- The thing is...
- Ah!
Spit it out!
Spit it out!
- What?
You have lots.
It's not turkey bacon.
Sorry.
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
[ sigh ]
That's wine.
Kidding!
[ sigh ]
Stupid answering machine!
"Where are you, Charles Thorne?"
"Guess who had bacon this morning, real bacon?"
- I did.
"- No, I did."
I've finally took that last step away from my old life.
"Sarah, I love you, but your religious crisis is getting in the way of my real crisis."
"Well, then I guess you don't want half my BLT."
"Hell, yeah!"
Less dork... more pork.
This one looks more like a prison than a mosque.
"Look, I keep telling you, I haven't got a girl."
- What's she like?
"- Oh, about 40."
I thought you said she was a girl.
- I wasn't referring to her age.
- Eh?
Oh.
Poor Henry.
"It never rains but it pours, hmm?"
I've never seen her before.
It's a lie.
- What?
- Whatever she says I've done.
- Oughtn't you go and find out?
"- Yes, I jolly well will."
And be careful.
You might fall.
- Good evening.
Did you want me?
- I'm sorry to come like this.
"I know you've done something dreadful, too, but you needn't pay a penny."
- What are you talking about?
- That beastly Dennis.
"Come here, will you?"
...and there were magazines on Sonny MacGregor and a lady called Ransom.
"Now I've nothing to lose, I'm going to expose everything."
- To whom?
- To the police.
You may have nothing to lose but other people have.
"- You don't want to pay him, do you?"
- I have my reputation to think of.
I can't discuss this with you here.
"-Either I will go, or go... hopefully."
"It sees, María."
"-Yes, lady."
"And now it studies, that you have the examinations."
"yes, study, study..."
What I am going to study?
"We do something, comes."
"God, what beautiful you are..."
No.
-Why no?
-Because not and point.
If everybody does.
"Stay put, watch the film."
"-Sight, watches what it is doing to him."
-If you knew what you haríía I...
"Only would to see if still worked,"
If I worked or I endorse?
"They call Perennial Dust to me,"
"In addition, after a time between grates,"
"Then all good goes,"
"You remember lnés Badoer, its artistic name, if therefore it is possible to be said, Inés?"
To the attack!
"Alvaro, quiet."
It is possible that you only think about that?
"Yes, Yes."
Only in that.
You already know that I do not want.
"But, if we are engaged."
Indeed.
Ten patience?
no?
"Have I it, she is who does not have it."
Or...
Or maybe you couldjust check it out before Maintenance gets here.
And risk angering a restless spirit?
"No, no, no."
"No, no, no."
That's not how I roll.
Okay.
Uh...
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.
Mr. And Mrs. Burke.
We will...
We will send somebody up right away.
Thanks very much.
Okay.
"Oh, and could you tell Maintenance to take a look at the shower door while they're here?"
I got stuck in there this morning.
No problem.
Did you hear that?
Did you hear that?
The shower door?
In the same shower door where Monica was stuck?
In the same bathroom where her ashes were flushed down the toilet?
You really are superstitious?
I just figured fixing a thermostat was beneath you.
Superstitious?
No.
Spiritual?
Yes.
"I grew up in my grandmother's house, Danny."
"And when she died, strange things started happening."
Footsteps when there was no one there.
Light turning on and off.
You repair what is broken between you.
Peter?
Dad?
Daddy?
Ralphie's dead.
"Ohh, I'm sorry."
"I'm so sorry, bubele."
"Shall we say kaddish for him, huh?"
"What's a ""cad dish""?"
Kaddish is a sacred prayer for the dead that will send Ralphie to a blessed life in Olam Ha-Ba where Hashem will welcome him.
"Please don't talk gibberish to our son, Jacob."
"Sweetie, ralphie died 'cause fish don't live as long as people do."
"We'll get you another one, okay?"
- Tie your shoes.
- I want...
I want Ralphie.
"Well, we'll get you a better one."
What is your problem?
All he needed was a hug.
You're late for the partner's meeting.
"Your shoes are polished, Mr. Myers."
I ironed your blue sea island cotton shirt.
Cufflink choices are here.
"Thank you, Rosalinda."
"Yesterday, I noticed you didn't eat your strawberries..."
I-I don't really like them.
"So, today, I put in bananas and peanut butter, okay?"
You got to promise to eat it.
Daddy?
Mr. Myers?
Bezeh hammaqom tehi b'rakhah v'shalom.
"That means, ""may this home be filled with the blessing of joy and peace."""
"I beg your pardon, sir, for barging in."
- Get out of here!
"- I'm trying, sir."
"All right, I'll see that you do."
Wait here a minute.
MacGregor...
What the devil are you doing?
- Do you want to know who I am?
"- Yes, I do."
"Well, sir, see, I'm from the London Bureau of Boats, Barges, Brigs, all tethered bottoms and maintenance of, sir... that's it."
Maintenance?
This place is condemned.
I'm the last one.
Lucky you are.
"If you've got wet rot on the top, you've got dry rot on the bottom."
- What are you talking about?
- I'll show you.
Look at that.
- What...?
- Oh!
I'll see what I can do.
I'll put my report in... and I'll try and get them before they close.
"I haven't got a cork with me, so I'll be back later..."
"Terrible thing, you've got there."
"Dreadful thing, that."
"Terrible mess you've got there, terrible mess."
- Madam?
"- Some knock-out drops, please."
- Some...?
- Knock-out drops.
- You want a pick-me-up?
"- If I did, I would say so."
"We came this far by faith, Lord."
"And we ask you, Father, when he get in college, Lord... to keep him, Lord- keep him protected."
"We thank you for him,Jesus."
- In Jesus' name we pray.
Amen.
- Amen.
"Oh,you can cry like a river, girl."
"You're crying so bad, I won't even make fun of you."
"Oh, God."
- I'm gonna miss you.
- I'll miss you too.
"I want you to be good, okay?"
"And don't, uh, get mixed up in none of that old stuff that, uh, you know."
I done told you what to do.
"Don't get no alcohol, no wine coolers."
None of that stuff.
Bye-bye.
I just hope he stay in there.
That's what worries me most.
"Once he get in the door, I want him to stay in there for four years."
Think he gonna make it?
You do?
I think he gonna make it.
"Well, I hope so anyway."
When I was young
"- When I was little, that's all I used to think about- the NBA."
"If I set my mind, I can"
- I can go.
I can st
- I can go.
Get in good college.
I can go.
Get a room!
I know you and I are history.
I just hope that we can reconnect on some level.
Maybe even be friends.
Yes!

Sorry?
There's a what?
"""without the classic distraction maneuver"
"""known as the 'bait and switch.'"
"""The key is picking the appropriate unsuspecting target."""
So we're really gonna do this?
"I mean, I want to find her, man."
"I really do, but... this guy and his family?"
- That'll make us just as bad as...
- Ava.
"You know, one of those books said you can't cheat an honest man."
"Yeah, I read that."
I still don't get it.
"- Hey, thank you."
- You're welcome.
"It's like there are people who set themselves up to be taken because they're, you know, greedy or selfish or mean."
You know what?
We need some ground rules.
Those are your pads.
"Here you go, two!"
"Zen is peace, clarity, focus."
Empty your minds of all distractions.
"Don't think, just be."
What if I have to think about not thinking?
- Shut up.
- I have that same problem.
- Hey.
- Sorry.
"When you're passing the puck, you're sharing your soul."
"You're saying, ""Here, I trust you with this precious and rare gift, my brother."""
- Nice.
- Don't be angry with the puck.
Release the energy.
- Slow.
- Nice.
Like that.
Nice and easy.
- Release through the body.
- Be one with the universe.
- Nice.
- Beautiful.
Love that.
Wow!
You work much here or...

- Condiment art?
Lt's very popular in Taiwan.
I sell them on eBay.
Made $50 once.
Really?
But this time it's totally about the crying.
So he showed a little emotion.
Girls are supposed to like that.
I do not need the chase.
"Bella,you're a control freak."
You love a project.
"To you,an ambivalent guy is like a poorly organized closet."
I don't...
I don't want ambivalence.
I want to be adored.
Johnny's great.
The guy touches my face.
You know how many face-touching guys are left out there?
I hope it's a similar amount to the number of hand-washing guys.
"Good morning,my love!"
"Dude,just sack up,already."
Geez!
I saw it.
It was fine.
It was cute.
Whatever.
Excuse me.
Gotta go to the office.
Later.
What the hell did you do to this thing?
Were you hanging from it?
Nothing.
I don't know.
It's old.
- You had sex right there.
- Shut up.
- Right where your father is.
a book I believe both of these generals my be familiar with.
"Come on, rock star."
"Ok, it's on you, Joe."
"Ok, ok."
3 kings.
That's pretty good.
That's pretty good.
Whoa!
Full house.
Marines have landed.
"Ok, I don't know if you're ready what I got right here."
"Oh, I think we're ready."
Because in the words of Mr. Withers...
Ain't no sunshine in these cards.
"Oh, man!"
"All right, all right, all right."
"No, wait."
We agreed 25% of every pot goes to the baby Morgan tuition fund.
Much appreciated.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
"Where is this child going to school,"
Harvard and Yale?
"Hey, listen, I really appreciate you letting me rob you for the night, but, uh,"
I gotta get up out of here.
Come on come on.
For what?
You get 25% out of each pot just for sitting there.
"- Ok, look here, pops--"
- Said the weasel.
"Ok, ok, I clearly cannot compete at this table, but, uh, look, I gotta go hang out with wifey."
We're taking those Lamaze lessons.
Get your rear end in here.
"Lightning McQueen, you are wicked fast!"

"""Fred. "" Fred, thank you."
He knows my name.
He knows my name!
"Looking good, Freddie!"
"Thanks to you, Lightning, we had a banner year!"
We might clear enough to buy you some headlights.
You saying he doesn't have headlights?
That's what I'm telling ya.
They're stickers!
"Well, you know, racecars don't need headlights, because the track is always lit."
"Yeah, well, so is my brother, but he still needs headlights."
"- Ladies and gentlemen,"
- Lightning McQueen!

"You know, the Rust-eze Medicated Bumper Ointment team ran a great race today."
"And remember, with a little Rust-eze..."

"Fine, fine..."
We'll drink until we're drunk!
Right-have some more!
Some more!
"No, no-that's dangerous!"
It's best not to drink too much
"Come on, have a drink!"
Have a drink!
"No, no..."
You've had a lot-l'll help you inside
Who says I'm drunk?
I'm no drunk!
What's this?

Right-l wasn't your life for keeps
"Oh, no."

We've got to find a way to save him!
Can we do it?
Yes-with this!
"How'd you like to help me do some good, serve up a little karmic justice?"
–Joe...
"–Hey, 20 bucks says we bust him on a felony before nightfall."
These assholes could win a lottery and still not keep their noses clean.
See that little prick?
"He got one over on me, man."
–You know that ain't right.
"–Yes, I know it's not right."
–Then here we go.
–Lookee here!
–Jesus Christ.
–Bitch that made me rich!

I'll just buy me a new one.
"Hey, what's this?"
- Cathet...
- Pressure's up to 95 palp.
No gross blood.
Where do you need me?
- We're all set.
- She's good.
"Thanks, Sam."
We'll take it from here.
I'll go check on his kids.
She's really not sure what happened.
She gave herself a good whack in the head.
We can't do anything if she doesn't identify her assailants.
That's okay.
"Like I said, she's not sure what she remembers."
She's not even certain it was intentional now.
Fine.
Let me know if she changes her mind.
You did the right thing.
The next step is to get your wife some help.
No.
The next step is for me to take her home.
"My wife is not crazy, okay?"
She had an accident.
It happens.
"I'd rather she chose to stay, than have psychiatry put her on forced hold."
She's gonna be with me.
She's gonna be fine.
Just leave us alone.
I mean it.
Pressure's up to 100 systolic.
Crit's 28.
Send another 4 units to angio.
You'd never met him?
"I've never seen him before this morning, hand to God."
"Look, the cops got it all wrong, man."
You know I would never do this.
You gotta believe me.
"You believe me, right?"
Yeah.
But it's not me you need to worry about.
"No, please, just don't tell Jackie."
"And it's not your sister, either."
Gibbs is my best agent.
Convince him.
"Tell him the truth, everything will be okay."
Minute's up.
No record.
This your first arrest?
First and only.
"I'm a good person, Agent Gibbs; ask Leon."
I'm not asking him.
I'm asking you.
"Well, I just meant he knows who I am."
He knows I'd never kill anybody.
Cops say they found you with blood on your hands.
I was trying to stop that kid from bleeding to death.
They said that you were asking skittish.
That you couldn't get your story straight.
They wouldn't let me talk.
I tried to tell them what happened.
They wouldn't listen.
They just assumed I was lying.
Okay.
I'm listening.
I stopped at Krispy Kreme donuts.
That's it?
.
"No, that's not it."
The hot light was on.
Feel these things.
They're practically radioactive.
"Please, don't ask me for details about Scott."
"Oh, I'm not going to."
"He's totally wrong for me, he's unpredictable, and his neck smells better than that bag of donuts."
"Apparently your hot light is on, as well."
"But if you don't want to talk about it, I'm certainly not going to probe."
I know you're a very private person...
- Sit.
- You are so easy.
Would this be the same Scott you kissed the other day?
The one your dad detests?
"Hmm, yep, that's the one."
Sleeping with the enemy.
I'm not sleeping with anyone.
And such a shame.
Like a Maserati up on blocks.
"Oh, it's my dad."
"When I left work today to sneak out with Scott, I told him I was coming down with something."
"Hey, Dad."
Sorry my voice is all...
"Yeah, sure, I'll hold for him..."
"Hey, Dad..."
"Yeah, a little."
"Yeah, I know."
A lot of fluids.
Okay.
- You off-duty?
- This isn't a cab.
Are you off-duty?
"I had laryngitis, remember?"
I was sick this whole time.
You didn't sound like you during this.
- During this stuff?
"- Yeah, during all this stuff."
"Aaron Yoo was really driving that van, by the way."
Confidently.
- It doesn't sound like I have laryngitis.
- I don't think you sound that different.
"It's because Self, our PA from heaven, used to bring me hot beverages."
- We miss you.
- I love Self.
- you two might get stuck.
Having some trouble?
"Hey, I bet that wasn't looped."
I was with Jonny...
I was with Jonny during that moment.
ADR.
Whatever.
"I'm not trying to show off, I'm just saying."
You know what though?
This is bad because I'm loving watching this and not saying anything interesting.
Don't look at it.
"- Yeah, look away."
- I can't look away.
"Hey, I think I should..."
- This was freezing.
- This is from cold.
- This awkward...
Dr. Cairn had it personally adjusted for you.
- Thank you.
- Very good.
Please!
Please don't do this!
Where is Dr. Cairn?
!
"- Dr. Cairn has given you to me, my exquisite... pitiful little creature."
"- I'll do better, I promise."
Please give me a second chance.
"Please, please."
- Don't worry.
This will all be over soon.
This is a special day.
"- No, no, no."
- A celebration.
"- No, no, no."
- In your honour.
- No.
"Life is changed, not taken away."
Bodies grow slowly and die quickly.
- How have your dreams been of late?
"- After my parents' passing,"
I had the most frightful nightmares.
- Mm-hmm.
- Now... my dreams are different.
- Different how?
"Isabel, we spoke about this last week."
"Without complete honesty, the healing cannot take place."
"- Yes, sir."
"Lately, my dreams have been... strange."
"They feel so real, I hardly know where the dream ends and reality begins."
I don't understand.
How does that make you money?
Do carol singers have to pay you 10 percent?
"They should, but you can't always catch the little bastards."
It's on every Christmas album ever made.
Elvis did it.
The Muppets.
An American punk band called...
Remember where we live?
"Flat 2, 31 Craysfield Road, Islington, London, N12SF."
"England, the world, the universe."
Yeah.
We'd like to go to Planet Hollywood.
Jesus.
Really?
Yeah.
It's supposed to be brilliant.
Planet Hollywood is horrible.
Marcus?
This is hopeless.
Look at the length of the queue.
"It's probably because Bruce Willis is inside, or Sylvester Stallone."
They won't be in there.
"Yes, they will."
They're here all the time.
Unless they're working.
"Even then, they try to make films in London so they can come here for lunch."
I'm really hungry.
Does this place you're talking about have good fries?
Fantastic fries.
Come on.
Let's go.
Harry.
Come on.
Harry.
"Harry, come on we've got so much to do today."
"please, my darling."
"Yeah, thank you."
Love you.
"Come on, now."
Harry.
That is sick.
holy wow.
Nice to meet you.
What's your name?
Liam.
I went on X Factor when I was 1 4 the first time.
It's bad news.
Simon sent me home because I was too young.
Why are you here today?
I'm here to be the best artist I can be.
he first time  saw the One Direction boys was when they auditioned as solo artists for he X Factor.
"I don't know if any of you have seen my first audition, but it was horrendous."
I hope it doesn't make any part of this movie.
just murdered it.
I'd Iike to make a personal apology to plain White T's.
hello.
So tell me a bit about you.
-I work in a bakery.
-And was asking stupid questions about what pies are popular.
You see these people  that audition for the show and they come from  the same sort of background as you.
"They just come from normal, working-cIass families."
-What's your name?
-My name's Zayn.
"A thousand greetings to you, Terry, Dad,"
"Furface and Watersprite, from your loving Henry."
The main thing is he's alive and well.
Where does it say greetings to Furface and Watersprite?
Here.
He never forgets us.
Give him our love too.
"Of course, and I'll say how you help me."
"Come, let's feed you."
You need a rest after your long flight.
"But I'm not alone, really."
The Duke sent Henry away to fight the Turk.
The Turk?
But nobody came back alive!
"That's what the Duke thinks, that ghastly ugly wretch."
Ghastly?
Ugly'?
The nastiest under the sun.
He's mean to everyone.
"But he'll meet a just end, such a type always does."
But they praise him in town!
Our Duke?
Must be some mistake.
"The Count in Netolice maybe, he's a wonderful person."
"But our Duke is proud and evil, just about ripe for hell."
- Stop it!
- Don't you like our food?
Honza's used to better things - on his travels.
Johann!
Not Honza!
How about a nice roast chicken with sage stuffing?
"Just say so, Johann."
Redemption costs.
"And on my watch, you fucking pay up front."
Everything you know about Latif.
Or I put a fucking bullet in your head right now.
Latif has a spy at the top of British intelligence.
"Neutralize him, and you'll stop the atrocity Latif has planned."
He can't finalize the arrangements without him.
Who is he?
I need a name.
When my daughter is safe.
Last chance.
"Oh, you need Clare safe, as much as I do."
You wouldn't be here otherwise.
People die.
I'm fine with that.
You fucking prick.
"Shoot, then."
(DISTORTED EXPLOSION)
Fuck.
(PLANE ENGINE ROARING)
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
"Hello, Maggie."
I'm Eleanor Grant.
Can I get you a drink?
"No, but can you can turn off the recording device in your pocket."
This conversation is off the record.
We never met.
Do you understand?
(DEVICE BEEPS OFF)
Damien said you were a ball breaker.
"Well, Damien Scott talks too much and to people he shouldn't."
He knows he can trust me.
- No.
Someone has to look after the injured.
We can't take them with us.
- All right.
"- Thank you, Mariá."
I have a question.
"Do you love this country, your homeland?"
"Yes, señor."
Have you explained that we're fighting this war for them?
"Yes, I have, señor."
So why are they staring at me as if I was a venomous snake?
They're just watching you eat because they're not going to get any food today.
Commandante!
Commandante!
What's the matter?
I've intercepted a radio message.
It wasn't even encoded.
They're going north.
So are Silveira and his militia.
- And they've requested helicopters.
- We're leaving right now.
- Get ready.
We're leaving.
- Mariá will take you to San Juan.
Helicopters!
"Oh, my God!"
"Into the jungle, everybody!"
Hurry up!
Take cover!
The helicopters are coming!
Hurry up!
Get into the jungle!
Please.
Please let go.
- What's the count?
- Please don't hurt me.
"- I said, what's the count?"
"- Look, I haven't even done anything!"
What's the count?
Plus 18.
"Oh, you've gotta be kidding."
"Congratulations, Ben."
"Sorry, we had to make sure you'd keep the count under pressure."
Welcome to the team.
We didn't mean it.
"It's okay, Campbell, I cried inside that bag."
Fisher and Jimmy have always been the big players.
I want you to take Jimmy's place.
I've never done this.
I know that and I understand.
"But I don't trust the girls, and Choi is, well, Choi."
"Look, I've been teaching for more than 14 years, and I've never had a student as impressive as you."
Your brain is like a goddamn Pentium chip.
You're gonna do great.
You know how I know that?
'Cause you remind me of myself 25 years ago.
You in?
- Yeah.
"Yeah, I'm in."
- Good.
Good.
"There's one more thing, Ben, and this is important."
"We're counting cards, we're not gambling."
We're following a specific set of rules and playing a system.
I have to sent you to jail for one day.
Immediate execution.
"Your Honour, are you kidding me?"
"Your Honour, can you give me face?"
Hubby.
Are you kidding me?
"Your Honour, for what we've just heard, should we forget them too?"
"Since the statement is against legal procedure,"
"Jury, you should forget everything you've just heard."
Chan Mon-gut will be represented by Wu Man.
"Tomorrow, the final address should be presented."
Court.
Brother Foon.
Miss Shui.
Why are you here?
I come to save you.
"Alright, I'll pack up first."
I just want to prove your personality.
I am right.
You are a gutless coward.
What?
"If you leave like this, you will be sinful forever."
You can't live peacefully and you'd hide up for the rest of your life.
You would be a criminal forever.
I have decided to stay.
That's why I love you.
Creep!
"Ho Foon, someone comes to visit you."
Miss Shui.
Where did you cut your hair?
"Number 9, Nathan Road."
"Cut the crap, I won't go."
"[Cell Phone Ringing] There are more things in heaven and earth, Danny."
Danny McCoy.
Really.
Uh-huh.
Okay.
"Uh, yeah, we'll be right up, sir."
"That was the Burkes, at the new Montecito residences."
The new owners of Monica's condo?
Yeah.
They say it's haunted.
"#Boy, you feelin'lucky tonight #"
#Roll the dice again and let it ride #
#Let it ride Let it ride #
# You gonna do this one more time #
#Hit me again and let it ride #
#Let it ride Let it ride #
#Are you gonna play tonight #
# 'Cause Lady Luck is right by your side #
#By your side By your side #

Hmm.
"No visible dirt, but..."
Maureen?
Yeah.
Send this to the lab for bacterial analysis.
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.
"Cleanliness, people."
You can never be too sure.
"Word on the street there's a new inspector at the health department, and he's wicked hard-core."
"-Good morning, Ernie."
-What is this?
"Come on, Ernie."
We've got work to do.
"What are you doing, taking bets?"
Transfer all of Mr. Morgan's calls up here...
I hope you don't think I was kidding last night.
-You're working for me.
"-Oh, come on, come on, you were"
-high last night.
"-Oh, not that high."
I didn't get where I am today by being high and making gaiety.
"I find that you're one of the top motor pool sergeants in the whole Army, and if you can unsnarl one-tenth of the jams that we get into, you're worth twice the $10,000 a year that I'm giving you."
"$10,000 a year?"
Fine.
Do that.
BILKO:
What are you talking about?
Ed Houlihan in Cleveland.
"-Oh, Houlihan again."
Yeah.
-(Houlihan speaks indistinctly)
"All right, now, look, Houlihan, get this straight."
I don't want 22 trailer trucks laying dead all over the road.
What?
You're waiting for some chain drive parts
-to get down from Seattle?
-Let me tell him.
Let...
-What?
-Just a minute.
What are you talking about?
- lf you're concerned with the truth...
why did you lie about me?
- Your name didn't even come up.
- Not the gun thing.
With Sharon !
What you said to her about me and Jordan Catalano.
- What are you talking about?
"- l heard her, Brian."
You told her terrible things.
False things.
You lied to her.
"I didn't lie to her, I just..."
What difference does it makes.
I can imagine what she did with it.
But it's just that you lied too.
When you said you didn't know about Jordan coming over that night.
I thought about it for like fifty hours.
"You knew it, didn't you?"
You used me.
- lt's not the same.
- Maybe it is because...
you just did what you wanted.
And didn't care about what damage it did to anybody else.
What damage did it do you?
Angela?
Angela.
Can I talk to you for a second?
- How are you doing?
- You know.
Life goes on.
I was thinking about what I said to you yesterday?
"You know, the thing."
We're passing ships.
We've met a few times.
You were on tour somewhere and we...
Yeah.
Yeah.
And one time I don't remember.
"No, I don't."
Yeah.
It was a crazy night.
LAUGHTER
"Ten past one, Rob!"
I've had similar experiences with Ronnie Corbett where the two of us are smashed off our tits.
Literally no memory of what time we left the golf club.
So it seems silly to ask you if you're a party girl.
Don't you try to deny it!
Slightly retired.
I'm a country bumpkin now.
You moved to the country.
Is that a real thing?
It's not like a stage!
It's real.
I've got a veggie patch and everything.
A veggie patch?
"It's not a euphemism, Noel."
So you're out in the country and you're acting more now.
I am.
Is that as big a thing as the music?
I think music's my first love.
I couldn't ever not do music.
"But acting, yeah, totally."
Love it.
I nearly wanted you.
IN HIS PERCEPTIVE ANALYSIS OF THE DAY'S NEWS-
IT'S ALREADY ON THE WIRE.
WAIT TILL YOU HEAR.
"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,"
"AT APPROXIMATELY 3:00 A.M. THIS MORNING, IN OUR CITY,"
ONE HUMAN BEING TOOK THE LIFE OF ANOTHER.
"IN OUR WORLD, ACTS OF VIOLENCE ARE NOT RARE."
"AND SO MY EXCUSE,"
"OR, I SHOULD SAY, MY REASON,"
"FOR GIVING IMPORTANCE TO THIS PARTICULAR STORY,"
IS MY HOPE THAT THE KILLER MAY BE LISTENING TO ME.
FOR I BELIEVE THAT IN HIS PROGRESS TO THE CHAIR
OR TO THE INSANE ASYLUM
"THAT HE HAS REACHED A WAY STATION,"
WHERE HIS SICK AND WARPED EGO DEMANDS TO BE FED
WITH THE MILK OF SELF-IMPORTANCE.
"AND SO, WITH THE CONSENT OF A VERY GOOD FRIEND OF MINE,"
"WHO IS BY WAY OF BEING A REMARKABLE CRIMINOLOGIST,"
"BUT WHO HAS ALSO ASKED THAT HIS NAME NOT BE CREDITED,"
"I'M GOING TO SAY A FEW THINGS TO THE KILLER,"
FACE TO FACE.

A GIRL BY THE NAME OF JUDITH FELTON.

"Listen, I'll catch one for you in secret."
Let's go.
"-Mr Roth, I must take you into custody."
-I understand.
What's your reaction to the Israeli High Court ruling?
I'm a retired investor on a pension.
"I went to Israel to live there as a Jew, in the twilight of my life."
"Hey, Frankie!"
"Come on out, let's play some Hearts."
Frankie!
Is it tyue you're worth over 300 million dollars?
"I'm a retired investor, living on a pension."
I came home to vote in the presidential election because they wouldn't give me an absentee ballot.

-You know my brother Fredo.
-Sure.
"This is my stepbrother Tom, and that's his girl Theresa."
This cute little thing is my sister Connie.
Say hello to Carlo.
"He's good-looking, isn't he?"
Yes.
The droopy thing is Mike.
We call him Joe College.
- He hates you.
He hates you.
- Getaway from him.
Getaway.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
"Lucy, did you hear me?"
What?
I asked you if you were upset because Bruce left.
Am I ever gonna get out?
Are you getting sick of me?
What I'm getting sick of is Fish-Stick Fridays.
"You will be leaving at some point, yes."
But our sessions don't have to end.
I would like to be a regular part of your life.
What life?
- Lucy.
"- No, no, you don't understand."
I know what my life should look like.
I know that I should be in school and starting my career and going on dates and making out in inappropriate places but I'm never gonna be able to do that.
I have something for you.
Torts.
Funny.
"You know, that's what drove me crazy in the first place."
That book didn't cause your psychosis.
Law school didn't cause your psychosis.
Didn't help.
Why did you wanna be a lawyer?
You won't impress my showbiz friends.
I'd be impressed if you had any friends.
"Right, that's it."
Your invitation's withdrawn.
Go away.
"Oh, go on, daughter, do me a favour."
Where's your sense of humour?
- Only a bijou jokette.
"- Oh, joke, oh."
Of course I'll impress your friends.
We'll make a bona little team.
The financial artiste.
The theatrical artiste.
And the piss artist.
It's going to be a truly magical evening.
"Blimey, those candles burned down fast."
"Oh, keep it to yourself, Eddie."
Much time has passed.
I'm swathed in melancholic pathos.
- Oo-er.
"- Shut up, Eddie."
"I think you've been stood up, Richie."
Oo-er.
"Oh, shut up, Eddie."
After all I've done.
"A show in a peepshow, robbed a supermarket, been to prison and the rotters haven't even turned up."
Fate deals me blow after blow.
Oo-er.
"What time did you put on the invites, love?"
Eight o'clock.
"Look, I've got 'em here."
"Tarby's, Brucie's, Lynchy's and..."
There's no time.
"Gemma, run, please, go!"
Fuck.
She could... s-she could've cut us free.
"Tools, weapons."
We-we could have fought.
We could have run away.
"You can't run anywhere, babe."
"You did well, Luke."
You showed guts.
"Oh, you keep it."
You're in the family now.
I trust you with it.
- What if someone finds out?
"- Trust me, Luke."
We're some distance above the law.
Once this is all over... we can just disappear.
Lie low while my father's people deal with these loose ends.
Your father knows about this?
This whole business has shamed him more than anyone else.
My duty was clear.
Restore family honour by any means necessary.
- What?
- I knew he had my back.
He doesn't want to lose another son.
"Did you send the postcard, El?"
No.
- Did you?
- No.
Glad we got that cleared up.
This is the last leg.
You're almost there.
- Stand still!
- Get out.
All right.
No one will come in here.
Stay on the door.
The Frenchman.
What'd he say?
It's about us being revolutionaries like him.
The captain wants to see me about him now.
Got the petition?
Take care of him.
"We are revolutionaries, but they do things properly."
The French with the guillotine!
"We've had this ship, and Scott-Padget's still alive!"
Wait.
You can go now.
Come in.
"You wish to see me, sir?"
- Mr. Crawford?
- Sit down.
Where are we heading?
"Oh, my committee aren't decided yet."
"Caribbean, South America..."
Anywhere but England.
It's of England I wish to speak to you.
Colonel Giraud has vital information about an intended invasion.
- That's the truth.
- Invasion?
We got the landing places and the approximate date out of him.
But he knows a great deal more.
He must be handed over for questioning at once.
Handed over?
I followed him into New Haven.
He just parks and into the scientific supplies store.
What?
Open the car.
Open the car.
- Shit.
- What?
He's buying a Geiger counter.
God damn.
"Look, I need you to stall him for an hour, all right?"
How the hell am I supposed to do that?
I don't know.
"Look, you want to succeed in the life?"
Figure it out.
Work the problem.
And now what?
What are we gonna do?
We're gonna salt it.
With what?
Gonna find somebody on CraigsList trying to unload a couple pounds of yellowcake?
Nope.
Bullshit.
Is the internet ever wrong?
"If kitty litter's radioactive enough to set off a Geiger counter, what makes you think it won't grow me a third nut or some shit like that?"
"For the amount you've been breaking my balls lately,"
I could use a spare one.
[sobbing]
Hey.
You okay?
No!
"Oh, God."
Ohh.
This way.
"Now, I warn you, sir,"
- it's not a pretty sight.
- I'll prepare myself.
You may want to keep your distance as well.
(girl grunting)
"Stay back, sir."
"It may look harmless, but I've seen that thing kill and eat a live chicken with my own eyes."
Really?
"Look no further, sir."
It's your killer.
(grunting)
"How do you know about this, Henry?"
"Well, I paid to see it, sir."
"Ten cents, but it was worth it."
"From the shores of Borneo, sir."
"Could have been the mountains, I don't recall exactly, sir,"
- but someplace...
- Who cares for her?
!
"Well, a keeper."
He collects the money.
"- I don't know, she hardly seems to be..."
- What the hell are you two doing in here?
Show's not open for another hour.
"Detective Murdoch, Toronto Constabulary."
But you still have to pay.
- Ten cents each you owe me.
- I've paid once already.
He hasn't...
- Who are you?
- Mick Travis.
These children are dangerous to us.
also to their own selves.
We can't cure it.
"Therefore,"
"I have to tell you... that we've decided for their sake, to lock them up indefinitely."
Benigno!
David!
Stand up.
Where's Anais?
Let's go!
Anais didn't make it.
But we save a child.
Your child.
Don't move!
Make them wear it.
Tell them to wear the safety clothes.
I can't eat slowly when I eat hot things.
"If you eat it, will you die?"
Eat it quietly!
"Son-in-law, it looks like your food is too hot for you."
Would you like to drink some cool beer?
Beer?
Why not?
"Sure, sure."
Would I die if I drink it?
!
"Dad, he has to drive later."
"Da Ran, I don't have a car since the accident."
"Yoon Jae, your body is still not well since the accident."
I think I will sleep well with just one drink.
"Please pour it for me, Father-in-law."
"Dad, Dad, me too."
FRIENDSHIP
We don't have profound conversations.
I ask how they are doing but it's mostly just being polite.
If I really had a problem -
- I think they'd   quietly disappear.
I try to be just like them.
I try to be like them so they'll accept me.
It isn't really acceptable to be different from the others.
I've got loads of friends.
All over the world.
I go to L.A. I get in anywhere I want   because I know people and I'm friends with them.
With celebs and so on.
They've got money.
You can't be friends with people who've no money.
How did it go?
- Let's stop now.
- You can't stop now.
- It was your idea.
- A stupid idea.
I'm sorry.
When I hook a guy I won't share the money with you.
"Hey, baby!"
"Hey, Marc!"
- I thought you left with some guy?
- It's been a really lousy night.
Cheer up.
We're going to an after-party at Peter Skjoldmark's.
Have some Cristal.
Why are you always on booze and coke?
You're 26.
You need a wife and kids.
Send me one of your girls.
Delicious.
"High time, where've you been, Duke?"
"It didn't work, did it."
Elisa doesn't want me.
What did you think?
I told you so.
Save me!
"Help me, gracious witch!"
"Stop moaning, she's not the only Elisa around."
I said I'd choose a Lady for your palace myself.
Get up.
"My, you're heavy."
I wonder are you worthy of her?
"Call me Elisa, I don't mind."
What?
You?
Never!
No?
That's all right.
I can be the mistress here without you around.
You and your precious servant'll clean the place all day and every day for 100 years.
And I want everything to shine and sparkle!
That's what I get for my my tragic love!
"I know everything, move and fast or I'll turn you into six ugly green dwarfs."
No.
"Your Grace, you too?"
You're as heavy as a sack of grouts!
Come quickly!
"They'll haunt the castle at nights, they don't know yet!"
- But this is our...
-Elisa's!
They locked it up!
Don't run away.
Just hear me out for two seconds.
"Look, this running has to stop."
How much time could you possibly need?
"This isn't about me, Vic."
"It's about our kids, about them being safe."
Do you honestly think I'd put my children in danger?
"Not intentionally, but the things going on in your life..."
Something told me to run.
School's back in session.
Matthew needs to be at Glenridge.
He needs his routine.
Cassidy needs to see her friends.
This isn't gonna change things between us.
Don't punish them because of me.
"I'll move out if I have to, if that's what it takes."
But I need to know that they're at home where they can be safe.
I don't...
"I don't know, okay?"
I'll think about it.
"Hey, how'd your meeting with I.A.D. go last night?"
Good.
Good.
You ran out of here so quick.
They told me not to discuss it with anyone.
But it went fine.
Anything yet?
- Hi.
I'm Detective Wagenbach.
- All right.
Just a second.
"- Bob, the police are here."
I wanted...
I wanted to do something that used the part of my brain that was healthy.
"So, what's different now?"
I know how the world sees me.
And people with schizophrenia aren't lawyers.
They're bag ladies.
So prove them wrong.
Finish law school.
You have insight into something very few people understand.
Think about this.
"If you finish law school, who could you help?"
"Their distinct color comes from their main food source, shrimp."
Not far away from our flamingo friends...
Cat.
Bat.
Rat-a-tat-tat.
- Jack Sprat could eat no fat.
- Heh.
Right?
Right.
You're so lucky.
Your voices... stop sometimes.
Times.
Crimes.
Limes.
Times.
I have a secret.
It's about my mother.
There was the one I told my friends about... the mom I wished I had.
She mostly lives in my snow globe.
Then there was Up Mom.
You see what I'm talking about?
B.N.:
May 15.
May 15.
It's the date of the train robbery.
The gold bars.
B.N. is for is Barbey Nanteuil.
Mr F?
There is no date.
That I do not see.
Thomery: during May.
During May...
"It is rather late May, because he was assassinated on the 30th."
Farewell!
Mr F.
"For god's sake, Fantômas wants to murder me?"
"Yes, but there is no date after your initials, then Fantomas has perhaps considered that your death was not essential."
It's still frightens me.
I thought you loved the danger?
"The danger, yes, but executions, no!"
"And finally, Bank:"
May 31.
And we are at May 31.
Of course it's the Barbey-Nanteuil bank.
Their deposit safes are in danger and also their lives.
He will act before midnight.
How do we play?
"I stay behind the scenes, you come into the scene."
Fantomas?
Please...
"The people need dreams or nightmares, but not us."
It is nonetheless true we are in danger.
"Gentlemen, would you offer me hospitality until tomorrow?"
Huh?
Your attitude makes me sick!
What's the matter with you?
I'm talking to you!
If you don't take any advice... you'll never solve your problems!
I don't have any problems!
"- Oh, yeah?"
- You have a problem!
Sure.
Typical.
You are the problem!
Your obstinacy is my only problem!
- How come?
- You aren't reliable.
I have to smooth things out with Gerd!
"Sorry, but you got yourself into it!"
I don't get it.
You don't want to change a thing.
You only want to be left in peace.
Make an effort.
You know what's really ironic?
That you can't stand your father... but you say the same crap as him!
What do you know about my father?
I just have to look at you to know everything.
- What the hell's wrong with you?
- Leave me alone!
- You just want to hurt me!
- Then cry!
It's true!
You enjoy hurting me!
Ouch!
Are you crazy?
"- Take him forward, put him under guard."
- Jones.
Another flogging.
Pass the word:
We do a full tryout tomorrow at eight bells.
First Lieutenant said keep a sharp lookout to starboard.
"You men on gun three, jump to it!"
Station two marines in the after well deck at six bells.
- Steer east-nor'east.
"- Aye, aye."
- Mr. Scott-Padget.
"- Yes, sir."
- Have you noticed anything?
"- Noticed what, sir?"
A number of small things.
Like a man shouting without a sound.
"- I don't know what you mean, sir."
- All right.
He saw you do it.
- Why did you?
- That's the signal.
Three cheers.
"- Next time, be careful."
- When are we gonna do it?
- The real thing?
- You'll be told.
We did what we said.
We join the fleet in Corsica with something to show.
A fully-pledged ship.
Ready for action.
Not a single bloody ship.
Nothing in the harbor.
Please sit down.
How do you like it here?
"It's a beautiful country, isn't it?"
- Yes.
- Could I see your papers?
"- Oh, come on."
You can overdo things.
- I'm supposed to check all civilians.
Certainly.
Don't get worked up.
There you are.
- I'll be back in a minute.
- Where are you going?
"To the radio room, to check everything."
These militiamen are fanatical.
They'd frisk their own granny.
- We have nothing to hide.
- But it's unnecessary.
He's just a busybody who's seeing how far he can go.
Who is he going to call by radio?
The Holy Father?
"Oh, I'm sorry."
Priests have a sense of humour too.
Everything's all right.
Open the gate.
We're going to the depot now.
We'll be there soon.
- I'm sure it's hotter here than it is in hell.
- It might get even hotter.
"Oh, I see, yes."
We're nearly there now.
This is the fuel depot.
Let's bring him in.
"Deep-dive every team that competed in those races, Patton."
Especially Dana's.
I'm hoping that a hacker can find a fellow hacker.
"(chuckles) Come on, man."
That's what I'm all about.
That's why I do what I do.
"Well, go do it."
"Come on, Christopher."
Where the hell are you?
(line ringing)
(phone ringing)
(door closes in distance)
(phone continues ringing)
(sighs) (beeps)
(train passing)
Hey.
What the hell are you doing here?
I come here to give you a friendly warning.
Stay away from Tucker and his mom.
You understand?
(laughing):
What?
"Get out of here, right..."
But I don't think you heard me.
"Look, I may not be Tucker's dad, but I'm not gonna let anything happen to him or his mom."
"So, if I were you,"
I would just... stay away.
- Or what?
"- Well, trust me."
You don't want to find out.
"You see, that's my boy and my woman."
Look lively.
"A gent in box F wants you to serve him, and Old Prouty says you're to do it."
"Oh, he does?"
I'll tell him it ain't my business.
But he wants a bottle of the boil.
"Oh, bubbly."
Why didn't you say so?
"Hey, lvy, me love, how about some fish and chips after the show?"
How about a dozen oysters and a pint of stout?
What about a glass of champagne?
"- Oh, hello, Marcia."
"- Hello, lvy."
"Watch out, lvy."
"How's about it, lvy?"
"Over there, lvy."
Ain't she a bit of horseflesh?
"Well, that'll..."
"That'll be half a quid, sir."
Half a quid?
"Yes, sir."
Half a quid.
Here.
"Here's a sovereign, my dear."
Keep the change.
"Thank you, sir."
"Oh, but you're not going?"
"Oh, no."
No.
"After all, you brought two glasses."
Two minds with but a single thought.
"My, what a nice beginning."
Sit down there.
I'll call you tonight.
"Won't you sit down, Miss Kelly?"
My money do all this?
"Yes, your money and my brains."
Except that it wasn't your money.
You stole it from me.
To steal from a thief is no crime.
"Look, I'm broke because of you."
"Well, how would you like a job?"
Doing what?
Working for me.
I could use a pretty thief in my business.
I'd wind up in jail.
Not my way you wouldn't.
Yours for sure.
I'd be no use to you.
I'm not really a thief.
I saw you pull a little job.
"Small stuff, but it showed promise."
The wallet dropped on the floor.
I was tempted.
I was broke.
I never dreamed of picking up that wallet would end that way for Chuck.
He tried to kill me.
He loved me.
He was just trying to help me.
"You know, you and I are very much alike."
"Oh, we're both crooks."
Only there's one difference.
I don't want to be.
And you can't help yourself.
I like you.
Read this morning's operations printout?
What about it?
I was with Vinnie Zapatti last night.
He's dead because of Tino Zapatti's probation report.
Now there's four deaths.
They're connected.
-That's all I know--
-That's all I wanna know!
-Just trying to circle the wagons.
-Circle the wagons?
Who do you think you are?
Some gumshoe in a dime novel...
... loose-cannoningaroundthecity?
Consorting with known mobsters!
"Kevin, for God's sakes!"
You're the mayor's right-hand!
What are you fucking around for?
You see this desk?
"It belonged to Fiorello La Guardia, """"the little flower. """""
He was about 5 foot tall.
Used to read the funny papers to children over the radio...
... andwasabout the best mayor the city ever had.
Know what La Guardia said?
"""""Why is it every time you can do some good..."
"... thenicepeoplecomein and mess you up?"""""
Be nice.
Don't mess me up.
-Did I wake you up?
-You kidding?
"I've been trying to figure out how to raise $1 0,000."
"The hook is in, and I'm close."
Vinnie is Eddie's passport...
"- No, you wasn't!"
- I was!
- At all...
- Was my fault.
God... so inefficient...
Well...
Let's go!
Please enter on the collapsed tunnel.
In about 500 meters there's the place we are searching for.
"Ram, don't run."
"Male, pay attention to your steps."
Yes.
"Lieutenant, what happened?"
Don't worry.
Male stepped over a landmine.
Really?
In a place like that?
You are not scared.
Aren't you?
Leave me alone...
"Lieutenant, be careful please."
Right now a heat source has become visible.
Ok!
Let's change location.
"Everyone, listen!"
There is something lurking in the ruins at the west.
It's not like they are unarmed people.
We will take a walk before exploring underground.
Let's start the procedure as usual.
Launch the UAV.
The enemy is already moving.
Hurry!
You know why?
"Because it's a stupid decision and you're not stupid, Paige."
- You were saving that money to go to Europe.
- It's going to better use there.
What use?
Do you know what they're using that money for?
"They're feeding refugees, building houses."
You guys don't help anyone!
We help you.
"W-We help you, and we helped you save that money."
Please do not roll your eyes at me.
You can show me some respect.
"- Paige, you started lying to us."
- I didn't lie.
"- Well, you certainly don't seem to know the difference."
- Do you?
- Lie...
Lying...
- Stop!
What are you doing?
You go behind our backs.
Why?
Does this book tell you to do that?
- Philip.
- Does it?
"You respect Jesus, but not us?"
[Door Opens]
[Door Closes]
Emergency signal from Fred.
What happened last night...
"You didn't have a choice, Philip."
This is war.
"Apology, Senator!"
"-Michael, excuse me."
"-Hello, darling."
The children are outside.
We're going.
What do you mean?
We're leaving tomorrow.
Rocco?
"I'll be in my room, Mike."
"Michael, I'm not going back to Nevada."
I brought the children to say goodbye to you.
I'm very happy for you.
I always knew you were too smart to let any of them beat you.
-Why don't you sit down?
"-No, I'm not going to stay long."
There are some things I'd like to talk to you about.
"Things that have been on my mind, changes I want to make."
"I think it's too late for changes, Michael."
-I wasn't going to say anything...
"-What do you mean, ""too late""?"
What really happened with Pentangeli?
-His brother came and helped him.
-I didn't even know he had a brother.
Where is he now?
"He's on a plane, back to Sicily."
All he had to do was show his face.
"It was between the brothers, Kay."
I had nothing to do with it.
I don't want you going!
"Not you, not the kids."
No.
You're my wife and my children.
My memory is like a 70-year-old granny's.
I always leave my phone in the office once or twice a day.
I'm one of the better cases.
One of my colleagues has a neck brace for her phone.
What?
You said that we don't have enough time.
Let's use it wisely.
Is something wrong?
"I know you could be angry, but you shouldn't be this mad."
What's wrong?
Did you order steak?
They are cold.
-It's ok.
"-Leave them, I'll order again."
I can see stars already.
-I said leave them.
-You said there's no time.
Let's just eat.
Sit!
There's salad.
"Bread, plenty to eat."
"Oh yeah, I should drink wine first."
When you called me stupid my stomach got upset.
Even stupid people get shocked from that.
Did you know that I was stupid now?
"This isn't the first time you were called ""stupid."""
"That ""stupid"" was different from ""stupid"" before."
Aren't you going to drink?
You have to drive?
So do I.
A glass will be ok within an hour.
It shows.
"- Oh, I'm glad you listened to reason."
"- Dad, wow."
"As of tomorrow morning, Julie will be the new Chief Executive Officer of the Newport Group."
"Who needs more champagne, hmm?"
"- Hey, thanks."
- Yup.
- Any Summer sightings?
"- Oh, no, not yet."
What if she doesn't show?
"What if, after all this, she never knows the blood and sweat and-and other people's pee that went in to getting her those tick"
"Well, then you'd be happy for her 'cause you're her friend, right?"
"Totally, yeah."
"Hey, you came."
- Where's Zach?
"- Oh, um, he couldn't make it."
"- Oh, that's..."
That's real... that's too bad.
"Um, let me show you to your very V.I.P. seating."
It's this way.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I wasn't planning on coming here tonight.
I'm here for Team Summer.
I'm here for Team Seth.
"So, what do you think?"
- Seth and Summer... star-crossed lovers?
- Or better off just friends.
- Destined to be together?
- Or just too dysfunctional together to make it work.
- I guess only time will tell.
"- Yeah, I guess."
"You want to go in, watch the band?"
Arrest me!
I'm asking for police custody!
I'm a criminal!
Arrest me!
Jeffrey... my friend.
Do you believe in God?
"No, but I enjoy the tranquility here."
Want to check the gun?
I trust you.
Another quiet tear
Streaks down my face
Another night ofdesolation
And solitude
Just accept me
For what I am
Don't make promises
That you won't keep
Who needs dreams
When we have each other
Who needs tomorrow
When we have today
- I can't see.
- Your corneas are badly damaged.
- Will I recover?
- Your sight will never be perfect.
- My sight is so blurred!
- We can do an operation transplant.
Will I be blind?
"Jenny, I'm Sergeant Chang."
Do you remember the murderer's face?
"Please, leave me alone."
I'm frightened.
"I understand that, and thank you."
Yeah.
"So, uh, what's the plan?"
"Well, 7 AM we leave from here-"
"- Riley, no."
Stop.
He's not part of the crew.
Didn't my sister tell you?
You're not in.
"I understand that, Connor."
"I was just, wanted to see what you guys had planned."
No.
This is exactly my problem with you.
You're problem with me?
"You want me to take care of this, boss?"
Step back.
You just tell me to step back?
Don't tell me to step back.
I'll step back if I want.
"I'll step off, I'll step up to the streets if I want to."
"You know what my problem is with you, Ollie?"
Your lack of respect.
That's my problem with you.
"I, I respect you."
No you don't.
You don't trust me.
Never have.
Maybe that's because you've landed me in jail twice.
That's not helping.
You're not helpin'.
Where'd you get this guy?
I told you to play dead.
On your feet.
Hold on just a second.
Where are your manners?
"If you try something, I'll kill her!"
Don't make it worse for yourselves.
Come out with your hands up.
We won't hurt you.
"Aldin, I'm here!"
Don't worry anymore.
Your Renato is here.
You're gonna ruin everything!
"Renato, I want to go home!"
Don't worry.
I'll take you home.
"Shut up, for God's sake!"
Get him out of here.
Don't talk to me in that tone of voice.
Don't get so excited.
I'll keep still.
Tie him up!
Listen to me.
The dastards took a shot at me!
Ask for a plane.
In exchange for what?
For that.
For that thing?
Would you exchange a plane for that?
"A child, a woman, a priest, yes, dut that?"
Pretend I'm not here.
It doesn't matter.
You have two minutes... or we'll open fire.
"Come and get us, you dastards!"
I'm going to kill youraunt.
She nevertells me anything.
"Look at his gorgeous eyes, his pearly teeth."
"Mom, don't embarrass him."
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?
!
"What's that hair, pussy boy?"
It looks beautiful.
Don't you ever risk your life like this again.
Mom...
I'lljoin the army.
Silly boy.
F... ing liar...
My son would never upset me...
"I'm so broke, nobody will give me a job..."
You can find so many jobs...
I can send you money...
How the hell can you?
My aunt is having a hard time...
What now?
"Because of the army, I haven't seen daylight for years."
You can go-go dance in the army...
"Cihan, go get some air."
Yourdaughterwill come back as a man from the army.
Save it for your hairy ass.
Excuse me?
"Cihan, come on, son."
"Sorry, dear."
How did this army thing came up?
Look what the military did to yourbrother...
Yourfather...
I don't want to loose you either.
"You'll find out what's wrong, won't you?"
- You said you could.
"- Sure, my love."
"And you've always got me, in case of need."
Or did you want us both?
"No, I'm not like that."
Not the one and the other.
- lt's more either/or.
- Either/or?
What are you two either/or-ing?
"Gerard asked me about my morning, and I have to work."
"It's either working, or neglecting the salon."
Working?
Today?
I've taken the whole damned week off for you!
"It's just this morning, sweetheart."
Monday mornings I have to see my salesmen. I'll be froe this afternoon.
That's great!
I'll be bored to tears meanwhile.
- Do something with Gerard.
- He's here to work too!
So I don't work this morning.
Yes... show him around.
Or talk to him.
Perhaps he'll write about us.
Then we'll be in a book.
What's the use of being in a book?
You know what?
Take the car.
I don't need it anyway.
Shall we?
I have to get to the meeting.
You leave that to me.
They found his body at the scene of a car crash just outside St. Albans carrying NIA documents.
He was discharged from the NIA six months ago for psychiatric reasons.
So where'd he get the NIA papers?
Pronto.
You all right?
Yes.
Is Julia with you?
Yes.
Thank god.
"Okay, where are you?"
At home.
Where the hell are you?
Better you don't know.
The police came here looking for you.
They found Paolo's body at your studio.
"Kyra, you know I thought I could leave the past behind."
I know you did.
But why did you run?
It's complicated.
Look I need your help.
I have a Swiss phone number.
"I need you to go on the computer, use reverse directory, see if you can get a, uh, name and an address."
"Kyra, it'll take you ten seconds."
Give me the number.
Got it.
"Christian Lenk,"
"Twenty-one Zermatt Strasse,"
"Zurich, Zero-Five-W."
"Great, okay, now you and Julia need to go away for a couple days."
"Go to the inn where she likes to feed the ducks, you know where I mean."
You are creeping me out.
It's not a question of believing them.
"Like I said, they're honest people."
- How long you lived here?
- My whole life.
- I grew up right over that hill.
- On a farm?
"Shucks, no."
A real live house.
Indoor plumbing and everything.
Sorry.
We even had shoes for church and schooling' and stuff.
"All right, all right."
Where the hell are you?
I'm still here.
- West Virginia?
- Yeah.
Something's come up.
You're kidding.
Something of national interest in West Virginia?
"No, scientific."
I'll tell you about it later.
Cy's beginning to look rabid.
"Keep him at bay, okay?"
Are you okay?
You sounda little stressed.
"No, I'm fine."
I'll talk to you later.
We were parked up here... and sort a making out in the back seat.
And what happened next... is sort of hard to explain.
Next day...
I woke up and... both my... my eyes were swelled up.
What did the doctors say?
She called me 'Robin darling'!
"Oh dear, so intimate!"
Robin darling!
Can't take this!
"""Guest..."""
"Your Excellency, take a seat please!"
Where's the 'Beast'?
You think I really hid it in the toothbrush?
You hid it in the toothbrush?
"Yes, but I moved it after the burglar show up."
Then why were you so agitated?
I meant to set a trap to catch the burglar.
But didn't succeed!
I'll go to the bank tomorrow.
And get it back for you from the safe!
Go and have an early night!
Plumbing system of the Police Station.
This Formula is only a phoney one.
I think you'd better find Yoyo first.
"Your Excellency, you knew I'd come."
"That's why you didn't lock the door, right?"
Yoyo!
You still remember my name?
Yoyo!
You're the same Yoyo of 3 years ago.
You shouldn't even talk about it.
"3 years ago, poor Yoyo waited for someone at the station."
Yoyo!
He waited and waited...
Yoyo!
He didn't move an inch in case she came.
Yoyo!
- but i wouldn't have asked him to fix it.
- you didn't need to ask.
- and tim -- [sighs]
- tim looked up to harley and couldn't say no.
- did he die in the robbery?
- no. the clerk did.
"tim dropped the gun, and it went off."
"- well, what happened?"
- tim died the first night in the county jail.
they cooked his food in peanut oil.
- ohh.
"- [chuckling] well, hey."
aren't you gonna make a crack about that?
"i mean, typical, right?"
he's such a little wussy.
"he couldn't even make it through one night at the clink, and it wasn't 'cause he was shanked, either."
it's 'cause of a peanut allergy.
"[chuckling] i mean, what a lame-ass, right?"
- it's not funny!
"- rest in peace, mom."
[dramatic music plays] harley?
harley!
"you know your mama loves you, right?"

- am i a good mama?

-Agreed.
-Agreed.
I think we've made some sort of frontier history today.
"Until tomorrow, beautiful Maudie."
[SPEAKS in FRENCH]
MAUDE:
"Until tomorrow, Preston."
"Well, Mother, you're a free woman."
Go and sin no more.
"Ezra, you haven't done much to gladden my heart in your life."
I'm proud to be your mother.
"Thank you, Mary."
Daddy.
All those years.
Why didn't you ever tell me?
"I tried to, son, but I couldn't."
You had enough troubles...
... withoutcarryingthisburden in your heart.
No.
That made me sound too damn noble.
Truth be told...
... Ijustdidn'thad the courage.
And I didn't want you to think bad of your mama.
She was a brave woman.
"Yes, sir. lt was."
"And all this time, I thought bad of you."
"You got consumption, don't you?"
That's why I come looking for you.
travis:
Mr. Jackson has confessed his guilt in open court.
The jury is dismissed.
You sent that to Tyler.
(screams)
I can't go home.
I can never go home again.
It can't be that bad.
Whoa.
I have never even seen this on the Internet.
You watch that kind of stuff on the Internet?
Sometimes.
Don't you?
"No, it's blocked at my house."
"I thought it was because of my dad, but now I'm wondering if it's because of my mom."
Hmm.
You'll be fine.
"My dentist accidentally sexts me, like, once a week."
Ooh.
You know what I'm gonna do?
"I'll look him in the eye and I'll just say,"
"""Hey, autocorrect completely changed the grocery list I gave your dad."""
"Well, not completely."
"I mean, ""cream"" and ""meat"""
could have stayed the same.
"God, Tim, why?"
Why aren't you helping me with this?
!
"I'm sorry, honey."
"I'm just enjoying this too much because, for once, it's not me who screwed up."
"Okay, you know what I need?"
I-I need the advice...
of a professional.
Did I do this to you?
Did I make you like this?
"It's one who sets the table, prepares a meal or teaches in a certain way."
"- You're an artist, isn't she?"
- Thank you.
Why didn't you use the Limoges?
May I serve you?
- Rose!
- My hands are clean.
"We go to all this trouble, and Rose and I don't eat very much."
- Really?
- Mmm.
I've always thought she had a very healthy appetite.
I can't stand women who eat two bites and say they're full.
Do you really need extra salt?
You know how it retains water.
Can I have some?
And potatoes.
Mmm-mmm.
You don't need them.
Have you ever sat in on one of your daughter's classes?
- Rose!
- What?
That's the best part.
- Rose tells me you've never been married.
- Mom.
"That's all right, Rose."
"That's correct, Mrs. Morgan."
I guess I haven't found the right girl.
"I've had relationships that haven't worked out, but that will change."
Really?
Why?
"As I told Rose,"
I have a theory about love and sex.
You're the best we've got.
Am I really?
"It's more than psychiatry, and you know that, Tom."
"Some of their problems come down to faith their vocation, the meaning of their lives, and I can't cut it anymore."

"-Oh, circuits, my ass!"
He doesn't give a shit.
-Why don't you let me--?
"-No, I've got it, Sharon."
It's all right.
Yes.
"No, operator, don't tell me there's no answer."
It's the Hotel Excelsior in Rome.
"Would you try it again, please, and let it ring?"
Hello?
Yes.
"No, operator, I've given you the number four times."
"Do you take an illiteracy test to get that job, for Christ's sakes?"
"Don't tell me to be calm, goddamn it!"
Yeah?
You're kidding me.
Okay.

A query.

Has Katy mentioned anything about me not talking to her?
- Can confirm.
- Major league.
- It's working.
- What's working?
"By not talking to her, she will form the conclusion that I'm upset with her and eventually ask me why."
"Why you so butt-hurt, Stewart?"
"- Well, she acts like..."
- Just kidding.
I don't give a fuck.
DAN:
Wait.
"So, you're upsets with her, and you wanna communicate that by not communicatings?"
Acutely.

"Uh, ""nothing to live for,"""
"and then at the ending, when he says about the St. Louis Arch."
"Oh, my God."
Okay.
"Well, he-- he can't mean the thing about the Arch."
You've got to be a sherpa to get up that thing.
"So, where is he?"
I--
Oh.
I didn't hear you girls come in.
Oh.
"Uh, I was just doodling the way a depressed person does."
- Ha!
- How would you even climb up the Arch?
"That was a thoughtless, childish, moronic thing to do!"
"Okay, I'm-- I'm sorry, but... on the other hand, what reason do I have to live?"
I don't know.
Why don't you ask the Arch?
"No, I mean it."
"My kids are gone, I have no wife, even my parents have died."
"I'm... nobody's son, nobody's husband, nobody's father."
But... you are the father of our child.
I'm not even that.
A dead man.
A dead man at the lagoon.
We have to leave!
He's been into the grog again!
"Shut your mouth, will!"
"We all saw it, right?"
It's true.
I saw it with me own eyes.
- It rose up like a demon!
- Demon?
Get the women back into the stockade!
"First it attacked you, now it's come for me."
This place is cursed.
We're all cursed!
"Calm down, man!"
We have to find another island to get provisions from before it's too late.
"- It's a devil, sir."
- He speaks the truth.
"Right, you lot."
Load all the goods into the longboat!
Did you not hear him?
Move it!
We shouldn't have taken the ship!
"Shut up, man!"
You're giving everyone the jitters!
He must be sun-struck.
Let me help.
Right.
Just keep him away from the rest of the men.
Come on.
"Roll out the barrel, boys!"
Just put your shoulder into it.
"Hey, who you calling Matthew Perry, bitch?"
"I'm calling you Matthew Perry, you Matthew Perry-Iooking bitch!"
"No, there's nobody here who is Matthew Perry."
No one!
What is going on here?
"Sir, Matthew Perry over here thinks that I have illegal narcotics on me... because I'm a minority."
This is textbook racial profiling... and I'd be more than happy to call the ACLU or the government--
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no."
"Sorry for the inconvenience, sir."
- You can move along.
- I appreciate it.
"Thanks, Matt Perry."
"Why does everything have to become a huge argument with you, man?"
"'Cause this is America, dude... and as long as I have my freedom of speech, no one's gonna shut me up."

Roldy?
- Vanessa.
"- Oh, my God!"
- Good to see you.
- So good to see you. l--
- Hi.
Hey.
- Hey.
Hey.
"God, it's been forever."
What are you guys doing?
We're actually on our way to Amsterdam.
- Amsterdam?
- Yeah.
"Well, you guys haven't changed."
You have.
You look amazing.
"Yes, Sir."
"Yes, it was an accident."
A coconut fell from the tree at full speed and shattered the glass.
Repair cost me 4000 rupees.
This car?
Did you replace a damaged windshield?
- Yes.
How did it get damaged?
Some kids broke it while playing cricket on the streets.
Mohan.
"- Welcome, Sir."
I want the details of those who have changed windshields.
"Here it is, Sir."
A car from Dindigul has been here for a windshield change.
Let's enquire.
This is the number.
"Siri, call..."
"I'm dead serious in the middle of this,"
You are always poking the phone in my face saying 'Siri...'
Can't you even dial a number?
"Sorry, Sir."
I'm used to it.
"Yes, a minor accident."
So I changed the windshield.
I had even filed an FIR to claim insurance.
Do you want the FIR number?
It's okay.
Not necessary.
Thanks.
Are we taking the right path?
Only some places are left.
Let's hope for the best.
I don't care!
Fine!
Do whatever you want!
Why did you come back?
Leave me alone!
Chun-su.
What do you want?
I looked into the tax collection in the village.
"In all, we've paid over 70% of our harvest in taxes."
I bet there is not another saltern city in the country that paid so much!
I'm going to...
Give it up!
Chun-su...
What's this going to change?
Will it bring my father back?
Don't make me in a difficult spot and give it a rest.
Chun-su...
"I don't want anything to do with this, so give it up."
Soon-shin.
Mother...
Where are you going so early?
What are you up to?
And what's that written in that book?
Mother...
A friend's father is dead.
"And if I don't do something, my friend may not be safe either."
But this isn't something you can resolve.
I know.
"I know what's scaring you, Mother."
But I have to do this.
"If I don't, I'll never forgive myself."
Soon-shin!
"Oh, God, I'm not pregnant."
I'm not pregnant.
That's ridiculous.
- Chug a beer then.
PAIGE:
"No, I'm not chugging a beer."
CATHERINE:
Chug a beer.
PAIGE:
"We're in love, you assholes."
"That's what people do when they're in love, they get married."
But you know what?
"Not everybody gets married, you know?"
There are many people who never get married.
"Well, thanks for the inspirational pep talk."
What she meant to say was that it's fine that you broke up with Neil.
Right.
Tons of people make the choice to be alone.
They're happy.
Look at Al Pacino.
"Never been married, happy as a clam."
Would that...?
Am I...?
Would I be Al Pacino in this scenario?
"No, Bethie, we just..."
We want you to be happy.
"Well, then you should have rethought the coral."
LAURA:
"Oh, her face."
- Your face.
- Don't make her cry.
I'm sick of these coral jokes.
"So, why don't you stay the hell away from them?"
(grunting)
Ow!
You're gonna bust my arm. (yells)
"Look, I'm not warning you again."
You hear me?
You stay away from them.

It was something you touched.
The picture.
Caught out by Jesus!

You killed those people.
Why?
Absolutely authentic.

It brought him lots of luck.

Isn't this a rather large house for you?
"Oh, I don't know."
In Europe I lived in a palace for some time.
So did I.
But when the king was unfaithful...
I moved.
You know the price is $300.000 furnished.
I'll give you a fairly substantial deposit.
$5.000 in cash.
I'll sigh the rest of the papers tomorrow.
"You really make up your mind fast, don't you?"
"Oh, you!"
"Yes, sir?"
Who do you work for?
"No one, sir."
Now that you have bought the house.

You're totally paranoiac.

Where is she?
Why do you need to know?
You know what will happen if you go outside.
Yes.
I won't be a B8 anymore.
I won't be handicapped and Globale will lose its contract.
They pay you.
So you have no interest in my going outside.
Look.
We all want you to get better.
to go outside.
But gradually.
I want to find her!
Remember two days ago?
You almost died.
Was it fun?
You want to try it again?
Introduce yourself!
Pleased to meet you.
We got off on the wrong feet.
I didn't know who you were.
"Brother, I have a little party going at the back gate."
Come wet your whistle.
I'm on duty.
I have to guard my prisoners.
Come on?
Are you afraid they'll break out of here when they're barely clinging to life?
Let the new kid watch your post and come with me.
I shouldn't be doing this...
"Oh, it's all right!"
"Kid, stay right here and watch the prisoners."
You got that?
"Chun-su, Chun-su!"
"Chun-su, wake up!"
Water...
Water...
Here.
Here's some water.
I'm sorry...
I caused to you and Chun-su...
"No, it's not your fault."
Baron Huh did this to us.
This is what I get for twenty years of loyalty.
Isn't this pathetic?
But I will not go down like this.
"Baron Huh, that bastard, I will kill him if it's the last thing I do!"
I hope I'm not asking too much of you.
Don't mention it.
Chun-su isn't just your friend.
"Oh, gosh."
"- You""re not having a good week."
- Try a good year.
"- You don""t have to get that."
"- That""s all right."
- That was my lunch.
"- L""ll buy you lunch."
"You must think I""m always this pathetic."
"Looks like you""re trying to do everything by yourself."
You could use help.
"Yeah, mental help."
Does our medical cover that:
Commitment to a psych ward?
"Lt""s okay to ask for help, Lisa."
"It just means you""re human, that""s all."
"You""re human."
"Morning, Dr. Harris."
- Those things will kill you.
- So they say.
Smile.
Big smile.
"Oh, my goodness, you are so clean."
You smell good.

Infidelity is a virus spreading since the beginning of time.
"It lives in our tree-lined neighborhoods, in our office buildings... our churches, coffee shops, and YMCAs."
"David, I need you."
Come here.
Come here and hold me.
"He's a genius, right?"
And you're his partner.
Partner/ babysitter/assistant/ babysitter.
- What's your name?
- Natalie Teeger.
"Ms. Teeger,"
"I know this probably sounds callous, but have you ever done any acting?"
Me?
- No!
"- Well, here's my problem."
"We've got another show tomorrow night, and"
"I know it's terrible timing, but we need someone to pick the numbers."
You mean on Tv?
I think you're a natural.
"- No, I don't think so."
- Here you go.
I was just talking to his nephew on the phone.
He couldn't even believe it was really me.
Felt like felt like fats Domino.
"Mr. Monk, this is Mr. Lawrence."
He's the station manager.
He just asked me to be the new Lotto girl.
Only for one night.
We can hold a regular audition over the weekend.
What do you think?
I don't know.
What do you think?
- I think it sounds like fun.
"- I know, but here's the thing."
Tomorrow is... wednesday.
- We already made plans.
- What plans?
"Well, it's impolite to kiss and tell."

"- Where's Stewart been, Katy?"
- He's not talking to me.
- Why?
- I don't know.
"Here are your birthday pancakes, big brother."
Don't fuck with tradition.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
BOTH:
"Happy birthday, Wayne."
Jinx.
You owe me a Coke.
"Well, see now, that you can get in the States."
"What you can't get, though, is Crush Cream Soda."
- BOTH:
"We got you a present, Wayne."
- Two Cokes.
We don't make a thing of birthdays in this family.
Can we skip my super-soft birthday party then this year?
Hard no!
"It's not a birthday thing, it's an efficiency thing."
"Uh, if you can be one thing, you should be efficient."
We got you an appointment with a matchmaker.
Get the...
Take a...
"Well, start walkin'."
"Well, you won't do online dating."
"There's no more MoDeans, so you can't meet girls there."
"You're handcuffed, cowboy."
- Peralta...
Holt.
I know you're here.
I'm gonna kill you.
- I don't think so.
- Oh...
"- Put down the weapon, Figgis."
There you go.
"Oh, yes."
I've been waiting for this moment a long time.
You ruined my life.
I had to live in Florida for six months!
- It's the worst.
Have you tried the pizza down here?
"- Yeah, it's the most disgusting thing I've ever tasted."
It somehow burned my mouth and is cold at the same time.
But none of that changes the fact that you're about to go to prison for the rest of your life.
"- Drop it, Sherbert!"
- What?
No!
"- I've been everywhere, and I finally spotted your minivan with the New York plates parked around back."
We already got all your friends.
So drop it.
- You don't understand.
I'm a detective with the NYPD.
This is Jimmy Figgis;
he's wanted by the FBI.
"- No, I'm Constantine Binvoglio, and I came here to repair a skee ball machine on the the fritz, but suddenly he's trying to kill me."
- He's lying.
"""Constantine Binvoglio."""
It's clearly a name he just made up.
I'm very impressed.
"Bankers' conference, Vienna."
Sorry.
- You couldn't tell me any sooner?
"- Sorry, I forgot."
Okay.
Let's go outside and talk.
What is this?
It's quite noisy outside.
What silent kind of a conversation do you want to have?
"We talk a lot, don't we?"
But we don't listen to this.
I think they are both conspiring against us.
We have no control.
So what now?
"So now, let's leave them alone."
They are acting smart.
"It's all about trust, right?"
So let's see what they do when they are alone.
One week.
Away from each other.
And what if they don't mend their ways?
Next level?
Do you really have to go?
It's good in a way.

I didn't mean to kill him.
I didn't mean it.
He's all right.
I didn't mean to...
He's fine.
"Calm down, be brave!"
- You stay there!
-Jeffrey!
Let's get out of here.
Then you can arrest me.
Let's getJenny out of here.
The car's outside.
Come on!
I won't let you put me behind bars!
Throw the gun down.
You wouldn't kill a cop.
Thankyou.
You could have killed me with one shot.
I don't kill anybody until I know they are the real enemy.
- Do you really know me?
- Fate controls everything.
The only person who really knows me turns out to be a cop.
You could always give yourself up.
No.
I made a promise.
I keep my word.
"Sometimes, I really envy you, your freedom."
It's something I don't have.
"I believe in justice, but nobody trusts me."
I have the same problem.
You're an unusual cop.
And you're an unusual killer.
She was first in the room.
"I followed immediately after, sir."
Who's Miss Kelly?
"She works for Mr. Sabourin, sir."
Yeah?
And where should she be found?
"She's in his mother's room, sir."
You mean his mother lives here with him?
"Just since she came from Europe, yes, sir."
Let's look over the rest of the room.
Show me his personal things.
"Yes, sir."
"This way, sir."
It couldn't have been robbery.
"Yeah, if it was they overlooked a lot of cash and jewelry in these boxes."
"Diamond cufflinks, diamond rings, women's jewelry."
"Look at this, gold handcuffs."
Must be a dozen of them in here.
"Yeah, they're all over town."
He liked to think his women were his slaves.
Show me his mother's room.
"Yes, sir."
"This way, sir."
I'm sorry to break in.
We're police.
I'm her doctor.
You can't disturb her now.
He can ask me anything he wants.
"I'm sorry I have to do this, mam."
But do you know anything about this?
No.
I know nothing about who killed my son.
Everything's near a beach.
"- Okay, then Tallahassee it is."
- Tallahassee it is.
Are you sure?
Is this... what you really want?
What I really want is you.
What is that?
Keeps the time.
(Crow caws)
You have somewhere to be?
"We can mark watches, take turns sleeping."
"We'll most likely have to walk through the night again, so we should rest while we can."
I'll take first shift.
I'll stay up with you.
Okay.
When's the last time you slept?
I don't really sleep now.
Not after what I've been through.
Sleeping curse.
"The one time I did sleep, I had horrible nightmares."
It's a side effect.
Same thing happened to me.
It did?
Mm.
I had them for months.
Charming... my husband... he used to wake me.
"When I cried out, he'd light a candle."
He said it would capture the nightmares.
He'd watch over me as I fell back to sleep.
Sounds like he lives up to his name.
Yeah.
Um... why don't you try... to sleep?
I call even that thing my brother.
But the Hyung Ahjussi already dumped me.

- Cops are coming.
"You want to yell at me some more, or should we both get out of here?"
Neither.
"Hey, Mick."
"Oh, it... it's me."
It's Ray.
I-I thought we should talk.
Drive.
Well you didn't waste any time getting back to your old habits.
I like stealing stuff.
It makes me feel good.
Did you ever think that maybe you weren't meant to do this anymore?
"What do you want, haircut?"
"To apologize, sort of."
For Snart.
"I was the one who was supposed to die,"
"You know, a car is like a man."
It needs to rest and restore itself.
It's given up the ghost.
It's overheating.
Can it be mended?
"Yes, it will work again."
Don't ask so many questions or I'll give up the ghost too... at this altitude.
I've forgotten my book.
- What?
- l've forgotten my book.
"Don't worry, the others will bring it."
I have exams.
They'll be coming up to join us soon.
I have to study.
I'll tell them to bring it.
I have to study to have a good grade.
What a pest...
"Ali, bring him up the book."
Where is it?
On top of the dashboard.
People always come this way?
"No, there are several different paths."
It's a tough one.
This isn't the main path.
Where is it?
It's a long way off.
This path is shorter.
- ls that why we've taken it?
- Yes.
"Wait, why are you going so fast?"
It was the best way!
That's what you want.
That bitch is trying to take money out of my fist.
That's it!
Out.
Get out!
Wait.
Darlene's busting you for child's support?
She's trying to tell me this Chinese-eyed motheftucker is my kid.
- Angel:
That's bullshit!
"- Un plato, and that's it."
"Shitty day, man."
How is your kid in Santo Domingo doing?
"What, Junior?"
My real kid?
"Good, man."
I can't wait.
"Save my money, soon as I get my 60 Gs, getting the fuck outta here."
"Go back to the D.R., live with him and Carmen."
I'm gonna open me a bike shop.
"Stay with my tío in Baitoa, just till I get hooked up."
"He got a farm, and when you're done working all day, you go lay on this hammock, next to the pond."
"You just lay there, bro'."
You let the breeze hit your face.
"You're chillin' with your boxers off, and the wind kissing your balls..."
Maggie:
Darlene is only asking for 600 a month.
Angel:
Guess how much she's getting?
Zero dollars.
"The thing of it is, that bitch rats me out,"
I'm as good as back in lockup.
That's why I don't trust nobody.
"Me, too."
I'm totally bushed today.
Good night.
"-Tomorrow, Iet's all go there and see."
-Go where?
See what?
Those two trees that committed double suicide by being struck by lightning.
Don't be stupid!
That happened a Iong time ago.
Those trees can't still be there.
I can't see them.
"Grandma told me they were still here, though."
Burnt trees keep standing forever because they won't rot.
There they are!
That's it!
Let's go and see.
Why don't we just look from where we are?
"I don't know why, but I'm a little scared."
"""Those two cedar trees look as if they have committed double suicide."""
"""We are two eIopers."
"""Why not live next to them?"""
What are you doing?
Sorry!
I just got carried away because of the mood.
Stupid!
I'm going back!
Wait a minute!
"Hey, wait a minute!"
What's wrong?
Something's weird.
An old lady from somewhere came to visit Grandma.
So what?
"As promised, yes"
Please we'll be forever grateful
Farewell...

why are you running around?
I have a friend who has been taken away by the Green Bat
Green Bat?
His martial art skill greatly excels yours
You are no match for him
I have to
And so what if they laugh?
- So what?
- Don't tell me what I know... you haven't been through things like me.
"And I hope I'll never do, if that makes me so scared."
- I'm not scared!
"- Yes you are, Violet."
"You don't trust anyone, or anything.."
You never did.
I trusted you!
What?
I said I trusted you!
When did you stop?
The second I saw that goddamn dress on your back!
That's just perfect then.
Why?
Because now you don't have anything at all.
- So what are you trying to say?
- I just said it.
"Say it again, if you have the guts."
- You heard me!
- I'm gonna kick your ass!
Cut it off bitch!
You're gonna mess up my new dress.
My landlady was coming up the street.
I was just... just messin' with her.
Never shot a gun before.
- How was it?
- What do you aim on for some new shoes now?
- Shut up about it!
- You shut up about it!
- Make me!
- I just did!
No.
Because I've heard it all before.
"No, I can't do this any more, Richard."
"Just leave me alone, OK?"
- Sorry.
- Don't be.
"Well, other people's rows."
"Oh, they're great, they're very entertaining."
Especially ones where they're shouting in the street.
"Well, we're done with the shouting."
- Is that why you're here?
- Yeah.
I left him.
- Poor guy.
- He messed up.
- Stupid guy.
"- I like to think I'm the easy-going type but, well, there are some things that can never be forgiven."
Tell me about it.
"My name's John, by the way."
I'm Rose.

Be nice if somebody would.
Would you like another drink?
"- So, where are you heading?"
- Patagonia.
- Travelling light.
- Mm-hm.
"Well, you don't need much stuff out there, do you, so..."
Just a change of clothes and a bottle of whisky.
"- I don't have any whisky, actually."
-I'm not really reading it.
-You just looking at it?
I'm skimming it.
-Is it helping?
"-Yeah, it's informative."
-It's good for an overview.
"-What, like a primer?"
"-Yeah, something like that."
"-Getting the basics, a light survey of popular culture."
-Are you teasing me?
-No.
Should I be reading the Journal of Medicine or the Harvard Review?
Would that be more appropriate?
-Something more scholarly?
"-No, come on, Al."
I was teasing.
"I could harass you about those porno magazines, but I didn't even bring it up."
Wha--?
Come on.
I don't care about the porno magazines.
-I just didn't know you liked Juggs.
"-Oh, God."
-Sorry I don't have enormous breasts.
"-Please, stop it."
Your breasts are fine.
Your breasts are perfect.
Really.
"Yeah, but who's had 72 lovers?"
Where did you come up with that fucking number?
I'm guessing from what you said.
"Well, I'm 16 years older than you."
That's a lifetime of fucking.
- Thanks.
- Be right back.
"Uh, Ms. McCabe, I have to go."
Thank you for your time.
[Gasps]
"Damn it, Alexis."
You're just like your old man.
You can't leave things alone.
Are you going to kill me?
What?
Why would you say that?
"Oh, I don't know."
Maybe because you're connected to my dad's missing time and now you're hiding in the back of my rental car.
"Alexis, I would never hurt you."
This isn't what you think.
"What the hell is your game, Hayley?"
"Believe me, you don't want to know."
Neither does your father.
Why not?
It's complicated.
Jordan Keegan?
We need to talk.
About what?
"Well, your name came up in a homicide."
This is the murder weapon.
It's a prop from a movie that you wrote.
So?
"So, did you happen to keep one as a souvenir?"
Perhaps two?
"One for yourself, one for your partner out in Los Angeles?"
What are you guys talking about?
"We're talking about Pat Crews, your old writing teacher."
-
- Pardon?
-
- It's not so loud.
-
- I can't hear you for that shirt.
The milk woman loves it.
Don't change the subject.
We're talking about shirts.
We've got an empty shop here.
"Come on, you're supposed to be outside getting customers in."
Smarten yourself up.
What's the point?
I'll only make a fool of myself.
Then make a smartly--dressed fool of yourself.
-
- Call this smartly--dressed?
-
- It's style for an apprentice shopkeeper.
I know.
"It's a hell of a rig for a fighter pilot, though!"
"Granville, you're going out on your first solo mission!"
The world is your oyster.
"Go out, pick a victim, and come at him out of the sun."
"You're on your own, B--B--Biggles."
Bring 'em back alive.
I'll hold your parachute.
"What are you doing, charging into people that way?"
-
- You can stop people's breath that way!
-
- Ow!
"The first time I was introduced to all of them at once, it was crazy."
Paulie and his brothers had lots of sons and nephews.
Almost all of them were named Peter or Paul.
It was unbelievable.
"Meet Paulie Jr., my nephew."
And this is Petey.
There must have been two dozen Peters and Pauls at the wedding...
This is Marie.
"...plus, they were all married to girls named Marie."
She looks Italian.
And they named all their daughters Marie.
And this is Pete.
"No, I mean Paulie."
I get confused myself.
"By the time I had met everybody, I thought I was drunk."
"Paulie, you shouldn't have."
Welcome to the family.
Sunday dinner?
So beautiful. I want to cry.
"Karen, here's something to help you get started, huh?"
-The bag.
The bag.
-What bag?
"The bag with the envelopes in it, all the money."
Don't worry about that.
Nobody's going to steal that here.
He didn't call?
-He's with his friends.
-What kind of person doesn't call?
He's a grown-up.
He doesn't have to call every five minutes.
If he was such a grown-up why doesn't he get you two an apartment.
"Well, I've got $50 that says you can't get one past me out there."
What do you say?
Ls that a yes?
"You know, I've got the lowest goals against in Pennsylvania history, right?"
Wow!
That's really funny because I've scored the most in Pennsylvania history.
"Yeah, but for girls."
Come on.
Combined.
All right.
Let's go.
And this.
Let's go.
Give it to me.
Come on!
Let's go.
"Come on, you got better than that."
"Let's go, you're the MVP girl."
"Oh, man."
I could get you in a game.
You just need to be distracted.
"Trust me, watching you shoot in that shirt is distracting enough."
So?
Ls this feng shui hockey for real?
"We got gear, uniforms and our fees paid."
"And they can run the practises, but we'll still play the games my way."
- So lots of skating and no scoring?
- That is harsh.
"You open with the Hounds, Saturday."
Drop the Zen crap.
Control the blue line and put me on the roster.
Then you'll have a shot.
I had an affair.
And how did that make him feel?
"Sad, maybe?"
"The reason they're so powerful is because they got the resources, you know?"
"They got investigators and a shit load of money, 200 or 300 little creeps running around there that can search the internet or research whatever they need, you know."
Big operation.
They got everything on everybody.
- Well--
- Sorry I'm late.
Didn't you even know I was late?
We started the trial.
- I'm sorry--
- I know.
I was there for some of it.
It's not going so good for your team.
"I don't know where this came from or what it means, so don't ask."
That right there is the last favor I do for you.
Hi.
How's it going?
"Oh, no."
What happened to your hand?
Please go away.
- No?
- Mm-mm.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Um... what?
Oh.
"We got a couple of creeps, too."
Right.
Okay.
So... these are Stoltz' military records from the Marines.
And also I'd like us a decent stove.
This one is covered in fat.
"It'd be nice to have like a white, beautiful place and a decent stove."
It's not a lot to ask.
"Wow, don't look so surprised."
Even a call girl can scramble an egg.
You know what's funny?
I don't think I ever cooked for a guy before.
I mean not even my husband.
Jesus Christ.
Where is he?
Who?
You know who.
- Trevor.
- Don't.
"Jesus, Trevor, what's wrong?"
"This, Ivan."
"He's your ex, isn't he?"
What?
Why is he doing this?
"It's because I'm fucking you, isn't it?"
Now it all makes sense.
"I'm fucking you, so he's fucking me."
Where is he?
"Hiding in the closet, beneath the bed?"
"I don't know what you are talking about, baby."
"Ah, don't baby me."
"Yeah, baby."
I'll change my whole fucking life for you.
"I'll do anything you want, baby."
"You know what, I don't deserve this."
What did you do?
"Hey, put that on the wall."
"If I can't have my lab, no one's having her."
"Now, don't lose this."
"Fuck you, Akan."
And don't change your channel.
We're coming right over.
"All right, I counted six vehicles."
That's at least 35 men.
We've gotta cut them down to half that before they enter the hotel to give us a fighting chance to get out alive.
"Also, there's a certain stigma attached to blokes who like musicals."
I just wanna get it out there right now that I'm straight as an arrow.

You know...
Oh.

There's one thing I have to say.
I promised your sister I wouldn't.
"You love Claire, too?"
You just slept with her?
- You want to?
- I don't even know her.
It's about how I found you.
I wrote this ad...
I think that's kind of great.
- I thought you'd be upset.
- Why?
You picked me.
"Actually, I found you through this charming woman on TV..."
"Well, well, well..."
Ha...
So?
Gregory just proposed to me.
Do you need a Valium?
"I know you don't respect my opinion, but I don't trust him."
"I mean, where's the attraction?"
He's not attracted to me.
He doesn't want sex.
He wants to be companions.
What sane person would agree to that kind of marriage?
It's not natural.
I humbly ask you to tend to your children with love.
Deign to see the pain and suffering of my friend and those like him.
"Chun-su, what are you doing?"
!
They'll take everything away anyway.
I'd rather bum it myself.
I'm going to destroy everything and follow my friend.
Chun-su!
Please tend to my father's grave.
He's burned everything!
Who's next?
First old man Yim then his son Chun-su: who's next?
Say something!
Are you mute?
"Don't get involved, Father."
"Hush up, boy?"
Old man Yim was like family to us.
But we just let them take him.
"Heck, we didn't even go to his funeral because we were afraid!"
What do we have except our friends?
"If we lowly peasants don't stick together, who are we to trust and depend on?"
Who goes there!
"Soon-shin, I'm here for you!"
It's me.
Yim Chun-su!
Soon-shin!
Soon-shin!
"It's me, Yim Chun-su!"
Soon-shin!
Soon-shin!
What are you waiting for?
Stop this man!
- All right.
OK.
Spare me the lecture.
I already know what you're gonna say so I'm just going to fast forward through all the bull crap that you're about to...
You should be happy for Justin he's your...
Oh.
"I'm so disappointed in you,"
Danny.
Good night.
Let's get high and watch wrestling.
"To be fair, that is what I say first thing in the morning."
"- Danny, Justin's your best friend."
- So?
It's OK to be hurt that he's leaving.
Don't you understand that this is all a ruse on
Justin's behalf?
He's not even really moving out.
Look.
All these boxes are empty.
See?
Oh.
It's all of his khakis.
- I guess he really is moving out.
- Aw.
"Danny, I know how scary it can be to admit how you really feel."
"I mean look how long it took me to admit how I feel about Burski but now I can look you straight in the eyes and I can say ""I love Burski""?"
You don't even realize you said that as a question.
I really do?
I like him.
I do.
OK.
I like him.
Are you all right?
"-Hey, you don't look so good."
-I just need to get some water.
No one leaves their seats.
Stiles says you know how Jackson's parents died.
Maybe.
Talk.
It was a car accident.
"My dad was the insurance investigator, and every time he sees Jackson drive by in his Porsche, he makes some comment about the huge settlement he'll be getting when he's 18."
"So not only is Jackson rich now, but he's getting even richer at 18?"
Yep.
There's something so deeply wrong with that.
You know what?
I could try to find the insurance report in my dad's inbox.
He keeps everything.
victoria ON PA:
"Scott McCall, please report to the principal's office."
Jackson!
"I'm fine, just give me a minute."
(gasping)
(sighs)
Perfect.
STlLES:
Look at the dates.
"erica: ""Passengers arrived at the hospital DOA."
"""The estimated time of death 9:26 p.m., June 14, 1995."""
Jackson's birthday is June 15th.
(LAUGHS)
"No, I'm sorry."
"Yes, I'm leaving."
But none of you are.
You may go when you're done with the re-shelving.
Let's go!
Follow me to a place.
Where?
Don't ask!
Just follow me.
- No way!
"- In case the baby is born, didn't you think about how miserable its life will be?"
You can not keep this baby!
- But what will happened to you?
- I'd rather be prisoned.
Absolutely not!
- I can not ruin your life!
- Shu Yawang!
"I will be prisoned, for 7 or 8 years at most."
"If you keep the baby, you will ruin the life of three person!"
"You, me, and this baby!"
I knew you would come.
"Qu Weiran, if just I'm not a soldier,"
I would have killed you.
Good then.
"When you kill me, Shu Yawang's unborn baby will be the bastard."
You bastard!
Good.
Kill me.
Go kill me.
Go away.
"Qu Weiran, live longer."
Make sure you do.
"Once you start a happy life,"
I will come to make sure you never can do it.
It is raining.
What date is it?
Natasha Franks.
Yeah JP shoots her all the time.
What about her?
Ok I just read this it was on CMZ.
"So ""Natasha Franks, German supermodel."
Recently has confirmed reports that she is Three months pregnant.
Sources confirm that celebrity... fashion photographer JP Gio.
Whatever his name is...
is the father.
JP is well known as a Los Angeles savant and has been linked to several Hollywood socialites.
"Stay tuned... as the story develops."""
I'm done.
I'm sorry.
I'm done dating men in this city.
So tired of being the nice girl that always get burnt.
"Wait, wait..."
I mean this guy's a jerk.
No I...
"Hey, Dale."
Hey.
Hi.
Zach.
"You look, you look fantastic."
"Oh, thanks I..."
I cut my bangs.
It suits you very much.
I knew ZACH before he was a rock star.
He was the lead singer of this cool garage band.
"Now he's got four Grammys, and he's a shoe in for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame."
But to me... he'll all ways be good old Zach.
"Wow, long time no see."
"Ah, this is my friend Hallie."
I think... cleaning's overrated.
There's still hot food down there to eat.
There's something really truthful about this waiting... and doing the whole job at once.
"We're gonna use up all the dishes, and then it's time to clean."
So you want to talk about it?
Not really.
Hallie call?
No.
Call her?
And say what?
I haven't done anything.
I do.
I'm not a housewife.
And I found fleas in the bedroom.
You mean my pets?
"I think fleas are people, too."
And... they should be treated as such.
Those are my pets.
And you're going to kill them?
Are you a murderess?
"Seven, what do you think I should do?"
Be honest.
"Well, I've been honest."
Not with Hallie.
With yourself.
"Sorry, babe."
I cannot give you any more advice on this one.
Just take mine!
And you put on... your...
"You know, if Vanessa has a problem with it she should clean that (bleep) up."
"Hey, it's Dale."
"Listen, Hallie, why don't you just call me back, please."
Where's his mom?
- What type of mask?
"- Uh, round, like a baby."
Okay.
What do you see next?
[Laughter]
Fire.
"They were grilling lamb, and, uh, people were cheering."
[Rossi] All right.
It was a Greek restaurant.
"Baby, me and gyros?"
"- No, thanks."
- What?
- I'm gonna go check out this Mexican food.
"- Oh, baby, no."
"Baby, I'll be right back."
- All right.
- Stay there.
- I'm gonna come and get you.
- All right.
"[Rossi] Now, do you remember anyone in the crowd, anyone that didn't fit in?"
[Kiersten] No.
"But to be honest, I was already looking at the menu."
"All right, that's good."
"Now, don't look up from the menu."
Just listen to me.
"Now, when you love someone and they step away, there's an instinctive response to glance up to make sure that they're still there."
"Now, you did that last night, even if you don't remember."
Okay.
You're getting ready to place an order.
I already know what I'm getting.
I'm getting the gyros.
Fine.
He thinks I'm paranoid!
"I should bring him the helicopter, then we'll see how paranoid I am."
"Come on, let's go inside."
"- Yeah, it's gone."
- I don't hear anything.
Let's go back to your mother's.
- They all right?
- Beautiful.
They're great.
"Didn't I tell you, you were paranoid?"
Didn't I tell him?
Yeah.
I need a hit.
Want to see helicopters?
"Come on, I'll show you helicopters."
"I've seen enough helicopters for one day, thank you."
My plan was I had to get home and get the package ready for Lois to take on her trip.
"Also, I had to get to Sandy's house to give the package a whack with quinine."
"Plus, I knew Sandy would get on my ass."
"Then I had the cooking to finish, and I had to get Lois ready for her trip."
- It's Sandy.
What is this?
- She's a pain in the ass.
- When are you coming over?
- In an hour.
"- You staying tonight, right?"
- I can't.
I got my brother tonight.
"Come on, stop."
"We'll talk about it later, okay?"
Goodbye.
Why do not you make yourself room.
I'm exhausted.
No heart!
DEATH ...
Book of death?
How to use it .
This is English.
The person whose name is written in the notebook dies
This works if has the face of the person in mind.
This is ineffective on people of the same name and surname.
The cause of death must be written within 40 seconds for that to happen.
Cardiac arrest is systematic absence of cause.
Very fun.
Ouch!
I will not let go .
I would have preferred it to disappear
Ridiculous.
- This is his?
- Yes.
"Yagami, you know some Sakota?"
- Yes.
- Mr. Yagami Light.
Yes.
I checked the content and it's your mobile phone.
He was in his jacket pocket.
Uh...
He reportedly died.
Died?
Water boils!
Last night 23 to 30 h at a motorcycle race he crashed into the barriers a crossing.
He died instantly.
You know him?
You...
[Giggling]
"- Oh, my poor boy!"
"- Why do you say that, Doctor?"
"Well, it just occurred to me:"
You must be under tremendous emotional strain:
Strain?
No:
Why?
"Because when that simulacrum of Wilma was destroyed, well, you lost the Goral of your dreams, didn't you?"
The Goral of your dreams!
You lost her!
[All Groaning And Laughing]
All Things Pass
Darling.
Darling.
Dorien.
"This isn't possible, guys."
If only it had been a few days later.
Now we've been liberated.
"Even if it's the last thing I'll do, Niels is a dead man."
We'll get that bloody fascist.
No matter how.
We can never forget this.
We owe it to Arie.
I won't turn in my weapon.
Never.
Will you take the garbage bags out?
"-Yes, darling."
"It's not easy is it, old man?"
But I did keep up with you!
- The battery runs down.
"Now, what sort of a reduction are you going to give me on this room?"
- 60% if you turn it on.
- What?
My wife handles all such matters.
I'm sure she will be delighted to discuss it with you.
I shall speak to her after lunch.
"You heard that all right, didn't you?"
- What?
- Thank you so much.
Lunch will be served at half past 12:00.
Manuel!
Manuel!
Are you going to the betting shop today?
- What?
"- Oh, don't you start!"
You go betting shop today?
"Oh, sí!"
"Betting shop, sí!"
"Now, I want you to put this on this little horse,"
"Dragonfly, but... big secret."
Sybil no know.
"No, no, it's lovely."
It's just a bit buttery with my skin.
"I think I need something more... more... topazy, for my coloring, you know, more tonal."
Have you got...
have you got Cosmopolitan there?
"Page 42, you see Burt Reynolds?"
"Well, there's a girl standing behind him looking at James Caan."
That sort of color.
Mm.
Lovely.
"Mate, I'm as happy as a pig in shit."
"No, let's be honest."
It's not working.
"No, let's be honest."
It's not working.
"You're better off trying to run your own outfit, Greg."
"You're better off trying to run your own outfit, Greg."
"I'd rather a 2IC that was 100% happy,"
"I'd rather a 2IC that was 100% happy, not just 90%."
not just 90%.
You know?
You know?
This is what I'm thinking -
"This is what I'm thinking - pay you what I owe you, plus a few extras, pay you what I owe you, plus a few extras, we'll shake hands, part as friends."
"we'll shake hands, part as friends."
What do you say?
What do you say?
What extras?
How's a brand-new car sound?
What extras?
How's a brand-new car sound?
Plus a bag of your favourite scag as a bonus.
Plus a bag of your favourite scag as a bonus.
I could live with that.
I could live with that.
Lennie McPherson?
Lennie McPherson?
I am he.
I am he.
Phil Scott.
I rang you.
Phil Scott.

Aah!
Get them!
Aah!
Keep Savage and our Nazi friends occupied.
Gideon has detected a temporal signature consistent with a timeship.
"If Kendra and Carter are alive, that is where they're going to be."
"Yeah, I see it."
- Jax.
- You miss me?
Is he still nuts?
"No, he's okay."
Take this to the ship.
What the hell was that?
You transmuted the molecular properties of the rifle.
What does that even mean?
"Okay, let's get out of here."
Kendra's down.
"Rip, we're kind of outnumbered here."
Fall back.
Staying here to fight Nazis is exacerbating the damage that we have already done to the timeline.
- But Kendra...
"- Is alive, thankfully, and we will rescue her in due course."
I hope.
- So this is a spaceship?
"- It's a timeship, but yes, it does also travel through space."
"You... you've seen it before, Mr. Hall."
That used to be my name.
Worthless scrolls.
Where's the treasure?
I think you're looking at it.
That's right.
Solon himself said the Treasure of Atlantis has the power to command men's minds.
"Of course, books."
No.
It can't be true.
The Treasure of Atlantis... is knowledge.
There has to be more.
No!
You're destroying the scrolls!
Get away you stupid old fool.
I want treasure.
We gotta go.
But all this knowledge.
We can't let it be destroyed.
"Kelly, come on!"
"Come on, Kelly!"
Forget that.
"Well, that's our only way out."
Maybe we can tap into a little geothermal power of our own.
Geothermal power?
Professor.
Yes?
Stuff your jacket into one of those pipes.
Put a rock on top of it.
"Kelly, stand by the Torch."
"Well, whatever you've got in mind, MacGyver, hurry."
"Stand back, professor."
"All right, Kelly, hit it."
"Shut it off, Kelly."
"They tend to be pen snobs, strictly Montblanc and beyond."
Why does he creep you out?
- He doesn't creep me out.
"- Yes, he does."
You get a bad vibe from the guy.
- It's complicated.
- Tell me.
I like complicated.
Ari does a great deal of independent reading.
You can see she's excited by the idea of fiction.
It's one of the things that makes her a good student.
- So you're taking my wife out.
- Uh...
Sorry?
"Well, you're going out with my wife."
"To, uh, some book event?"
"Right, right."
The book signing next week.
"An event for an author we both like, Leonard Addams."
Leonard Addams.
Do you...?
Do you think he's good?
I like some of his stuff very much.
"Ella's a fan, too."
"Well, I think he's a fake."
Very overrated.
He has his critics.
He certainly wouldn't fit in to what I'm trying to do with Aria's class.
Is he really your idea of a good writer?
"Well, I like a lot of writers for a lot of different reasons."
Hmm.
"Ha, ha."
Good to see you.
Good to see you.
Bye.
Dad!
"Serena, I thought you left."
Um...
Is everything okay?
"Not really, no."
"I heard what you said in your speech,"
"And if you want to fight for mom, then you should do it."
Ahem.
Hi.
I think you girls got some misinformation.
I will be attending Columbia in the fall.
Oh.
"Well, that's awesome."
We have an extra room in the apartment.
Maybe you wanna move in with us?
No.
I don't live with the help.
"Oh, and you wanted to see a Blair Waldorf takedown?"
"Well, cross me again,"
And you'll experience one firsthand.
Hello?
"Hey, it's Jenny."
I want to talk to you about Lily.
"Obviously, I'm not a doctor,"
"And it's kind of a long story how I know this,"
But there's something weird about her medicine.
Elliot's the perfect mix of smart and fun.
"He speaks three languages,"
"But he has a subscription to ""People"" magazine."
See what they say.
- I don't have time.
What do you want?
Something I don't know.
They were tortured.
Were they raped?
I read your letter in the paper.
I liked it.
"If you catch me younger, I make you a hero."
It's a very rare film.
Not a common brand.
Imported.
I don't think many people around here use a roll like that.
I can find out who does.
But I want the photos of their cadavers.
From the autopsy.
I have a family.
I have to put food on the table.
Does your family know what you do?
My family thinks I'm the next Truman Capote.
He's an American writer.
Never mind.
Find out.
"I've seen your partner too, but I don't remember where."
Do you know if he ever worked in Vallecas?
- I'm sorry.
- Thank you.
I'm sorry.
I found my daughters' bankbook.
My husband had it hidden in the car.
We found this in the glove compartment of your car.
"What's going on, Rodrigo?"
"Now you form up here, put fire down on them."
They're coming and I'm going to meet them.
Captain Goree.
Come on!
"General, what are your orders, sir?"
What do you want me to do?
Where do you want me to go?
"You've got to pull back, General."
"Pull back, sir."
Place the guns.
Bring up the guns!
God!
"How are you, T.J.?"
"I'm tolerable, sir."
They aren't coming.
Too bad.
"Yes, sir."
General.
I'll tell you plain.
There are times when you worry me.
No good trying to get yourself killed.
The Lord will come for you in his own good time.
"What are the orders, sir?"
"Prepare for defense, but the Yankees aren't coming."
"Come on, boys."
I have the figures from Pickett's command.
General Armistead is missing.
"General Garnett, missing and figured to be dead, sir."
"General Kemper is down, seriously wounded."
"Sir, of the 13 colonels in Pickett's division, seven are dead and six are wounded."
No more.
You tell me the rest later.
I'd rather keep this monkey - than ruin my life loving a man who plays Batman in ketchup.
Right!
I'll change my mind as soon as the dogs stop barking - the stars fall off the sky and the flames of the world are down.
Did you get it all down?
-He did.
"Women are like that, Jesse."
Your mother said the same when she left me.
I love Haitian manioki.
It's the best.
"I'd like to make a toast with you, Marie-Claude."
Perhaps we'll sing the national song of Haiti together one day.
You're wonderful.
"I don't know you, Dad!"
"-No, you don't."
Where's the toilet?
Pee out the window.
I should brush my teeth.
My fiancée has a cold.
"What's wrong with you, Mom?"
Go back to sleep.
This is it.
What's wrong with Jesse now?
He's so weird.
And you hate him.
Are you taking orders from children now?
You're nuts.
It's too late to regret.
-Right.
Did you say that she can see into my soul?
"Relax, Jesse, and let her look."
Don't hide from her.
"Relax, take it easy."
- I may pass out here.
"- No, you won't."
- Do you know CPR?
"- Uh, n-no."
You're gonna need to take my right arm and put it across my chest.
Okay.
Make sure I don't roll over.
Then what do I do?
You're gonna have to give me mouth-to-mouth.
I'm sorry I said those things about the way you live.
I was scared.
It's like Allie said--people get mean when they get scared.
All right.
"She's a wonderful girl, Lisa."
You did great.
"You want CNN here so badly, why don't you call 'em yourself?"
"Because they'd just think he was crazy, and he wants everyone to know that he isn't crazy at all."
( cell phone rings )
Yeah?
Okay.
The media'll be here in 15 minutes.
"We're almost home, fruit loops."
( gunshot )
( everyone screams )
Get down.
Who took that shot?
( cell phone rings )
What the hell do you think you're doing?
!
What'd you think would happen if you tried something like that?
It was a miscommunication.
I'm sorry.
Let me go...!
Hurry up!
He looks like a drug-addict.
He probably did this to get some money!
"Yes, but he really does look like you."
"If you were not here, I would have been fooled."
"Yes, this is the Commissioner!"
He's not the real Mr. Hiroshima!
- You mean him?
- We were just tipped-off.
is that so?
- lt's came from a reliable source.
- ls that so?
"Sir, do we need to take action?"
Wait till I come back.
Your Excellency!
"I'll be right back, don't go away!"
You must stay for my wedding party.
"Notify all the guards, without my orders,"
No one is permitted to leave the house.
Yes Sir!
"Excepting myself, of course."
"Yoyo, you're done!"
Did you say something?
"Ridiculous, you're dumb."
Dangerous situations can do miracles.
Who are you?
I am woman!
"You must be crazy, you're a man, how come...?"
Listen:
I am woman!
I am woman too.
Lilly do you want to come with us?
Oh yeah that'd be great.
"Pizza and a movie, that totally makes up for making me."
Throw away the college of my dreams.
Just 'cause of your miserable stinking secret!
But you said you were okay with it.
I am.
"I just said I wanted to go, didn't I?"
"-Yeah, right."
-Yeah come on you must be starving.
And I can't wait.
To just go out there and get ripped apart by an angry mob of Hannah fans!
Yeah but who cares about us.
As long as Little Miss Center-of-the-Universe is happy!
-It's always about you!
-Always!
-You!
-You!
-You!
-You!
[Echoing]
So who wants to drive?
Will you stop it?
Come on Lilly just come out and say what you're really thinking.
Well I was thinking:
who wants to drive?
And now I'm thinking maybe I should.
I'm not talking about who's driving.
I'm talking about the secret!
You both hate it and you hate what it's doing to your lives!
Just admit it!
Everything would be so much easier for you if I just told the world who I was!
I could not contact her either.
"Seeing everything that is happening now,"
I'm worried about her safety!
"She should be safe, Manoj."
Is Ashwini's number?
7599... 44... 7333?
Yes!
How do you know it?
We will explain.
If we need to find Ashwini...
We need some details about her.
Since when do you know Ashwini?
Recently...
Not too long ago...
She came to see my sculptures.
We became friends.
You said Ashwini was an NRI?
Yes.
From Singapore.
She has some ancestral property near Nagercoil.
She had come to sell it.
Was she staying with you?
At first she was staying outside.
As we got closer...
She came here and stayed with me.
I was happy every single moment that I spent with her.
She loved me as well.
But everything turned up-side-down in one night.
Maybe Ashwini has gone back to Singapore.
Do you have that contact number?
"Her E-mail ID, Facebook ID, or something like that?"
No.
There's no one else here.
You must be talking to me.
"Well, that was an antique."
Crap!
"Oh, yeah."
So good.
"Oh, that explains his mysterious trip to Holland."
And I had the greatest time.
"Mr. Burns's house has everything-- a hedge maze, a moat, bleached hardwood floors and a bottomless pit."
"a hedge maze, a moat, bleached hardwood floors and a bottomless pit."
- It couldn't possibly be bottomless.
- For all intents and purposes.
Hey!
"Mom, Bart's throwing peas!"
"Bart, don't throw peas at your sister."
Mr. Burns throws peas at Smithers.
Ow!
That was a big one!
"- Homer, say something."
- Okay.
"Lisa, quit getting in the way of your wealthy brother's peas."
- [ Groans ]
"- Oh, yuck."
Meat loaf.
My most hated of all loafs.
[ Gasps ] That was the end piece!
That's it!
Being abusive to your family is one thing... but I will not stand idly by and watch you feed a hungry dog!
- Go to your room!
- No!
This family stinks!
Mr. Burns nurtures my destructive side.
"She did the same, too."
She said she loved me but betrayed me since I got sick.
Rotten bitches.
Dirty bitches.
All sluts like you should be wiped out for this country and society.
I'm doing a good deed for making a just society.
I'm a servant of pure justice.
I'm Wonder Woman.
15 minutes left!
Hurry up!
Why are you so slow?
Then carry her instead!
We have no time!
What'll you do if something happens to her?
Hey!
Wake up!
Please wake up!
Are you alright?
Where's Mr. Hong?
You shouldn't be here.
Hurry and run!
I was misunderstood because of you.
"Wait, why are you giving it to her?"
If she eats his liver...
We've waited for a thousand years!
How could you do that?
"Dad, one of us has to sacrifice because of him!"
Right.
I've lived long enough.
Take care of the youngest.
We have no time.
Hurry and start.
"Do you want to know what I'm feeling, George?"
Mm-hm.
Hungry.
Adam?
"Do you want to go in and spend some time with your dad, and say goodbye to him?"
I don't have a good feeling about this.
Someone's just died.
You're not supposed to.
Adam hasn't just lost his dad.
He's lost his food supply.
He's going to have to feed again soon.
"Oh, my God."
- Where is he?
- Out.
"Oh, no."
Peaches)
You were a teenage boy once.
You know what they do.
"- Yeah, wank at any opportunity."
"- Well, that's helpful."
"Well, no, there's other stuff, but none of it really registers."
"# Well, there goes a girl and a half"
#She's got me going up and down
#She's got me going up and down... #
Dollar!

Walking on the beaches Looking at the peaches
"# Well, I got the notion, girl"
# That you got some suntan lotion in that bottle of yours
"#Spread it all over my peeling skin, baby"
# That feels real good
#All this skirt lapping up the sun
-What are you looking for?
-Where is that box you used to keep all my stuff in?
- The memory box?
- Sounds about right.
I don't remember.
I'm kidding.
Excuse me.
"Oh, God."
Look.
First place.
The trophy was bigger than you were.
"Can we speed this up, Ma?"
I need my medical records and my birth certificate.
All right.
Here.
"How about your report card, huh?"
You could have been valedictorian... if you hadn't been suspended so many times for getting into fights.
- I never could figure-
"- Mom, I don't need my report card."
- Your father used to get so angry.
- I don't want to talk about Dad.
- I just need my stuff.
- Fine.
Here.
All right?
-I don't want you to think you're keeping those.
"-No, I'm just gonna make copies."
I'm gonna take a trip.
Work.
"The last time you said that, you left for 10 years, Michael."
It's not that kind.
"Did you ever think about leaving, Mom?"
They earn their living over three months.
"In winter, they sit around drinking tea."
There's not a lot to do in winter.
"Apparently, they're not that idle!"
"No, they do nothing."
They sit around the stove for warmth.
They spend evenings together.
Certain produce is sown in winter...
And harvested in summer.
I don't know.
Your harvest will soon be ripe.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
How many children do you have?
Nine.
"Well done, nine children!"
Yes.
How many girls and how many boys?
Five girls and four boys.
"See, you're not idle!"
May God preserve them.
Thank you.
You don't want to get up?
We have to get up?
You don't want to?
is there any news?
"News, but not what you think."
But there is something.
She didn't eat the soup sent by Mrs Hatcher and Mrs Terayn.
Meaning what?
Meaning...
Hold the line.
He's just sabotaging himself.
He's sabotaging this account that would mean so much to us and... I can't even say anything--
"Oh God, Patty."
What would I do?
"I mean, how would I survive?"
"Camille, Camille, it's okay, honey, you're going to be okay."
"No, you don't understand, I need him. I'm not like you."
"Wait, wait, what am I like?"
"I didn't mean that, I just mean I need him, I really need Andy to live."
This is incredible.
Right. I'm sorry that...
H i.
We can go downstairs.
"No, lt's fine. I was just..."
- l should probably go.
- No.
"No, don't go."
"- So, your room is..."
- A mess.
Different from the last time I saw it.
"Okay, well, I'm going."
I'm on hold.
"Rosenfeld, I got to call him back."
Good morning.
How long have you been up?
A while.
You can have the first shower if you want.
"That's okay, you go ahead."
There's nothing edible in here.
"Don't be ridiculous, sweetie."
That things crammed full of stuff.
Let me look.
- Is it?
"OK, OK, that's..."
that's just the wind.
Donkey!
And apparently it knows my name.
"That's very funny, Shrek."
But I know it's you doing this.
"Hey, I'm standing right here with you, Donkey."
No way.
"This place is not haunted by a ghost, and when the sun comes up, Donkey will be the new King of..."
"It's right behind me, isn't it?"
- Donkey.
"- Oh, my goodness!"
"Well, that's what I'd call a ""knight"" to remember."
What do you say we scare ourselves up some dinner?
I'd say... grab the kids and let's get going.
And that's why we're the Kings of Halloween.
He was so scared.
We probably won't see him for a month.
"So, what else have you got in your bag of tricks?"
I've got seven eggs.
Perfect.
I love this holiday.
"Oh, very nice!"
I am not happy!
Get your jacket off and get out!
"This season, on Hell's Kitchen:"
How dare you?
"If you don't get out, I'll drag you out."
Really?
It's the one you've been waiting for.
Thank goodness. I'm famished.
I forgot to have lunch today.
Make sure you get double cheese.
And get some of those little tomatoes daddy likes.
- Daddy can't be disturbed!
- What?
He's lying down upstairs.
"Here, get a large."
"Graham, what happened?"
is it Andy?
Nothing happened.
Do you feel all right?
Are you coming down... I just want to lie here.
How was your meeting with Rosenfeld?
It went okay.
Did you feel like you made all your points?
"Look. I want to tell you, and I will tell you how the meeting went... but I really just can't talk about it, now!"
Okay?
You know it's okay.
We'll live.
"You know I mean... we don't have to have this account, I mean the important thing is... I'm really sorry."
I have to get out of here.
- What?
- l can't breathe.
Graham!
"If you didn't land this account, that's okay."
Please!
"J ust let it be, okay?"
- l can't...
- You can't what?
What is wrong?
- Where are you going?
Did you... notice any black smoke?
"What are you, crazy?"
So?
I think she's telling the truth.
"I mean, the way she talked about being there mentally but not physically --"
Kind of sounds like demonic possession to me.
Kind of?
She didn't see any black smoke or smell sulphur.
Maybe it's not a demon.
"I mean, kids can be vicious."
"Well, I mean, we're already here."
Might as well check out the school.
Right.
The school.
What?
"Truman High, home of the bombers."
What's your point?
I don't know.
"I mean, we went there, like... for a month a million years ago."
- Why are you so jazzed to go back?
- I'm not.
I just think it's worth looking into.
"All right, well, what's our cover?"
FBI?
Homeland Security?
Swedish exchange students?
Don't worry.
I got an idea.
Okay.

"Thanks, dad."

(MARSH):
Judy.
"Oh, for Pete's sake."
(MARSH):
What on Earth has gotten into you anyway?
"Dad and Mike, don't jump at Judy so."
I'm not jumping at Judy.
She's just been acting up.
First stealing my hat.
Now twisting Clarence's tail.
And not only that.
She has been poaching bananas from the fruit bowl.
Oh?
"You know, young lady,"
I think a few days in a cage might do you some good.

"Oh, come on, you guys, stop picking on her."
"Oh, I'm not picking on her."
"Ah, she's just picking on the whole world."

"Hello, Hedley, what's up?"
More a question of what's down.
"Have you been listening to the radio reports of Sally, the American astro-chimp?"
"Oh, yes."
"Yes, we listened to the blast-off last week"
- from Cape Kennedy.
- It certainly was exciting.
"Judy, you remember my telling you about the chimp taking the ride around the moon."
(CHATTERING)
"Last we heard, she had returned and was due to splash down in the South Atlantic"
- about an hour ago.
- I didn't chop them up.
- I donated them to science.
- Donating my ass!
How much did you get?
Two grand a body.
- But the benefit of medical research...
- Who'd you hawk them to?
Who'd you hawk them to?
A guy named Russ Bianco.
"I call a number, and he meets me."
You Bianco?
"Yeah, where's Mogan?"
"Ah, he couldn't make it."
He knew I needed the cash.
Name's Elliot.
I work in the morgue with him.
You got a city ID?
Fresh off the slab.
"- Uh, he's not an addict."
- No.
That guy's in better shape than the stiffs Mark usually sends me.
Brain hemorrhage.
Tox screen clean.
So...
Nice gig Mark's got going here.
How's your supply?
Always looking for more.
Why?
One of my cousins works in the Manhattan morgue.
Make sure he's discreet.
"You see something you think I'll like, give me a call./ All right."
You wanna give me a hand with this guy?
That's... pretty damn well.
"So, when you say you want a partner..."
"Yeah, that's not exactly true."
I don't want a partner.
Ah.
I want you as my partner.
I've heard good things.
I want to find out if they're true.
"If they're good, they're definitely true."
What scares you most?
Don't think.
Just answer.
Bees.
You know what scares me?
Mediocrity.
"Safe choices, hedged bets, a willingness to settle for the easy and familiar."
"I would really like to take back ""bees."""
Geez.
Married?
I didn't even know you were dating.
'Cause it's none of your business.
You don't tell me when you're screwing your stalker.
"Hey, careful."
They're starting to get too small.
"Oh, right."
Mr. big balls.
"I'm just saying, they're gonna dry out when you fry them."
I'm baking them.
"Oh, you're killing me."
"So, uh, how'd you get the kids not to tell me?"
Really?
The never mentioned Ollie?
-Just don't bustin' my balls.
"Hey, Tommy..."
"If I was gonna break your balls, I'd tell ya to ""go home and get your shine box."""
This kid was great.
"I used to call him ""Spitshine Tommy."""
I swear to God.
"Oh, he'd make your shoes look like fuckin' mirrors."
Excuse my language.
He was terrific.
He was the best.
He made a lot of money too.
"Salut, Tommy!"
"No more shines, Billy."
What?
"I said ""No more shines."" Maybe you didn't hear about it..."
You been away a long time.
They didn't go up there and tell you.
I don't shine shoes anymore.
Relax.
What's got into you?
"I'm breaking your balls a little bit, that's all."
I'm only kidding with you.
Sometimes you don't sound like you're kiddin'.
"You know, there's a lot of people around."
"Tommy, I'm only kidding with you."
We're having a party.
I haven't seen you in a long time and you get fucking fresh.
"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend you."
"I'm sorry, too."
"It's ok, no problem."
"-Alright, salut."
Now go home and get your fucking shine box.
It's just a riot!
"And what's that, Nina?"
Do you smoke?
!
- Drop it now!
"- Come on, mama!"
- Give it to me!
"- Stop it, mama!"
I know what I'm doing!
"Here, you may have it!"
Did I give birth to you for you to smoke that filth?
"Will you shut up, please?"
"- Nina, hurry, the telephone!"
- What do you care?
- Maybe it's for me?
- Who can call you?
Perhaps there's someone.
"Stop it, you've just arrived."
Hello?
- Do you have a rag?
"- I'll do it later, mom."
I'm listening.
Are you going to play the silent game?
"Well, as you wish."
He wouldn't answer?
"No, he wouldn't answer."
"Nina, I see Stasik is still into his snags, making sculptures."
Good for him.
"- Remember Kolia, the Pioneer leader?"
"- Yes, I do."
"I just finished packing, was about to go to the station, and here he comes carrying all kinds of roots and knolls and some weird stumps."
"Here, Aunt Marusya, take them to your son-in-law."
I'm Seaman Robert Epplund.
We were on the Hagen together.
You knew Petty Officer Adams?
"We were friends, yeah."
I just found out what happened.
I can't believe it.
He was doing fine when I saw him last night.
What time was that?
"Uh, like, 11:00 or so."
"His crew was the first section off for liberty, we were the second."
He was in a great mood.
He was going to see his girlfriend.
"Like, totally in love with her."
He kept saying she was the one.
"""The One's"" name wouldn't happen to be Meredith Bilson, would it?"
"Yeah, that's her."
Does she know?
We'll stay in touch.
Thank you.
Thanks.
The director has always been very protective of his family.
That should come as no surprise.
"No, it's not just that."
It's something else.
Can't put my finger on it.
"And you're worrying that whatever ""it"" is may prevent the director from seeking the truth?"
"It's not him, Duck."
It's me.
Family or not.
I gotta do my job.
"Do you have news, Dr. Mallard?"
I was just about to brief Agent Gibbs.
Such good intentions...
Hey!
Don't you care what happens to your friend?
!
Don't underestimate me!
It's resonating with him.
You had it.
Professor Mayzel.
and seal off this block!
Bastard!
I think there is a meaning in the fact that the ark is in this area.
that no other mountain around was suitable for?
If the legend of the first flood was caused by the ark then the true power of the ark may be the ability to control the magnetic field.
This is it.
it is unknown territory.
We don't know what will happen.
Fine by me.
let's go.
Die!
Die!
no!
Damn!
Jean!
Jean?
Ominae what did you do with that brat?
I heard he's headed for the ark.
Dr. Mayzel and his assistant are hostages.
That should be taken care of first.
Jean.
quickly..!
Ominae!
Save those two by all means.
- Sorta.
"It's hard work, ain't it?"
"Hey, I'm just happy to help out."
That's what I hear.
"So, uh, can you do me?"
Pardon?
"What you did for lester, i want it done."
I didn't do anything to lester.
"Look, he's right over there."
I sit alone in a room all day praying for death to come.
You got to do this for me.
Please.
Listen to me.
I killed 5 men in my life.
4 of them had slanty eyes and were shooting at me and my buddies.
The other one was a drunk driver who ran over my 10-year-old nephew.
They all had it coming.
"But I'll be goddamned if I'm gonna kill a war hero, a brother in arms."
I just won't do it.
Then you're a fag.
"Say that again, war hero or not, I'll kill you."
You are a fag.
"Ok, all right."
We're on.
5 goddamn miles.
"You know, i nearly had a heart attack."
My legs feel like jell-O.
"Oh, that's all right, dude."
You'll get used to it.
"Yeah, when?"
"Uh, depends on you."
You're pretty good with that thing.
I checked with Dorothy's boss.
"She was let go last night, but on the application... she listed a motel by the airport."
"Thanks, Trudy."
"Where's the papers, lady?"
What papers?
"Come on, where's the papers?"
What papers?
"We can do this nice or we can do this not so nice, now."
"Where's the papers, lady?"
"Come on, where's the papers?"
Freeze.
Dorothy?
I'm Det.
"Crockett, Miami Vice."
"Everything's okay, open up."
"Wait a minute, Dorothy."
Hold it.
I'm a cop.
Dorothy!
Crockett!
Frank Doss was convicted of murder in 1943.
Served 15 years.
"In 1960, became partner to Johnny Cannata."
"Las Vegas, Atlantic City."
Now they're spearheading the drive for legalized gambling in Miami.
"They've been arrested several times, but never convicted."
Morty Price has been with Cannata and Doss since they began working in Las Vegas.
Dorothy Bain is the question mark.
"Except, we think we know why she might have killed Morty Price."
Annie said Dorothy told her stories about... being beaten by her husband back in New York.
That's what drove her and the baby to Miami.
"I called him there, he was no help."
Exactly!
Everything about her is an action replay of my wife!
My heart says that too!
Get me my Laxmi!
Please!
"If Aunt gets to know of this, she'd be really offended."
Not at all!
D'you know what she threw at me today?
This!
The box?
That would break my head!
She threw a rose at me!
Did that fall on you?
"On my heart, actually."
Now look; suppose you're walking down the street...
But I'm standing here.
Just suppose so!
And a crow flying overhead drops excrement on your head.
Just suppose so!
"Will you fall for the crow, too?"
What a rotten joke!
"A crow and Laxmi, eh?"
I'll throw you out!
Just listen...
She's terribly angry with Durgaprasad which is why she threw the rose at you.
Durgaprasad?
Now who the hell is that?
I'm trapped...
"Her brother-in-law, eh?"
Not her brother-in-law.
He's her husband.
She said she was alone!
- It's all that matters.
- It's never all.
It can exist in a happy ship.
"The ideal is always possible, sir."
If the men cooperate.
I'm sure they will.
I'll give you a toast!
To Defiant.
An efficient and happy ship.
An efficient ship.
And death to the French.
Depends on your gun drill.
"Mr. D'Arblay, get them into position!"
Jumping about like jackrabbits!
Fire!
Get back!
"- Oh, sir, I never meant to..."
- Sergeant!
Put this man under arrest.
For making to strike an officer.
You'll be flogged for this.
Six dozen lashes.
"Wheatley, you're under arrest."
- You made to strike an officer?
"- No, sir."
I wouldn't have.
- I've learned that much.
- But you did put up your fists?
"Well, answer me!"
"An impulse, instantly regretted."
- What was that?
"- An impulse, sir."
How long have you known my mother?
About a year.
How did you meet her?
We just kind of met.
Are you going to see her again?
I hope so.
Would you like that?
I guess so.
"Hey, you wanna know a secret?"
What?
My father left us when I was your age.
You wanna know something else?
Made me realise what a wonderful mother I had.
You will realise that too some day.
What's that?
Monster ride.
Route six hundred and sixty six.
What's that mean?
"Well, a route is a road you take when you're on a long journey."
Can we go in?
"Well, Nicolas, maybe we should wait for your mother."
What for?
You're going straight to hell on route 666.
Ride here if you dare!
You're going straight to hell on route 666.
Look like someone had a bad crack up.
"Fill her up, cowboy."
"We wouldn't be eating in there anytime soon, Nicolas?"
"Eww, look at that."
You should close your eyes.
Jesus!
"- Boy, this is one heck of a ride."
... ifyoufollowthatkind ofthing .
Recently divorced.
"But not too recently. I've already had my rebound, transitional relationships."
-So no worries there.
-Good to know.
"Actually, it wasn't so much a relationship..."
"... asa caseof mistakenidentity, but I think it still counts."
-Okay.
-And...
"... asyouknow,Ilive with Charlie..."
... whomyou'vealready....
-Met?
"-Yeah, let's go with met."
"Alan, is my having dated Charlie gonna be a problem for you?"
"No, no, no."
A little.
"Okay, look."
Charlie and l--
"We had a very brief, superficial relationship."
Okay?
"And to be honest, it was mostly about sex."
Great.
"My point is, yeah, I'm tired of those, those shallow relationships..."
... Iwashavingwithguys like Charlie.
"I wanna be with a man who can be sensitive and caring, nurturing."
"You know, somebody who can make me laugh, make me think."
"You do realize I'm straight, right?"
"-See, you really are adorable."
-Thank you.
I tend to bring out the mothering instinct in women.
"-Oh, really?"
"-ironically, not my mother."
This is good.
This is really good.
My mother made food like this.
"Oh, thank you, Fern."
How's Walter?
He had his gallbladder taken out yesterday.
Good for him.
I'll give you boys 100% cooperation.
Me and my two deputies...
We'll take turns watching the place around the clock.
"So you boys can just take it easy, relax, drink beer, chase chicks, whatever you want."
We'll help.
Hmm?
We'll help you.
Suit yourself.
"Oh, another thing."
Old man Malcolm?
I guarantee he don't know jack shit about this stuff with his nephew.
You talk to him?
Not yet.
I just know it.
There aren't any telephone lines out to that old place.
He's like a hermit.
Hardly steps foot off his property.
We ought to talk to him.
That may be the case...
DALE:
"Charlie, get on in here."
Charlie's my deputy.
Retired police officer.
"Morning, guys."
This is Dud Cole.
Then I guess there's just one problem left.
"And what's that, Your Majesty?"
How much I'm going to miss her.
Aha!
Yes!
Thankyou.
Thankyou.
"I love you, Daddy."

Now we can stay all day in the sun

Thank you for everything.

It's still here.
It's Rin.
Rin Sakurazawa.
Hurry!
Hurry up!
What are you doing?
You guys have aptitude.
Bridget!
"3 years ago, my heart was broken by you."
"After 3 years, my body and soul are in your hands again."
You can do whatever you like.
May your body rot and your soul burn in hellfire!
"Doesn't matter, I'll die anyway."
But this is the best way to go.
I'll die for my country and all mankind.
What a hero!
Pity no one knows about this.
"You know, I know, God knows and the Devil knows."
The man downstairs knows too!
"Unlike you, everybody knows you're a real whore!"
You think you're the greatest hero on Earth?
I am woman too!
"I know you are woman, a bad woman too!"
I said I am woman!
"You're not just bad, but wicked too!"
Listen:
I am woman.
You...!
What did you say?
"I am woman, answer me!"
I am woman too!
"18 years old girl, like a rose."
"Boy at 18, nothing to boast;"
"Woman at 40, beauty most,"
"Man at 40, what a ghost."
"Woman at 80, sparkles and glows,"
"Man at 80, coffin soon to close."
What's your rank?
"Supermac 99, and yours?"
"If Vlad wants his crazy Mexican, he should go after him."
It's pissing me off.
The last girl is off with a client.
"Down, down, down!"
He's gonna get a blow-job here.
"Fuck, he must be desperate to get a woman here."
What do you care?
You don't come here on holiday.
You're right.
I forgot that you were an expert.
You're out of line.
"Fuck, you're becoming a pain, Gilou."
- We can't say anything any more.
- Don't worry.
You'll soon be rid of me.
And Laure?
Tell me it doesn't hurt to leave her.
"Me, I would understand, but Laure?"
"Go ahead, say it."
Say it!
They're moving.
Gilou to Laure.
"The guy is going away with the girl, what do we do?"
We follow?
"No, we wait."
They're done.
Let's go.
Why don't they come back?
Are you sure the pimps didn't pick them up?
They must have picked them up somewhere else.
"We'll come back tonight, we've got to stay on their back."
"Everybody, get some sleep."
"What did you say, hysterical?"
Who?
Hello?
Hello!
It was me.
"I know, when my... husband behaves well, then I become a beast."
"I lose control, become inexplicable."
"I was sure that it was Gianni again, but I did not have... any inclination to speak nor to listen."
"Love, I tell you something:"
my cock is hard.
"Can you hear, beloved?"
I thought about it and I got a hard-on.
-That's the way it is!
-Who is talking?
-You are not Teresa.
"-Of course not, I am Rosella."
"So what, I have a hard-on."
So what can I do about that?
-Lend us a hand.
-Who allows you of using me?
"Sorry, I continued to believe you were Teresa."
"But I told you, I am Rosella."
"This is just as well, give me a hand, it is good."
What hand?
I do not understand.
"A hand, just a hand."
Indeed!
But you must pretend that my hand is yours.
-You are crazy!
"-Please, don't hang up."
I could not forget that voice.
It's sensuality prevented me.
"For all intents and purposes, it already happened."
(INHALES) I mean...
I'm in the room.
I don't look mad or pissed.
(CLEARS THROAT)
The painting's coming out great.
Yeah.
The painting's coming out great.
You probably asked us to do it for inspiration or something.
We're all friends.
And we just need to trust that it's going to be okay.
Fuck!
What the fuck was that for?
(SIGHS) That's for kissing my girlfriend tomorrow.
"T-minus one hour, in case you were wondering."
"Please, stop counting down like it's a fucking shuttle launch."
- Sorry.
- JASPER:
"Yeah, yeah."
I told you Crab Apple was a sure thing.
He just needed a few more races.
"Let's roll half the winnings into tomorrow's bets, and I'll come pick up the rest."
Uh-huh.
"Okay, yeah."
"Um, let me just get something to write on."
I thought there wasn't a bottle in the photo.
That's because it was down here.
"What time is it, babe?"
"Finn, you okay?"
"Yeah, uh, no."
It's this part of the painting-it's unfinished.
I'm clearly about to paint it.

Heart on?
You think that'll work in German?
We'll drop hundreds of these on the guys in the trenches.
"You picture your woman back home schtupping some guy, all for the love of the Fatherland?"
It's a nice kick in the morale.
Good.
Give me your sketches.
Seems to be having fun.

That was probably the stupidest thing I've ever done.
"No, I-I think my passing was the stupidest, actually."

Better get on that bus.
-No!
-You'd better take your boy and go.
"I've never, never been so humiliated and disgusted!"
Allison!
Come back here immediately!
"If you keep this up, someday I'll do what you keep accusing me of."
I don't doubt it.
You're just like your father about sex!
"In that way, you're just like him!"
Don't you say things about my father.
He was a wonderful man!
-Wonderful.
-Fine and good to you.
That's what you told me.
So don't blame him for anything!
"Wonderful, and fine, and good."
That's what I told you?
I lied.
I lied about him because I was ashamed of him and of myself.
-Then why did you marry him?
-I didn't!
And he didn't marry me because he already had a wife!
"-You don't mean that, mother."
-I do mean it.
-Don't you understand?
-No...
He had a wife!
No!
Nellie!
Allison!
"Connie, everybody reacts differently to suicide."
"With Allison, severe shock."
"No, I'll call Mrs. Page myself."
"Operator, would you please connect me with Evelyn Page?"
I don't believe Norman did what you said he did!
2 people saw them.
Marion Partridge has probably spread all over town!
Don't you dare say a word against Norman!
"If you brought your son up with some intelligence, decent principles..."
He has no interest in girls!
He never had.
He never learned about sex at home.
The word was never mentioned.
"-Hello, Mrs. Page."
-Come in here.
-Where is Norman?
"-Outside, just going home."
-Mother.
-You just stay right here.
-What's the matter?
-Norman!
-Come in here!
"-What is it, mom?"
-Where were you today?
"-What is it, mother?"
You were seen at Crystal Pond swimming in the nude with Norman.
"-Oh, that's a lie!"
-How could you think such a thing?
You were seen clearly and plainly by two people!
"We went swimming, Mrs. MacKenzie, but we had our suits on."
And by now everybody in Peyton Place knows about it!
So help me if anything is wrong with her because of this!
I didn't do anything.
"We didn't do anything, did we, Allison?"
"If you don't understand, I'm not going to explain."
- More?
- Why not?
Your father said to give you a big sendoff.
"Rodney, will I ever see you again?"
Can I compete with those Boston girls?
What are your qualifications?
- Can't you guess?
- Seeing is believing.
I think you're 10 percent man and 90 percent talk.
You're 100 percent woman.
Two hundred and fifty percent woman.
Maybe 500.
Going to take more than money to keep me.
Know what you're doing to my temperature?
- Let's cool it off and go for a swim.
- But we didn't bring any bathing suits.
"- You all ready, Norman?"
- Yeah.
Forgot my cap.
What did you say?
"Norman, you're making me blush all over."
I'm sorry.
Let's go in swimming.
What did you whistle for?
"I saw a fellow and a girl swimming, without a stitch on."
- Where?
- They're gone now.
They got out of the water and ran into the woods.
- Naked?
- Naked.
It was Allison MacKenzie and Norman Page.
It's just hard not to feel that everybody is when you' re lying in the street with a cop's foot to the back of your neck.
I've never seen it like this.
"It's okay, there will be a later bus."
Yeah.
"That's not your music, that's Abby's."
She always liked that noise.
I'm getting used to it.
There's an accident up ahead.
"Sit tight, we'll keep you posted."
- Thank
- Thank you.
- Thanks.
- Well...
"- Thank you for this, John."
- I know it's a huge inconvenience.
- It's no problem.
I'm sorry for getting so upset.
I hate being so pathetic.
Just the idea of going home alone and waiting...
- Eric will turn up.
- Yeah.
"Yeah, but I worry about both of them."
Abby's good.
"You know, we' re both good."
You don't have to worry about that.
She told me.
She told me you might get married.
- Is that what she said?
"- No, she told me you proposed."
"I know she's work, it runs in the family, but she's so worth it."
Yeah.
Yeah.
Is your phone broken?
Or your thumbs?
"Ok look, we're on the list."
Here you see that?
Let them in.
You tot's owe me Seven.
Nice natural looking good.
Ah uh Brett Michaels is waiting down over there and you darling
Sunset Strip is that way.
Dude.
This chick has the biggest tits you've ever seen.
"Hey, Jamie did her and said she was wild in bed."
"Jamie, bro you don't want his sloppy second are you kidding me?"
They call him herp for a reason.
"Hey, check out the old dude and the cougar."
Sweetheart I'm sorry there's been some kind of misunderstanding there you go.
Tom how many times do I have to tell you
I only date girls 25 and younger.
I'm sorry...
Oh my God is that David Spade over there?
He's hot.
God this town is so disgusting.
"Oh my God, check this guy out."
That's the producer I met the other night.
He is so hot and well connected... oh.
Out or my way...
Uh oh...
Don't look over there.
Oh you've got to be kidding me.
I'm going to go to the bathroom.
I'm just...
Skank!
Got a head start out of the territory.
I guess he knew you were coming.

"I'm gonna find him, wherever he is."
I think you'll find this room delightful.
"It has a lovely view down Main Street, just as you requested."

"-Yes, we are, ma'am."
-How long will you be gone?
-However long it takes.
"Way we figure, Eli Joe is just a day ahead of us."
Where to first?
-What's this all about?
-Thought you could use some help.
I'm much obliged.
But my business with this man is mine and mine alone.
"Got no argument there. lt's just, it's awful big country out there, is all."
"I mean, what the hell do they want with us?"
They wanna kill us.
Make sure you don't cancel the broadcasts.
Grab that.
Let's go.
Here.
"That's all the information from the laptop, in case..."
"I don't know, in case we don't get out of here."
Drink that.
"""Of course we'll get out of here, Katherine."
"Don't you worry about a thing."""
You ever get used to it?
Used to what?
Bodies.
Dead people.
Seeing them.
No.
They never seem to stay dead.
How's it going over there?
"There's stuff on here, but it's password protected."
"I know, but can you open it?"
I don't know.
I'm trying.
How do we know all this mayhem hasn't already happened?
We don't.
Good.
Just keep working.
Fuck.
Can you just talk to me?
"Yeah, what do you wanna talk about?"
Anything.
Just regular stuff.
"You married up, Son."
Everyone knows you married up.
"My son has committed a terrible sin... against you, Clara, and you, Amy."
Against those innocent little boys.
Against his own mother and father.
"And against the Lord, our God."
If God can forgive us... then we should forgive the mistakes of our loved ones.
"And it was a mistake, David."
"A thoughtless, self-centered mistake... of a weak man."
"You can do better, Son."
We all know you can do better.
I forgive you.
"She forgives you, Son."
Clara forgives you.
And I forgive you.
"- Thank you again for supper, Clara."
- It was lovely.
I think those Colombian meatballs are my favorite.
"First thing tomorrow, you have to fire that home wrecker."
"- You haven""t fired her yet?"
"- This isn""t Lisa""s fault."
- She has three children and no way...

You forgot to turn on my nightlight.
Look at this boy.
March right down there.
Yes!
- Buddy.
"- Come here, honey."
Thank you for coming.
What could it be?
We're waiting.
Gamze came here too.
The three of us are waiting.
What's Gamze doing there?
May God watch over you guys.
Did we buy those devices so the three of could stand together?
I congratulate you guys.
Is this all you can do?
"Ok, dude."
Calm down a little.
"Now, put your phones on silent and wait until you hear from me."
We won't give up.
We still have time.
We will keep waiting.
Uluc says we'll wait.
Come on.
Hello?
They arrived at a shopping mall.
I am following them...
Is everything alright with you guys?
"Things are a little bit complicated here, but you keep following her."
"My dear Candan, it is such an untimely devotion to music."
Here's your mobile number.
"Now, I need an address for a recording company."
"Pick it up, pick it up."
Hello?
- Am I speaking with Professor Candan?
"- Yes, speaking."
"Professor, I am calling from Bemol Records"
:
-This is Cevat Ceyhan.
"He's on 6 grams a day, and he has a crazy idea of becoming a tattooist."
"He started tattooing some bananas, and then he got a roast pork   and now he's dragged half a goddamn pig into our living-room."
It's so gross!
"Go away, for fuck's sake!"
Get off!
What the hell's the matter with you?
Strange dogs.
The police was there!
You told me there'd be no police.
No police at all.
"- How should I know, honey?"
"- You don't know shit, man."
Asger?
Do you love me?
What are you talking about?
- Do you love me?
- Why the fuck do you ask me that?
It can't be that difficult.
"Do you love me, or..."
Shut up!
Right...
"No, she made it."
"No, she brought the CDs home."
And the washing machine.
They got Lars' stuff.
That's good for our business.
- We'll need some more soon.
- I don't feel well...
- Probably just your nerves.
"- No, I'm really..."
I really feel bad.
There...
Then do.
I'd like that.
Maybe we can catch a movie some time.
"Audrey, it's Pacey. lf you're there, could you please pick up the phone?"
Audrey?
Please?
"Audrey, come on."
-Hey.
-Hey.
How long have you--?
How long have you been here?
A while.
How was the movie?
Fun. inspiring.
-Completely unexpected.
-Lucky you.
How's studying?
Not good.
I only have a couple of hours left.
Here.
Maybe this will help.
Do you mind if I just sit here a little while?
"You know, if you need anything, I can--"
Sure.
Thank you.
Very sweet.
Much needed.
"I gotta tell you, Dawson it's like the entire world has been coming at me tonight."
"Like, completely distracting me from what I've spent my entire life preparing for. I mean it's like this night has been a metaphor for the whole semester."
One big left turn.
"Not that it's been bad because it hasn't, but it's just if I don't get myself back on track, I could--"
Dawson?
Because of Mum?
Right.
Do you want me to get rid of them?
'Cause I will if it's bugging you?
"How about you just keep the music down a bit, OK?"
"Thanks George, you're the best."
Good work Dad.
(PARTY MUSIC IN OTHER ROOM)
Hey Shay.
"Gotta love your brother, right?"
He doesn't give up.
"You do know what a lost cause is, right?"
Mm-hm.
"Except it's not, is it?"
"You know it, I know it, so why avoid the inevitable?"
Because maybe I want more for myself?
"Not to be one of the Lindsays of this world, hanging off some random guy's every word to fill the void of my existence."
"Yeah, but I'm not some random guy, am I?"
But you might as well be.
Dad?
"It's time, Dad."
Time for what?
We want our house back.
Fair enough.
Alright everyone!
Just...
"Sorry to break up the party everyone but it's time to move it elsewhere, please."
Sorry.
"Thanks for having us, Mr T."
It's been spiritual.
"Yeah, thanks Ollie."
No worries mate.
Sis!
Look!
You're right!
It's really beautiful!
"It's been a while since you have looked like this, Sis!"
Really?
Yeah!
You looked like this for a long time!
Was it really like that?
It looks lke you became her wind.
Eh?
"To that kid, your point of view is like a wind to the fog around her."
Sorry for keeping you waiting.
Don't worry about it.
"More importantly, did you bring what you wrote?"
"Yeah, I did."
I am still good friends with Saho-san.
Saho-san's smoke will never vanish.
It only disappears for a little while.
"It's weird, but I really feel like I understand your stories, Hibara-san."
Thank you.
"When we talk, Saho-san's smoke sometimes vanishes."
I am happy even if I can only become Saho-san's wind every so often.
"I really don't like when the seasons change, because they start to come out."
HA HA HA!
I'm not worried about it!
What's with that weird confidence you have?
!
"Could it be that it happened again, Mizuki?"
!
Yeah!
But this time...
- What?
"Is it timeless, or is it likely to go out ofstyle in the next 20 years?"
I would say it's a new classic.
But 20 years is a long time.
I think everything's gonna be computerized in 20 years.
- Soup won't be computerized.
- Why not?
It's a liquid.
"Dude, did you just give her the family discount?"
Yeah.
She's my neighbor.
I'm trying to work on my karma.
- Doyou know what karma means?
- Yeah.
It means that she owes me one.
I love you.
I'm not following you.
My car's parked over there.
- In Smart Park?
"- No, on Front Street."
"Oh, I parked in Smart Park."
"So, at the end of the next block we'll separate."
At Tyrone Street.
"Yeah, the ""Ice Land"" sign is halfway."
It's the halfway... point.
Ice Land is-
"It's kind of like that point in a relationship, you know... where you suddenly realize it's not gonna last forever."
"You know, you can see the end in sight."
Tyrone Street.
"Yeah, but we're not even there yet."
We're still at the good part.
We're not even sick of each other yet.
I have to continue working or I'll be told off.
They love to play bite the cake.
And we've got games where they can win prizes.
"Niels, Arie's Niels."
I know where he is and what he's doing.
I got the guns.
We can finally kill him.
After 35 years.
I'm out.
-What?
I don't want to kill anybody anymore.
Why so ethical suddenly?
-Suddenly?
It's taken some time.
How many Krauts did you kill in those days?
"20, 30?"
There won't be another one.
Every life's precious.
"-Oh, come on."
"Once, I was going on holiday with my wife."
"We had a blowout, an accident."
Totally messed up.
"When I came to, I had so many tubes in my body, I looked like an octopus."
And your wife?
-Dead.
She had already been cremated when I came to.
And you married the nurse?
A bit of a cliché.
-Yes?
"Well, I've got another one for you."
"When I was laying in hospital, I thought life had to continue."
"I'd never wanted to have children, but ten months later... our eldest son was born."
He is free!
You came when I called to you.
I am free and you will sacrifice your bodies to me.
Come.
"You say nothing, but you speak to me with your minds."
"I will give you all my power, so that you may carry out your revenge."
You may go.
Now I am within you.
You have all of my power until sunrise.
"Once the daylight comes, you will be just as weak as you were before."
Go now.
You only have a few hours to carry out your revenge.
They're alive.
I saw them.
Poor things
"So, Louise, who did you see?"
Tell us what you know.
I didn't see anyone.
But I do know everything that happened.
That's the way I am.
I know things I have never seen!
I've heard about your gift of second sight.
Are they alive
- They're alive.
- Where are they?
Right here.
"- No, Bosco!"
- Calm down!
"Captain, stop him!"
"So there you are, my children."
You are very much as I imagined.
"Yes, I've seen you before."
- At Brian's house.
- Oh my God.
Can you believe it?
Right in the front yard.
Brian watched the entire thing through his kitchen window.
I thought you and Angela were really tight.
She was like my best friend.
This whole things been really hard for me to accept.
But Brian wouldn't lie.
So it's like...
it's like she's this completely different person.
Like a slut?
No.
"No, she's not."
I think she's just confused or something.
- Do you want me to kill her?
"- No, it doesn't matter."
Brian's the one who ought to be killed.
He should definitely die.
You know he's going to rat on Rickie.
What actually is there to rat on Rickie.
Do you know?
"I know whatever he did, he did because he had to."
You haven't had to clean him up after some Neanderthal...
beat the hell out of him.
"Come here for a minute, son."
Rickie Vasquez.
Are you familiar with the name?
Excuse me?
"What can you tell me, son, about Rickie Vasquez?"
He goes here.
"I don't, I mean..."
"Oh, God."
Patti Nyholm.
"- Well, look at you."
- And you.
Poster child for Motherhood Today.
"You have no changing tables in the restroom, Will."
- It's a lawsuit waiting to happen.
"- Yep, doing our part to suppress the birth rate."
"So, I need some legal advice on my contract."
"Oh, my God, wait."
You can't practice law any more.
What was I thinking?
"No, thank you."
"I'll be right out, Michael."
This'll take a few minutes.
"That must be really hard on you, Will, just sitting around watching all these lawyers while you're, what, surfing the Web?"
- Clipping coupons?
"- What's up, Patti?"
- A lawsuit.
- Really?
Which one?
A new one.
"It'll be great being on opposite sides again, dusting it up..."
"Oh, wait."
Darn it.
You're not a lawyer any more.
I keep forgetting.
So sorry I'm late.
Here's my lawyer now.
"Ms. Nyholm, I believe you know everybody."
I think I do.
Hello.
Get in.
Where did you go?
"Hey, where did he go?"
Go inside.
Where did Kutty go?
Come here.
Where did you go?
Where did you go?
To pluck guavas.
There are only stones for 12 kms.
Where did you get the guavas?
Tell me the truth.
Where did you go?
I won't tell you.
Tell me.
I won't tell you.
Small boy!
Don't you fear me now?
Konda Reddy says that Singamuthu is in this quarry.
And is insulting me with a camera.
This bastard says that he went to pluck guavas.
Don't you have any fear?
"Until he tells me where he went, he must lie there bleeding."
"If anyone tries to save his life without my knowledge, your children's fate will be very much similar to his."
This is Cuddapah Raja's line of death.
"If anyone treads on it, I will kill him."
"Kutty, where did he go?"
He didn't come for lunch either.
He can't stay hungry.
"Kutty, come fast."
We might miss the bus.
Someone tell me where he is.
"- How can you say that, Uncle?"
"No matter how much you teach a donkey, it can never become a horse."
"- Come on, now!"
"- Phone for you, Baba."
"Yes, mother. I am coming."
Why?
What happened?
is everything fine?
Mother is feeling somewhat ill.
"Uncle, I am moving."
"All right, then, Uncle."
What happened?
The car has broken down.
Let's check what's wrong.
I don't understand what's wrong with it?
It's become a problem.
The problem has been solved.
Excuse me...
Did you think that person to be the hotel's doorman who parks cars?
No.
Then you give your car to strangers just like that?
There are some people who don't look like strangers in the first meetings too.
Do you believe that he will return?
He will return.
He will surely return.
A girl...and a car!
"How wonderful, Lord!"
I pray at the shrine.
But He gives everything to him.
Anyway...
"Mother, you are unwell."
"Still, you are sitting here?"
"It would go great with cocktails or, uh, for a snack or on crackers or to make small sandwiches."
"- Even those, uh, ""ooh-doovas."""
-What?
- Hors d'oeuvres.
-Huh?
Hors d'oeuvres!
"They'd be good for that, too!"
"Here, just taste this."
- Just taste it.
"-No, no, no, I'd better not, Kramden."
I'm on a very strict diet.
No.
How can this harm you?
"It's homemade, pal."
- Here.
Take a little bit.
- Well. ..
"just one, if it's homemade."
Hey.
This is very good.
What did I tell you?
L-I've never tasted anything like it before.
"Everybody that tastes it says the same thing, Mr. Marshall."
- This'll be a riot.
-Yeah.
"Well, I want to try it on someone else."
"Oh, Ms. Evans, please tell Mr. Peck I'd like to see him in here for a moment."
"Mr. Tebbits, too."
"Kramden, this appetizer has possibilities."
"If it's handled right, it can be a big thing."
"Now, tell me, is this your wife's exclusive recipe or could there some..."
"be someone else involved, like, uh..."
"My company keeps a suite here all year round, in case of emergency."
Keeps a suite here?
"Pretty big outfit, huh?"
TUBBY:
"Yeah, it's his outfit-- Rutlege Cotton Mills."
-Cotton mills?
-Yeah.
"Well, hey, Tubb, you can shack up with me here."
You don't have to rent a room.
"Well, I got my own apartment right around the corner on Park Avenue."
-Park Avenue?
-Yeah.
Where else would a Park Avenue doctor live?
-Doctor?
-Yeah.
"Why, this poor soul couldn't open a can of rations without cutting his finger."
"Doctor, huh?"
Good boy.
"What are you doing, Bissel?"
Insurance.
Door-to-door?
"No, he's chairman of the board."
Chairman?
It figures.
"Say, you guys are doing all right."
(all chattering at once)
MORGAN:
"Now, Bilk, we have to..."
"You know, Bilk, it takes a lot of angling and finagling to make a success of yourself in the world today."
"Of course, we spent three years training under you-- the master."
Master?
How'd you find out I was a master?
Rematch next week?
Yeah.
"Oh, hey, Tommy."
Yeah.
"Bite me, man."
"* on another day,"
"Come on, come on,"
"With these ropes I tied,"
Can we do no wrong?
Now we grieve
"'Cause now is gone,"
Things were good
"When we were young,"
With my teeth locked down
I can see the blood
Of a thousand men
"Who have come and gone,"
Now we grieve
"'Cause now is gone,"
Things were good
"When we were young,"
Is it safe to say?
"Come on, come on,"
Was it right to leave?
"Come on, come on,"
Will I ever learn?
"Come on, come on,"
"Come on, come on,"
"Come on, come on *"

You can't just sit here.
Hello.
[dialing]
Yeah.
Chayton.
Chayton.
This is Otto Bernhardt.
Listen...
"Well, there's a fellow here in my office, and he refuses to leave."
"In fact, he refuses to even talk."
I suspect that he's here on your behalf.
"Actually, he's there for you, to help you make sure nothing happens to my money."
"Yeah, but that's... that's... that's really not necessary."
"I'll see you in the morning after my case is dropped, when I come to get what's mine."
Whew.
That's better.
Good to get out of those church clothes.
"I tried cleaning this up, but he about bit my head off."
"That's what marriage is, mostly... putting up with each other's shit."
[doorbell rings]
You expecting anyone?
I am.
- [knocking] - [door opens]
- I'm sorry to interrupt...
- Hi.
"... but, uh, this gentleman says he's here to see you."
Ah.
Dr. Barrett.
You met my grandson?
Just now.
"Yeah, if you need me,"
- I'll be in my room.
(MAN) (SPEAKING GERMAN)
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
She's coming with us.
Eh!
Eh!
We have to do something.
"Yes, but in due time."
How can you be so calm?
"If you would be so kind, tell me the joke about the Spanish hell."
What are you doing here?
Thinking about how to get out.
Wait!
Wait.
Get me out of here.
I have an even more important secret for Himmler.
"Here inside there is a time door, only one."
I can show you hundreds.
Traitor.
(WHISPERS) You have no idea.
"I hate to disappoint you, but the Holy Grail isn't in Montserrat."
"Our only grail is our Blessed Virgin and our custom, to kiss her."
(MAN) (SPEAKING GERMAN)
Tell him that I hope he enjoys his cyanide.
You speak German.
-I studied in Tübingen.
"Look, I know that I can't prohibit you from treading this holy ground but I can confine myself to my cell until you leave here."
Take care not to break anything.
Should we fear God's wrath?
-No.
You should fear mine.
Heil Hitler.
Fräulein Lola Mendieta.
"Listen to me, there's no cash with me."
They took the bag with them when they¡ª
"Asshole, I saw them leave."
No bag.
Get it.Now.
Ok.
"We have security cameras in here, you know."
You don't got shit.
"You're running an illegal joint under the table and off the books, asshole."
- Nice and easy.
- Ok.
"Ok, take the money out of the bag."
Put it down so I can see it.
And you're gonna put it back in.
Very slowly.
"If you play your cards right,"
"I'm going to leave quietly, and you're not going to tell anybody about this, because reporting a robbery of unreported income would be insane."
As would doing anything other than what I just told you.
Right.
- How much of this should--
- Just keep it coming.
Putting it right here.
Nice.
Shit.
Just take the money.
Can you hear me?
Hey.
Hey.
Jesus christ.
"You want to be a hero, asshole?"
You want to be a goddamn hero?
Guess I do.
"It's my dad, ok?"
He won't let me.
Why?
I...
"It's ok, just... tell me."
"I know it's not true, but my dad won't let me sleep over at your house because he thinks you're gay."
I know you're not.
I just...
I have to do what he says.
I'm sorry.
What if I was gay?
What do you mean?
Would you not want to sleep over at my house if I really was gay?
Hey.
So... don't worry about last night.
"It was almost curfew, and there was a lot of pressure."
Yeah.
But you still want to... right?
Of course.
"Um, Saturday night, we'll do it the right way, ok?"
"Yeah, I'd like that."
I got it all planned out.
We can go to a really nice dinner.
Totally on me.
"And then afterwards, maybe we can go to the beach."
- The beach?
- Yeah.
What's wrong with the beach?
Have you ever had sex on the beach?
"I know it's supposed to be all romantic and stuff, but there's sand everywhere, in all your business, and bugs."
It's...
It's pretty terrible.
Even better.
"Alright, let's wrap it up"
And get out of here.
[âª]
You can't fault his taste.
[âª]
I recognize this.
"Yeah, he stole it from the"
National gallery in '93.
"We're coming back here,"
And we're returning everything.
[âª]
What happened to your mother?
It was an accident.
Father never talks about it.
(syd:)were you about ten?
(andreas:) eleven.
(nigel:)same age that you lost yours.
"Put it back, andreas."

Rush him.
He can't kill us all.
That is the furthest thing from my mind.
Put the briefcase on the table.
[âª]
(da veiga:)when you opened
The briefcase...
This tracer bug started to transmit
On a narrow band frequency
Which I had kept from the gural nataz.
"However, agents have now been dispatched"
And the man leading them will be
What are you doing?
Hurry and get up!
I was going to cook some bean sprouts.
"I've already made the rice, serve yourself."
"All right, all right, I'll take care of it."
What the hell?
Are you trying to kill yourself?
Please hurry and cross!
Hurry!
You can't stop traffic!
Hello.
- I'm sorry for being late.
- Hello.
I'm sorry.
Are you having some problems in your life?
Excuse me?
"Oh, I don't have any problems in my life, editor."
"I haven't been getting any sleep, and I overslept."
You must've had a good sleep.
"Yes, that's correct."
"All right, let's start the meeting."
Yes.
"It fits perfectly, it doesn't need any adjustments."
I'll make that decision.
All right.
Did you gain some weight?
"No, I didn't."
You must've been slacking off on your exercise.
Did I gain weight?
Why isn't your groom here?
"He's coming, he'll be here."
Did I gain a lot of weight?
"He's clean, Vi."
Come on then.
This isn't going much like the picture by...
"Yea, I know."
"204, 00:18:15,886 -- 00:18:18,094 I wish it would be more like a normal job."
Now it's weird!
"206, 00:18:20,016 -- 00:18:21,882 I never really talked to a job before."
Listen...this might be some kind of a test.
Everything is a test when you're a career woman.
Damn right .
And thoses dresses aren't going to buy themselves.
I got it!
What?
I know what we can do!
What?
"Why don't we just go in there, blast him without thinking about it ?"
"That way, we don't have to think about it."
"214, 00:18:40,911 -- 00:18:43,654 We don't even have to look either because we never going to miss at that distance."
"That's a good plan, Daze."
A real good one!
You think so?
Totally!
Cool.
But don't aim too high.
Why not?
We don't want to hit that little bird.
"Oh, yea, good thinking."
"Okay, ready?"
Ready!
Let's do it!
Who wants a snack?
"Be careful, they're hot."
Ariel?
Where are you going?
"Ariel, what are you doing here with this riffraff?"
I'm going to see Ursula.
"[Gasps] Ariel, no!"
No!
She's a demon.
She's a monster.
Why don't you go tell my father?
You're good at that.
But...
"But, I..."
Come on!
This way.
[Creatures moan]
"[Gasps, grunts]"
[Pants]
[Ursula] Come in.
"Come in, my child."
We mustn't lurk in doorways.
It's rude.
One might question your upbringing. [chuckles]
"Now, then, you're here because you have a thing for this human, this prince fellow."
Not that I blame you.
"He is quite a catch, isn't he?"
"Well, angelfish, the solution to your problem is simple."
The only way to get what you want is to become a human yourself.
[Gasps] Can you do that?
"My dear, sweet child."
That's what I do.
It's what I live for.
"To help unfortunate merfolk, like yourself, poor souls with no one else to turn to."
It'll soften the blow.
It doesn't matter what I do.
He is never going to forgive me.
Of course he will.
You're his only daughter.
He has to.
"Congratulations, by the way."
- Thank you.
- How's it going?
Good.
Good.
"Okay, talk to your father soon, please, because I need your help on Saturday with the Novack wedding."
They want five additional cakes.
Cakes.
Mom-- mom!
Mom.
What?
"You don't even ask anymore, you just assume?"
What if I have plans?
Do you?
- That's not the point.
- What's the point?
That I could have.
What time Saturday?
8:00 a.m.
I love you.
I don't know how to tell him.
"Honey, ever since you could crawl, you've been out to prove a point-- that you could do whatever your brothers could do, only you could do it better."
"And you've always been way too smart, except where it comes to your father."
You're 30 years old.
When are you gonna stop looking for his approval?
I thought we were going out.
"So, one-way ticket to Peru?"
I'm hitting it.
Yeah.
Hey.
Yeah?
About what you said the other day.
I thought it didn't bother you.
"You know, Sam, I saved your hide back there."
And I saved your hide at that church...
And the hospital.
I may not think things all the way through.
Okay?
"But what I do,"
I do because it's the right thing.
I'd do it again.
And that... is the problem.
"Y-you think you're my savior, m-my brother, the hero."
"You swoop in, and even when you mess up, you think what you're doing is worth it because you've convinced yourself you're doing more good than bad..."
But you're not.
"I mean, Kevin's dead, Crowley's in the wind, uh..."
We're no closer to beating this angel thing.
"Please tell me, what is the upside of me being alive?"
You kidding me?
You and me -- fighting the good fight together.
[ Sighs ]
[ Sighs ] Okay.
"Just once, be honest with me."
You didn't save me for me.
You did it for you.
What are you talkin' about?
I was ready to die.
I was ready.
"In South Korea, there are only five people who know about this."
What's the plan?
Infiltrate Pyongyang.
And take the lives of 30 North Korean generals.
Are you planning to go on the mission?
I can't just give up.
"I will be the one going, you should quit."
You're not alone now.
Kyeong Hee.
Mu Yeol.
"Must have been tiring alone, right?"
I'm sorry.
Please hold this...
"This is our son, isn't it?"
Let me have a look at him.
"Oh, he's really handsome."
"Baby, I'm your father."
I heard that you didn't come out quickly.
Your mother worked so hard.
"Both of you, you are now new parents."
"Ms. Kyung, you've worked hard."
"Kid, she is your sister-in-law."
Thank you for returning safely.
I saw the news.
You don't know how much I was worried.
"Don't worry, I'm all right now."
Crazy guy!
Why would my wife worry about you?
I know that you're as strong as my husband.
"Ah, I'm broken-hearted!"
I need to get married this year at once.
"Well, take good care of sister-in-law."
- Fire Pete?
He can't fire Pete.
- I quit.
He can suck it.
"Yeah, suck it, Pete."
"No, you're not listening."
You're not a good listener.

Liz said we were cutting the cat-lady sketch.
She said it stinks.
This is why Liz is wrong.
Animal humour is universal.
I just don't think I'm good in it.
Do you think I'm good in it?
I think this is your opportunity and prove everybody wrong.
- What do you mean?
Who's everybody?
"- The network that wanted to fire you, the focus groups that said your eye is weird."
This eye?
"It doesn't open all the way because when I was little, my sister peed in it."
Tonight is your opportunity to go out there and change all of our minds.
What?
Where is Liz?
Liz!
Get down!
Four minutes to air.
That's four minutes to air.
- Is Liz back yet?
- No.
Which cat do you want Jenna to carry?
- I'm sorry?
- Which cat?
Your things just flew out the window.
What?
You're part of the scenery.
"The air passes through, filling your entire body."
It flows out your finger tips.
Breathe with your toes to get the air into your toes.
The energy flowing in your toes fills you with vitality.
Your toes are laughing.
Good.
You're like air.
A cool breeze permeates your body.
You see a vision of divine beauty.
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Who did this?
The Freemasons?
Are you from a bat lodge or something?
Leave me alone.
"Guys, I need help!"
Don't touch her!
"There's some wacko here, Peku!"
Are you fucking crazy or what?
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Somebody was crying for help.
"The bride was tied up, her clothes all torn."
"I tried to help, but the Devil and Dracula attacked me."
Then they all just disappeared.
{\i1\cH80ffff}They were raised in the bellies of Mexican girls.
{\i1\cH80ffff}Girls no one can find anymore.
{\i1\cH80ffff}Their fathers are semillas geneticas... {\i1\cH80ffff}...special seeds in bottles.
{\i1\cH80ffff}
- Birthday?
No birth.
- Maria.
{\i1\cH80ffff}We do not dress them up for Halloween.
"{\i1\cH80ffff}We do not call them ""baby"" or kiss boo-boos."
{\i1\cH80ffff}Don't think of them as children.
{\i1\cH80ffff}Think of them as things... {\i1\cH80ffff}...with patents and copyrights.
{\i1\cH80ffff}Comprende?
senor.
{\i1\cH80ffff}They thought we were too poor... {\i1\cH80ffff}...and stupid to understand.
yes... {\i1\cH80ffff}...but we are not stupid.
{\i1\cH80ffff}Use your powers.
{\i1\cH80ffff}This is business.
{\i1\cH80ffff}They are making soldiers.
{\i1\cH80ffff}Killers.
{\i1\cH80ffff}These are babies of mutantes...
North Dakota.
Mmm.
You took that woman's money.
You said you would take the child there.
What is she?
Logan.
Alkali has your genetic code.
Not just mine.
Logan...
I don't want to talk about it.
I don't wanna hear about it anymore.
Logan...
"Do I need to make fun of ""Star Wars"" or something"
- to summon your angry nerd strength?
- I'm fine.
"[ Strained voice ] And anyone who makes fun of ""Star Wars"""
is just revealing their own cinematic ignorance.
- [ Chuckles ] Nerd speak.
- Whoa.
I don't remember having that in my storeroom.
"Yo, guys."
What's going on?
[ Chuckles ]
Why aren't you out at the party?
- The thing is...
- We're in a weird situation.
Oh.
[ Chuckles ]
"I get it, fellas."
It's okay.
"I mean, look, you're 17."
"Life's crazy right now, and the one thing you can really count on is your best friend."
It's natural to kiss a little.
"You know, just see if it feel all right."
Dude!
We're not gay.
We didn't kiss.
"Uh, duh!"
[ Laughs ]
I did not kiss my best friend in high school either.
At all.
Ever.
"We are always pulling back a strange new layer on you, aren't we?"
This is just the greatest night!
So I was very happy to only photograph...
"His trousers, his boots, the sidewalk, and this car."
"I really liked that, and..."
Also what I liked was...
"To blur the whole picture, except the upper outline."
What's that?
It's beautiful.
It's a sunrise on Fès.
I went to Fès in April...
"And people told me ""Did you take pictures?"
"!"""
"I say ""Sure, here's a great sunrise on Fès""!"
And I show them...
And they're a little bit surprised...
"It is Fès, that's obvious..."
Fès is here...
"There's the brightness of a lamp, but..."
"No, it's not a lamp..."
There's Fès...
And there's some brightness...
Those two things together can make a picture...
Can make a picture...!
Two heterogenous things can make a picture together...
Like a sunrise in Fès.
I seduced someone with this picture.
I send it to him...
He fell in love instantly with the picture...
He's also a photographer.
"He felt close to it, especially for this."
The end.
That's all.
I want to thank (...) For their help.
The man who shot me wrapped it over my eyes.
I'll never forget that.
- Would you like some tea?
"- No, thanks."
It won't take a minute.
"Please, sit."
I'll put some music on.
Another quiet tear
Streaks down my face
Another night of desolation
And solitude
Just accept me
For what I am
Don't make promises
That you won't keep
Who needs dreams...
Relax!
"You look exactly like what you are, an undercover agent."
"Lighten up, or it'll be an open secret."
Come on.
Smile!
Now you look like something out ofa nuthouse.
"Chang, this guy Eddie's a lunatic."
Be careful.
"Same to you, pal."
Watch your ass!
"Eddie, sorry to keep you waiting."
- Who the hell is that?
- He's a good buddy.
- Say hello to Eddie.
- Eddie.
Search him!
"Oh, well, you know."
"Hey, if, uh, the mountain won't come to Muhammad-"
"Hey, Danny, look."
"As your accountant and as your friend,"
I sort of feel I have some kind of fiduciary obligation to advise you-
I know.
You want me to sell my dad's house.
I will.
"Hey, every month you don't,"
- you're incurring a wholly unnecessary tax liability.
- I get it.
- You like that?
"- Yeah, I get it."
Yeah?
What about this?
What if I put you in touch with a broker?
"I'd love to chat, Stan, but I gotta go home and get some sleep."
Good.
"Then you can be fresh for my poker game tonight, huh?"
"Yes, sir."
Hey.
Hey.
An accountant that works out of a topless pool.
Nice.
He's bugging me about selling my dad's house.
How much you say he bought the place for?
"He bought the land for 16,000 and built the house himself."
"16,000?"
Yeah.
You know how much it's worth?
A million and a half.
Excuse me.
Why don't you take this?
Then you can call off the bet.
What bet?
"I know you have sworn to seduce me, and at this rate you will succeed, so..."
That's a disgusting lie!
Who told you that?
Marie?
"She's a good friend, I have no reason to doubt her."
Once I wrote you a letter and asked her to deliver it.
I found out that she signed her own name to it!
Surely you realise she wants you for herself?
"- Dear lady, please..."
"- Don't worry, I'm going!"
She's right.
We're not suited.
I'm not full of virtues and noble qualities.
"I love, that is all."
"But I love strongly, exclusively, steadfastly."
- You remember?

"- Yes, monsieur."
- Madame?
Please excuse me.
- Sophie!
There's no more.
I'm empty.
That's the last you'll get from me.

That is like the weirdest thing that ever happened at this school.
Ever.
J ust think about who...
if we all weren't in our classrooms just minding our own business.
And look.
By what.
I could have been right at that spot.
I was there like ten minutes earlier.
What is the big deal?
It's not like anybody even got a flesh wound.
Goten!
You should not touch it so suddenly.
right?
It is an invention of mom.
She said that nothing could be detected with the award.
So we will not be able to see ...
Do not worry.
but ...
Did you see?
There is always some trick!
Trunks!
I'll show you the special prize!
Wow!
I'm hungry...
Pilaf-sama!
I'm a dog but this is too much!
what guarantees that this island is a treasure?
It's what this map says!
looking good ...
How could you believe this ?
!
the motor broke down because it is not of good quality.
we will not get to reach the port.
What are we going to do?
I am going to die here?
Stay calm and continue to seek the treasure!
I'm hungry...
I want to eat monjayaki ...
I do not get any fish or fish... right?
Wow!
right?
My mama collected these today!
It's not like you're one of them.
Schanke...
um...
What would you say if...
What would you say if I told you that I was an addict?
"[LAUGHS] Yeah, right, and I'm the Maharishi."
"Hey, wait, wait, wait, I'm serious."
"I'm talking to you, here, okay?"
Seriously.
An addict?
"Wait, wait, we're not talking about the red wine in the refrigerator, are we, because..."
"No, no, no, absolutely not."
"You're perfectly all right, Nick."
You're perfectly fine.
Absolutely not.
Trust me.
[LAUGHS]
So much for step number one.
Yeah?
What's step number two?
[POURING]
"Hi, my name's Nick, and I'm an addict."

"Come on, what are you afraid of?"

"No one else knows any better, don't be silly!"
But they know I can't dance.

I'm not going to make a fool of myself.
"No one knows, they just jump around."
"Come on, what harm can it do?"
"If I don't know how to dance, I won't."
Excuse me. I'll tidy myself up a bit.

"The other day, going through my papers,"
I found some notes I took the day you came to see me.
I'd written down a topic to discuss on your second visit.
A visit that never took place.
What topic?
Your sexual orientation.
My sexual orientation?
"Yes, your sexuality."
If you like men or women.
"When you came to see me, you said you were still a virgin."
Well...
"To answer your question in some way,"
I think I'm oriented more towards men.
Was that why you came to see me?
I can't remember now.
I guess so.
But I'm fine now.
I go on long-term disability.
At 75% pay.
"And then do what, shay?"

You need to get back behind the lines.
"Mouch, get this kid safe."
I'm not gonna pretend like I don't remember peeling you off the floor after that woman broke your heart.
I know.
I just always thought she was the one.
Come on!
Get down!
[Children cheering]
When can we go back inside?
"We have to check with the gas company, ma'am."
And they'll tell you when it's safe.
"Ms. Simpson, I was looking for Leonard to get the keys to the shed."
No one's seen him.
"Oh, God."

Down here?
Call out!
You guys smell anything?
Are we sure they cut off the gas lines?
"Oh, I shut it down myself."
Then you whacked your aunt and uncle.
"Shut up, Calum."
I'm just saying.
At least with Lenny you know it's someone who probably deserves it.
Not just some scared kid in a trench.
"I didn't fight in the trenches, Calum."
You wouldn't be going to see your sister if Lenny hadn't got you out of prison.
"Yeah, well, I'm not gonna do it."
OK.
He can find himself another hitman.
I'm sure.
"OK, kids, lunch is ready."
You should get yourself a new map.
Nah.
This is my only school prize.
The names are out of date.
I know.
But the old maps are the best.

Are you gonna talk to me?
What do you wanna know?

What's the verdict?
"Well, other than a few hiccups, it's looking good."
What hiccups?
"According to Julien's statement, he didn't see the shooting."
What do you mean?
He was right there!
He says he was in the woman's apartment.
But I wouldn't worry about it though.
It's gonna be a good shoot.
–Dutch.
–Jordan's alibi checked out.
I ran a records check on everyone in Kayla's building.
–Any hits?
–Two: a woman passing bad checks and a Bob Lindhoff.
Bob Lindhoff?
I just had him down here.
"Nine years ago, an attempted kidnapping charge, later dropped."
She's coming to again.
Get in the car.
Hey!
"Hey, I tried to call, but there was no answer."
We went out to grab a bite to eat.
What's up?
I've got a suspect down at the station I was hoping you could I.D.
You mind coming back?
You'll be recruiting Resistance on your own until the troops land in Dieppe.
- Please don't let them take me again.
- It's all right.
"I'm right here, my love."

"S02E04 Last Man, Last Round"
How many guns on this rotation?
"Eight rifles, three, four, MP-38s."
You think Major Stirling is in there?
If he survived.
Two years since they were captured at Dunkirk.
None of them are going to be in good shape.
"If we're gonna build an army, we've got to start somewhere."
Two watch towers.
Six hundred feet of exposed no man's land.
What about that hill?
It's not guarded.
It's covered in land mines.
So is that path.
No problem.
What about a blind spot from the tower?
- There isn't one.
- No time to tunnel under.
- Patrols?
- Twenty-four hour rotation.
- Like a Swiss watch.
No gaps.
- Efficient bastards.
Maybe we don't need to break into the camp.
She can be.
We will see.
"You are more attracted by the comical gendre,... than by the dramatic."
By the master of erotica.
Back in your dress.
"You have a great future ""behind'."
-What actress?
-More.
All of you!
Leave a photo with my secretary.
"-Thank you, maestro."
-Thanks.
We will keep a picture of yourself.
"-Thanks, maestro!"
-Thanks.
Thank you miss.
I told him that was exceptional.
Thanking you too.
"Here it is, I recommend it."
"- Archive ""A""?"
-How did you guess?
What are you doing tonight?
As I said.
I am going to the movies with my boyfriend.
You expect to get it outside of yourself?
I see what you're getting at!
But why?
"Because it won't let you go, before first telling you something about yourself."
Anything?
What?
Something or the other.
An adventure for example.
Look!
"Look, my baby."
Those are all places where Daddy's been.
Look.
Where's that?
"In Australia, he travelled by bus."
He saw crocodiles.
"No, Mommy doesn't like them."
Or over in India.
"It was so filthy, he didn't like it either."
"And up here, the red pin, that's where we are, sweetie."
"That's where you and I are, in Daddy's room."
The green pins are where he's going this summer.
"All the way up to the cold, cold icebergs."
"I've never eaten baboon, but I've tasted every other animal."
Take the rancher.
who won't eat Warthog...
My wife made Wiener Schnitzel from Warthog.
"The rancher asked, ""What is it?"" My wife said, ""Wiener Schnitzel."""
His cook was about to tell him what it was.
I said to her.
"""Tell him and I'll slap you!"""
I said we'd tell him later ourselves.
He doesn't eat Warthog.
But he loved it.
I asked.
"""Know what you just ate?"
"Warthog."""
"""No way."
"That was a Wiener Schnitzel."""
"I said, ""See how wrong you can be?"""
'Cause a Warthog doesn't have dark meat like our wild boar.
Problem with the elevators?
"With 2, always 2."
"Hook, did you just see a little girl, in the hallway, maybe?"
I didn't see anyone.
"But then, half the lights are out again."
Abel to Security.
- It's Otto.
- And Hook.
The lights are out in West 1.
And Elevator 2 is acting up again.
"And Blondie, did you see him?"
No.
Flipping a breaker isn't a solution.
It's only a Band-Aid.
Did you see a little girl?
"If kids are wandering out of Paeds, Dr. James is going to be very unhappy."
I have never seen Dr. James unhappy.
There you are.
I've been so worried about you.
"Hon, stay on the lane, okay?"
I hate it when you run on the main road.
"It's October, in case you haven't noticed."
There's no traffic on the main road.
All the summer people went home a month ago...
God bless their pointy little heads.
"Well, still, it makes me nervous, so just stay on the lane, okay?"
- I suppose I could.
- Great.
"- And by the way, you were great."
- So were you.
- See you later.
"- Peter, what are you painting?"
The lady that went in the elevator...
Is that a student?
No.
I think that I know her family...
"No, no."
She's a teacher.
"Hi, sweetheart!"
Ready for cyberspace?
I just got in a very exclusive chat room.
A friend has just arrived.
She's an Internet virgin.
You do this every night?
No.
On Thursdays I eat at my mother's... then I come home and take a Valium.
Wouldn't you rather meet someone live?
In a real place?
Like at the beach?
And compete with those teenagers who live at the gym?
No.
Thank you.
By any chance... do you meet live people in real places?
No... but I don't want to meet anyone.
Everyone wants to meet someone.
I already met the person I was supposed to meet... and I married him.
Are you divorced?
No.
Widowed.
I'm sorry.
"No, Nadine."
It's not like I'm some traumatized madwoman.
"Okay, but I am."
Must be Gary.
My daughter isn't depressed.
"Well, you mentioned her father and the separation."
You think I should take her to a psychiatrist?
No.
I think we should wait and see what happens with the Ritalin.
I think that's the answer.
-Okay.
"-Let's wait two, three weeks."
All right.
And the lies she's been telling?
"That's part of it, huh?"
-Lies?
-Like saying her bed's shaking.
That stuff.
Have you ever known your daughter to swear?
-To use obscenities?
"-No, never."
Hmm.
Interesting.
Similar-
- Similar to things like her lying...
-...it's uncharacteristic for her.
-I don't understand.
She doesn't swear.
"Well, she let loose quite a string while I was examining her, Mrs. MacNeil."
I find that hard to believe.
What did she say?
Her vocabulary is rather extensive.
"Well, give me an example."
Like what?
"Specifically, what did she say?"
"Specifically, Mrs. MacNeil she advised me to keep my fingers away from her goddamn cunt."
"Look, there's a hotel across the road there."
"We could grab a room, really thrash this thing out."
(Laughs) It's not gonna happen.
No?
"Come on, well, why do you call?"
Why do you...
Why do you keep dropping in?
"Fine, I won't."
"No, I'm not saying that."
I'm just saying why?
Why?
I don't know.
And I can't stay.
"Oh, well, this has been a cracker day for me."
I'm only trying to get an innocent man off murder charges.
"I'm happy for the distraction, yeah."
I thought everyone you defended was guilty.
Do you remember that long weekend we spent together?
"Yeah, yes."
Son Of Astor paid for it.
Came in ten to one.
"I had you for four beautiful days, all to myself."
In the Margaret River.
"And I really slept there, didn't I?"
"Yes, you did."
"Yeah, it was pretty much all you did, actually."
Snuggled up and snoozed.
I didn't mind.
They had in-house porn.
Call me anytime.
It's looking a bit messy.
"Ah, Sal."
"Well, it wasn't just that."
"When we met, it was like fate brought us together."
Now what's it doing?
I'm not a big believer in fate.
"Yeah, well, I hate fate."
"Oh, let's not make it mad, though."
I can't believe this.
I'm gonna take the car to go get some coffee with this guy.
What?
I'll be back soon.
"He's really, reay nice."
And he likes my hat.
Okay.
"- So, you're happy."
- Me?
"Oh, yeah."
It's all good.
"I mean, Yonk's a lot older, so we're into different stuff, and-and we have different friends."
"And he's away a lot, promoting the Yonk Allen Barbeque Grill."
Okay.
"But, I mean, how cool is it?"
I'm married to Yonk Allen.
It's-it's awesome.
"Yeah, I mean, he was a huge football star, so, you know, he... got hit in the head a lot."
"But he takes really good care of me, and he's very sweet."
"Sometimes mean, but-but mostly sweet."
"Well, yeah, that's - that's just like your dad."
- Yes.
- Yes.
"Hey, babe."
Time to go to the airport.
I'll be right there.
The rear window.
That minibus is following us.
I command you to place obstacles in its path.
[tires squeal]
City property.
I've damaged city property.
[moaning]
[panting] they said these glasses were shatterproof.
Was that a bus or a bridge?
They're still with us.
"Tony, you must stop her."
"Man, that man was really buzzing."
Am I still alive?
[tires screech]
They're gaining on us.
She counteracts everything that Tony does.
"Tony, you've got to stop her."
We flew!
[boys cheering]
They must've flown.
Don't you dare try it.
Sickle...
"Sickle, stop..."
Stop over that hill.
"Tony, cause the reflection of the sun on the rear window"
To magnify and shine so brightly
That our pursuers'll be blinded by it.
[glass breaking]
[van scrapes road]
"[muscles] come on, open the doors."
[crusher] I can't see.
- [Tia] yeah.
"No, thanks."
Do you have Pac-Man?
No.
Space Invaders?
No.
Do you have Asteroids?
"No, but my dad does."
He can`t even sit on the toilet some days.
"What do you do here, dale?"
"well, I have a stack of nudie books this high."
She`s beautiful!
would you sell me any of them?
"Shit, no!"
I cherish these things!
I use them a Iot!
How do you use a magazine?
I was getting to that.
"A guy taught me something really neat, last year."
Did you ever bop your baloney?
"I guess we`re 1 1, aren`t we?"
"No, we`re 12 with Aunt Edna."
Aunt Edna?
Is she still alive?
You bet!
I can`t wait to see the look on CIark`s face when he hears that.
She came to help when Eddie ruptured his spleen and she`s been here ever since.
She wanted to go back to Phoenix last year but Eddie wouIdn`t let her.
"Without her social Security, we`d never be able to live like this."
It looks like you`ve really got your hands full.
It`s not so bad!
"Eddie says after the baby comes, I can quit one of my night jobs."
"How do you Iike yours, clark?"
- I don't blame you for not trusting me.
"Look, if it makes you feel any better, the Marta I knew wouldn't be involved in anything like this."
People don't change that much.
"Jacob, where are we going now?"
I'm gonna do whatever it takes to get her back.
"If I'm gonna save her, I'll need your help."
Can I trust you?
C'mon.
That's it.
"Shit, c'mon."
Jared.
How'd you recognize me?
From pictures.
Of us together.
Where's Jacob?
"Take me to Julia, and when I know she's okay, I'll call him."
"What would you say if I told you, uh she was still in Italy?"
Then you don't get your money.
"Good old Jacob, huh?"
I shoulda known he'd keep the game interesting.
Where is he?
Is he looking at us now?
Is the girl in Italy?
"No, she's here in Zurich."
I have a taxi waiting.
How long was I with you?
Not long.
You were setting me up.
To get the money.
(speaking German)
How did we get together?
Does it really matter?
- I'll untie him myself.
"- Yes, that's right."
"Only one hand, that's all I need at you."
Just one hand.
- Hurry up about it.
"- I'll take all day, if you order me around."
"I owe you one, anyway."
"Mate, look at your back."
- Never mind that.
Untie my hands.
- Just look what they did to you.
"I'm sorry, mate."
The fiends!
- The Guru.
- Filthy scum.
- Dog.
- Maniac.
- Let's get him.
- Here we go.
Grab him regardless how many are with him.
It's our only chance.
"He's sacred, so they won't shoot us."
"Why, you hairless dog."
"Look what you did to that man's back, you filthy..."
"A lesson in the error of false pride, Sergeant."
You're talking very proudly yourself.
Perhaps you're not too proud to give a little information I seek.
- I want to know about your army.
"- Why don't you enlist, mate?"
Lash.
"For a beginning, this is not bad."
Three soldiers to be given to Mother Kali... three soldiers and a slave.
Badly.
"Well, we see."
"Lack of appetite, weakness, diminution of weight, asthenia, you feel nauseous, vomits."
And a pretty coloration bronzes.
Disease of Addison.
You know that you have much luck?
Only there are a case each ten thousands.
One each ten thousands.
Disease of Addison.
It hears?
you know that when I am in critical moment me...?
-You.
You.
The stomach.
"-Ah, very well, thanks."
"Yours no, cretino."
The one of the patient.
"Ah, yes."
"Professor, he does not think that he is embarrassed?"
It seems to you the moment for joking?
Cretino.
"It feels, feels."
You see it?
It is aerophagia.
Who has been?
"I will take you to all before the Academic Senate,"
I will cause that they expel to you...
"By charity, Cicchirini, we do not begin, will have been the echo."
"Make me case, you will not regret..."
Damn Ah... is.
"-Sir, want to come in?"
"-Yes, thanks."
"- Hey, Katie."
- Mm-hmm?
"Why don't you sit your bottom here, next to me?"
"Oh, Vali, I think I'm going to go ahead and probably sit next to anyone else."
Fair enough.
- I'll sit there.
- Okay.
Mom.
Do you want to go ahead and sit next to me?
Oh!
I would love that.
"Hey, I'm sorry things got awkward with us today."
Let's just start over.
"Happy Thanksgiving, Greg."
"Oh, happy Thanksgiving."
You...
You just unhooked my bra.
That's not even a thing I can do if I'm trying!
"Oh, Greg."
"The one time a year we get little marshmallows on sweet potatoes, and you're too high to put them on the table."
I made a lot of bad decisions yesterday.
You're telling me.
You left the oven on all night long.
You could have burned down the house.
I also left the sink on.
It would have put out part of the fire.
Oh.
No!
"No, no, no, no, no!"
What?
"Apparently, I also agreed to make an ""Amazing Race"" audition video with my mom."
"Always say no to drugs, Katie."
I'll go with you ifyou go home.
Go home ?
"Get the hell away from me, you punk-ass bitch."
You're the one don't have the balls.
to walk away from this shit.
"I should have tookyour ass tojail along with mine, man."
"But you didn't, so you do not have to get in that car."
"Malakai, you are so much smarter than this shit."
I know what you can be.
I know what you're capable of.
Let'sjust walk away.
Walk away to what ?
"I'm not you, Derek."
I can't do nothing but what I'm doing.
"I can't go to Georgetown with a 1 0.0 G.P.A., operating on people, doing brain surgery..."
- or whateveryou're gonna be doing.
"- You can, man."
"- lf l can do it, you can do it."
- All I have is my respect.
Andthat's what lgotta go take care of.
"You wanna bail out on me, man ?"
That's fline.
But you can kiss my ass with all your future bullshit.
I know who the hell I am...
right now.
"Kai, man, wait, man."
"Let's go, man."
[CarEngineStarts]
Sara ?
Ready to go ?
Um--
Yes.
- Good!
Why isn't the sign up?
Hi everyone.
"Well, at least it's finished."
When do I get the money?
When this thing is up.
Tell me Nora.
Wouldn't you rather work over there with us...
Instead of wasting your time over here.
Oh no!
We're wasting our time.
What's going to happen to us.
We won't survive!
He's got a screw loose!
"By the way, does your brother have the money?"
"Yes, he has the money."
You can pick it up right now.
Finally some good news!
"Great, right?"
Maybe something will actually come out of your hotel.
Although I would fire the bellman.
He's got a screw loose.
Tom?
Tom is the way he is.
"But you Toni, how are you?"
I don't have a screw loose.
I'm an entrepreneur.
But I shouldn't say that too loud.
And what else are you?
The sign goes up tonight.
It's taken long enough.
"Hi there, I heard you have my money."
"Good night, Gordon."
It's been a pleasure.
- Thank you.
- Must you go?
"Well, yes."
I've got an 8:00 appointment at the office in the morning.
"Good night, Lynn."
Don't bother to see me out.
"- Good night, Dougie."
- Good night.
"I've been around long enough to know that you want something, honey."
What?
I want you to kill someone for me.
My husband.
Please.
I know who you are.
I've read all about you.
You don't know enough not to believe everything you read.
It would be so easy for you.
I could help you.
I'll pay you anything.
I'll be worth a fortune afterwards.
You're out of your mind.
You're lucky I don't slap you senseless for even suggesting it.
"Please, you've met him."
You see what he's like.
You can't imagine what it's like living with a man like that.
I want him dead.
You've got to help me.
I don't have to do anything.
"Got the wrong guy, honey."
You better forget the whole thing and just hope that I do too.
Suits you.
(EXHALES)
(CHUCKLES)
"And to Victor, the spoils."
(DOOR OPENS)
(GROANING)
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
(CONTINUES GROANING)
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
(YELLING)
"So, you're my benefactor."
You're the man behind all this.
(PANTING)
Don't worry.
There will be time to discuss how you can... (BREATHES HEAVILY) repay the debt.
(COURTIERS LAUGHING)
LOUIS:
Do I make a good Pilgrim?
"Well, Feron, am I transformed?"
"No garments, no matter how dreary, could disguise Your Majesty's regal bearing."
What do you think?
I think it would be safer if you were accompanied by a royal guard.
Why must you question my every decision?
Why?
I am angry now.
I was happy before and you have made me... (COUGHING)
(CONTINUES COUGHING)
"The Musketeer Aramis, as requested."
You are to accompany me on a pilgrimage.
"A pilgrimage, Your Majesty?"
"Well, you are a man of God, Aramis."
Or so you say.
"Babe, this is Austin Elektra."
- Hi.
- Hi.
"So, I just invited your girlfriend up to my place later."
Ready to rehearse.
You're more than welcome to join if you want.
"Oh, that sounds naughty."
I love naughty.
Ready to rehearse.
Got to go.
See you ladies tonight.
Absolutely.
Are you kidding me with this?
"Oh, come on, sweetie."
All's fair in love and murder investigations.
"What, do you think this is a game?"
As hot as it would be to see you two fight...
Especially after that kiss...
We need to work together on this.
It is in all our best interests.
All right.
We'll work together.
For now.
Wow.
This is actually gonna work out great.
"While you and Kendall keep Austin distracted,"
I'll search his house for proof that he's The Phantom.
Membership in the GDS is as good as mine.
"Oh, yay for you."
What's wrong?
[Sighs]
Was it the kiss with Kendall?
Yes.
Good morning.
Nozu Good morning.
"Hey, the performance in Tengeki looks like it's set."
Oh really?
Kayama-sensei is there.
Oh?
He's driving a bus.
Why?
What happened?
He can't dance.
He hurt his foot in the war.
"You know, his right foot."
Your feet are your career.
What's happened?
This was so sudden.
"He was such a good teacher, but everyone's forgotten about him."
I wonder what goes through his mind when he's driving his bus.
When my father was a student he lived at my mother's house and they supported him.
He was a hard-working and honest scholar back then.
He was blessed in many ways.
"Your mother was dancing ballet then, wasn't she?"
It's a strange combination.
It sure is.
Especially since my mother likes someone else.
Really?
My mother has been seeing someone since she was in her twenties.
But she had children with my father - me and my sister.
Good morning.
Good morning.
I'd like you to put another cheque in for me.
Certainly.
What?
You know.
The ones with the drugs that make you go crazy.
His blood was full of that shit.
And there were tons of dried mushrooms at his place.
You really believe that?
It's what the results said!
Didn't you ever try those mushrooms as a kid?
Hell no.
"All I know is, mushrooms don't do that to you."
You saw that poor guy.
Mushrooms would never make you that way.
But I'm right about the Japanese guy.
"If everyone's talking about him, there's likely a good reason."
What the hell?
Power's gone out again.
Fuck.
I keep telling the Captain to get that damn wiring fixed.
Never listens!
What the fuck!
- What's wrong?
- What the Christ was that?
- That thing outside.
- What's outside?
"- Outside, that... fuck!"
- What's your problem?
"What is it, man?"
You check it out.
- Me?
"- Yes, you!"
Dammit.
You want me to go out?
"It's me, Caroline."
My cards were stolen.
I've seen backs of vans with better candy selections.
This is a disgrace to the name Gas and Gobble.
How do you even wake up in the morning?
My alligator licks my face.
"Oh, my God, Max."
Whoever stole our credit cards maxed them out.
"They spent the $1,500 we had left."
No way.
"Someone just spent $1,500 on phone cards and cigarettes."
His name was Caroline Channing.
What?
That's my name!
"Ah, you got a dude's name."
"Ugh, we were robbed."
Police!
Where!
"Max, I am tired and I'm hungry and I can't find a mirror, but I am sensing a disturbance in my hair."
We have to go home!
But we have to go to Texas.
Randy needs me.
He's saying it on his Snapchat story.
Still on the movie set.
"Pretty lonely, so if anyone would respond to my Words With Friends request,"
"I promise to let you win, and if you're ever in Texas... why?"
See?
He's begging me to come there.
But we have no money to get to Texas.
Wrong.
I've got $11 in this one and $32 in this one.
Lefty's been holding back as per usual.
Both of you.
We don't want anyone injured.
Put down your weapons.
"Until the captain says otherwise, I give the orders on this bridge."
Go back to the ship.
You have to come with us.
Captain!
"Shh, it's all right."
Contact the captain.
Belay that.
"I gave you a direct order, Ensign."
"I'm sorry, Major."
"It's over, Major!"
Take him to his quarters.
"Aye, sir."
It's Commander Tucker.
Put him through.
Go ahead.
We've got the captain.
What's going on up there?
The bridge is secure.
Tell Phlox to get the Imaging Chamber ready.
We've got a patient for him.
"Acting Captain's Starlog, We've resumed our course for Azati Prime."
Major Hayes and his men have been temporarily relieved of duty.
Dr. Phlox believes he's found an explanation for the captain's behavior.
Where is he?
"In his quarters, resting."
Do you recall when the captain was attacked by one of the eggs?
It sprayed something in his face.
Mmm.
I thought it was a defense reflex.
I could show you around the country.
We'd always be together.
"If I could live here, I wouldn't have to rent the place in town."
You didn't sell yourself well as a prospective roommate.
- What do you mean?
- You should know!
Gerd is still looking for new ski instructors.
- I don't want to.
- Why not?
- I have enough to do.
- You could earn a lot more.
I earn just as much with the translations.
"""Forest Ranger's Love""..."
"""Hour of Desire."""
You'd be a great ski instructor.
But I don't want to.
Ridiculous!
- What?
- Your attitude.
You never try anything new.
- What'll I tell Gerd?
- What about?
- Your refusal.
Where did you get that idea anyway?
- I told him.
- What?
For your sake.
You'd earn twice as much.
"Thanks, but I'm grown up."
"Oh, yeah?"
Don't you ever want to achieve anything?
You can talk!
- You are the...?
- That's right.
I am the babysitter.
"Yes, yes."
Thank goodness that you've come.
My boy.
I don't know what's gotten into him.
I've never seen anything like it.
"Trust me, buddy, I've got three little ogres at home."
This will be a piece of cake.
Father.
Father!
"- OK, then."
"- Look, I'm telling you."
I've tried every trick in the book.
You see?
"""Once Upon A Time-Out""?"
"Oh, come on, now."
- You're gonna listen to a goose?
- Please.
You don't understand.
It's like he's two different people.
"What your kid needs is discipline, not a bunch of psychological mumbo jumbo."
"You just gotta walk in there, look him in the eye, and show him who's..."
Please tell me he's an only child.
Bubblegum fish pants...
Hello.
"Well, here's your problem."
His head's not screwed on right.
"When you wish upon a star, you get lots of stuff."
"Well, I wish for a nice, quiet evening where you go to sleep and I raid the icebox."
OK.
- I just— I gotta—
- What are you doing?
- Call you back.
- Excuse me.
"Moe, I apologize."
He just walked in here.
"I'm sorry for rushing in like this, but you were right."
"They tried to kill him like you said, but he got away."
Now he's runnin' through the woods.
He's like a scared animal.
He's scared to death.
That motherfucker should be scared.
His uncle got this case closed with one phone call.
"I'm sorry it took so long for me to come around, but you were right."
I couldn't see the truth.
"Like you said, the evidence, my loyalty, they were confusing."
They never give you any napkins in this place.
What am I supposed to use?
You want this?
What is this?
"You came to me, to my town... with all these speeches, talking about doing the right thing."
I'm doing the right thing.
What's goin' on?
What are you doing?
That was like two weeks ago.
Two weeks ago?
- What about Babitch?
- What about him?
Fuck him.
- What about Donlan?
- Fuck him too.
What about Joey Randone?
"Would Elisa roast it, just for me?"
If you catch one.
"Come, come here..."
Got you at last!
I caught it!
Help!
I'll show him yet!
"I'm only little, but I'm nifty, see."
"Jean, I discovered something awful!"
We'll write to daddy about your new tooth!
He'll be amazed at you.
When he comes back.
"My little turtle-dove, if it weren't for you..."
So that's the way it is!
That pigeon must be done away with!
Where am I?
What is this?
What have I done to deserve this?
A sword!
"You ugly bird, there..."
I'll get you yet!
Damned bird!
"We'll wring your neck, no more love-notes!"
"Good morning, Elisa."
"Hello, my little devil, have you seen my pigeon?"
"No, let's hope a fox didn't get it!"
Beast!
"I was frightened, where've you been?"
"Good morning, Elisa."
"Did you sleep well, Johann?"
"How else, under one roof with a lovely woman!"
For you I'd sleep on a bare rock!
"I'm telling you, Joe pulled a gun on Patsy."
"A guy like him, self-defense?"
Not a chance.
"- If you killed him, you're out of luck."
- But I didn't kill him.
You're okay.
Better dive in somewhere till you find out for sure.
You gotta get out of the state.
"Mike, find a hideout."
Quick.
For what?
You've got that much head start.
Keep in touch with the hospital.
"When he goes, you start going."
Laying down on me?
You gonna cover me?
Not if he passes out.
"He's living, I can cover you."
Newspapers won't print a word.
They won't look for you.
If he goes-
"- Patsy, I don't have to kid you."
"--you're all washed up, you're through."
"Listen, get across the state line."
Get in touch with Nasetti.
He'll help you find a safe place.
Go ahead.
Okay.
Take your hats off.
- What's the matter?
- I don't know.
Doesn't seem like Sunday without Patsy around.
"Head to the south, See what I can find."
"Yeah, copy that."
Didn't see once piece of gold In that hole.
Am I headed In the right direction?
You need to turn right.
Turn right.
Look where he is.
He's way out there.
He's on his own.
I don't know.
It's looking like.
"All the right materials, Nice heavy material,"
But there ain't Anything here.
Now I'm starting to get Worried.
I can't see over here.
100 miles East of nome.
At the bluff...
Shawn pomrenke's Pump motor has run out of gas.
"And within seconds, mr."
Gold Will be out of air.
Here he comes.
We ran out of gas.
Umbilical's All twisted up.
Oof.
Out of breath.
That was a lot Of hard work that time.
When Just doesn't go right.
"When things are breaking And there's no gold,"
It gets stressful.
"As soon as that pump died, I could tell the air pressure."
Was dropping And I was losing air.
It was off.
"Good, plenty of rocks around."
"Good morning, daddy!"
So the young 'uns are up already.
"A beautiful good morning, miller."
Good morning...
wait...my cap... wait!
"'Morning, master."
How do we go about it?
Only a couple of sacks...
"You'll manage those on your own, Furface."
Johann can clean the dung out of the goat-shed.
- Dung?
Me?
- Dung.
Such swarms of them!
"Our boys'll fight like lions, your Highness."
- They had tough training.
- Our boys'll be killed.
We're far outnumbered!
They'll beat us just with their turbans!
Where're you from?
"From far away, Bohemia."
Bavorov.
Really?
My wife comes from Netolice.
"That's quite close, across the wood."
D'you think we can make them run?
How dare you doubt our victory!
It looks like my tough training did no good.
I'll show you!
Lock him up!
You won't forget me in a hurry.
Why should my wife make dog food?
We haven't even got a dog!
"Now, look, I could be wrong."
Anybody can make a mistake.
"Well, you certainly are wrong."
I don't think I am.
"But if you want to make sure,"
I'll get Charlie.
He raises dogs.
-(chuckling):
Dog food.
-Charlie.
"Boy, jealousy, sometimes."
I'm telling you.
"Well, it'd better not be!"
"Yes, Mr. Peck?"
"Charlie, do you know what that is?"
I should know.
I've been using this for years.
It's dog food.
(grumbling)
(grumbling)
"You know, Alice, a French name would be cute for him."
"Well, I'll worry about a name for him after I get Ralph to agree to let me keep him."
"I told you, you're worrying over nothing."
"Once Ralph gets a look at that little face, he's got to fall in love with it."
"Well, I hope so."
"You know something, Trix,"
I never realized what wonderful company a little pup is around the house all day.
"You know, this day just flew by."
Sure.
"That reminds me, I gotta be getting back upstairs."
What?
I'm already married.
"No, you're not."
That was private.
It was a private conversation.
You had to buy the ring yourself in Woolworths.
"When times got hard, he tried to send you back to Wales, and he's disappointed in you?"
"He's a stupid bloody fool, but he's not as much of a fool as you."
"He changed your name, for Christ's sake!"
Where's your fucking self-respect?
How dare you?
You have no one.
You don't know.
- I know you deserve better.
- You?
You're the better?
Catrin-
- I-
- I--
I think-
"- Look, I think you're mustard."
And I think...
"you're a drunk, squalid bully."
Come and get out of the water.
- Hush!
You were speaking of Flight Lieutenant Lundbeck.
Ah.
You know he only did the film under orders.
"""They told me it would be good for Eagle Squadron recruitment, sir."""
"He's desperate to get back in the air, poor boy."
"- Tea, sir?"
- Thank you.
Edward.

GIRL:
"You're still going to Justin's thing tonight, right?"
Yeah.
I'll probably get there around 11:00.
Depends on how much wine Mr. and Mrs. Hiller drink at dinner tonight.
Can't believe you get paid 15 bucks an hour to sit on your ass all night.
"Well, occasionally the baby cries, and I have to go check on her."
"But, yeah, I, uh, pretty much just watch Netflix."
Whatever.
(chuckles)
"So let me ask you something, does this outfit look too trashy for tonight?"
"Well, on, like, a scale of from"
"Taylor to Miley, you're, um... you're at a Kardashian level of trashiness right now."
Which one?
Does it matter?
Ugh.
I'm gonna change.
(chuckles softly)
Text me when you're done.
Okay.

"For the traditional, parents flanking their graduate child."
- Don't they look proud?
- They do.
Very proud.
What is that?
It's pictures of Sookie's high school graduation.
What was your high school graduation like?
"It was dignified, as most French ceremonies are."
"Poetry was read, a string quartet played, a ballerina performed."
Drank Boone's Farm out of a bota bag and knocked a beach ball around?
I don't understand half of what you say.
That's why we work.
- Hello.
"- Hey, Lor, how you doing?"
Christopher.
I'm good.
I'm excited.
You should be.
It's a big day.
Did you get my present?
- What present?
- A basket.
You should've gotten it by now.
- Did a basket come for me?
- It came.
It was heavy.
"I felt a twinge, so I dropped it for health reasons."
It's probably still intact.
My cracked staff has just informed me of its arrival.
I'm going to find it.
I put it together myself.
- And it's all for me?
- Please.
"Rick, please, I didn't mean to start anything like this."
Please just let me hold you.
You need to sleep.
"Lil, I'll call you."
It'll be okay. lt will.
You wouldn't want to be a flower girl.
[Zoe] How would you know?
You're supposed to look like a robot who marches up the aisle dropping rose petals.
- What's wrong with that?
- l'm so glad you're not making this complete spectacle with this wedding.
"What if you have two flower girls, me and Jessie?"
Mom?
- Mom.
- lt's okay.
What's the matter?
Nothing. I'll tell you later.
"Mom, are you okay?"
[whispering] No.
"No, honey, I'm not, but I will be."
"Oh, Mom."
I'm okay.
"- [woman] Karen Sammler's here,"
"- Oh, great."
"Oh, uh, how you doing?"
[stammering] I want you to know how much I appreciate this.
- l'm not doing this for you.
- l didn't mean...
- lt's for my clients.
- Of course.
And I need something from you in return.

"When Cassie shows up, remember, all you have to do is believe."
And don't limit yourself to what you can see.
You know?
"I mean, we can't see the air."
- Hmm.
- Does that make the air less fucking real?
No.
- What page?
- 16.
"Jesus Christ, you're a slow reader."
Yeah.
"Oh, here we go."
"[Cassie] Oh, hey, ""kiss and run."""
"P.S., uh, I lied, those were my balls."
You're welcome.
Hello.
- [groans] - [chuckles]
"Uh, look um, fuck it."
I'm not gonna apologize for kissing you.
"I did what I did, and..."
that's that.
So.
[inhales] Yep.
- [sighs] - [chuckles]
"Ahh, well, that's way too long of a pause."
"I've overplayed my hand, haven't I?"
"Look, despite almost losing a tooth on impact, the kiss was nice."
You running away was fucking weird.
"Yeah, I think I used up, uh, all my adrenaline on the kiss, and I...had to hide in the men's room until closing to recharge."
[both laughing]

Might as well do it on your watch.
Grey's Anatomy Season 5 Episode 12 Sympathy for the Devil
Why do you have to live in Meredith's attic?
How am I supposed to sneak out of here with that frat party going on downstairs?
Don't you kids ever sleep?
They're cleaning the house for dr.
Shepherd's mother.
Mrs. Shepherd is coming?
- To Seattle?
- So?
"So that woman practically raised me, taught me right from wrong, and if she found out that I was..."
"With you, that we were..."
You're Meredith Grey's little sister.
You are forbidden fruit.
You are 25.
- You're a fetus.
- 24.
I skipped third grade.
I feel dirty.
10 bucks that she tanks in the first 5 minutes.
I have faith in Death.
She'll make a good impression.
She's holding that bottle of tequila like it's a life vest.
"Mer, don't listen to them."
- She's gonna love you.
- No.
Mothers don't love me.
Mothers like bright and bubbly and happy and...
Izzie.
Mothers love Izzie.
They do.
"Stop, stop, stop, stop!"
"Stop, stop, stop!"
"Stop, stop, stop, stop!"
"No, don't, don't!"
Don't!
Don't!
Stop!
Stop!
No!
"Oh, fuck."
That was one second.
Either he's super susceptible to this or the software is way too powerful still.
It's jumped from zero to 18K in five milliseconds...
I'm sorry.
"The experience was more powerful than intended, Mr. Cooper."
I hope you can forgive us.
...allluggageunderthe seat in front of you.
All electronic devices should now be turned off and stowed as they may interfere with the aircraft's navigational and communication...
Mum?
Mum?
I have to call him.
Mum?
Why did Cooper go?
- I...
"- Mom, I'm right here."
I'm...
"- I'm right here, Mum."
- I have to call Cooper.
I have to call and make sure that he's safe.
I have to call him.
I have to call him.
I have to call him.
- Go ahead.
- Short and sweet.
"I want half the money, or i'll have you arrested, and might even do it on the air, live."
- Imagine the ratings.
"- I'd like to see you try, asshole."
- You're gonna see me.
"- I'll kill you, I swear to God!"
- I'm gonna kill you!
- You treacherous little bitch!
You got one week to get your shit together.
- You listening?
I want the money.
- [Door Slams]
Okay.
Okay.
"Okay, let's do a little math."
"You want 20 percent, Dale wants half a million, and Dick wants half of everything."
"I don't have a calculator, but it seems I'm in debt again!"
Dale's money comes out of your share.
He's your friend.
- Not my friend.
He's his friend.
- I hardly know the man.
Who cares?
It's all fucking moot now.
The only thing that's moot to me is the Dick Simmons issue.
"You get a toothache, you pull the tooth."
What does that mean?
- Let's kill the son of a bitch.
"- Oh, God!"
- [Crystal] Yes!
- No!
So... are we good?
So-
(SIGHS) He basically knows.
He doesn't know jack shit.
FINN:
"Well, he knows that you have some kind of information."
How long is he going to be content just piggybacking your bets?
I don't know.
Forever?
I got it under control.
"You look like hell, Jasper."
Are you even sleeping?
"You know what, man?"
Get off my dick!
You and Callie both get all this money for doing nothing.
- You should be happy.
- We're all in this.
Callie and I are sharing the risk.
I hope you have a back-up plan in case this thing with your bookie falls through.
I seem to remember you wearing something a little different in tonight's photo.
"Screw you, Jasper."
I'm not going to start as long as he's here.
"Yeah, no, Jasper was just about to take a walk."
Aren't you?
I am?
Yeah.
"Yes, don't forget to come spy on me at 8:00."
(DOOR CLOSES) (SIGHS)
So I don't really know what I'm doing here.
You're going to have to walk me through it.
Sure.
"Um, we just need to get you in the same pose in the photo."
The sooner the better.
Oh.
I'll have him sent down here.
SKEETS:
"Yes, Mrs. Brendan?"
"Skeets, would you have Wilbur Hoolick sent to my office, please?"
Wilbur will be delighted to see you.
He'll be surprised to see me.
Gee!
"""Majuba diamond murderer."
"Police baffled."""
(MAN WHISTLING)
Wilbur's the killer!
"Boy, these straight razors sure do the job, boy."
"You know somethin', Mike?"
I want to thank you.
"You've been very, very helpful to me, and believe me when I tell you, I ain't gonna forget you."
You won't?
No.
"(STUTTERING) Well, I mean, I'd just as soon you would."
"What do you mean, pal?"
"We've been buddies, we're friends."
What do you mean forget you?
"And the gang back home, they'll love you."
But I'm too young to be with a gang.
"Yeah, maybe you're right, kid."
"Yeah, well, maybe we'll give you a few years."
"Wait, Willy."
Wait just a minute!
I won't tell on you.
Please!
"Please, don't kill me!"
"I grabbed him by the lapels, I said,"
"""This is it."
Your time.
Bucky time.
"Go get her."""
He looked so cool walking over to her.
So brave.
[ Breathes deeply ]
She looked up and saw him and smiled.
♪♪
They were so fast.
[ Whispers ] Jocks always are.
♪♪
It was a half a second before Bucky's pants hit the ground.
- [ Fabric drops ]
- He just froze...
- [ Laughter ] - ...standing there in his little white undies.
The laughs were deafening.
"He turned to me, his eyes pleading for help, trembling..."
I did nothing!
"- I couldn't even get out ""Bucky!"" - [ Gasps ]"
"He turned around and ran, his pants still at his ankles, until he was out the door."
And I never saw him again.
"Until Monday at school, when I saw him again."
But he was different.
He would never be the same.
The Bucky I knew was dead.
And now it's happening all over again.
Not if we stop it.
"I was excited about my prom, too."
I had the cutest vintage YSL jumpsuit.
"And when I got there, the nuns got all weird because my date was a 28-year-old Wall Street banker."
I'm sorry.
No need to be sorry.
It's my fault.
I knew this day would come.
I thought I'd be okay.
"But in reality, I can't take it."
I am sorry too.
I am so sorry.
I didn't mean to leave you hanging.
"But there comes a time when we have to choose, right?"
And I just didn't choose work like you did.
Can I ask you to do one thing for me?
"Even if there's no work, call me sometime."
I'll call for sure.
"As soon as I give birth, you'll be the first person I call."
Oh shit.
I can't.
I have to call my dad.
Then I will call you 2nd.
You go do whatever you want to do then.
That photo I have lots of pimples.
Erase them for me.
No hurry.
Your deadline is 2 days.
Beyotch.
Make my boobs a little bigger too.
- Is this man the best you can do?
- When did I have time?
I'm always with you.
Surprise proposal clip of Je and Shane.
Wait.
"You have moment like this too, Je?"
"You look stunning, today"
Today you're really beautiful
"What's with the ""today-today""?"
She always thinks she's beautiful
Cheeky!
That's a lovely wrap!
You're being sarcastic
You bought it at Mitsukoshi?
"No, is it too earthy?"
Earthy?
You don't feel it is?
How old are you?
Old enough
"Terrible, terrible"
What's so funny?
Isn't that it?
Perhaps you're right
Getting a lot of lines recently
Grows older?
You don't have to spell it out
"Only when laughing, though"
I've tried it in front of the mirror
"See, no lines that time?"
Isn't there?

Cheeky!
Gotta give it up

You'd better leave
Can you solve this?
What?
Because this property is sold.
And any trespasser will be executed.
You get that baby.
Yes.
Excuse me Vishal.
But our film's just begun.
Oh!
Let the film's begun... then the hero's got to hold the heroine's hand.
Leave my hand Vishal.
Oh so sweet.
Or else?
Move.
Move.
Move.
I hit him.
Watch out.
Shiv are you okay?
Ankita this is a big problem.
The real problem will start when brother finds out.
Come on.
Come on keep walking.
Why bring us here sir?
I tried explaining nicely but you wouldn't listen.
If you go against Minister Pradhan and... roam around like a big oaf you'll be put down like a dog.
There's just one way to save yourselves.
Kill me and escape.
Don't try to run from death.
People have a wrong notion about death.
Its life that makes you suffer.
Garbage cleared.
My record's also cleared.
Mr. Pradhan your job's done.
Yes!
Ha ha!
Ooh!
I might have overcooked that.
Ha!
This is amazing!

Track days are such big business that there are lots of companies making cars designed for the purpose - racers with indicators so they can go on roads.
This Palmer Jag is one of them.
"It costs £47,000, and that's a lot."
"Don't worry - there are lots of others, which are cheaper."

Meeting...?
Is your meeting more important than your daughter's marriage?
Cancel that silly meeting.
Keep quiet.
You remember half  forget half.
Ministers meeting...?
"As said, fix the engagement in 2 days time."
Thank you.
Find out when was the Ministers meeting in Malaysia finalised.
Oh God!
My bladder is full.
Hey Halwa...
I can't take this tension.
I don't know how you will behave.
Tell me your next plan.
I'm planning to surrender.
Don't be tensed.
I am not selfish.
I give charity to everyone.
"Once I surrender, I will tell them your name too."
Even you will find some kick.
I'll be back soon.
- What should I do now?
- Run.
You...
You heard me right.
I said that.
Buy the ticket  run away before they lynch you.
You must know why we got separated.
I won't listen to you.
This is very important.
"Guys pulling out, that's how I ended up with a kid in the first place."
"All right, fine."
I'll do it.
But it's not fair.
You asked me in the middle of sex.
"I was like: ""Uh, uh, uh, uh..."
"fine, I'll take him to Dave  Buster's."""
"Okay guys, quick announcement."
"It's a new year and I wanted to spice things up a little bit, so I decided to dye my hair red and then I chickened out."
Thank God.
Because red hair is the worst.
"However, I did convince Candace to do it."
Yeah!
I love it.
No.
I love it.
It's so good.
It's like a...
like a nice warm bowl of tomato soup.
"If I had a grilled cheese, I would just dunk it on your head."
No I love it.
Like your whole head's on fire.
"I love you, fire-head."
Yeah.
"All right, Brett, I'm going to kill you."
- What do you have against red hair?
- I love redheads.
"When you sleep with them, it's like putting a fire out with your penis."
Just look.
The first time my dad cheated on my mom he was
- dressed as Ronald McDonald.
- What?
Whatever.
We're probably gonna get arrested.
What do you want me to put?
Like how I said it.
"""I'll poop in your butt hole... and then you will poop it back... into my butt... and we will keep doing it""-"
- Back-
- Back-
- And forth-
- And forth-
With the same poop.
Same poop.
Forever.
"Wow, look at these beds!"
You don't have to make the beds.
I'll make 'em when I get home from work.
Where'd you learn to make corners like that?
It's just the way we like it.
Really?
"I thought you preferred the rumpled, unkempt look."
- We like it this way now.
- Yeah.
"At Mom's house, we have a chore wheel."
- What?
- Nothing.
A chore wheel.
"You put chores on it, and then you can spin it."
There's this metal thing... and it helps it to spin.
It's spinning from the metal.
Okay.
"Well- So, it's just a half shift."
"I'll be back in four hours, and we'll go do something fun, okay?"
Okay.
I won it last night at his casino.
You owed him this much money?
- Double it.
- Harry!
- Don't start with me.
- You need to get a grip on this.
How does a man who spends all his time fighting the bad guys get into so much trouble with his own side?
Hmm?
"- Thank you, Rich."
- Pleasure.
Here.
"Look, um..."
There's something else.
What?
Will you have a look at this?
"(LAUGHS) I didn't take you as the bangle type, Harry, but then jewelry creeps up on the best of us."
- Where did you get this?
- It's hard to explain.
A woman?
- You dark horse!
Take it off.
- I can't.
"- Well, let me try."
- I've tried.
It won't come off.
"Well, how did you get it on in the first place?"
- I haven't a baldy.
"- Wow, that must have been some night."
Right...
- I have no idea what this is.
- Really?
Or where it comes from or how old it is.
It doesn't come up that often.
Maybe it's the neighborhood.
T om.
-Larry.
-Wow.
"Well, it's not the battery."
"In the morning, I'll check the fuel line for you, the alternator, the pump."
"You know, it could be your plugs are worn down."
I'll replace them for you in the morning.
"In the meantime, uh... could I give you a ride home?"
"Um, no, I can walk."
"So, what do you think?"
Can you help him?
I'd much rather do something for you.
"Well, what could you do for me?"
"Well, it seems like you've forgotten just about everything."
"Well, I remember the basics..."
but it's...
I'm not concerned about myself.
It's Frank I'm worried about.
"You know, it's just not that important to me anymore."
Poor man.
Look at that woman.
"Oh, my God."
Her top is so low.
And her skirt is so high.
That is bad.
It is.
"It's very, very bad."
"Are you, uh... what I think you are?"
"Well, I'm not the public health nurse."
Would you...
Are you crazy ?
It's Jimmy Cooper's flare gun.
I found it in the hall closet when I was looking for rain gear.
"Yeah, but it's not raining."
"Well, this was last November."
What ?
"Jimmy doesn't need it anymore, and it's cold, and it's shiny, and it feels so good in my..."
Here.
You try it.
Eww !
I'm not touching your pistol.
That is stupid and dangerous.
"Oh, my God."
Go 187 on that zombie ass.
It's in the kitchen.
Follow me.
Stop or I'll shoot !
"Oh, my God !"
I've been hit !
Mom ?
Taylor... you shot me !
sorry
I came here because I was worried about you.
"I know, Mom, and it really means a lot to me that you did."
"Save it... that's the last maternal instinct I'll ever have, since you shot me."
It was just a toe nick.
You're totally fine.
Until sandal season !
"Taylor, I'm going to have to see a plastic surgeon right away."
"I already told you, there's no way to get you to the hospital."
You're just going to have to tough it out !
Pancakes is hurt !
"But the box was to be opened only if the Faction System broke down, which is why it requires someone like you to open it."
You are living proof that the Divergent problem has grown beyond all control.
Do you even hear what you're saying right now?
No one thinks it's your fault that you were born this way.
"Jeanine murdered an entire faction, Caleb."
That faction could no longer be trusted.
She killed our parents.
Our parents brought that on themselves.
What are you talking about?
The box?
It was in their house.
They were the ones hiding it.
All of those lives could have been spared.
Seems we didn't know our parents as well as we thought we did.
(DOOR OPENS)
All right.
Family reunion's over.
It's time to go.
"I got a little surprise for you, Tris."
TRIS:
Four?
Tris!
- Tris!
Tris!
-Four!
Four!
- Tris!
-Four!
Four!
Stop!
Four!
Foufl
"Yes, I am."
- No.
"Dr Brandon is his physician, but he's on vacation."
I've treated him in the interim.
- Look.
His name's on the prescription.
- I didn't know.
- Did you prescribe those for Saul?
"- Yes, I did."
- Does he need them?
- They're nitroglycerine tablets - only to be taken in case of a heart attack.
Has Mr Greenberg suffered a seizure?
- Ruben?
"- Yeah, I'm back."
- How is he?
- He's still out.
His heart seems steadier though.
You have any problems?
"No, I left the ambulance in a dirt road off the jungle in Koko Head."
"But coming back, a coastguard cutter was dropping black flags in the water."
- It must be some kind of a warning.
"- Yeah, maybe to keep us in."
Don't worry.
"We'll get out of here tomorrow, no matter what."
- And the woman?
- We'll get her too.
- Give him an injection!
- What about his heart?
The hell with his heart!
inject him!
Hello.
He tried to escape.
I think someone took my wallet.
You heard Ed.
I gotta get some sleep.
So-
"Come on, Jerry."
Give him a six.
Yes!
Look at that.
He listens.
"You are the man, Jerry!"
Oh!
I'm winning more money.
I'm winning more money!
All right.
"Keep it comin', Jerry, 'cause I'm in the zone and you are en fuego."
I've never seen anything like it.
We've switched tables on him.
We've switched decks.
We even switched chips.
The man keeps dealing winners.
How much has he cost us?
"This guy is up 300,000."
Are you sure the dealer isn't cheating?
Maybe he's signaling the player.
We did a complete analysis.
It's just one of those streaks.
"Well, if he continues on one of those streaks, doesn't it make sense to put him where he's gonna cause the least amount of damage?"
"Yes, Miss Mancuso, it does."
"The people here, do they think about making sense?"
"We try to, Miss Mancuso."
And what's with the Miss Mancuso routine?
I thought you told me that's what you wanted me to call you.
"- I love you too, sweetie."
What's up...?
I literally just walked in the door.
What did I do?
You missed her talent show.
"No, I didn't miss it."
"That's, like, next Thursday."
"No, it was last Thursday."
It was on the school calendar.
What did she do?
She was a flag twirler.
That's a talent?
"She practised for like six weeks, John."
She thought you were gonna be there.
It would've been really nice to have a bit of a reminder.
"- Come on, I'm not your secretary, John."
- I'm not asking you to be my secretary.
"Look, I'm just-"
- I'm trying.
I'm trying really hard to be in her life.
"It's a little late for that, wouldn't you say?"
Have a good day.
Are you mad at me?
Just tell me.
Will you be on that all day long?
"""Yes."" Well, that sucks, because, you know, I thought you would want this, but..."
- Lame.
You don't even know what it is.
Do you really think a bribe's gonna work?
Yeah.
I'm hoping so.
"- We're both adults here, John."
"♪ Weaving the good life for you, sugar ♪"
♪ In every way ♪
[sighs]
"So, what can I do for you?"
"Well, I really need to talk to Topher in person."
- I called a bunch of times.
- Yeah.
He didn't know what it was about.
The hotel.
We had a deal.
- Did you?
- Yeah.
I got the good people of Venice to support the hotel development.
You remember.
"Come on, man."
You were there.
"And in exchange, Topher was gonna... well, I think I was gonna get a house."
[chuckles] A house?
Topher promised you a house?
"Well, not in so-- I know that that's what he meant."
"Look, all you did was... placate a community pressure group."
It was just PR.
[faint chiming]
You know what?
Why don't we just call it an even ten thou and we won't darken each other's doors again?
That's not gonna happen.
"Hey, I went to bat for you guys."
Okay?
I betrayed--
I upset a lot of good people who trusted me.
It's not right to do that and get nothing in return.
You owe me.
"- Oh, you're one of Stoney's boys?"
"- Uh, no."
You staff or intern?
Actually I'm a representative.
Reginald Webster of Delaware.
"Oh, fuck me."
"I'm sorry, Webster."
What can I do for you?
- I'm running late.
- I was hoping I could grab your attention for a second.
- What's the skinny?
"- Well, uh..."
"- I'm late, Mr. Webster."
- I understand a chair's opened up in the committee... and I'd like to put my name forward.
I believe you'll find me industrious and hardworking.
The Judiciary's for senior members.
Wheeling was in for five terms before we let him in.
My hands are tied.
There's nothing I can do.
"Shelly, I've been trying to reach you for five days."
- I left you 32 messages.
"- Well, leave me a 33rd."
- Where you from?
- Delaware.
"Oh, yeah, you were..."
You knocked Emory Bettis out.
Emory used to be in the Thursday night game.
He was always good for a few hundred bucks.
I guess he ran his campaign like he played poker.
I take it you have a predisposition.
"- About the confirmation, I mean."
- No.
Are you sure about this?
If the bag is   so give it to Marie.
Okay.
- Do you want him to die?
- Who are you?
Lisa's boyfriend.
It is our son.
Why do you help him?
- We must first know what has happened.
- At the expense of his life?
We only need new identities.
Give us a chance.
Murderers must serve their sentences.
Armed men entered the apartment.
Frank defended us.
"If he is innocent, He has nothing to be afraid of."
"Treats In all, working for the police, how?"
Have you wondered why we live under a death threat?
Answer me!
Is it our fault?
He works for you!
It is your responsibility!
Move!
Guess who I just saw.
Half a million on two legs.
A friend at Kungsgatan have seen Wagner.
He is heading for North Stan.
See now picking up speed.
- Wagner are Kungsportsplatsen.
- We must not let him get away from us.
Others are looking for the reward.
Two shots to the head should be enough.
Eden of the East.
Hirasawa-san... users always complain about the system being down.
Don't let it get to you.
sweat and snot!
Leave the snot out!
what do we do now that we can't help Takkun?
I have a suggestion! why don't we change our HQ's location?
To where?
I set up our room at the university as a fallback.
The old Eden System is still in there.
that settles it.
What better place to save Vintage's butt.
Agreed.
It's from Saki!
I'm heading to the airport now.
Takizawa-kun is returning to Japan.
What the heck?
I'm afraid your journey ends here.
Hey...
What's this mean?
No. 01's launching a missile?
I need to know No. 01's target.
launch the remaining missiles.
Request accepted.
Noblesse oblige.
I pray that your plan to destroy and rebuild leaves you as our strongest savior.
Now I'm gone?
Juiz.
Juiz?
Did Mononobe-san manage to locate Juiz and launch missiles at her?
my request is still being carried out too.
Mononobe-san.
And since when ?
"Well, here's the kicker."
She disappeared 5 years ago.
5 years ?
Jesus-Christ !
"My brother went missing, too."
When he was 5 years old and... we've never seen him again.
It's hard on those that left behind.
you know.
"You've been missing for a really long time, Gemma."
Where have you been ?
Were you with someone ?
Did someone take you?
Were you hold against your will ?
You can tell me.
Nothing bad is gonna happen to you.
We'll do everything we can to help you.
Were you held?
Can you tell me where you've been?
Not just me.
I'm not the only one.
There are more.
More?
I mean how many?
What are we supposed to do about that?
Tread carefully.
The last thing we want to do is to freak her out.
We'll do just one piece of information at a time.
"No, this is massive."
You know maybe Pru was right.
Maybe we need to get the cops in on this.
"- Tell Danny, at least."
Are you all right?
Who did it?
This guy who lives across the street from me that I've known all my life.
He started to touch me.
He started to grab me... I told him to stop.
He didn't stop.
I hit him back.
And then he got really angry.
He pushed me out of the car.
You sure you're all right?
Huh?
Why don't you go inside and get yourself together.
Clean up.
"What do you want, fucko?"
"You want some, huh?"
"I swear on my fuckin' mother, if you touch her again, you're dead."
Don't shoot.
Hide this.
Are you all right?
Are you all right?
"I know there are women, like my best friends who would have gotten out of there the minute their boyfriend gave them a gun to hide."
But I didn't.
I got to admit the truth:
It turned me on.
Mazel tov!
Why don't you be like your friend Henry?
He's got a nice girl.
He's settling down now.
He's married.
Pretty soon he'll have a nice family.
And you're still bouncing around from girl to girl.
It was like he had two families.
You'll have to kill him.
Get my diamond before killing him.
I want that diamond at any cost.
Don't worry Bhai.
Have some opium and go to sleep.
I'm hearing a name that scary for the 1st time.
"Time is not good, let's go to the village."
We are in the village.
"Let's go to the city, Car is here."
I will kill him slowly.
Make a bomb.
Which blows.
"Laxminarayan will come, but he won't go back."
Listen to me carefully.
I've seen an old car on the internet.
"How is it, Sir?"
I want to buy this car.
Leave for Pondi now.
Check the car and give 1 lac as advance.
I will mail you the details.
"Which mail, Sir?"
"Sir, Today's Zapack mail comes very quick."
Fool.
I'll fax you from the computer turn on the fax machine.
"There are two fax machines here, which one, Sir."
Left or right?
Left.
Your left or my left?
My left.
"Which position are you in, Sir?"
Can't see on the phone.
This is your last chance.
-But it's a scientist.
-And what's his name?
-Doctor Yansky.
Hallo.
This is attendant Zero.
Doctor Yansky come to the exit of the reservation.
I repeat.
"This is attendant zero, barrier 173."
Doctor Yansky come to the exit of the reservation.
You caused this.
What a mission!
-You are an interplanetary bungler.
-Let it go.
"Look, everybody drives, but we are going on foot."
This way we will never look like people.
-And would you like it?
"-Well... they are better, prettier."
Look at me.
Never in my life have I looked better.
"In contrast to it, out there at home, how do we look?"
It's better not to speak about it!
The ridiculous antennae.
Horror!
"I'm telling you, I'm considering whether or not to stay like this."
All right.
Normally we look hideous.
That's a fact.
On the other hand we can travel where we want.
Yoohoo!
Come for a ride!
All over space.
And that's a fact too.
I told you Mario's a ciaparatt!
"Daddy, what's that mean?"
"""Rat catcher"", good fornothing."
- What are you doing forus?
- It's nobody's fault.
We're not going to Grandma and Grandpa's in milan?
"You'II go the American school anyway, yourmotherwiII take you, if it were up to yourfather..."
"Then university in milan, you'II become a lawyer, get married and buy a house in milan's biggest square!"
- Or stay here and marry Pina.
- Who's she?
"The daughter of the pizza maker at ""The Reef""."
She's not bad looking.

Fish sticks!
"Fish sticks, again."
- What's Pina like?
- A monster.
Are you crazy?
Did they see you come in?
"We work at the Post Office, not the CIA!"
"- Quiet, I'm running a huge risk!"
- What?
I've been busting my ass in hicksville for15 years.
Don't shout orwe're screwed!
"help me, orSiIvia won't talk to me anymore."
There's another opening in milan.
In a month the manager in Via valparaiso is retiring.
- I have to get thatjob.

- There.
"- There, what?"
Is it him?
Blair Waldorf just got a text.
It's like watching lady gaga set fire to a piano!
Who's it from?
Serena.
"Apparently, Jenny Humphrey is claiming squatter's rights"
On her old room.
It's disgusting.
"Oh, my God."
Jenny can't do that to Serena van Der Woodsen.
So what's the plan of attack?
It's between Serena and Jenny.
"Anyway, I've had some recent bad luck"
Getting involved in real estate disputes.
So I was thinking Warren-Tricomi mani/pedis?
I told you.
It doesn't matter if she transfers.
Blair Waldorf was over
The minute she became a student at N.Y.U.
Are you third personing me?
"I third person people, not you!"
Exactly.
"You're Blair Waldorf- fashion icon, queen b."
And probably the future President of the United States.
Or Chanel.
Jenny Humphrey just kicked Serena van Der Woodsen
"Out of her room, and you're not gonna do anything?"
I would.
I just don't have any dirt on Jenny right now.
Ahem.
I do.
Jenny and her boyfriend sold my boyfriend Adderall
A couple of months ago.
"Marcus Zerbib, you know him?"
He wasn't a friend.
You two were in business.
Some nasty gossips say he snitched on you 4 years ago.
The guys he snitched on would fill the phone book.
"But only you could gun him down in cold blood, during a leave from jail."
Would I waste him when I have 2 weeks left to do?
"What's wrong, Leo?"
"- Nothing, why?"
- Don't kid me.
"You're lost, I can tell."
"I'm in deep shit, and I can't discuss it."
Not even with me?
Not even with you.
- Where were you that night?
- With a cop.
HQ's finest cop.
"We met at ""Swann's"""
"at 1 AM, we chewed the fat till 5 AM, then he dropped me at my hotel."
OK?
His name?
Vrinks.
I'll need your boys.
What for?
We located the van gang.
How'd you get the tip?
Know a man called Silien?
Why?
Says he was with you when Zerbib died.
"If he says so, must be true."
Could I have that in writing?
Investigating murders now?
- Yeah.
- The end.
And the last.
- Anyone wanna talk about auditioning?
"- Oh, God."
"Oh, yeah."
"Remember, there was that huge to-do about my hair and my makeup and all that stuff on my last audition."
"Remember, Pete?"
Remem...?
Somebody went...
Did you go shopping for clothes?
- I went shopping for clothes.
- You brought options.
- I bought 800...
- That was the first time we met.
- That's right.
- We read together.
"Pete and Kerry Kohansky gave me pointers and really helped me out, you know."
Was this something I shouldn't talk about?
Never mind.
- That was all a lie.
- We should talk about...
Let's rewind and...
"Wait, seriously, should we go redo that?"
"No, it's okay."
"Oh, shit."
"Should we talk about that today is September 24th, 2008?"
- It's one week till the premiere.
- What's today?
"One week from the premiere, today."
- We have one week till the premiere.
- That's exciting.
-Yeah!
Are you just gonna let him shove you like that?
Come on.
Come on.
Ow!
"Jesse I just don't want to make the same mistake I've made in the past, so"
I just want to come right out and say it.
I'm Hannah Montana.
Eh?
"[Mimicking Jesse] Whoa dude, stop, you're blowing my mind!"
"I mean, you're Hannah, you're Miley, you're Hannah."
Who am I dating?
You're tearing me apart.
Will you stop?
Will you?
Why are we even rehearsing this?
I mean you've told the secret enough times.
I'm surprised the pizza delivery guy doesn't know.
Mmm-hmm.
"""Who ordered the meat lovers special?"" ""I did and I'm Hannah Montana!"""
Oh stop sulking.
You've been mad ever since I told Siena about the secret.
She didn't know who Lola was!
Get over it!
All right look at me!
I wear Day-Glo wigs.
I dress like a Japanese cartoon character.
How can she not know who Lola is?
Come on she's dating Jackson.
She's one drumstick short of a jumbo bucket.
Now can we get back to the person with the real problem?
[Gasps] Lola's real to me.
She ain't bad.
"Yeah, she's the chick, all right, but she don't wanna do it."
"Well, shit, I'll go somewhere else."
"Now, now, wait a minute."
"If we discipline her a little, she'll be glad to do it."
"You'd like to watch that, wouldn't you?"
- Yeah.
- No!
[Whimpering]
[Laughing]
"Eh, can I, uh... yeah, but it's gonna cost you extra."
"Yeah, all right."
Go get your toy.
"No, ah!"
[Whimpering]
No... no!
"No, no."
[Gasping]
"No, no."
"Oh, please!"
[Screaming]
Do you have to get up early?
"I'm supposed to have the day off, but, uh, you never can tell."
What's your day like?
"So far, so good."
"Yes, Al, we're ready on the floor."
Twenty seconds to air.
"Mic up, over there."
"Sit down, here we go, in ten..."
"Five, four, three, two... good morning, I'm rodger grimsby."
"Here now, the news."
"Early today, the grisly remains of a reputed meat mobster, gino pontivini, were found on the floor of a warehouse in the South Bronx, beneath a huge meat grinding machine."
It sort of wobbled as well.
They'd come in their triangle car.
"HUMS ""Roobarb"" THEME"
You have had a reputation as what I would call a party animal.
Is that fair?
"I do like a party, yeah."
Who doesn't?
"I've seen you photographed out and about on the Camden scene, staying up beyond midnight."
Is this true?
Ten past one.
That's my record.
Don't you feel terrible the next day?
Yeah.
You mean the day after the next day.
The next day you're still up.
CHEERING You feel good the next day.
"Well, what...what would a typical evening involve if I came along with you?"
"If I rang and said, ""Noel..."" You pick it up by mistake."
"""It's Rob."
Hi.
You came on my show.
"""You said we could go out to Camden together."
It's half six now.
Em...
"""I've left it a bit late."
I've just had my dinner.
"""Where shall we meet?"" Where would we meet?"
I don't know...
LAUGHTER
In a forest.
I'd send someone out for you.
Now your new show is even weirder than the Boosh.
"Well, you sirs show no patriotism."
Fine english fabrics!
"Fine english fabrics, Mr Biberkopf!"
I'd rather hope so!
I could never fool myself.
Stop tickling me!
I'll have someone pick my rags up later.
Mieze!
Look!
Be astonished!
- You look very fine!
- Look at me!
Clothes make the man!
- Now it's your turn!
- No no no!
Oh come on!
"Business is going well so we can afford decent clothes, can't we?"
- You'll get your money!
Goodbye.
- I hope so.
Goodbye Mr Biberkopf.
2 bottles of sparkling wine!
Where is the party?
- Knew it!
"- Just some ""celebrities""."
"No, I already told you I won't come along."
I'm not dressed accordingly.
It's your choice.
"Guys like us, looking fine."
I'm not gonna let Franz walk all over me.
"Just watch out for him, he might cause trouble for us with his money-spending habit"
He's an amateur!
May I help you?
I'd like to see the inmate Benigno Martin.
"This isn't a visitor's day, but let me see."
"I'm sorry, I can't hear you."
I'm sorry.
This isn't a visitor's day.
"and what's more, the intern hasn't requested a visit."
He doesn't know I'm in Madrid.
I arrived yesterday.
Are you a relative?
"No, I'm a friend."
My name is Marco Zuloaga.
"- May I see your ID, please?"
"- Yes, of course."
Can I phone him?
"You can't phone him, but he can phone you."
My number's changed.
Can you give him the new one?
- Of course.
- Thank you.
Great.
You should remember that visitor's days are Saturday and Sunday.
But it's the intern who has to request the visit.
"If he doesn't want to see you, we can't do anything."
He'll want to see me.
"By the way, we don't have inmates here, we have..."
I can't hear you.
I'm sorry.
"We don't have inmates here, we have interns."
"Good-bye, and thank you."
- 627...
- Wait.
"Yeah, tell me about it."
That's my wife Olivia.
"Awesome, bone structure."
- She's lovely.
- Glad you think so.
We were hoping you'd join us for a drink back at our place.
"And your wife, is she okay with that?"
"My wife is an Erinys, a Fury."
I wouldn't flirt if she didn't give me say so.
"In fact, you're her choice, and I wholeheartedly agree."
Yeah.
Yeah.
I don't know.
"Girl, are you a Succubus or a succu-bust?"
A rebound screw is the greatest way to get over a guy.
-It's just science.
- I told you.
I never cared that much about Dyson anyway.
My place.
Let's go.
It's coming ...
We're gonna need a safe word.
Gold star for Kenzi.
Rebound sex was exactly what I needed.
Why do you look like you're not at all sharing this monster hangover?
What can I say?
"For me, sexual healing is a literal thing."
I hate you.
And there's no strings attached.
- That was the best idea you ever had.
- You're very welcome.
And you're back.
I'll read it to you.
"""Dear Karen, just a note to thank you for your cooperation"""
"""in helping to keep Bob here."""
"""I don't know what the school would do without him,"""
"""or for that matter, what I would do without him."""
"""I will return the favor someday."""
"""Gobs of love, Gretchen."""
"Why, that dirty double-crosser."
What did I tell you?
I'd do anything to help Bob go overseas.
So would I.
"Oh, I mean, I would like to help him out, too, 'cause he's a very nice fellow."
I have an idea.
"Look, how would it be if you and I wrote another letter to Colonel Blair's wife, and in that letter..."
"No, but we would change all the words our way."
No.
How would it...
"Oh, I know."
We'll have Gretchen phone Colonel Blair's wife.
"Say, that's great."
"Oh, wait a minute."
Gretchen would never do that.
And I have a sneaking suspicion that's exactly what she's going to do.
Here.
Huh?
Dormitory.
Okay.
Hello?
WOMAN:
"The time, please."
The time?
The time is exactly 7:57.
Congratulations!
She's a great...
Yes.
I've heard so much about you.
- Likewise about you.

"Had I known you were this good-looking,"
I'd have answered the ad for myself.
Congratulations.
She's the best.

Congratulations.
I'm sure you'll both be very fascinating to watch.
"Rose, isn't it amazing how many books you accumulate over the years?"
- I know what you mean.
- I can't believe it.
And the dust!
This place needs a good cleaning.
We'll take care of that.
I made room for your books.
Need any help?
Everything's put in its place.
- What would you like to do?
- Go to bed.
To sleep...
"In order to sleep, you go to the bed for sleeping."
- Unless you want to do something else.
- What?
I wasn't going to say anything.
Do you want the bathroom first?
"- No, I can wait."
"- No, you go."
Like you give a fuck.
- You never even asked me why.
- Because I don't care.
Think you're the only one who's ever screwed up?
"Well, boo-hoo-hoo, Tommy."
"Life sometimes sucks and that's that, but not all of us have so much self-pity we need to kill ourselves."
How the fuck would you know?
With your head stuck up your arse all day!
How the fuck would I know?
"'Cause I'm standing on a bridge in the middle of fuck knows where, covered in cow shit, fighting a fat, old Irishman dressed in a kimono."
And all because his daughter hates him and seems to quite like me.
Come on.
Budge up.
"Come on, now."
Come on.
Here.
For fuck's sake.
Hey!
Where are you going?
"Eh, Paul, wait!"
"Wait, you fucker."
Wait for me.
- You can forget about tomorrow.
- Good.
- Find some other poor fucker.
I won't be there.
- So?
- Fuck you!
"- No, fuck you!"
"Tommy, you're an arsehole."
Tommy?
"That's so childish, mate."

Hell no.

You saw that poor guy.
Mushrooms would never make you that way.
But I'm right about the Japanese guy.
"If everyone's talking about him, there's likely a good reason."

You check it out.
- Me?
"- Yes, you!"
Dammit.
You want me to go out?
"I'm telling you, asshole, to get your ass out there!"
For crying out loud...
"Okay, I'll go."
The aunt is jealous of me!
"You mustn't say that, dear!"
This is only a trailer.
Had I shot the whole show we'd have had a video-library!
You're lying!
Stop this nonsense!
"Let me talk to her, sir."
"Well, Kaushi?"
Why did you do that?
"You dare steal here, Kaushalya!"
Impudent woman!
"Dangerous woman, sir!"
She's playing the Bandit Queen!
"You, too?"
Shut up!
"Who else, if not I?"

The neighbours won't ask if my house is robbed!
"I ran out of battery, or I'd have shot the night-scene..."
The day-scene is all so obvious!
Why'd we need night-scenes?
"Call the police, Banwa."
"That's not necessary, sir!"
I'll personally throw her out!
Shameless creature!
You dare bite the hand that feeds!
"Will you do all that in my presence, Banwa!"
Yes.
The garden is the ideal place.
Let's go...
"The plate, Banwa..."
Sure.
"No, a cash trail is very fucking bad for us."
- Oh.

"If I'm going down, you're going down, too."
I don't know what this is about.
Good point.
Dan and Amy.
They're getting paid cash from the campaign fund to bring down the bill.
"There, you've been blooded."
So join the circle jerk.
Grab a dick.
Wish I could hear what you were saying over that incessant drilling sound.
- What are you doing?
Shh!
What cash?
What Dan and Amy?
Ben's paying Dan and Amy to lobby against the bill and now there's a cash trail and we're all incriminated.
But you're not.
"Oh, my God, now you are!"
Well done.
Now I feel a lot better.
"Did you know, Tom?"
"Ma'am, I am as shocked as you are."
"Shocked and disappointed, Ben."
"Ma'am, Moyes is voting yes."
Ruiz is voting yes.
This comes down to one vote.

No bombings Tuesdays apparently.
"Soon, I imagine."
Good.
I will wait.
"So I wait and wait and wait and wait, and still she doesn't come or call or anything."
What makes you so sure she didn't know you were there and why?
What kind of talk is that?
"- Please, Carl."
- Please what?
Why do you need a woman to do things for you?
To ask about things?
This is none of your business.
"Well, you sure don't need help from the lady who fixed up your contract with Somers in the first place."
You be quiet!

Mason speaking.
"No, no, you just caught me."
We've been working late.
"Mr. Mason, you'll be in your office first thing in morning, yes?"
"Well, I'll be here, but I have a calendar full of appointments."
Cancel them.
I be there at 9 sharp.
And then you fix Somers for me.
You're scaring me.
So..?
"Dear, I don't feel a thing."
Wait.
This is the danger.
The effect kicks in when you least expect it.
"You know, I'm discovering the US."
What surprising people.
They're clean and crystalline...
They believe that Christ is always on the side of the winner.
- May I say something?
- Yes.
I'm starting to feel the effect.
Are you joking?
- Is it strong?
"- Yes, I can't take it anymore."
"It's been so long, Curzio!"
You're the only person that calls me Curzio.
"Careful, she's looking this way."
Is she crazy?
My god!
"- My god, that woman is crazy!"

Don't tell me she flew that plane all the way from Washington.
"Sicíly, but I don't doubt she'd manage it."
She had her wings before she sprouted tits.
- Maam...

"I'm General Howes, representantive of General Cork..."

"So, uh, what do you want to talk about?"
"Well, um, do you know my name?"
- Uh...
- It's Wendy.
Wendy.
- Wendy?
- Yeah?
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Lot of homework?
"- Yeah, a lot."
You?
Yeah.
"Look, Cory, I know I've been forbidden to give you any advice on any subject ever again, so if there's any information you'd like to voluntarily offer about the current events of your life, I'm listening."
- How was my date?
- Yeah.
- I had a real good time.
"- So, what was your technique?"
"Look, I know you know everything there is to know about women and I don't know anything, so I did what I do best..."
I was real nervous and I nodded a lot.
Did she like that?
"I don't know, but when we were done,"
I asked her if she maybe wanted to go out again.
"She said, ""Yeah, I would."""
Cool.
- Cor?
- Yeah?
"So, how did you nod?"
"I mean, was it like this or...?"

Who's Danny Moore?
He's been talking about a beating on you.
Who is he?
- I don't know who he is!
- That kid you bumped into

- That was Jay.
You'll have to go and knock him out now.
- Teach him a lesson.
"- If you see him,"
- tell him it's a mistake.
- I'm not getting involved.
He's from a hard family in Northwood.
His brother did time.
"Oh, Northwood?"
"Been nice knowing you, Si!"
"What's this, my dad's bigger than your dad?"
"What are we, 12?"
"- I think he is 12, actually."
"- You're not scared are you, Si?"
"No, it's just I'm not going to look cool beating up a kid."
- And you couldn't.
"- Yes, I could, can we just leave it?"
I'm not fighting anyone.
"Oh yeah, nice one."
Mature.
"Compared to Simon, my first day was turning out OK."

"They're just sentimental value, nothing more."
"Earl, get Tom's Indian stuff and bring it up here, will you?"
Anything else you want?
"- Well, my rifle."
- No.
- How about a nice fast horse?
- No.
You getting all choky seeing me behind bars?
God damn you.
- What are these buttons for?
- Just lucky.
- The paper said they're charms.
"- Yeah, they are."
- Said you believed in them.
- I do.
- Show me how they work.
- Someday.
Who are those fellows out there with those rifles?
That's the National Guard.
The paper said they didn't think we could hold you in jail... and they got kind of personal about it.
"Open this thing up, Earl."
Let us in.
John Coble's here to see Tom.
Here you go.
John brought you a suit to wear at the trial.
"All right, you fellows can have about 10 minutes."
"Come on, Earl."
"Ken, the kiosk man. """
Amazing.
Too bad this guy didn't run a hot-dog stand.
I'm here for allergies.
These things are pushing me over the edge.
Can you get rid of them?
Or give them to someone a little more deserving.
Who saved flower boy's foot and moved more patients than anybody today?
"Me, that's who."
"You' re gonna miss me too, because I'm out of here."
"- Banker's hours, Pratt?"
- Only if they work doubles.
"Hey, Carter."
What's up with your boss?
Is it true she was crying earlier?
- Weaver?
- Yeah.
Bad breakup or something?
- Been pretty moody lately.
- Lately?
I'm sorry!
I think this man needs immediate attention!
- You gotta help my pops!
- What happened?
They came in the ambulance entrance.
- I saw he was diaphoretic.
- Not asking you.
We were playing ball.
He grabbed his chest.
- When did the pain start?
- An hour ago.
- Thought it would go away!
"Gigi, he's not coming."
But you can tell me the story about the molars.
I'd love to hear it.
Hey.
How could he already not like me?
I screwed up.
"I told Bill it was Thursday, not Tuesday."
It's my fault.
Hi.
Are you good?
- Can I get a Jameson on the rocks?
- Sure.
GIGI:
Awesome.
I'm stuck with a guy who can't distinguish Tuesday from Thursday.
"Meanwhile, this girl, she's probably meeting her soul mate as we speak."
- This one right here?
- Mm-hm.
"Oh, God, no."
How do you know?
The guy working the Tom Cruise thing?
"She's interested, he's clearly not."
You cannot tell from a cursory glance that he's not into her.
"Actually, I can."
I see this stuff going on every night.
Watch this.
She's going on about her macrobiotic diet.
"He's thinking, ""Dear Christ, get me out of here."""
"And look, how fortuitous."
"Drinks spill, which is perfect for him, because now..."
He can move on to the girl with the shoulder tattoo.
"Man, you have a gift."
"He tried to kill me, and I killed him first."
But you hid the body!
Why?
"Come in, Allison."
Allison!
I was never happier to see anyone in my life.
Are you all right?
"-Hi, Ted."
"-Hi, Allison."
"Mr. Partridge, I can testify about Lucas."
I saw him beat her.
"It will help, believe me."
We appreciate you coming for the trial.
-You're going to get her off?
-We're going to do the best we can.
But the jury decides on the one thing:
evidence.
"Now, it adds up to this:"
we have a murder and a defense that's too simple to be good.
It's open to attack from many sides.
"Selena, have you told me the whole story?"
I'm sorry!
There's no more to tell.
"Yeah, I'll take the dress shop before, okay?"
"Hello, Allison."
-You look well.
-With the drink in my hand?
Would you care for something?
I moved hoping I'd be left alone.
"-You haven't learned, have you?"
"-Oh, yes, I have, mother."
I learned to smoke and drink.
Helen:
Okay.
Are you really serious about this?
"I told your dad, Grandpa was gone, but now you coming into our lives and digging up this case, well, that was the last time"
"Dad and Duval were ever civil to each other, so now I think he might still be here."
"Just holding on, something left to do."
All right.
Come on.
Both of you.
Fingers on.
[Sighs]
Thank you.
Close your eyes.
"Sheriff James Pritchard, if you are here, make your presence known."
James Pritchard.
Are you with us?
[Door slams]
You.
Outside.
Right now.
[Door opens]
They sure do this a lot.
Maybe they like it.
"When we were kids, your grandpa would take your dad out there when he was in trouble."
I can't imagine Dad in trouble.
Yeah.
They'd stand there just... like that.
Duval:
Why are you here?
I told you to stay away from my house.
You'd only come if you had leverage.
I'd only come?
If the best they could come up with is...
Me.
False humility-check.
I'll be there.
I hope you don't mind.
I invited Nate and Blair.
I really want them to get to know you.
Terrific.
I'd be honored.
"Well, Rufus and I would love to come."
"Uh, why don't you grab a plate?"
Help yourself.
What?
He left when I was 2.
The man's a total stranger to me.
You have to at least give him a chance.
"No, I don't."
"Okay, everyone."
Let's sit down and enjoy this wonderful food.
"Dad, here."
Sit here.
"Rufus, scoot over, please."
Please.
Thank you.
"Hey, Blair, what's up?"
I thought I'd come and watch your lacrosse game.
"So if you could make sure that there's a seat for me in v.I.P.,"
"Preferably next to an injured cute player,"
But not one on scholarship.
Since when do you care about lacrosse?
Since I desperately needed to get away from N.Y.U.
Everyone's planning their living arrangements for next year.
Have you split up?
You could say that.
"Believe me, I could see it coming."
"Don't ask me how, but I did."
"There was something in your relationship, forgive me, that didn't work."
When are you leaving?
"- Very soon, but I'll see you before."
- I hope so.
I'm sorry you're going.
- I'm off.
"Benigno, see you soon."
- Yes.
Has her period come yet?
Going by last month's nursing report it should have come.
"Yes, it is a bit late."
It's over two weeks.
That's too much.
Are you sure she had one last month?
I put the towel on her myself.
It was the week you had flu.
She even seems swollen.
"Yes, but at times they can be irregular."
Lydia's periods have stopped.
You're right.
But I think we should tell Dr.Vega.
I brought some of my travel guides for Alicia and you.
Thank you.
I've said good-bye to Lydia.
I tried to see Alicia but Dr.Vega and the head nurse were there and I wasn't allowed in.
Is anything wrong?
"No, I think Alicia has got an infection."
Can you take me home?
Because you have access to the files.
"And as soon as you smell something, you're close."
"Oh well, at Pierre's to solve."
He was responsible for the dossier.
Do not tell him!
Why would not I?
Because it does not make sense.
Say 'll tell you whom I gave the pictures.
Who?
Thomas Riffautu.
Deek one for his client.
Sophie Mazerat?
He was with her in the car when they H. Rozier left the body in the woods?
"I gave you his name, It's already a great deal, right?"
Search Riffauta with two and one F.
Mighty police mind!
Hi there!
We know to whom belongs the second sample DNA.
-Who?
-Idrissi Cottages.
Known for violence and robberies.
Already a odgulio three years.
Negro and conforms Where Çetin description.
Where is it?
In the neighborhood Merisiers Champignyju.
In this neighborhood would not enter.
What do you know?
We'll see.
You and Tintin in the last time so much hassle!
What do you want?
"It's okay, I came to Omar."
Omar!
"Here look, Fuk (winter melon)."
Fuck!
What kind of person are you?
Are you talking to me?
I'm talking about that guy.
What kind of person?
Are you talking to me?
I'm talking about that guy.
A person whose personality like that shouldn't live long.
Oh you also mean that guy?
I meant you!
"""Speak English like a native"""
Oh gosh!
Hey what is with you?
Don't get any closer.
I will poke and blind you.
It's not worth it.
You like it rough?
I'm going to take that interview so I can go get Kaya back.
You have to teach me.
Ask your daddy to teach you then.
Aren't you mixed?
Hey!
My dad is French.
He fled back to his country before I could walk.
You can study with some other teacher.
"No, I can't."
You taught Kaya so you have to teach me.
"You saw your cut-out standee, right?"
So will you teach me?
Sure
One on one?
"""To each according to his needs""."
My poor little thing.
Is it love?
My cub...
Love.
I'll show you.
Mommy!
The smell is the proof.
You don't leave a friend wounded in the trenches of old age.
Especially when they're incontinent.
"Here I am, my friend."
"Come on, get down here, you prick."
Do you want me to snatch you by the balls?
Jump off!
And don't fidget!
"Do you remember when, you told me that"
I am doing all this for Mary.
You were right.
"Do you know what a ""lost girl"" means in French?"
Nobody knows any more.
It's a woman that keeps on walking until she falls apart.
You can never help her.
Ever.
You can try to kill yourself.
That's all.
"Yeah, I know."
"You could tell me that I could have nabbed the Munch Bunch at the parking lot, or the villa..."
I'm not God.
I'm just holding his crayon.
That's all.
"one more point, I'm not like the ones you've dealt with at home."
Come on.
Go back!
[Letha screeching] sickle!
No!
Letha...
Look.
- I can't look.
- You must.
[footsteps approaching]
[Letha] it's miraculous.
"There are no miracles, Letha."
Only scientific explanations for everything.
"Well, then, just explain to me what we're seeing."
It...
Must be That...
Boy.
There's a...
There's a force that Centers around that boy.
A force capable of countermanding
The basic physical law of...
Gravity.
"Victor, I don't know what you're talking about."
Molecular mobilization.
"- I need that boy, Letha."
- [horns honking]
- I need him desperately.
"- Now, just a minute."
"Brilliant, my boy."
Brilliant.
"Congratulations, young man, for a fantastic..."
"Well, whatever it was you just did,"
It was absolutely heroic.
"It was nothing, I just... [gasps]"
"I mean, it was his flute that..."
You've the filthiest mouth!
"Ah, lay off, Kay, will you?"
I'm being harassed!
You just move!
"Look, do you want to keep it?"
What do you mean?
Do you want to...
He wants to know do you want an abortion?
I do not!
There's no way I'm having an abortion!
"Good, you're right!"
You definitely won't tell us who it is?
No!
Sorry.
"Well, there's no more to be said, is there?"
She's obviously made her mind up.
A man needs a pint after all that.
Hang on a second.
"Yes, love?"
Is that all?
What do you mean?
It's a terrible... the neighbors!
Do you care what the neighbors think?
"Yes, I do."
"Sure, the O'Neill young ones are after having kids."
The pair of them.
And the Bells would be the same... except they don't have any daughters... but you know what I mean.
Tara O'Neill had her baby for Paddy Bell.
Of course she did.
So fuck the neighbors.
"You coming for a drink, Sharon?"
He was an exciting guy.
He was really nice.
He introduced me to everybody.
Everybody wanted to be nice to him.
And he knew how to handle it.
Don't buy wigs that come off at the wrong time.
Morrie's wigs don't come off!
Even underwater.
"And remember, Morrie's wigs are tested against hurricane winds."
"So, forget about money."
You can afford a Morrie wig.
Prices to fit every budget.
So call me now!
And come in for a personalized fitting.
"Morrie, Jimmy's waiting."
You're past due.
I've been good to you.
But there's something quite unreasonable going on here.
Jimmy's being an unconscionable ball breaker.
Give him 8-to-5 on Cleveland.
I never had to pay the vigorish that he demands.
"What am I, a schmuck on wheels?"
"Please, you know Jimmy."
You borrowed his money.
Pay him.
I didn't agree to three points above the vig.
What are you going to do?
Going to fight with Jimmy Conway?
He wants his money.
Give him his money and let us just get the fuck outta here!
Hey...
Fuck him!
How nice.
Look at this.
It's worthless.
Ten dollars from a vendor in the street.
"But I take it, I burry it in the sand for a thousand years it becomes priceless."
Like the Ark.
"Men will kill for it, men like you and me."
What about your boss?
Der Führer?
I thought he was waiting to take possession.
All in good time.
When I am finished with it.
"Jones, do you realize what the Ark is?"
It's a transmitter.
It's a radio for speaking to God.
And it's within my reach.
You want to talk to God?
Let's go see him together.
I've got nothing better to do!
Doctor Indy!
Come back home now!
"Next time, Indiana Jones, it will take more than children to save you."
I thought I would find you there.
"Better than the United States Marines, eh?"
Marion is dead.
"Yes, I know."
I am sorry.
"Life goes on, Indy."
There is the proof.
I have much to tell you.
"First we will take them home, and then I will take you to the old man."
I can't figure out how Belloq did it.
"- Hello, Jeanne."
- Hello.
May I ask why you're in such a good mood?
We're happy to see our favourite manager.
Good.
You'll smile less when you see the Décopril figures.
We'll have to be more... aggressive and tenacious!
Danou wants you.
- Now?
- It's urgent.
- Sounds like trouble up there.
- I'll go.
Get started.
"HIS SPRING, HER WINTER"
Come in.
"Hello, Jeanne."
Thanks for coming.
Have a seat.
Sit down.
"I'm listening, Maillet."
I'll be straight.
The parent company's made a decision.
"Staff at the south-west branch is being reduced, and..."
"- ""And""?"
- 10 jobs are going.
- That many?
"- Yes, 10."
"Under the circumstances, it's the only way to keep the branch running after the heavy losses, due to generic drugs."
"""Heavy losses""."
"Don't exaggerate, Hugues."
Latest results aren't...
Right.
-Thanks.
The war is most likely over in a couple of months.
And i will maybe come visit.
"-Good luck, Tronstad."
-Thanks.
Oh well...
We'll see eachother soon.
Good luck.
Heisenberg.
"Welcome to London, Heisenberg."
"Im major Julie Smith, SOE."
Im leading the german nuclear program interogations.
Come with me.
"Its a great thrill, on behalf of Hydro."
- To be able to give the homefront four million krones (500k $)
"Norwegian Hydro kept producing and selling ""heavy water"" until 1988"
The company has today 13000 employees.
and a turnover of roughly 65 billion krones (8.5billion usd)
"Tronstad never returned to his wife and child.But got killed during operation ""Sunshine"""
"This Tv-series is based on a true story, but has been slightly alterated for simplifaction/drama The Hydro chief and his wife was fictional."
"- Hey, Pop."
"- Hey, kid."
I got news.
Coco left me.
Turns out she was banging her yogi.
"Oh, I'm sorry, Pop."
Sorry?
I set the whole thing up.
It's fine.
It's fine.
Paid for her yoga retreat to Nicaragua.
"Sorry to call late, cock."
I was up.
I just needed to hear a friendly voice.
It's been one prick of a day.
Yeah?
"First, Lorton."
And then-
"One of the many things Scarlet hates about me is my inability to lose my temper, so I won't even try now."
"But let's have nothing more to do with each other, OK?"
"Barn, what the hell are you- Ask Scarlet about John Bartrop."
"You were joking about him, remember?"
In the alley where Ben Rigby was killed.
What'd you call him?
A puff of wind in a mohair cardigan?
"You know, even when you're destroying lives, somehow it still comes out as a bloody joke."

LAUGHTER
I want to play a game with you.
This Countdown thing.
This rearranging letters.
Yes.
What do you reckon?
Any ideas on that one?
"I'm short-sighted, thank goodness!"
"Tell you what, we've got some here."
What do you think that might be?
"Mini, Mini."
Mini?
You're absolutely right.
It's mini.
What about sexul?
Sexul?
Gary Lineker's got one.
Nothing sexy about him or it.
Got to be a Lexus.
He's right.
That's two.
They're getting harder now.
"Hmm, I see that you've been looking at the papers again."
Mm-hmm.
You want to tell me what's going on?
Okay.
Don't freak.
I got mugged today.
You got mugged?
!
"Not freaking, remember?"
I think someone's after the papers.
How do you know that?
Just tell me what happened.
"All right, since Mom couldn't help you with the encryption,"
I went to see Dad today.
Yeah?
He said that there might be something in the time capsule that could help me decode the papers.
Really.
It's--
It's under the bed.
Hello?
(Leo on phone) Angela.
"Hey, Leo."
I've been researching our artist.
He's got no money troubles.
No history of illicit or suspicious dealings.
He's clean.
Except for the fact that he was lying about something
"(Leo) Yeah, but what?"
Maybe it's time to have another conversation with Mr. Walker.
"I've already thought of that, but he's not answering his phone."
"I guess we're just gonna have to pay him a visit, then."
All right.
- Is it a conspiracy?
- I have not even heard coming.
- I opened it.
- Come in the living room?
- I was going in the kitchen.
Idiot.
He has the courage André.
He loves me.
I am sure that I prefer my mother.
"If I'm with him, is to recite better in the theater, you understand."
Forbid you to judge.
You have confused ideas to do this.
Finally.
All right.
It's clean!
"So, enlightened, ports reports of Mickey Marie?"
- I do not know where they are ...
- You are as Marie.
Put it where the Chiappe.
I told you that I would found.
He is my dog.
My brother of sugar.
He knows the future.
"Your future we'll leave, but this leaves me!"
"Marie has paid his return ticket, is the price."
The trip was a surprise and this is priceless.
So no cheating with your whistle.
Do not you know far more to be a man?
Shut up you.
"I Don't trust you, Albert."
The good Lord has addressed if one tries not to understand ...
"Hit, Albert ..."
"That was a long day, wasn't it?"

"Dad, I gotta follow my heart!"
"- Okay, my U$20.000 degree..."

- Send the life-boat...
"Paul, let's go."
I was just knocking around with Jocelyn.
"This is Jocelyn, your spritzer, you met her."
Hi!
I'm gonna be late for Patrick Tomarce's book party.
I gotta split.
Are you all right with your...
- what is that?
- Ribbon?
"Yeah, ribbon rapping?"
"- Jocelyn, I can help you."
"- Thanks, Alex."
"Well, I'll see you at the Carnival tomorrow."
"Don't touch me, you're all wet!"
"Jocelyn, I think we could get a cup of coffee after or something?"
"Sir, I..."
Listen...
"Sir, listen..."
"- Step outside, Mansley."
- Yes.
(YELLING) You realize how much hardware I brought out here?
You just blew millions of Uncle Sam's dollars out of your butt!
"I gotta admit, I'm relieved that this is what Hogarth was talking about."
(LAUGHS)
"I mean, I was beginning to, um, think it was real. (LAUGHS)"

"- I mean, don't get me wrong, I like it."
"But, uh, do you need all this stuff on the surface?"
"Well, um, no, actually."
(STUTTERING) It just sort of...
It seems kind of slapped on.
"You know, not as thought-out as this other piece."
- You like that one?
- Yeah.
(THE GENERAL YELLING INDISTINCTLY)

Hmm.
I see why Hogarth sneaks out here.
"You mean, you know about that?"
(LAUGHS) Aw.
Now I do.
(ENGINE REVVING)
"Bye, Kent, and all that that implies."
That makes 12.75.
An elastic band around it?
Here's 13.
-And 25 cents change.
5 nickels is ok too.
-Or 2 dimes and a nickel.
"Or 25 cents, right Auntie Cor?"
-I could barely carry that.
"What can I do for you, sir?"
The working man isn't interested in the revolution.
Must be too expensive.
Beautiful books about the revolution that nobody wants to buy.
What can I do for you?
"Hey, a first edition."
This is an antiquarian book.
It's been here for years.
No one will buy it like this.
Let alone follow its example.
"No, they'd rather buy this junk."
Rather than Marx and his revolution.
Ab.
Ab from the assault group.
-I thought you'd never recognize me.
"Yes, I've changed."
Hair doesn't grow on brains.
It also doesn't grow on sandy soils.
Did you want to buy all these books?
You could give them to your capitalist friends.
They've already got them all.
Or else their children.
I've come to get you.
I found him.
"All right, then i'll tell you."
Mr. Fisk is backing a show.
Miss mansfield is an actress.
That's all there is to it.
"I've known miss mansfield as long as he has, and i've never known a finer woman."
"No, malicious gossip isn't news."
"I don't think your papers want to print it, boys."
"Thanks, mr."
Boyd.
That's good enough for us.
Yeah.
Thanks.
No offense.
"Good night, miss mansfield."
Good night.
"Thank you, nick."
"That's all right, josie."
What else could i do?
Did you really mean what you told them about me?
No.
I was thinking of jim.
"Ever since i've known you, nick, you've been fighting me because of jim."
"You knew how he felt, and you didn't want to hurt him... so you tried to hurt me."
And you succeeded for a while... till i discovered the reason.
What is the reason?
You're in love with me.
I'm in love with you?
"Why... what do your guests think about all this, mr."
Taylor?
I haven't got any guests except mr.
Drew and colonel fisk and his soldiers.
I don't care what they call the place.
He wouldn't go to the hospital.
Of course he wouldn't.
"It's like an anxiety thing, you know."
- He's okay.
"- He's fine, okay?"
I'm sorry.
I really didn't mean to scare you.
"Jesus, Patty."
I'm sorry.
Look.
"Uh, the reason-- the reason why I'm-- I'm here is, um... you seem to be the only person who knows how to ground him."
And he could really use that right now.
"So if there's anything that you can do,"
I just-
- I'd really appreciate it.
Okay?
Why are you doing this?
What do you mean?
This case.
Why are any of you doing it?
It's destroying him.
It looks like it's destroying you.
My mom is acting like a complete crazy person.
"Okay, with all due respect, your mother's not my fucking problem."
Okay?
"And, uh, no one's getting paid for this."
So I don't know why the fuck we're doing this.
"But... everyone needs a reason to wake up in the morning, and it's a pretty good fucking reason."
"I'm having a day, okay?"
Okay.
So... are you in?
- Of course.
BRENNAN:
Oh...
This is blood.
Aldo's?
"We can't be completely sure, there are tests..."
"Look at that, Bones."
Look.
That's the cage.
(Brennan groans)
Cam will want to do blood spatter analysis as soon as possible.
(camera snapping)
Bones.
I need to finish...
"No, look."
Look!
"Booth, that's a bomb!"
BOOTH:
"We got to go, now."
(grunting)
(gasping)
(Brennan groaning)
Crews are still battling the blaze at an abandoned office complex in Anacostia.
"The cause of the fire is undetermined, but fire marshals suspect the strong possibility of arson."
Booth says it was an IED.
"Yeah, but do IEDs usually take this long to burn off?"
HODGINS:
"No, Booth saw Jerry Cans of gas."
My hunch is it was powered by a petroleum gel.
"It sticks to everything and burns at over 2,000 degrees."
Which means there won't be much left.
Close to zilch.
"Whoa, Dr. B."
"All three families lived within several miles of each other, but we never crossed paths until Lou's funeral."
- Do you remember this guy?
- Hell of a man.
"- Sure, I remember him."
- Did he ever ride in your cab?
"20, 40 times."
Who knows?
"He was a cab rider, strictly cab rider."
"- Yeah, he didn't drive?"
- Never.
He used to sit in front.
- He sat in front?
"- Oh, yeah."
- Really?
- Yeah.
"That was your dad, world-famous architect."
"Yeah, that was your father."
- Do you remember him at all?
"- A little bit, vaguely."
- Did he ever ride in your cab?
- Vaguely.
He loved the women.
"Not the young ones, but he loved the women."
Do you remember what he looked like or...
His face was pointed.
"Yeah, and his hair was..."
"his hair was, you know, very thin, like a blond."
- Like a what?
- Like it was blond.
Yeah.
"Oh, blond, uh-huh."
Do you remember that he had scars on his face?
I'll manage.
I told the cleaning lady to come twice a week too.
Absolutely not.
The way things were was fine.
It won't be the same.
What?
Dust?
I can dust.
I have to get the money from the account that Grandpa left.
We have to go to the bank.
Okay.
"Besides that, I'll arrange some more money."
I don't need you to arrange for me.
I need you to sign as a guarantor on the contract.
Did you notice that the bathroom light is flickering?
Yeah.
"It's like a discotheque, it needs to be checked."
I'll handle it.
Good.
Can I take this?
Of course.
You didn't forget anything?
I have everything.
You're sure?
- I'm sure.
"No, no, I'll take the dishes later."
Are you not feeling well?
"No, I'm fine."
Do you feel sick?
- It's nothing.
Want me to get you some glycerin?
"No, I don't need any."
I don't have anymore.
"Otherwise, I would give you another one."
Don't worry about it.
Don't let them get you down!
"They can all go to hell, right?"
"Great, three days of ravioli."
How was your audition?
They expired last year.
Throw them away.
"Nonsense, what else should we cook?"
Are you going to sing for Toni?
"Well, if I survive the ravioli."
Then that'll be your new job?
Right.
Then you won't work here anymore?
You can always visit me.
Would you like that?
I don't care.
"- No Tom, and no ravioli  but for actual money."
... without Tom.
Bon appetit!
"For tonight's special event, it's best to pray  because it's probably dangerous."
- What?
The food has expired!
If that was the only thing?
Same old story.
Amen.
Amen.
- No ravioli?
No thank you.
- No thanks.
"I bet he goes to a restaurant afterwards, and takes Babette with him."
!
Yes!
Good!
Then I'll have to go it alone.
You work here?
I wanted to tell you...
You're here in this bar?
Toni promised that he wouldn't steal you away.
You're ruining the hotel!
I should have known.
Where is Toni?
In his office.
"Franz, we had no contract."
I said that I would help you.
But you never paid me.
That's why.
Is that the only reason?
Among others.
You did steal Nora away!
You might as well hire Tom!
Then we'll all leave and you can build your luxury hotel  or your recreation center or whatever!
You've already prepared contracts?
Where are they then?
"Calm down, Franz."
Is that loaded?
You promised me that you wouldn't take Nora away from me.
And you gave Josphine money so she'd leave?
!
You're pointing a gun at me?
We're cousins right?
As far as Nora is concerned...
She applied at the bar.
"She's, um-- she's doing all right."
Thanks for asking.
"Now, who's gonna bring me back some candy?"
- I will!
- Yeah!
"Hey, tell your mom you get to eat as much as you can fit in your mouth."
- [Laughs]
- Right.
You guys have fun.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Bye.
See you when you get back.
- Look at you.
- Restaurant tricks.
Impressive.
[Marching band music] 25 members...
Look at these chumps.
"Are you kidding, man?"
Parade detail is great.
"Peter Mills, hold your arm up."
Now keep it there for five hours.
That's what being in the parade is.
"Mills, the shriners-- they throw out candy-- you clean up, man."
"Now, listen, I know you guys are gonna give me crap for this."
Go on.
[Sighs]
I want to start a podcast.
What the hell's that?
"Well, when I record myself being equal parts charming and brilliant, and then I put it up on iTunes, and people subscribe, and they follow me."
A mute would be better at that than you.
[Laughter]
Cool!
I like fat black girls.
I can't believe this cruise doesn't have cocktail sauce.
"Finish your breakfast, Rallo!"
"Hey, Junior."
Huh?
"All right, pirates, in one hour we board the cruise ship to rape, pillage and plunder."
PIRATES:
Yay!
"And maybe this time, a little less raping."
"I think with the last boat, we all got a wee bit carried away."
"We're better than that, you guys."
"I never thought I'd say this, but if I have to eat one more friggin' shrimp"
I'm gonna kill myself.
I got one!
(flapping like a fish)
"Okay, okay, stop it!"
"Oh, my goodness, a talking whale!"
I'm not a talking wha...
"Oh, come on, that's... that's mean."
"What mysteries of the deep have you come to tell me, o sea monster?"
"Junior, it's me."
Your dad.
Daddy!
"""Dad,"" 14. ""Dad."""
"Listen, we're in a heap of trouble."
Somali pirates are about to take over the ship unless we stop them.
Where's your mother?
She's dead.
"Oh, right."
Where's Donna?
(funk music playing)
My agent's.
"You and me, given opportunities only because young men are gone."
Or dying.
"But to turn our back on those opportunities, even when one has suffered such great loss, wouldn't that be giving death dominion over life?"
Have you seen it yet?
Our film?
You should.
It's very good.
I'm awfully good.
And so are you.
Calling all small boats.
All seaworthy vessels to report to your local harbor master immediately.
"Dunkirk. on, Lily!"
I think they're gonna get 'em out.
"Then they're going to need all the boats they can get, aren't they?"
The Nancy.
"- Here, boy."
- Here.
"Don't be a fool, Johnnie."
There's a sniper up there.
I don't care if he's got a bleedin' cannon.
I'm not gonna sit by and watch him shoot a dog.
Aww!
What in the-
- What is that?
"It's France, Uncle Frank."
Dunkirk.
Blimey.
There's so many of us.
They'll never get us all out.
Hitler?
Hitler?
Positive.
We'll walk home.
We almost died.
Yeah.
A-about what you said in the car...
Please don't make fun of me right now.
"No, I would never."
It was actually really honest.
And I need to stop taking shots at your intelligence.
You don't do it that often.
"Well, you miss a lot of it."
Oh.
"There, I did it again."
Did what?
"Uh, it doesn't matter."
"I always considered you to be this self-absorbed person, but you're more substantial than that, aren't you?"
Thank you.
You know what?
I'm blowing off Judo today.
Let's hang out.
What should we do?
Makeovers.
Okay.
Great!
We're gonna walk right past my waxing place.
Say goodbye to that gal stache.
Ow.
Ow!
"If it were easy, everyone would be hot."
"Yep, you know, I-it's not just my feet."
It's from when I walked into the stop sign because you wouldn't give me back my...
"Okay, fine."
"- I did, sir."
And they won't.
Then why did he come to us for help?
[SPEAKS IN VIETNAMESE]
[SPEAKS IN VIETNAMESE]
He says papers fall from the sky.
[SPEAKS IN VIETNAMESE]
"Papers say white man long nose, round eyes, called Americans help Montagnards."
But Viet Cong say our papers lie.
"Pardon me, sir."
You like this?
"She's a woman, isn't she?"
[SPEAKS IN VIETNAMESE]
She said she won't ever take it off.
And don't you take this off either.
Now you make your old granddad bring you back when this is dirty and I'll put a clean one on for you.
[SPEAKS IN VIETNAMESE]
[SPEAKS IN VIETNAMESE]
That's a good girl!
[SPEAKS IN VIETNAMESE]
"He says the Viet Cong takes all the rice, pigs and chickens and forces the young men to fight."
He hates the Cong.
"Tell him if he'll bring his people in with us that we'll give them protection, money and food."

What's he saying?
"He said, ""What's money?"""
How do you answer that?

KIRBY:
Sergeant McGee?
I think the United States Army can spare a litter.
Admit what I did.
Lily's away on a trip with some friends.
I want to speak with her first.
"After that, I'll speak with the press."
"Hopefully, the fact that there's going to be"
A press conference will be enough
To keep mr.
Gerwin at bay for a day.
I'm gonna miss this place.
Regal man:
Excuse me.
This is for you.
Wow.
"You already have my, uh, $92.18?"
"No, it's just what you gave me yesterday."
I can't keep it.
I don't care what you say.
"You know, uh,"
I've only been doing this for a couple of weeks.
I'm not proud of it.
"It's just, uh, I haven't worked in a while,"
And I was hoping to get a little bit of money coming in.
"But the truth is, your $38 was all I got,"
"And, uh, I didn't set out to swindle little girls."
So you're not a prince?
why are you dressed like that?
Bridgette?
"When you're done with those, would you come help me"
"In the children's section, please?"
"Yeah, sure."
"Um, miss aiken,"
This is prince abantu.
"When did he call you, John?"
About an hour ago.
I can't stand this.
John!
It didn't seem right to bring this up at the funeral... but as far as I know there's never been any accidents at the chemical plant.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I got your message the other day.
"I meant to call you back, but I forgot."
Don't you remember leaving me that message?
"Chief, this is John Klein."
I didn't call him.
"No, it's not me."
I analyzed both tapes with the voice print.
I don't care.
It may be my voice.
It's not me.
Listen to me.
I would swear in a court of law that that's your voice.
"Yeah, great."
Thanks.
$%#!
"Regular coffee to go, please."
Seventy-five cents.
Have a great day.
Do you know that woman?
- What woman?
- She just left.
You didn't see her?
- No.
- That's strange.
"She had long red hair, green eyes, real pretty, and she was asking about you."
John?
It will.
So I suggest you keep the Vorpal sword on hand when the Frabjous Day arrives.
You seem so real.
Sometimes I forget that this is all a dream.
(COUGHING)
Will you stop doing that?

(WHOOSHING)
I've always admired that hat.
"Hello, Chess."
"Since you won't be needing it anymore, would you consider bequeathing it to me?"
How dare you?
It is a formal execution.
"I would like to look my best, you know."
It is a pity about all this.
I was looking forward to seeing you Futterwacken.
"I was rather good at it, was I not?"
I really do love that hat.
I would wear it to all the finest occasions.
"I love a morning execution, don't you?"
"-Yes, Your Majesty."
"-Yes, Your Majesty."
-I'd like to keep it on.
-Suit yourself.
As long as I can get at your neck.
I'm right behind you.
Off with his head!
I can't watch.
(EXECUTIONER SHOUTING)
"Good morning, everyone."
"Chess, you dog."
-(GASPS)
It just came to me.
"Gee, I'm awful glad you could stay, Wilbur."
"Oh, I am, too."
Except I can only stay over the weekend.
Oh.
Would you like to sit down for a while?
Okay.
"No, sit over here."
No.
Close your eyes.
Real tight.
(GASPS) Why do you want...
"Oh, you scared me."
I was going to ask you why you wanted me to close my eyes.
"Well, Wilbur seems to know his way around a campus, doesn't he?"
I can't understand that.
"I could have sworn he was the shy, studious type."
I'll say.
"Man, dig that crazy homework."
I better have a little talk with him.
I don't think he understands girls.
Neither do I. I wish you'd have a little talk with me.
I got to get out of here.
Hey.
Kiss me!
Kiss me!
"Oh, no!"
"Get away, you!"
"Remember, girls, tomorrow we're having a test on the alloyed group."
I want a list of all our enzyme experiments.
Are there any questions?
Class dismissed.
They've brought him a telegram.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
"""Everything's going as we had hoped""."
(Speaking German)
So they're going to accept Franco's conditions.
Shit.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
"""We will go to Montserrat for the Grail of all grails."""
Heil Hitler.
-Heil Hitler.
(HUMMING)
(HUMMING)
(CLEARING THROAT)

What a nightmare.
Chiquetete would sing Wagner with more respect.
Turn that off.
Why would the Nazis accept Franco's demands?
What have you found out?
"We don't know if the Holy Grail is in Montserrat, but there is a time door."
Of course.
The grail of all grails.
They are accepting the conditions because they want that door.
And how do they know about a door that even we aren't aware of?
From Lola Mendieta.
Hello.
Did you come alone?
Where is your partner?
I saw them kill him hidden behind some bushes.
"and I fled without doing anything, like a coward."
The important thing is that you're alive and you're leaving this hell.
Quickly.
Undoubtedly edward mace.
We have to leave before he gets here.
"There's precious little time,"
He could be outside already.
Why are you helping us
Against your own people?
I have my reasons.
I don't want your help.
(da veiga:)I know you find this
"Hard to believe, andreas,"
But I am trying to save your life.
Maybe we could continue this elsewhere.
[âª] [machine gun fire]
You set us up.
[machine gun fire]
Give me the dagger and the scabbard.
No!
(da veiga:)mace will have orders to take the contents
Of the case.
He will not leave without them.
I'm sure I can convince him
That you escaped.
What good are they to us
If we're dead?
"(andreas:)no, don't believe him."
He's lying.
He always lies.
Andreas!
No!
Third man's got the case.
[gun shots]
It's da veiga's son.
This is cancer.
It's not easy.
"Look, it's more important for me than anyone else here to finish school, OK?"
All I want is to see him go to a university before I die.
I've kept you busy with my problems.
You've come to talk about something.
Did Mert do something bad?
No!
No?
"""Holly Ellenbogen- Some Other Kind of News. """
So.
It's been a while.
Yeah.
"Yeah, it has."
Not since...
I want to say prom night.
Really?
Has it been that long?
"Oh, you know, it's funny."
What's that?
"I just wonder what I'm gonna tell my daughter when she's in high school and she asks me,"
"""Mommy, what was your prom like?"""
"I guess I'll just say, Well, sweetie, I went with this very cute boy who was a wonderful dancer."
And then we went to a party at your Aunt Marcie's house.
"And later that night, I walked into her bedroom, and there he was."
With this other boy from our Spanish class.
Doing all the things
I was finally prepared to do with him.
Rrrah!
"Um, look."
"Holly, I"
- I am so sorry.
Well...
"While you're checking out my body,"
"I wish my spirit would temporarily escape, but I can't, so what to do?"
"If you keep this up, I think my spirit is going to go crazy."
Kang Gyung Joon.
Please take good care of Yoon Jae's body.
To me...
"He's a very, very precious person."
Then...
I'll go to the hospital and check to see if your body is doing well.
Give me your phone.
Phone?
-Who?
-My uncle.
Call him and ask how the situation is over there.
Hello?
"Ah yes, hello."
Is this Gyung Joon's uncle?
"Yes, I see the news has already reached the school."
Gyung Joon has been moved to the Seoul Hankuk hospital.
Yes...
"Then when Gyung Joon wakes up, please call me no matter what time it is."
"Yes, yes..."
Your uncle said he's been moved to a hospital in Seoul.
I heard it all.
This guy's hearing is really sharp.
But anyways...
Do you live here by yourself?
"If your uncle and aunt come, you can't be here in this state!"
I live by myself.
They have no reason to come here.
You can go.
You wouldn't listen!
I told you to tell him!
Keep your pants on!
"All right, boys, break it up!"
"The other eye, Nelson!"
Close the other eye!
"Ten seconds, Stoke!"
Get in your shell!
Cover up!
Cover up!
"Break it up, break it up!"
Go to your corners!
"Break it up, the bell rang!"
- What's got into him?
- He's got to make it look good!
"Yeah, yeah!"
"But we finish him the next heat, don't we?"
"Yeah, the next heat!"
"Here you are, get your fresh-roasted peanuts!"
"Get all the peanuts you need right now, folks!"
There's not many left!
"I told you to get in a shell, didn't I?"
You see his face when I gave him that right?
- He'll murder you now!
"Won't he, Tiny?"
- Red's got something!
- What do you mean?
- Play it smart!
"Keep away from him, and you'll go the distance!"
My only chance is to deck him!
It's better to go the distance than get your head knocked off!
Get your cold beer here!
No it's cool.
What's going on?
"Well, um, Nathan's talking about quitting the team."
"And I just, I don't know what to say."
"Yeah, look I could never find the words to get through that big wall that he puts up so I really can't help you out much."
But you're so much better with him than I ever was.
He's lucky to have you.
Thanks.
I don't want to keep you from your practice.
Hmm.
Go Ravens.
"Hey, um, I didn't mean anything, about your mom."
It's cool.
Okay.
You could have told me Travis was a group.
It's not like it's some big secret.
Lucas gave me the weirdest look when I said that.
I felt so stupid.
You're not stupid.
You guys just don't like the same things.
"See, that's the problem."
He brings up art and books and I've got nothing.
- Hey you.

"Better be a basketball in that thing, Jagielski."
"Come on, Coach."
It's either this or I miss practice.
"Sawthe-thestem,ifyouwill,  or the shaft of the arrow."

"-Thanks, guys."
So you saw the feed on from the camera up there?
-Yeah.
-We did.
But I need a firsthand account here.
What'd you see?
"She's definitely, um..."
That's not a flat bottom down there.
"There is hard, large rocks on the bottom."
And I'm guessing...
-Not flat though?
"-No, no, not flat."
But there is a lot of debris down there.
-Sure.
"Yes, but..."
"Don't bother about us, lvy, dear."
"- Oh, Marcia!"
- Oh.
For Miss Ivy Peterson.
"Thanks, governor."
Look.
Fifty pounds.
There ain't no letter.
You don't suppose it's from him?
He must have sent it for what he's done.
"No, not him."
"He's too mean, he is."
"Oh, I don't know."
I wouldn't put it past him.
Yes.
"Yes, that's it."
Hopes I'll use it to try and run away.
"Oh, I can see him thinking it up, I can."
"And then, then he'll follow me."
"And just when I think that I've got free, he'll..."
I can't stand it anymore.
I can't stand it.
"Oh, if I could only do it I'd go down to the river."
"Oh, lvy."
"It's her nerves, that's what."
She ought to see a doctor.
There's a copy of the Winged Victory.
The real one's in the Louvre in Paris.
I know because I saw it there.
What's the sense of being victorious if you haven't a head?

- You're kidding me.
- You're squandering my money.
You've been studying for seven years and you're only half way through.
- I'II get it together.
- Marry Michelle or earn your living.
- But dad...
- It's all arranged.
"You get a car, a house, and 25000 a month."
You can't force me to marry her.
The wedding is in two months.
Your friends are not welcome.
And your mother says she's waiting for some grandchildren.
"Hey, Marc?"
"What are you doing, you fucking faggot?"
"- Fuck you, bitch."
- What's going on?
He tried to kiss me.
- Have you seen Sofie?
- She was dancing.
I thought you'd finished with her.
- It's nearly closing time.
- There are still five on the list.
Who hasn't gone yet?
I saw Christian and Johannes.
Johannes is too drunk for it.
Will you do Christian?
I am too sore.
"- Of course, baby."
- Thanks.
How do you feel about your mum and dad?
- What are you doing?
- Why won't he talk to her?
It isn't rare to find destructive even criminal behavior.
"Hey, do me a favor, will you?"
Tell me something good.
Don't be alarmed.
"If it's a lesion, in a way, she's fortunate."
All we have to do is remove the scar.
-Let's move her.
"- Regan, can you sit up, scoot over?"
A little more.
Good.
"Regan, I'm just gonna move you down on the table, okay?"
Let me do this.
It's okay.
See?
There we go.
It's just for a short time.
You're doing fine.
Very sticky.
Good.
"Now, Regan, you're gonna feel something a little bit cold and wet."
Okay.
Now you're gonna feel a little stick here.
Don't move.
Good.
Okay.
You're gonna feel some pressure here.
"Now, don't move."
Hook up.
There's nothing there.
No vascular displacement at all.

"- Great, she'll need some."
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
I have some mints.
I'll leave them here.
"I'm okay, I just..."
- I gotta get back to work.
"- No, you go home."
I'll put you in a cab.
Here you go.
"- She's sick, buddy."
Come on!
- What the hell are you doing?
Listen.
"Go home, cuddle up and get some rest."
Youve gotta take better care.
You're working too hard.
- Come on.

-We're off the record?
It's Tony.
What?
Am I wrong?
Honestly?
I don't know.
Take a leak.
"This is bad, my friend."
"I mean, don't get me wrong."
I wouldn't piss on this Ralph if he was on fire.
But to whack the guy over a horse?
How fucked up is that?
"If it can happen to him, it can happen to any of us."
What's next?
You get clipped for wearing the wrong shoes?
What can you do?
Tony's the boss.
Centuries of tradition here.
Exactly my point.
If Tony did do this... whack Ralph over a fucking horse... that guy would be the first guy on line to pull his fucking plug.
I think Justin recognized me a few minutes ago.
Thank you.
"Come in, he's getting dressed."
I'll wait in the car.
"Well, welcome back."
I bring presents.

That is so sweet.
"Also, for the grownups, I bring some of my uncle's wine... but it's come later."

You'll see some traditional arts in this funny story!
"Next, on Great Dangaioh..."
"Tune in for ""Costume Confusion!"
"The Shipwreck at Sea""!"
Um... oh...
"What's wrong, Kasumi?"
You've got to be strong!
I know...
"So, you've finally come to."
"But, you're not the one, either."
"You know, it's how people are supposed to feel when they fall in love."
"Of course, I never have."
I wish I could be so sure of what I wanted to do.
You must have some idea.
No.
"No, I've thought of everything, but nothing seems to fit me."
Maybe I'll be unique and retire at the age of 18.
"Norman, it's about time you got home."
"Hello, Ms. Page."
"- Goodbye, Norman."
"- Wait just a minute, will you?"
- But you...
- I don't want to go in just yet.
"Norman, what an awful thing, hating to go home."
Come on in here.
"Well, thanks for walking with me."
"I enjoyed it, really."
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
"- May I walk on it, Nellie?"
"- Sure, it's dry by now."
- Your mother wants you to call her.
- I really don't feel like it.
You two have a fight again?
"Same fight, different round."
- Nellie?
- Yeah.
You've been both a daughter and a mother.
Which one is worse?
- Being a mother.
- Why?
You find yourself doing the same things you hated your own mother and father doing.
She'll take it from me.
But that's not your money.
I must pay for the identity card.
The fun costs 600 Marks!
Why haven't you taken care of it long ago?
- Without any photos?
I need to have her photographed.
And you wanted her to be a witness.
Now don't get worked up!
"But, Bruno, she'll wake up."
She must go away before she gathers her wits.
We can't let that happen!
And I know exactly what's awaiting her when she realizes.
And that is terrible.
I feel... as if it were me.
Attention!
"Photographing now, Miss!"
The camera will click shortly.
What's the matter?
You're not at the dentist's!
Why the sad face?
A passport is not a wanted poster.
It's not so bad.
"Please, a bit more pleasant, Miss!"
Well then!
...
Well then!
...
See?
"When you smile, you look quite pretty."
"Excuse me, please!"
It almost makes me sorry that I must get you an ID card today.
- [Squelching]
- Euch!
This is disgusting.
You're no threat to humanity.
"Well, except for maybe the gross-out factor."
"Go ahead, slimy."
Take your best shot.
Hot dog!
A worthy adversary.
"Don't press the ""Don't"" button."
"I'll press your ""Don't"" button, buddy."
[Strains] Heavier than it looks.
Eat bricks!
"Ooh, he's good."
Can I clone or can I clone?
"Surrender, Tick, you're hopelessly outclassed."
I don't know the meaning of the word surrender.
"I mean, I know it, I'm not dumb."
Just not in this context.
And if it's class you want...
Now talk to me about class.
Lucky break.
[Pants and strains]
Here goes nothing.
Oh.
Need an extension cord.
Huh?
What?
"Oh, that old joke."
"So, what tired routine do you do for an encore?"
"Oh, dear."
- [Crashing]
I'm in jail.
I can't stop people from coming to see me.
Let her sneak this stuff in for you every week.
Let her fight these bastards every week!
Look what you're doing!
Stop it!
I'm sorry.
Let her sneak this shit in for you.
Will you stop it?
-Let her do it!
-Stop it!
Nobody's helping me. I am all alone.
Belle and Morrie are broke.
I asked your friend Remo for the money he owes you.
He told me to take the kids down to the police station and get on welfare.
"Karen, lt's going to be okay."
I've never seen Paulie since he got out.
I never see anyone.
That's what happens when you go away.
We're on our own.
Forget everybody else.
Forget Paulie.
As long as he's on parole he doesn't want anybody doing anything.
-l can't do it.
"-Yes, you can."
All I need is for you is to keep bringing me this stuff.
I gotta guy in here from Pittsburgh who's gonna help me move it.
In a month we're gonna be fine.
We won't need anybody.
I'm afraid.
I'm afraid if Paulie finds out....
He is not helping us out.
"Yeah, we are all fine."
Can?
"No, that's not what I meant."
I was going to go to the army recruiting center... a German photographer was studying my art.
Are you a faggot?
Did you apply foran exemption?
Would you like coffee?
I want to take you to Germany.
What would I do there?
You'll stay with me.
My house big.
I'll do everything for you.
The military won't let go of me.
What kind of photos do they want?
Holy shit.
Disgusting.
They must really enjoy this.
"Sukran, could you make tea for us?"
I really don't like what I'm hearing.
You guys will drive me crazy.
"Between my mom, the cops and no job."
We haven't even paid the rent.
Why?
It's been paid.
How?
Here.
Did you pay it?
Don't I live here?
How many times have I told you?
Enough!
I support this house.
I am not a sponger.
But she was still there.
"""I took a bus from Uncle Malcolm's,"
"I got the jacket, and I waited."""
Eva?
"After that, I waited in my cubby."
"When I got back home, dad wasn't there."
Dad?
"You know, you should have listened to dad when he said he didn't do it."
Is there anything else you'd like to tell me?
I'm sorry..
None of this would have happened if I just got thom to the river.
"Mrs gundelach, this is your copy for you to sign, as guardian."
"It's alright, mum."
Everything's gonna be alright.
"No, it's not."
It's not...
"Eva abigail gundelach,"
I'm arresting you for the murder of thom murnane.
"You'll be taken to the watch house, charged, and arrangements will be made immediately."
You'll report before the children's court.
I'm not sure what the magistrate will decide for eva.
Mr gundelach?
Take care.

"Yeah, don't get up."
"I got it, bro."
I'll go up the hill.
"If we're cut off, call me back."
I can't call you.
Hello.
"Are you well, Mrs Godarzi?"
"Sorry, it takes a few minutes to reach the high ground."
You can't foresee that.
"One day she's well, the next she isn't."
Her condition varies.
We're all waiting.
We have to wait.
She has company.
Her son has come a long way.
He's waiting like us.
When will we be back?
In a couple of days maybe.
Good-bye.
I knew that warm voice belonged to a warm-hearted man.
Hello.
How are you?
It's deep!
"Three metres, as stated in the contract with the engineer."
I think you may be right.
Working alone is better.
It's harder... but there are advantages.
- Do you understand me?
- No.
I mean that no one bothers you.
A boss.
You don't have a boss.
Yeah?
He comes and disturbs us.
Get in and out as quickly as you can.
That's all.
"Well, good luck, everybody, if all else fails just tread on their blank blank fingers."
"Where you go, I go."
Dawes.
Corporal Dawes?
My legs.
My legs!
"Quick as you can, Sergeant Box."
"Well, why don't you kiss it?"
"Get a ruddy move on yourself, man."
Engelander!
"Sergeant Box, how much longer are you going to be?"
It's nearly five to six.
It'll be dawn soon.
Hurry up.
Don't you know there's a war on?
"And you, Sergeant Box."
"Quick, we don't want to keep the Navy waiting."
"All right, Sir, just coming."
"You two stick close to Sergeant Box, don't let him out of you sight."
"Yes, Sir."
"Hurry up, will you?"
Hurry down those ropes!
Fire!
"Come on, get this fellow out of here, into the cave."
Any luck with this machine?
Not a whisper.
If the Navy find us in this soup...
What's happening to the Navy?
Looks like a long swim home.
Do you swim?
I want you to be strong.
I know I will.
Because you never let me down.
"Penguin, still there?"
"Yes, right here."
You can leave them at home safe with her mother?
"-Daddy, what are you talking about?"
-What are you talking about?
"Sorry, kids."
The career of his father came to an end.
"No, Dad."
"No, Dad."
Let's take a look around.
Can you see any way out?
"Yes, only creating a pair of wings."
-Can you move?
"-I'm stuck, pal."
"Okay, everybody, move away from the edge we depart the edge."
"Okay, do not move until I return."
Where you going?
I'll see what I can do by their father.
What can he do?
He's just an ordinary penguin.
This is another small step for a krill.
A great leap invertebrate without a cord.
Holy mother of krill!
"How is your appetite, Bill?"
He is great?
-What do you think you're doing?
Armando-strike.
Can not ...
You do not give boat you're a krill.
Yesterday's fireworks are still echoing.
"So, no thanks."
Brilliant.
"And now, if you're done with your story... please get out of my house!"
Your house?
Wow!
"But, I believe this house isn't yours, it belongs to Tisha."
"And, I believe Tisha is no more."
Do you think you're the only one who can create an illusion?
Tisha is alive.
I'm very happy to hear that.
"Anyway, if you had any kind of proof then..."
We do have proof.
Your fingerprints.
What?
You heard me.
Your fingerprints.
They are on the key.
When we were banging on the door...
Mr. Malhotra?
Mr. Malhotra?
You said the key was in the keyhole.
"The key is in the keyhole, but he never locks the door."
And we believed you.
And when you realised I would break the door down... you made your move.
"Hammer... quick, come on."
This is your proof?
!
Of course my fingerprints were on the key.
"I turned the key to open the door, remember?"
"Yes, I remember."
"Then, explain this."
"It's because our half brother is here, isn't it?"
He's helping you.
"Oh, it took you a while, but I'm..."
I'm just...
"I'm so proud of you, Duvie."
Just let it in.
"You know, you... you can say it now."
"""My father is gone, and he's not coming back."""

That's rule number two.

"If you've got food and a roof over your head and you get taken to a prize fight every now and then, just say ""Thanks, Dad."""
Rule number one.
Is that so hard?
Are you listening to me?
Are you listening to yourself?
I wasn't talking to you.
That's the problem.
You're not talking to the right person.
"You know, it's been a long time..."
Since I could do this.
I've never been able to do that.
"Look, I got it, all right?"
I got it.
You want me to talk to my son.
He'll accept who you are.
You saw it.
- He's almost there.
- That's the problem.
"If he accepts who I am, he'll want nothing to do with me."
You'll cripple her!
She was swimming when I came.
Swimming?
Don't cry.
- The yokel.
What is it you want?
"I'm a miller's apprentice, I'm looking for work."
I mean for a roof over my head...
Where did you work last?
Here and there and everywhere!
"I know who he is, Froggy!"
"I heard you need a helper, so I came."
"We do, but are you any good?"
You don't look like a hard worker to me.
But I am!
And I can sing and dance!
"It's him, I smellt him, it's him!"
- You wait!
- You...
Haven't we met before?
You look familiar.
Impossible.
"We have a new helper, what do you think?"
"Why, daddy?"
I can get my work done.
I don't want a stranger around.
"Beautiful E- er, you'd work herself to death you need a helper I can do all sons of things,"
you won't be sorry.
All right.
We'll give him a try.
"There's plenty to do, even with our two helpmates."
"A devil and watersprite, like in every real mill."
"No cause for alarm, Robin."
"I feel fine, just fine."
"You see, Robin baby."
Now be a good little Boy Wonder and do just as I say.
"No, I will not submit to your treachery!"
"Trap Door, sweetie pie, you're needed."
"Wrap up Robin, my boys."
Ah!
"Very good, kiddies."
You're learning the business.
Ha-ha-ha.
"Now, is there anything I can do for you, Black Widow?"
"As a matter of fact, there is."
I have a perfectly devastating idea.
"Masked Muscles, you go back through the tunnel into my main web and have a little drink to the latest development."
"Ha, ha."
"- How does that grab you, doll?"
-Fine.
- Could we take Robin along too?
-But of course.
"No Robin, no Dynamic Duo."
- N'est-ce pas?
"- Ha, ha."
"Now, I imagine Robin is getting a bit heavy?"
"Boys, I'm sure the Bat-doll would like to get rid of him."
Better tie him up.
"Well, Bat-doll, perhaps you would like some champagne?"
I never touch spirits.
Have you some milk?
Milk?
"Oh, yes, yes."
"Oh, maybe Trap Door has some."
"Oh, great."
Perfect turns on every track I've ever raced on.
"Sheriff, why don't you go get yourself a quart of oil at Flo's."
I'll keep an eye on him.
"Well, thanks, Doc."
I've been feelin' a quart low.
"This ain't asphalt, son."
This is dirt.
"Oh, great."
What do you want?
You here to gloat?
"You don't have three-wheel brakes, so you got to pitch it hard, break it loose and then just drive it with the throttle."
"Give it too much, you'll be outta the dirt and into the tulips."
"So you're a judge, a doctor and a racing expert."
I'll put it simple.
"If you're goin' hard enough left, you'll find yourself turning' right."
Oh...
Right.
That makes perfect sense.
Turn right to go left!
Yes!
Thank you!
"Or should I say, ""No, thank you""?"
"Because in Opposite World, maybe that really means, ""Thank you""!"
Crazy grandpa car.
What an idiot!
Turn right to go left.
Hmm...
Whoa!
Oh!
Ow!
"Oh, that..."
- He doesn't know about it?
- No.
- He's my old friend.
- Right.
I need you to help to talk her out of it.
Just like a breast intervention.
How am I supposed to bring this up?
That's okay.
I'll think of something.
You always think of something.
I don't know.
Is everything else good in your life?
- Be honest with me.
- Hmm?
"For the first time in over a quarter of a century, tell me something that's really bugging you."
I have nothing to confide.
You have experienced a lot you have not shared.
"You've mentioned this to me that I don't confide in you,"
- and there's nothing to confide.
- You haven't confided in me
- in your entire life.
- How could you say...
- Hey!
- Hi!
- Hey.
- Uncle Richard!
Look at you from top to bottom.
"What a doll, huh?"
"- Oh, baby."
- Hi.
This is my fake niece Kim.

He does the best placas in East L.A. Check it out!
(MAN whistling)
Nice tits!
He had a lightweight jones going and got popped.
He's coming up to Folsom.
I want him in with us.
Can he take care of himself?
"He don't know nothing, but I'll be responsible for him."
You know what you're doing?
How you doing on the tecato side?
"I'm clean now, ese."
Thank you for helping us get this meeting together.
"Yeah, I'd do anything for my carnal."
"When you come up, if you need anything, let us know."
"You run into problems, we'll take care of it."
Gracias.

"And Lester, too."
He's an alcoholic.

I huff propane.
"And the worst part is, I only took those pills so I could go on that Commodores Gold Record and All-You-Can-Eat Jumbo Shrimps Cruise."
And now I can't go.
"Just don't think about it, C-bro."
Kind of tough not to think about it.
"Hey, what're you guys looking at?"
"No, Shrimpy Dave, don't look!"
Is that shrimp?
I'm off the wagon!
Ew.
I thought he'd be eating it.
"Lord, help Shrimpy Dave."
(slaps) Ow!
Yeah.
Yeah.
(LAUGHING)
(WHISPERS) That really hurt.
(GROANING)
I knew they weren't gonna come.
Maybe they got lost.
Maybe they got lost and they lost my phone number.
It was just a big joke on me.
I'm such an idiot.
No one wants to be friends with me.
I am sure there's some explanation.
"Get real, Grandma."
I'm pregnant and I'm new at the school and no one wants anything to do with me.
And I knew it was going to be that way going into this.
"Honey, don't say that."
"And, of course, I blew it with Ethan because I was the ""b"" word to him."
Bitch.
"Yes, I'm just surprised you said ""'b' word."""
"You have a tendency to use foul language, which I'm not completely opposed to when it's called for."
Why don't you call him?
"Oh, I can't."
I'll call him.
"No, it's stupid for me to have a boyfriend."
It's bad timing.
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)
I already called him.
Stay off the bed.
"Or the one she's on, anyway."
"So, mind if I come in?"
I guess not.
I told you those two weren't nice.

You won't get far in a motel room.
"Well, my business isn't doing so well lately."
"Business, my butt."
You call hidden cameras a business?
"Wait, so you recorded me with a hidden camera?"
- Is that it?
"- No, I didn't."
I told you to pay up last week.
"Give me a few days, and I promise I'll pay."
- You rotten bastard!
- What?
You said you're a poet.
Where's your camera?
Hand it over now!
What camera?
"No, there's a camera, but you saw already."
"It was covered, so nothing got recorded."

- Oh my God.
"Mom, please."
Angela. I can accept that you have a boyfriend.
I don't have a boyfriend.
Fine.

A male pal.
Whatever word you want to choose.
The point is...
"I'm your mother, and I don't think you're ready."
"- Mom, please."
- l don't think you're ready.
But...
I have to know if this is what's happening...
because I don't think that I keep you from--
"- Mom, I beg you to stop."
"- l need to know that you are using-- l mean, I remember how this feels, I do..."
but it's the times that we live in...
"- Mom, please."
- Honey...
"I know you do not want to think about these things, I know..."
- you think you are invulnerable...

"All right, I'll show you how to set it."

Okay.
- Hi.
- Hi.
"- You like me, don't you?"
- Yeah.
- You want me to be your girlfriend?

I'm not gonna kiss you until I get my braces off.
"And that won't be for a while, like maybe even a year."

"Okay, then."

"So you are saying Sergeant Major Seo, Myeong Joo and you were a love triangle?"
Yes.
Hold my hand.
And it's still valid?
- Yes.
- Then how about your opinion?
Why are you curious about my opinion?
When was it that you dumped me...
I am just asking.
I am just asking.
I am not curious about your opinion.

"Yeah, I don't have time to go to fancy restaurants like you."
- Are we doing this now?
- You were out for a date on our anniversary?
!
- How do you know it was a date?
!
I just wanted to see you.
I haven't asked you if you're seeing anyone else and I'm not going to because I just can't.
- He's a friend.
"- Oh, well..."
- And a divorce lawyer.
- What?
"- I'm worried, Harry."
I don't want to lose anything else after the house.
So that's what you were discussing with your friend the divorce lawyer over dinner?
"- Well, that's very convenient, eh?"
"- You're still gambling, aren't you?"
What?
Aren't you?
"I'm trying, Anna."
"Do something about it, Harry."
For all of us.
Mr and Mrs Clayton?
OK?
Mr Clayton?
There's someone to see you.
I'm sorry about your daughter.
Is she OK?
Yes.
"Today, you are a downpour from up above... that drenches all my heart."
A small word said in passing...
"It is chilly, it is true, listen."
You added sweetness to what you spoke.
My feminity is stunned.
Should I blush away?
Or climb up high to touch the clouds?
Should I yearn even more
Or look for more words to speak?
With the wishes as a garland...
Shall I go around you all day long?
Rhino.
I'll close the restaurant.
Mom wants you home; you leave.
Okay.
"Sorry, sir."
We are closed.
Someone named Varun...
I'm Varun.
And you are?
Your eyesight?
I had lost it earlier.
After a surgery now...
"Sir, who are you?"
Do you remember Deepa?
Sir!
I'm her father.
Why did you let us down like that!
"Sir, what do you mean?"
Didn't Deepa come now?
Where is Deepa?
"She told us happily that you offered to help us with the money, that all our problems will go away..."
"OK, Number Two."
Right.
Go!
"OK, Number Three."
"Stand by, Number Three."
Ready.
Go!
Look at mine.
"Oh, the silly, clumsy clot."
"OK, Number Five."
They're not a bad bunch.
I've seen worse.
Gardner!
From now on I'm in business strictly with you.
"Nothing like an old, established firm."
Heavy.
Hm.
How about a drink tonight?
I might be able to manage...
Have a nice trip?
You didn't have to push me.
"No offence, just trying to help."
I don't need that kind of help.
What makes you such a ruddy hero?
It just ain't natural.
If he puts his hands on me again I'll brain him.
How about that drink?
"Thank you, but this firm doesn't mix business with pleasure."
"Gentlemen, we don't know one another very well yet."
This morning you start your training and we can start to find out.
Now for myself.
"Information, I'm a professional soldier."
- Is it?
"You guys, nobody better fall sleep watching this commentary."
- Let's talk about this damn church.
- This is one of my favorite churches.
"- That's like Broadway, right?"
- Andy Samberg is genius.
- Famous street in New York.
"- Yeah, but it's..."
"Mike, why don't you talk about what it was like to film this?"
- How did you...?
"Yeah, you guys..."
- This was very late.
I remember it was the last thing in the night.
"- Andy was around for hours, though."
- Yeah.
"In fact, this was the same night as the convenience store thing."
- Right.
"- So this was, like, 6 in the morning."
"We started shooting the next scene at about 5, 5:30."
Yeah.
And we had to finish before the sun came up.
Yeah.
And we had to finish before the sun came up.
- This...
That.
- That.
Let's talk about that.
That is so good.
- It's so frigging good.
- Let's talk about it.
Let's discuss that.
"When you push those doors and you say, ""Yeah."""
The stuff you can't see.
I've known Walter my whole life.
God!
He's a decent man.
- He's a good man.
- But this is tough stuff.
This is body bag stuff.
Tell me if there's some other way.
There's isn't.
Die's been cast.
It was cast a long time ago.
Go easy.
Give him a blindfold and have mercy.
"Walter Stern was a tough man, but he was fair."
We give back the same.
No?
And you be careful.
Keep George with you.
Let him drive.
I got to go in here.
I knew James Wakeley would surface just as I knew when that bullet hit that boy it would keep traveling.
And find its way...
To me.
If only it had found me first.
It is not the way of a lust people !
"How could you lie to me, you butcher !"
How could you make me love you ?
I did not give you permission to leave !
She doesn't need anyone's permission.
Let her go !
Enough of this childishness !
Throw them in the slave pits !
EZRA:
Hmm.
Perhaps I could be persuaded to act as your advocate.
You?
[LAUGHS]
You're the one who had me locked up.
I don't find your story compellingly truthful.
"Well, I don't care what you think."
I know I'm innocent.
"All right, suit yourself."
Holler if you change your mind.
[EZRA chuckling ]
The judge says one of us needs to represent my father.
I don't think it should be me.
-Chris?
-What?
"Hell, Nathan, you know Chris don't say more than three words in a day."
"My apologies, Nathan, but I have legal issues of my own to deal with."
"That's all right, Ezra."
I wasn't thinking about asking you.
"Well, what you need is an honest, well-spoken..."
... handsomemanforthisjob.
"Fine, I'll do it."
Ain't nobody gonna listen to a youngster.
"Buck, you see a pretty girl in that courtroom, you're gonna be:"
I was thinking about Vin.
I get too nervous in front of a crowd.
What about Josiah?
He studied Cherokee law.
-That should count for something.
-And he's got a suit.
Josiah.
"- Couldn't lend us a ten-spot, could you?"
"- Yeah, course, our kid."
"Cheers, bro."
"- Nicely, nicely!"
- That's a bit of a relief.
Bit of a relief?
Bit of a relief?
I feel like I've just done a dump the size of a man's head.
Troy?
"Look, about that tenner."
There's... no rush for paying' us back.
As long as it's within one calendar month.
"- Moz, I know we've never been close..."
"- No, we hate each other."
"- No, we don't."
"- We do, don't we?"
We might.
"Look, I don't want to see you get hurt."
You can't always trust your friends.
- Aye aye!
- Or the law.
"Yeah, well, sayonara, Señor Paranoia!"
"All right, filth?"
Still got that tattoo of a Dalek on your arse?
"I can't stay long, Moz."
I'm mounted.
"What, you left Shergar outside?"
You'd best leave.
The kids round here'll melt him down for glue.
"Right, then, Moz, we'll be off..."
"Right, then."
"See you, lads."
Mom taught me.
Your mother was a great student.
She'd be...
I want to go back to the circus.
I want to go home.
Let's get Quico out of bed.
I'll take you to the beach.
"No, I want to go home."
Eat your bread.
What are you looking at?
Nothing.
Do you see anything?
I'mjust looking.
"Maria, when you're back in the circus someday, can you take me along?"
I want to see you walk the tightrope.
"Look, Marcia."
I made this for you.
It's beautiful.
It used to be my favorite toy.
"Whenever it rained hard, I set it in the water to watch it float down the gutter."
I stared as it floated away.
Take me to the circus.
What about your mother?
She can't tell me what to do anymore.
Going back still scares me.
Maybe it's best if I keep as a painter.
You're an artist.
You belong in the circus.
"Young man, I regret to inform you that this love will not last."
"How do you know, mom?"
Have you ever truly loved someone?
"Mom, dad!"
Phew.
"Listen, O'Leary, I know we're up against it time-wise, but, er..."
"Yeah, big time."
"We've got like, we've got to save Simon."
"Dermot, give me a second."
There's a bit of a big deal happening.
Right.
"Sid Lowecroft is leaving, um, this is a little present for his daughter."
"Oh, OK."
Put this on.
But he doesn't know who I am.
"That's what the whole kick is, he'll get a kick out of the new guy."
"He won't get a kick out of it, he'll go, ""Who are you?"
"""Why are you gate-crashing my last day?"""
"No, he won't, as soon as he walks in, blow that."
"Then give him the doll, read out the letter."
Yeah.
It's some kind words that I've written down for him.
OK.
And then let one of these bad boys off.
"Doll, letter, boom."
Bingo.
I'm going to go and get the cake.
Let him know that we're ready.
You're not in this with me?
"No, no, no, no, I'm just going to go and get a cake."
"Right, hide under there when he comes in."
Right.
Are you ready for this?
Under there?
"Yeah, under there."
Under there.
"Okay, you go on, I'll be right there I go first..."
Okay!
This is the best harvest ever!
"Ah-fang, you devil!"
Stop crashing around!
What're you in such a rush for you idiot?
I'm racing with Master Chang I left that old fellow 80 feet behind!
Eighty feet behind?
Who...who's that?
Somebody's stolen the grapes!
Yes...for the third time already!
Can we still make Night-sweet Premium?
"They really know their stuff, to steal here"
Come!
A thousand coppers a string!
Come!
Crystal grapes!
Real crystal grapes!
A rare chance!
A thousand coppers a string!
"Crystal grapes, come..."
Come on!
Taste them-real crystal grapes!
You can only get them here!
Real crystal grapes
Only here...
Taste them
"Taste them-only 1 ,000 coppers a string!"
"Have a taste, everybody!"
Eight hundred coppers-800 a string!
"Real crystal grapes, 800 a string!"
Six hundred a string!
Enough!
That's enough!
"If he doesn't remember you Joy, It only means... that his lost of memory is centered on the times you were together."
Is that why he can't remember me?
.
How long will this amnesia last?
.
Will he get his memory back?
.
"We can never tell right now, there are instances when the memories come back after a few weeks or months."
"But in some cases, the memory doesn't come back anymore."
But how is that?
I'm his wife.
Treat him like your patient.
I'll be out later.
"Come on, let's go there."
How are you feeling Migs?
.
How are you feeling Migs?
.
Who exactly are you?
.
I'm Joy.
I'm your wife.
I don't remember anything.
There are so many things I can't remember.
Son?
.
"Mom, what's happening?"
.
"Joy, can I talk to Migs for a while?"
.
Anything I can do?
"No, thanks, Frank."
[GUNFIRE]
They'll be blasting it open pretty soon.
"Stacey, the riot's a bust."
Get back in your cell while there's still a chance.
"No, won't do me no good now, kid."
"I still got that Limpy rap hanging over me, even though it was-- [EXPLOSION]"
It wasn't my job.
I wouldn't appear against you.
I know it.
"It's no use, Frank."
This is the last roundup for Stacey.
[GUNSHOTS]
But there's still that unfinished business of yours to take care of.
It's still okay.
Where's Polecat?
Over there.
I wanna talk to him.
Didn't I tell ya I had a surprise for ya?
Come on.
I ain't got no time to waste.
"Funny, just an hour ago, I had 199 years."
And now I ain't got no time at all.
I'll get the rat.
[GUNSHOTS]
We got an affidavit from Shake Edwards before I came back in here.
What about those guys who framed me?
Did you get them?
Yeah.
"Well, rat."
So it caught up with you.
You will shut down the complete cooling system of the furnace.
[alarm ringing]
It's a red light on the cooling system.
It must be a circuit breaker.
Restart the system.
I can't get a restart.
Hit the backup system.
It's no-go on backup.
Temperature increasing in the furnace.
- Get that coolant flowing.
- [phone buzzes]
- Furnace control.
- Control?
"You don't really think you're controlling anything, do you?"
- [alarm continues buzzing] - who is this?
"[victor] this is Dr.VictorGannon,"
It's the finest picture I've ever seen.
"They've gone, every single one."
Who have?
- Percy's pack of suitors.
So will he be OK?
- Yes.
The whole thing has disappeared.
Roly's in seventh heaven.
"Morning, Helen."
"Morning, James."
"- (Helen) Morning, Siegfried."
A quiet night?
"Yes, only one call and that was delightful."
I delivered six bouncing Labrador puppies.
"That's right, my boy."
Your friend Mrs Farmer.
Ok I don't understand the deal about big dicks
I mean they just hurt.
I mean not that I've ever really experienced one.
Becca and Hallie are my two best girlfriends.
They're always game to listen to my problems and dispense useful commentary.
Toe suckers freak me out.
I heard that he photographed Charlize is that true?
I mean I love her she's like one of my favorite.
Top five for sure.
Maybe I'm just being jealous?
Ok how do you spell his last name?
Becca what are... tell me you're not looking him up on the internet?
I personally think your dog is your biggest issue in your dating life.
What?
"Question, where does Bowie sleep?"
He sleeps in my bed.
Ok but if a guy...
sleeps over where does Bowie go?
"Um, I guess he just stays in my bed."
Wait what about fleas?
More importantly what about sniffing?
Don't dogs sniff?
Bowie stop it.
Bowie...
"Ok, Ok you have a point."
Dating in general...
is difficult enough Dale.
Uh oh...
What?
Oh no...
Becca what?
Ok you know that German supermodel?
"Russian, Polish, I've got no idea."
Everybody's having a good time.
How did he get this off the wall?
I think the girls will hold out for quite a while.
"Let's do ""Russian Nights"" then."
We could do whatever we want.
They're really good!
"Good then, we'll have ""Russian nights""."
It doesn't exist?
There is no quiz show.
But you showed it to me?
That was just a starting point.
The starting point was good.
What a night!
"If you ask me, I personally prefer classical music."
You've been pouring the beer really well lately.
Lately?
I'm serious.
I'm heading out.
Then of course there are the fjords.
Wasn't that Norway?
They're everywhere up there.
Everywhere?
Everywhere.
"It's all one big fjord up there, if you ask me."
"Green, green, green."
And water.
Really.
You can believe it.
"Lucy, I just need five minutes of your time for my new client."
"Oh, my gosh, she look ridiculous."
"Jesse‎,‎.‎.‎."
‎
"- To the east there is‎, right‎?"
‎
- Yes‎.
‎
- Then we go around ‎.‎.‎. ‎

We removed the main road‎.

The trace of a mile but escaped‎.
Go and check the grinder‎.
"Okay‎, guys‎."

So ‎.‎.‎.

The film that we might work on together is actually sort of about that.
You're gonna work with Jim Jarmusch?
I don't want to go to a bar on Smith street.
Let's just go back to my place.
"I live with my dad, but he'll be out tonight."
- We can have a drink there.
- What year are you again at N.Y.U?
- Senior.
- Senior?
Okay.
"Wait, so you're 22, right?"
I'm going to be soon.
I'm 21.
"You don't think i'm too old, do you?"
I'm 30.
30 is cool.
I've been with guys older than you.
But are you a man or a boy?
"Well, what's the difference?"
With a man... you feel like you're being taken and you like it.
And with a boy you feel like they're stealing something from you and you don't like it.
This is it.
Thank you.
"Shit, my dad is home already."
We can go to seventh avenue and grab a drink.
We're going in his office.
It's fun in there.
It's a beautiful brownstone.
- Your dad's a therapist?
"- Yeah, he's a pain in the ass."
He thinks he's the Carl Jung of Brooklyn.
I like Carl Jung.
"Oh, my goodness."
Look at that power.
'The training had paid off.'
Well done!
Look at the speed of this man.
'Sort of...'
"Oh, mate!"
"Are you all right, mate?"
Talk us through it again.
Which one was a professional boxer(?
)
I was in the blue on the floor.
You were in the blue?
Looking ripped.

I look like somebody's made a human out of mashed potato.
JIMMY GUFFAWS
APPLAUSE
I would pay?
40 to see you fight Vladimir Klitschko.
I'd love to see that.
Yeah.
"He didn't like me when we met, either."
Why?
"Ah, I kept on, I said to him, ""If you win..."""
"He went, ""I will win."" I went on, ""If you win..."""
"""I will win."" Then I went,"
"""Isn't there any part of your head telling you you might not?"
"""How are you being that positive?"""
"And he went, ""Don't ask a fighter"
"""a question he can't answer with words."""
"And I tell you, I was that close."
Wait!
These are only lemon sharks!
This is all part of the course.
It is like life.
Like in relationships.
They will not attack unless they feel attacked!
"Marcel, I need you to take the French out of your mouth and tell me what to do!"
Don't let them see your fear.
"Okay, I think we just hold tight, we play it cool, we don't make a move."
What was that?
What?
What was that?
"Jason, stop..."
He said not to panic!
He said not to panic!
I'm sitting in blood!
I'm sitting in blood!
"Marcel, this isn't a drill, buddy!"
You got real sharks here!
It's time to get the guns' and it's time to shoot some fish!
"Here on Eden, there are no guns!"
You got an American life at stake.
One life is not more important than another.
What do I do?
My friends and my wife left me to die.
"You must get out of the chum, but slowly."
Okay.
Swim slowly out of the chum!
Slowly.
Slowly.
"Yes, yes."
"Slowly, baby!"
No.
But we had aorai agreement.
"I me,he promised to pay me back."
With interest.
"I mean,I maxed out all of my cards, so you better findhat money."
What was he like the last time you saw him?
He was sweet.
We made love right before he left.
Use a condom?
I'm on the pill.
We were engaged.
"Abs,can dna still be recovered from lance corporal finn's skivvies?"
It would take the cooperation of weather and protection.
"He was wrapped in plastic and it's been cold,so... there's a decent chance."
"Well,run the tests."
We'll do a cheek swab on his fianc?
s.
"Wait,did you say ""fianc?"
s?
""" Like plural?"
Kinky.

"- For now,iri."
I need to follow you home and pickp his belongings.
I want them back when james returns.
He's dead.
He can't return.
"Look,I know he's not dead."
I would feel it in my heart.
We're soul mates.

Agent lee.

Just take your shirt off.
- It's not gay.
"Why can't I just get, like, all excited and passionately rip it off in the moment?"
- Why can't you just take your shirt off for us?
- Just drop it for now.
"All right, all right."
"Uh, maybe you should punch something."
- There you go.
"- Yeah, you should punch something..."
Why don't you punch this board?
Okay.
Hold it steady for me.
- Watch your eyes.
"- All right, come on."
Oh!
"Oh, that's..."
- That looks like it stings.
"- Oh, my God."
- What's that made out of?
"- It's a board, so it's, you know, made out of wood."
"- It's, like, particle board."
"- It's, like, harder than wood, dude."
- No.
- It's actually softer than wood.
"- Yeah, it's a lot softer than wood."
- Petrified wood.
"- What happened, man?"
I thought you were...
- I don't know.
- I wasn't drunk enough.
- You should be drunk for this.
I`m looking forward to a Iong ride.
You get to see the kids all the time!
I see them two minutes in the morning two minutes in the evening and maybe three hours on the weekend.
Someday I`II wake up and realize my little babies are all grown up!
And then what?
I just thought it might be easier to fly.
"Nothing worthwhile is easy, ellen."
We know that.
Kids?
Who wants to see the trip plan?
"Dad, we`re playing!"
"Okay, shut off the video games."
"Come on, Russ."
Shut it off.
I know you`II enjoy this.
I worked out the trip on the computer so that we get the maximum amount of fun time at WaIIey world without missing any of the good stuff along the way.
Here we go!
There`s us.
And there`s WaIIey world!
"Now, Iet`s just take a look at Day One."

"Honey, come on in!"
We`re going to do Day One!
"Now, there`s the family Truckster as we leave Chicago."
"Rusty, please, do not eat the Truckster!"
"Russ, do you mind?"
I`m trying to work this out here on the computer.
"Okay, Audrey."
"Thank you, Audrey."
That`s just great.
"Look out, Dad, here I come."
"AII right, that`s enough, Russ."
"Lawrence, I hate to be blunt."
"Maybe it's my age or my inability to be coy anymore in my life, but are you gay?"
"I mean, it's fine."
I have a son who's gay and I am a proud member of PFLAG.
- Are you... disappointed?
- No.
I'm curious.
I'm...
Why...?
Why date women?
I love women!
"I love their companionship, their friendship."
"I just want someone to go to museums, parties, take dancing."
Does that sound pathetic?
No.
"No, it sounds very familiar."
"If you want to call it a night, I'd understand."
"No, Lawrence."
Absolutely not.
We haven't eaten.
I'm starving to death.
You want to share an order of edamame with me?
- What time did you tell the sitter?
"- Twelve, latest."
It's 10:30 now.
This is ridiculous.
"Oh, God!"
Is that vomit?
I don't want to get close enough to confirm or deny.
This is the worst date night ever.
It's Betsy.
"Hey Betsy, what's up?"

"I will tell me he is my son, we talk regularly."
My wife says I'm supposed to trust someone.
What's it say about me that you're the one I trust?
♪ [both breathing heavily]
You seem different.
"Yeah, how so?"
You're just present. [chuckles]
I didn't realize I was being so absent.
What did you wanna tell me this morning?
Something was on your mind?
I wanna quit my job.
- What?
- [exhales]
I started a clinic outside the wall.
- Laura...
- I just can't take it anymore.
"The tongue extensions, the belly button removals."
I have a medical degree and I've never practiced real medicine
- until now.
- [exhales]
- You're worried.
- Yeah.
I get it.
It's reckless and it's dangerous.
"I know, but, Ben, I saved somebody's life today."
I got to be a real doctor.
We're trying to start a family.
I know.
You want me to stop?
No.
If this is what you need to do.
You're facing down your biggest fear and telling it to go to hell.
I think it's brave.
You have entered military academy.
Little Xiamu is having business in the high school.
"And I, finally graduated dan started looking for my first job!"
Wish me luck!
"My little Mumu, come pick your sister up!"
Your sister has got a job today!

"Mr. Lin, how are you?"

"- Yawang, now I'll send you to Hade Industry Group, and take a design plan back for me."
"Sure, no problem!"
"The projects of Manager Qu, have been handled by me!"
Besides...
Who are you?
I know what you're doing in this village.
I saw that room.
And I know what the fuck you're doing to my daughter!
"I want you... to stop what you're doing, and leave this village quietly."
I mean it.
Leave.
Quietly.
This is Gokseong.
My turf.
Don't mess around and get yourself killed.
Just leave.
"If you don't leave, you'll die."
"If you heard me, say something."
Or at least nod your fucking head!
Please answer.
"So, you're..."
"Shut up, bitch!"
You're blowing me off?
"Oh, I'm just not worth answering."
Is that it?
"You're not even gonna listen, right?"
Ain't that right?
"I'm trying to speak to you, but you're not listening!"
What's this?
What the fuck is this?
What the hell is all this?
What the...
What the fuck are these rituals you're doing?
!
What the fuck are you doing in my town!
Do you know whose daughter you're messing with?
Get out of my house!
This is my house!
Get out!
"Austin, what are you doing?"
I can't sleep.
Can I sleep with you?
When hell freezes over.
But I'm miserable.
I also threw up.
- Where?
- In the john.
But I still feel awful.
Okay.
I'll get you some ginger ale.
It'll settle your stomach.
I don't know how I got here.
"I mean, how did I become,"
"God, such a giant fuck-up."
Hey.
You were a...
pretty good doctor and a really good diet-pill salesman.
That was all bullshit-- the opposite of when I'm with my kids.
"That's when I was really myself-- watching ""Lost In Space,"""
"playing concentration, grilled cheese."
"Well, you are..."
on their level.
That is for sure.
"I always figured having kids would force me to grow up, but... it was the total opposite."
I knew who I was with my kids.
It's the only thing I was good at.
That is not true.
"You know it's true, Betty."
Let's get her on the phone.
I'll tell her myself.
You leave my wife out of this.
You dragged her into it when you broke the law with your boss.
"You pay, she pays."
Hmm.
He's about to fold.
And admit what?
"If I had my way, damn near everything."
This guy washes stark's underwear.
He knows.
"Hey, it's just getting good."
I should get back to my station.
I'm sure the last thing you want is to put anna on a plane
And have to explain why.
"All right, I'll let you take my shift."
"It's a one-time offer, carter."
Carter!
"Excuse me, chief dooley."
"I need your signature, sir."
What?
Can't it wait?
I'm afraid the codes are ready for analysis.
I need your approval.
Thank you.
Why don't you sit here awhile?
Think about it.
I'm gonna get a coffee.
You want something?
That's my cue.
What do you think?
I think he's on the verge of telling you
"They're cops,jody."
What is she doing here?
I called her.
She should know what's going on.
"Well,it's coming out of your profits,bob."
"Wait a minute,jody."
That sisal's expensive.
"You need to calm down,mrs.Carvell."
Calm down?
I just found a dead guy in the living room and I am losing money every day.
"Ohand my father just died of leukemia, so don't you tell me to calm down."
"I'm thinking before we open this up, maybe we should rub some vick's under our noses."
I don't think we'll find a body.
Hope not.
Hate that.
Nothing?
"Well,whatever lance corporal finn was planning on putting in here, he didn't get a chance to."
"Mcgee,give me your flashlight."
You didn't bring your own?
It's too heavy.It pulls my pants down.
Now close the door.
To the right.To the right.
Yeah.
"Just,more to the left.More to the left."
-Okay.
"-Okay,hold it."
Yeah.
too small to hold a body.
Big enough to hold a head.
Is that what I think it is?
"Oh,yes."
Gold.
"""Well, uh,"
"""that bitch gets a lot of exposure."
"""I mean, because, uh, uh, uh..."
"""uh, we all want to sleep with her."
"""Uh, me, Sasha, Malia."
"""Even my dog wants to hit that."
"""As a matter of fact, if I get caught, uh..."

"""Uh, I mean, come on, everybody."
"""Uh, her skin is soft."
"""Uh, she looks good."
"And, uh, that ass is bigger than the deficit."""
"Aw, man, I would love to see that dude in the strip club."
That'd be hilarious.
"He just be in the strip club, he be..."
"""Well, uh, thanks"
"""for bringing me here, Joe."
"""Uh, we gotta get a selfie with some of these asses."
"""Uh, hashtag it 'Obama-rama.'"
"""Uh, I can get her to come over here if you want me to."
"""She knows who the hell I am."
"""All right, let me get her."
"""Uh, Peppermint, come here."
"""Uh, come on, sit down right here."
"""Now, uh, my friend here, Joe Biden,"
"""he's, uh, he's pretty shy."
"""But he wants you to know that, uh,"
"""you're very beautiful, and, uh--oh!"
"""He won't make it rain."
"Uh, he'll make it Hurricane Sandy up in this bitch."""
"Now, my fantasy pick for a president would be Eddie Murphy."
L--Liverpool supporters!
"""A Song For Europe""."
Surely boring sounds better than that already!
There must be a happy medium.
There was.
Your c--cousin Ethel were a medium.
-
- I didn't know I had a cousin Ethel.
-
- She was your mother's cousin.
She used to do seances and the table r--rapping and all that.
-
- That's where I must get it!
-
- What?
I sometimes think I get little periods of precognition.
Do you?
It's just your plugs oiling up.
Don't worry about it.
-
- I'm being serious.
-
- So was your cousin Ethel.
"Oh, yes."
Night after night she used to try.
"Then one night, out of the b--blue -- well, out of the b--black, rather, suddenly there came this kn--knock."
A visitor from the spirit world?
"In a way, yes."
He was a chap who worked at the off--licence.
"He was looking for nice, honest, homely diggings."
-
- I don't believe a word of this.
"I know it's rough, man."
"I get it, you know?"
"He's your best friend and all, and you miss him like hell."
"But know this, he will never apologize to you."
- And he will never say that you're right.
"- I appreciate the concern, George."
I really do.
It's funny.
I always thought you didn't like me.
"Point is, you gotta stay strong."
We can't enable.
We gotta wait until the right time to let a person like that back in our life.
[yelps] Oh!
Shit!
[mutters] Fuck.
[knocking on door]
- Hi!
"- Hey, man."
"What's up, man?"
"Come on in, I was about to put a pot of coffee--"
"Oh, buddy, are you all right?"
You look a little torn up.
Yeah.
First time I've been in town and just-- kind of a lot of feelings and--
"Like, a big hole's opened up."
"Yeah, I guess."
You want some tape or something for that?
"Oh, yeah."
"No, if by ""something"" you mean a clean pair of pants?"
- I didn't realize we were winking.
"- Yeah, dude, we're winking."

"Mr. Stinkmeaner, do you understand what I've just told you?"
I'm a clone!
"Yes, created at this secret and highly illegal underground human cloning facility."
Why am I so old?
!
"Eh, what?"
"If you cloned me when you say you did, shouldn't I still be a little kid?"
!
The man who you are a clone of is Colonel H. Stinkmeaner.
He answered our volunteer recruitment ad on Blackpeoplemeet.
"A few days later, he died in a street fight."
Fuck him!
He dead!
I'm alive!
Motherfucker!
"He left you those clothes, that cane, and the glasses."
"He asked that if the cloning was successful, we relay this message."
"""Dear me, please go fuck with Robert J. Freeman."
I'm gonna go see if I can get some answers out of her.
What are you talking about?
I'm trying to find Trudy!
Talking to locals is the best way to get information!
"You guys should be doing it, too."
That's a great idea.
We split up.
"That way, we find her twice as fast."
"Shane, with me."
"We shouldn't split up, we should stay together."
"Listen, Dave, time is of the essence, okay, and if we don't find her, here's what else."
"We meet back at the exit in, like, an hour, okay?"
Come on.
Let's go.
"Jason, there's a ton of people here."
"If we split up, we're gonna..."
Stay with Joey.
This place rocks.
What are you doing?
What am I doing?
I'm trying to have a good time.
I'm trying to have a party going on.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
We gotta find Trudy.
I don't want to get into this.
"Come on, buddy."
"What, are you dying to be part of the new singles scene?"
Look at all these people.
"They're running around, they're..."
"I'm fucking with you, Cooper."
I told you to come up here to see if we've broken you enough to obey instructions without question.
- And we have.
"- Oh, no, no, no."
"Katie, come on."
"Katie, come on, let me out!"
"Katie, let me out, come on!"
What the fuck!
"Oh, what are you gonna do?"
"Oh, what are you doing to me?"
- Why are you doing this?
- You thought you'd see your mother.
"- Oh, fuck!"
- What does she look like?
"Your mother, can you describe her face?"
Her hair colour?
She...
"Is she tall, short, fat, thin?"
- Where did you grow up?
- She...
What's your favourite band?
Your favourite flavour ice cream?
The name of the girl who stabbed you?
"You don't know any of these things, do you?"
Don't you think that's odd?
It's fucking taking my memories!
"Overwriting them, technically."
Fuck.
Look in the mirror behind you.
Do you recognize yourself?
Do you even know who you're looking at?
Soon you won't be anything.
She's not feeling that well.
"Aw, no."
I'm sorry.
"No, it's nothing serious."
"I just haven't seen her in a while, so..."
I thought that...
My mom is not sick.
She's not sick.
Okay.
Where you going?
Away.
With a man I met from EST.
"What do you mean, ""Away""?"
Away.
I don't know.
"Uh, for a few days."
"We've, um... had this emotional connection for some time, and we just want to see if there is something else there."
You're telling me you're going to have an affair?
Sandra?
I might.
I don't know.
At least I'm being honest.
Go ahead.
Tell me that you're not having an affair.
I'm --
You know what kills me about the whole thing?
"Is that you didn't have any idea anything was going on -- you, Mr. Counterintelligence Genius."
You just didn't see it?
So you either didn't want to know or you didn't care enough to pay attention.
Who is he?
"Oh, it doesn't matter, really."
"- Who is he, Sandra?"
"Come on, Nami."
What's wrong?
No!
OK. I understand.
What happens is nothing to do with me!
Nothing whatsoever.
Who could do this?
Is she a porn model?
That can't be allowed.
I'm wondering what I should do as her supervisor.
There's no need for you to take responsibility in this case.
She's just a slut.
Yes.
It can't be tolerated.
Trust is very important in this industry.
Lay her off.
Of course.
"She looked nice, though."
Come with me.
No.
You're working at the department store?
Have you been following me?
What's wrong?
Has something happened to you?
Stop talking as if you're a friend.
Take this umbrella.
You should go home now.
I just wanted to apologize for having followed you like this.
I didn't intend to do anything like that.
Leave me alone.
I've had just about enough of it.
Please be quiet.
Yeah.
Do you remember that he had scars on his face?
"Oh, sure."
It would look like he was burned.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
"This is where your father had his office, right there, where it says tickets, upstairs."
That's 1501.
"That's where he was, right here."
[truck roars by]
(Kahn) The office at 1501 Walnut Street was the last place I saw my father.
My mother would bring me here sometimes after hours and on weekends.
Lou would lean out the top floor window and toss down a key wrapped in yellow tracing paper to let us in.

"(Louis Kahn) When I went to high school, I had a teacher in the arts who was head of the department, Central High:"
William Gray.
I am no longer amused.
You will die together.
"Give my regards to King Tut, asshole."
How much time do we have left?
- 45 seconds.
He's leaving.
Turn it off.
- I can't disarm it.
- What?
They've got it rigged.
I got an idea.
I always knew you'd get us back.
"- Yeah, right."
- Later.
"Thanks, Daniel."
You sure you wanna do this?
Ha
It was very strong ...
Fool!
Why you do not tell me before you do something like that?
!
Curse!
Why you not think about it in our lives?
I just want to train to get stronger.
Wow ...
That problem.
That's why I do not want to come across Bills-sama.
Huh?
Who is that Bills-sama?
can not be ... idiot ...
I knew it!
You're hiding something!
That's why you're acting so weird!
Is it a person?
There is a God.
It has the same level as Kaio Shin-sama.
he is coming here.
no problem.
He is a very cold and a very awesome God.
An awesome God?
"He is also called ""The God Of Destruction"
If there is something he does not like the the planet and lives ends up being destroyed.
Like when someone stamps on dogs shit?
sort of.
Like when you can not eat in the cafeteria?
sort of.
Like when someone urine into the hot springs?
Something like that!
I don't get to make these decisions.
"But, sir..."
I'm just a government employee.
Which government?
United States.
"Are you all right, ma'am?"
We heard there were six different people claiming the presidency.
There were.
"In fact, there are still a couple of holdouts--"
"Texas, a bloc in the East."
"The new federal government's been restored in Cheyenne, Wyoming."
"Colonel, this is an emergency."
You have to go to Jericho.
The fighting could be happening right now.
"I am very sorry, ma'am."
"Casper, you see she gets back to the medical unit."
"Come on, ma'am."
Get 'em out.
Why?
Get 'em out.
Clear everyone out.
You listen...
This place is where you survive.
"You make a stand here, you hear?"
We will.
I'm sorry you have to see this.
You been through enough.
"Dad, Dad, stop."
"You're stronger than you think you are, though."
Always have been.
"I love you, son."
"I guess I zigged when I should've zagged out there, huh?"
"This is DS Gray, SSU, requesting urgent armed response to Egmont Terrace, E1."
And send an ambulance.
(INHALES SHARPLY)
Did something happen?
"DS Gray DS Ripley, please escort Miss Calvert home."
"This way, please."
"Right, this way, please."
How are you feeling?
I'm angry.
Too angry?
Just angry enough.
"Because I can't have the wheels coming off this thing, John."
"They won't, Martin."
I fought tooth and nail to get you back into the fold.
I fought hard and I fought dirty.
Don't squander it now.
- I was just wondering...
- Yeah?
Would you mind just coming up with me?
"Just to check under the bed, that sort of thing."
- I just keep thinking...
"- Of course, that's not silly at all."

- West-sou'west!
- Lookout!
- Sail on the starboard quarter!
Sail?
Where?
I see only ships in anchor.
"Deck, there!"
Sail is an enemy frigate!
And another!
The French are out!
The French!
"Weigh anchor, beat to quarters."
The French are on the move.
Make to all ships.
Prepare to engage.
- They used the fog too.
- They're heading for our squadron.
Look.
That red glow.
"A fire ship, set on course in the breeze."
- She'll take the flagship!
- They can't move in time.
- Nor the others.
- They're going to burn!
"Vizard, I'm striking no bargains, and making no promises."
This ship is in your hands.
"There's nothing to stop you from running, but the enemy is there."
- All hands muster aft!
"- Lively, there!"
Sir.
"Well, lads, you see what's happening."
Ah.
"No, I didn't mean that."
It was supposed to be a gnome.
It looked more like a frog.
"When the teacher said, ""What's that, Julie?"" I said, ""Please, miss, it's a frog."""
I'm not usually so quick--thinking.
"She picked it up and said, ""It's a frog, is it?"""
"Then with a snooty expression she said, ""It looks like a gnome""!"
Yes.
"You lost me round about the second frog, Julie."
"No, what it is, I want you to model yourself."
I want you to be a model.
"Consider this while I unravel Gravel...er, Granville."
"About time, too."
"How would you feel about being Little Miss Arkwright's Stores, 1982?"
"No, thank you."
I've only got out of me pinny.
I'm not putting a dress on!
"Not you, you clown!"
I'm talking to Julie.
"Little Miss Arkwright's Stores, 1982?"
A central figure in our advertising c--campaign.
-
- Really?
-
- Could somebody get me out of here!
Quiet!
You're very noisy since you left your vest off!
-
- Just get me out!
-
- It's like a loudspeaker in the shop!
"Stupid, bloody engine, eh?"
How can one little drink...
I gotta get home or I'll be late.
How about a kiss?
Not thank you.
I could be back in action tomorrow... ?
Bon a fee passengers come on!
Bon a fee passengers to the right.
Catrin?
I got caught in the raid.
Ended up in the big street shelter.
I didn't know where you were.
I didn't know if you were safe.
I never know if you're safe.
Oh God!
Look at you.
I'll be alright after a cuppa tea.
They've already ruptured the mains.
"Look, Catrin..."
I want you to go back to Ebbw Vale.
Ellis!
It's the biggest steelworks in Europe.
"They are more likely to get bombed there, than here..."
It's just not the bombing.
I can't afford for us to live here anymore.
"I can't afford for us to live, anywhere."
I earn.
"If I want on my own, I can toss myself in a Paris studio."
I could keep painting.
You don't have to keep me.
I earn!
Your wages seem better off a husband's roof over your head.
She doesn't want to see me anymore
And i don't want to see her either.
"Look, i'm not gonna keep arguing with you about this."
"Michelle, you need to fix it."
- You don't need to keep...
- You need her.
Don't need to keep what?
"Hi, regina."
So what do i owe to this displeasure?
You know what?
I told you this wasn't a good idea.
See?
"I'm sorry to bother you, regina,"
May we please come in for a second?
We will not stay long.
I promise.
"Well, my day couldn't get any worse."
Come on in.
Get going.
so i brought michelle here
Because i think we all have some things we need to clear up.
Michelle told me what happened and...
And i'm sure she gave you
Her twisted version of things.
"Look, regina, i am tired of you disrespecting me."
"First i'm stupid, now i'm twisted?"
- You know what?
Let's go.
"- First, regina..."
Shh-Tch!
"First, regina,"
I want to apologize for any misunderstandings
What if I wake up?
Shan.
Believe it.
OK.
Come on.
Are they...?
They're wolves.
"Tom, they're wolves."
All this time.
It was wolves.
- My beast isn't a beast at all.
- How can there be wolves?
They've been extinct in Britain for years.
Maybe people just think they died out.
"Maybe they've been here all the time, surviving without anyone knowing."
"Right, you ready, Kyle?"
Sleeping animals are a lot easier to film than angry snarling ones.
Turns out The Beast wasn't a beast at all.
"Thought to be extinct in this country, these two wolves... have survived."
Their existence a secret for years... until I found them.
"Not a bad night's work, eh?"
They're waking up.
You should let them go now.
Why would I do that?
"Give us a hand, Steve."
What are you doing?
"I'm not going to leave them here for someone else to find, am I?"
So you're keeping them?
"As what, some sort of trophy?"
For now.
Then I'll sell them off to a zoo or something.
Why?
You're Lori's trampy friend.
"Oh, no, that's Hillary."
"Well, whoever you are,"

"So, uh, I'll see you at the Rack later?"
"Look, thanks a lot."
That's what I get paid the big bucks for.
"Speaking of which, that will be two hundred of them."
"Right, remember?"
Yeah listen.
Alls I got is thirty right now.
"Hey, that's nice. 18 karat?"
"Forget it, sentimental value."
Sentiment has no value.
Sentiment has no value.
How about I give you this now and I'll give you the rest next week when I get paid.
"How about you give me the ring, or I'll dial 9-1-1."
"Take it, but if you call the cops, I'll find you and I'll fucking bury you."

Here's hoping that Dr. Jekyll thinks of his lvy as I know he'd like to.
As his lvy thinks of him.
Because he's an angel.
Here's to my angel.
Surprised?
Couldn't be that you didn't expect to see me?
No.
I've been...
I've been waiting for you.
But you've been celebrating.
Though your dreams be tossed
And blown
"Walk on, walk on"
With hope in your heart
And you'll never walk alone
I know the water's rising.
It's up to the floorboards.
But I guarantee you...
... we'rebailingit outfasterthan  we're taking it in.
Let me call you back.
I'll call you when we can talk at length.
Anselmo just killed himself.
And this is the original probation report.
The one we were looking for.
They found it in Anselmo's car.
The police commissioner gave it to me.
He didn't want it ending up as tomorrow's headline.
"""""Tino Zapatti."
Recommended prison sentence:
"1 0 to 20 years. """""
-Check this one out?
-This one's kosher.
The story ends where it began.
"White-shoe lawyer, Brooklyn clubhouse boss."
Walter Stern and Frank Anselmo.
Don't see them in the same room.
"Something's still wrong, you know?"
I know.
Before we nail up the house for the season...
... onemoredoortoclose.
"Afternoon, Mr. Calhoun."
"-Sorry, the judge left for the day."
Come.
Arrangements for the night is done
Which is your room?
Situation is somewhat like this.
There's only one room
And we spend the night in the same room?
You presume somewhat like that?
How compelling!
- Not quite so compelling
I'm not staying here one minute.
- You take the bed.
I'll take the sofa
No problems.
- No way.
I'm leaving
I'm not joking.
I'm going away.
- And I'll have the bed all to myself?
So nice... so romantic!
And these curtains... so nice!
And the view!
No horses?
It's so warm in here
There!
You have a fire going
Granted.
You have a great sense of choice
"You couldn't find a better place to spend the night, right?"
We were getting a nice room
But you'd rather spend the night with me in the stables.
Not in the room
Eat
And you know it.
"You see, that's where you're wrong, mr."
Enright.
"So, what are you saying?"
You going to do a better job than the world-famous lapd?
If any of these crime scene photos would have shown
"Who took that cuff link,"
I think someone would have noticed by now.
Somebody did notice.
"Eric, take a look at this."
It's the same lady in every one of these photos.
Yes.
Watch this.
"Bang, bang, bang."
That's her again.
She's got...
She's got a camera.
"Eric, she can help us."
"h, in a city as big as l.A.,"
How are we going to find one girl?
This is how.
She's got a press pass.
Olivia burch.
Excuse me.
Captain sutter.
"Enjoying your lunch, lieutenant?"
"Yes, as a matter of fact we are."
"We're doing what we came to los angeles to do, captain."
Then you know you're wasting your time.
That's called clean police work.
Are you suggesting I'm not clean?
"I guess we're about to find out, captain."
Sylvia coming over?
You're not going to believe what happened. I gotta tell you that.
-What are you laughing at?
-Problem with the apartment?
That's an attitude I don't appreciate.
"As it turns out, I got an-- l do have a problem at my apartment."
-A gas leak.
-l didn't say anything.
But what's that?
What's that goofy grin for?
"What, you think I'd destroy my own gas installation?"
It's gonna get repaired.
It may take a few days...
... butyouknowthe way thingsare with utilities.
"Hey, the point is, is that I'm ready for her to come over."
Good. I'm glad to hear it.
Good for you.
Yeah.
"Great, the Amazing Hulk."
"Detective, I owe you an apology."
I shouldn't have gotten in your face.
I was out of line.
-No problem.
-Bygones be bygones?
Yeah.
I was thinking maybe you'd put in a good word for me with Janice Licalsi.
"If she knows we're cool, she might let me up."
-She put in to ride with someone else.
-l think you need to talk to her about that.
Mm-hm.
"Okay, no problem."
"Give me 20 minutes a day, I could get you tightened up in a month."
I came to offer you true happiness.
"I'll marry you, Elise, you'll live in luxury!"
"You can even bring the child, if you want to."
You're a lucky girl.
"I was happy with my Henry, but then my luck flew away."
"Except for - look, they have the same eyes."
I'm sick of your comedy.
Keep your palace.
I don't want it.
And get out!
I'll stay true to Henry even though he's gone!
Impossible!
You must marry me!
Leave Elisa alone!
She's got to marry me!
She must marry me!
"So you won't let her be, you nasty wretch?"
We've had really enough of you.
We saw right through you!
Get out or I'll change you into a limping mare!
- You said you can't do it.
"- I know, but he doesn't."
Let's scare him out of his wits!
"Climb on my back, quick."
Don't drop me!
"Jean, it's me!"
The Duke!
"It's all her fault, and she's waiting for you!"
- Who?
- The old witch!
Our salvation!
But your Grace...
"I tried to give it to my daughter, but she... threw it back at me."
I think you're about her size.
Could you try it on?
I'll wait in the other room.
Got the bullets.
You'll be surprised how many places I...
What's goin' on?
How do I look?
Ok.
Where did you get it?
He gave it to me.
What for?
"I don't know, Vi."
Can I talk to you a minute?
Have you lost your mind?
- What's your problem?
- You're my problem!
I'll let you borrow it some time if that's what this is about.
It's not about the fucking dress!
"- Yea, right."
- That's exactly right!
"You don't run me, Violet!"
We don't know anybody.
or get involved in stuff or anything like that.
I never went to a prom.
"You did, but I didn't."
- Be glad you didn't!
- Why?
- Because they would laugh at you!
- How do you know?
Because that's what they do if you're different.
"Everybody isn't like that, Vi."
Wait!
Those beautiful days of childhood.
"50 years later, the Nobel laureate Adam Bernau wrote in Volume One of the Memoirs, page 63, ""I was dreaming about discoveries that could improve the life of the entire human race."""
I'd like to emphasize that I don't agree.
It's pointless.
There is no other way.
Get ready...
We're going.
Helicopter!
Maximum alert!
"This is gonna cost you a lot, pal!"
- Where do you think that car was?
- There.
"I saw it, but then it drove off that way."
And what happened to the hut?
It just collapsed all by itself?
Look!
Rum!
It's worse than that.
It's brandy.
- But I... please...
- We know!
I'm impressed!
"The car only used up 30% energy,"
Instead of the allowed 70%.
Thanks to you!
- I'll remember that!
"- And you wanted to return, remember?"
"- Well, yeah."
"I'll never forgive you, you understand?"
Unless...
"So, what is it?"
-l'll take care of it.
"-Tell him what you were telling me about, Frenchy."
-Too good to be true.
Big score coming from Air France.
Bags of money like this coming in. ok?
Tourists and American servicemen change their money over into French money and send it back here.
-Calm down.
-lt's beautiful.
"It's totally, totally untraceable."
"Our only problem is getting a key, but I got a plan."
-Me and Frenchy and this citizen.
"-Yeah, he's a piece of work."
"If I'm right, there could be half a mil coming in, all cash."
The best time is probably over a weekend.
So maybe Saturday night.
There's a Jewish holiday Monday.
They won't find out until Tuesday.
Beautiful.
What about the security?
Security?
You're looking at it. lt's a joke.
I'm the midnight-to-eight man.
I'm the commandant.
He just comes in like he's picking up lost baggage with Tommy
-lt's beautiful.
-lt won't be a problem at all.
-Good.
-We're on.
What's really funny is that fucking bank job in Secaucus.
"I'm in the middle of the fuckin' weeds, laying down."
"He comes over he says, ""What are you doing?"" l said, ""Restin'."""
"""Here, you're resting'?"""
Take it easy.
I'm sorry.
Please.
"Hey, Jerry."
"George, you decided to get a rug."
"Good for you, Jack."
"Well, I'm just looking, really."
"Tommy, I'm gonna need a little adjustment."
I'll be right with you.
"Listen, George, I got some bad news."
I'm not gonna be able to give you that parking space.
- What?
- What?
This judge has to use it for some scofflaw.
"And you know, you can't fight city hall."
"You know, Gary I had a little chat with George the other day."
- You didn't!
- I did.
And he told me that...
- I'm not 100 percent recovered yet.
- Give me that thing.
How's your life?
All right?
"Yeah, not bad at all."
"And now, ladies and gentlemen of the press it is my pleasure to introduce you to Mr. Jake Jarmel."
"So, Jake, what's your percentage on this book?"
"Actually, I have some very interesting information on that."
"- You know, this is a co-venture..."
- Where did you get those?
- And as such it...
- Those glasses.
- Where did you get those glasses?
Just assume it's a ha bit.
- Ha bit left unchanged... tends to become necessity-like.
"- Philosophy, again?"
You're twelve
Talk like a 12-year old!
Why all this big talk?
"There's no childhood, no adulthood."
One is as grown-up as one feels
All right!
I lose!
"Now go to school, chew your teacher's brains, okay?"
Why d' you forget the almonds everyday?
What to do?
Just assume it's ha bit
Will you get out?
"""This is the first time it's happening in 18 years"""
"""Some stranger I have never seen, comes to my mind"""
That's my diary!
- So what...?
Only I can read it.
- That was so funny
Let me read some more.
- No way!
This is a private diary.
Why hide anything from me?
When a girl is grown up... her mother becomes her friend.
Show that to me
"You won't tell anyone, will you?"
- Never
All right.
I'll read.
You listen.
I'm not going anywhere.
You're too important ?
It's not negotiable.
Get him an escort.
And start getting everyone into position.
Who knows when they're gonna come back again?
Jake?
Go ahead.
So they got their reinforcements.
It's a couple hundred men.
And another six of those deuce and a halfs.
"They're mobilizing now, so I say you got about 15, maybe 20 minutes before they're on you."
"All right, you get back here as soon as you can."
All right?
"Say, what do you know about a set of train tracks running alongside the river?"
Why?
What do you see?
"Hawkins, what's on the tracks?"
I don't know.
I can't see.
Hawkins...
Robert...
"Robert, disconnect it."
Hang on.
"Jake, you got a very large train coming from New Bern and they've got three cargo cars."
What's in them?
"I think it's men, and there's hundreds of them."
It's a whole set of reinforcement...
"Hawkins, what's going on?"
Talk to me.
"Jake, I'm on my way."
I've got to go.
Rashad!
What'd they say?
She's there.
We're getting her exact location now.
Good.
Have my men dump him into the ocean.
"Uh, okay, whoa."
Whoa.
You can't just dump him.
I'm involved now.
"His body washes up on South Beach, there's gonna be an investigation, an autopsy."
It won't take long before those drugs are traced back to me.
What do I care?
It's not my problem.
Let me at least just take the body back to the hospital.
We'll dump it in the incinerator.
Nobody will know.
"But we got to move fast, 'cause security comes on at 4:00."
You got the information you needed.
Let us take care of this.
"Mr. Hamady, you saved my life."
It's the least I could do.
Fine.
Take him.
I'm done here.
Jesse!
How long has it been?
Four minutes.
Four minutes?
We're cutting it pretty close.
Come on.
Let's get out of here before Jabbar sees us.
-Henry says don't let the sauce stick.
-l'm stirring it.
"-Listen, you know what to do?"
"-Yeah, yeah."
"Don't ""yeah, yeah"" me, Lois!"
This is important.
Make sure you leave the house when you make the call.
Understand me?
Call from an outside line.
I mean it!
"Jesus, you must think I'm dumb."
I know what to do.
"Hey, you little hick, just make sure you do it!"
You're such a pain.
-Hey!
Just do it!
-Okay.
Un-fucking-believable.
All of them.
Every fucking girl in my life.
-What'd he say?
-Nothing.
So what does she do after she hangs up with me?
After everything I told her?
"After all her ""yeah, yeah"" bullshit?"
She calls from the house.
If anyone was listening they'd know everything.
They'd know a package was leaving my house and they'd have the flight number.
"As soon as I got home, I started cooking."
I had a few hours until Lois' flight.
I told my brother to watch on the stove.
All day long the poor guy's been watching helicopters and tomato sauce.
And you know what?
I'm gonna help you find your time capsule!
"Not tonight, though, 'cause sean and darrin are coming over,"
"And we're punching each other in the stomach,"
"You know, firming up the core,"
But tomorrow we're gonna find that time capsule!
"Oh, hey, Brick."
"Hey, when are you supposed to get your math test back?"
"Oh, I already got it."
Whoa.
Hold on.
How'd you do?
"Some might call it a very low ""d."""
Some might call it a d-minus.
What?
You did worse?
"Well, I was confident going in."
"Eh, well."
What are you gonna do?
This is nuts.
What do you think happened?
I'll tell you what happened.
Ms. Rinsky is what happened.
She's just a bad teacher!
Mm.
Could be.
"She intimidates people, mike."
I experienced it firsthand.
You can't do math
"With those cold, dead eyes staring at you."
Brick probably melted down just like I did.
Probably.
I know nothing about bullfighting but a lot about desperate women.
Yeah?
And who told you I'm desperate?
You gave me that impression.
You don't care about bullfighting.
You're interested in my relationship with El Nino.
"Tell ""El Pais"" the answer's no and leave me alone!"
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Get me out of here!
- What's wrong?
"Get me out of here, please."
There's a snake in the kitchen!
Give me the keys.
- The door's open.
"- Calm down, and stay here."
My purse...
Thank you.
Take me to a hotel.
I'm never going back to that house.
Which hotel?
"- The Eurobuilding, for example."
- Very well.
"Don't tell anyone about this snake business, please."
- Only my family knows about it.
- Don't worry.
One thing I respect is other people's phobias.
"After all you've done,"
I feel bad about saying no to the profile.
Sleep on it.
I'll call you tomorrow for your decision.
Thank you for everything.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Was I too loud?
"No, that wasn't bad at all."

Mr. Corey has no information about what transpired on that boat.
"Oh, that's great."
Let him testify to that.
"Your Honor, this is unfair surprise."
We have the right to call him.

-Over my dead body.
-That can be arranged.
Come along.
"-Oh, good day, beautiful Maudie."
-You corpulent cockroach.
That's enough.
You claim Mr. Wingo put those cuff links in your bag.
True?
He put them there so I'd agree to marry him.
"-Blackmail, Mr. Wingo?"
"-No, no, she stole them."
"- huh, you dipshit?"
"- Uh, Gene?"
G-Gene?
"Uh, no, I'm not coming to Fort Lauderdale."
Why would you think that?
What?
[Chuckles]
"Because you're still using the corporate credit card, you dummy."
"Listen, Nate,"
I don't know why you're doing this.
I don't know if you're trying to embarrass me.
I don't know if you're trying to sell this product to another company.
"Hey, man, I thought you cared about this company."
[Laughter]
Of course I care.
"What are you talking about, man?"
- I care more than anyone else.
- Shh.
I put so much on the line for this!
"I lied to my wife, I lied to my family"
- because I care so goddamn much.
- [Laughter]
"I told you he would cry, right?"
"You girls owe me shots, shots, shots."
- Am I on speakerphone?
"- Oh, yeah."
"Me and the ladies,"
- we needed a new drinking game.
- [Laughter]
"So, uh, listen, I'll let you go."
"You drive safe, sweetheart."
[Laughter]
"- Hey, hey, hey, hey!"
This is not a discussion.
When I--
"- Hello, Artie."
- Artie.
- Artie.
- James.
"Okay, I think I know who this is."
And I've got to go.
You tail the agents.
Grab the tsuba.
Watch out For implosion grenades.
Good-bye.
Your agents Bering and Lattimer
Are compromised.
Not possible.
I ran a background check on Arthur Nielsen.
Where'd you get this information?
I have my sources same as you do.
I don't see how any of this is your business.
The three of them returned to the embassy last night.
I'm very sorry to hear that.
I have no desire to stir up an international incident.
It's a great deal of paperwork and a great deal of scrutiny.
And you and I both get screwed.
"If you can't handle this,"
I will be forced to take this to a higher authority.
Everything all right?
Yes.
Peachy.
What?
The tsuba's heading back to the museum.
Damien looks after me too.
"Right, I'm going to need copies of all the photos."
No way.
But I will promise not to use any that compromise your team.
I think you misunderstood me.
All photos now.
You do not publish until this is over.
You make no mention of my unit or personnel.
Or what?
You're going to kill me?
CRAWFORD:
I can't see her.
"Christ, there's a lot of them."
They'll be heading out soon once they've juiced themselves up for the night.
(SHOUTING IN SUDANESE ARABIC)
That's him.
"That's the one we kill, no matter what."
(SPEAKING IN SUDANESE ARABIC)
Why isn't he leaving with them?
She's in that hut.
She's in that hut with him.
MATAK:
"I trust you have been treated appropriately, Major Sinclair."
Yes.
Thank you.
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)
Colonel Grant.
(GREETING IN SUDANESE ARABIC)
"Sit, please."
It is a tragedy how things have turned out.
- Then let us work to resolve it.
"- Indeed, yes."
I was once.
"But now, I am just a soldier and your loyal servant."
"Well, perhaps it is time we reacquainted you with your God."
ARAMIS:
"Yes, Your Majesty."
LOUIS:
We leave within the hour.
Why would the General's aide choose to meet somewhere like this?
That's a good question.
- Let's go see what's inside.
- D'ARTAGNAN:
I'll wait here.
(GRUNTING)
GRIMAUD:
Aramis is back in Paris.
What's going on?
He has been summoned back by the King.
"They are going on a pilgrimage, (CHUCKLES) to the Royal Mausoleum."
What about Porthos and d'Artagnan?
Marcheaux assures me they continued with their journey.
(BREATHES DEEPLY)
Perhaps it would be better to reconsider our plans.
No!
It's too late for that!
How many guards are with the King?
"Oh, Aramis, alone."
Then wait for them outside the Mausoleum and kill them both there.
(SCOFFING)
You...
You mean the King as well?
(CHUCKLING) We cannot kill the King.
We have to.
In what way?
"Well, you know, she and I would get going, and, uh, you know, there was never any middle ground."
It just would always end up being an all-out war.
And it never accomplished anything.
"It would just end up leading... well, you know where it led."
You lost her.
Are you afraid that you might lose Erica?
I don't know.
I--I don't understand.
"I mean, I don't even know what that was in there."
I was not a good father.
"And I'm aware of that,"
But I am a good therapist.
"Yes, but even the best therapists miss things."
What?
"Just tell me, then."
What is the connection here?
"You know, why am I having the same fight with Erica"
That I used to have with my daughter?
Only one way to find out.
Stop it!
Sarah.
Let go of me!
Sarah!
"Forget it, dad, I'm never coming home!"
"Sarah, wait."
Wait!
I just wanna talk to you.
"Yeah, well, you never listen to me."
There's no point.
"Wait, wait, wait!"
"This time, I will listen."

"- Liquid Moan, nice."
I wore this to Swampsgiving last year--cleaned up.
"- Right on, bro."
"- Oh, we have a promotion on the Code Rad."
It comes with a free cigarette.
"- Oh, no."
That doesn't matter.
We don't need it.
"- Well, if you don't want it, I'll take it."
"- No, no, no."
Don't do that--smoking is bad.
You should quit smoking right now.
- Hey...
- Ahh.
- We seem to be in the clear.
Are you hurt?
- Yeah.
I got caught on top of the fence.
Check out my calf-- it's like Scratch City.
How about you?
"- I'm fine, except I was impaled on a metal pipe."
"- Oh, my God!"
"Oh, my God!"
It's gonna be fine.
"Oh, my God!"
"- I got rifles, vests, flash grenades..."
"- Chips, dips, ice cream sammies..."
"- I'm pretty sure there's gonna be snacks in Florida, Scully."
- Pretty sure?
Do you arrest someone if you're pretty sure they're guilty?
"You know, we just looked and we - Let me see."
I'm gonna ask.
- Where is the person -
"- Well, there's -"
- We've looked at
-We've looked at -
- This is Khedive Avenue.
That isn't it.
"Yeah, no."
"And we looked at the Bathurst, and that wasn't it either."
"- Well, it has to be somewhere."
- Let me see if there is a way of finding out.
- [Phone Ringing]
- It could be right down here.
- [Woman] Hello?
"- Um, one of the..."
One of the residents on our floor- her name is Ida Orliffe -
"She, uh"
- She -
Her husband's photograph apparently is hanging somewhere in Baycrest.
And his name is Herb Orliffe.
"Now, would you have any idea..."
We...
We've been down here looking for it... 'cause she thought it used to be hanging in the front entrance.
[Ida] I don't understand this.
[Indistinct]
Is there any way of you finding out where -
It's near the entrance as you come in.
It's hanging from the ceiling.
[Chattering]
- Might as well go and show her where she is.
- Yeah.
You won't for long!
"I'll have your throat out, you bloody swine!"
- Another two dozen!
"- Aye, aye, sir."
Another two dozen!
"- What's wrong with you, Evans?"
- It's got worm in it.
"I'll eat weevils and maggots, but not red worms!"
Good food thrown on the deck.
You're spoiled.
You know that's an offence.
A flogging offence.
"You know that too, don't you?"
- He sent you.
- What?
"Yes, sir."
I know it.
While we consider the best course of action pick it up!
It's fit.
Eat it.
Eat it.
That's an order.
"You'll swing for this, every man jack of you!"
He's right.
We'll hang for striking an officer.
We're all in it.
We have to move fast.
What shall we do?
There is only one thing to do.
Give the signal.
"- When, now?"
- As soon as we can.
Just fucking hit me!
"- Get out of here, you pussy!"
"- Yes, ma'am."
Here.
"Yes, ""yes, ma'am."""
"Now, get out of here... pussy."
Here you go.
"You want to sing something, Adam?"
- [Sobs] No.
- No.
"- Oh, no, no, no, no, no."
- It's okay.
"- Adam, come on."
- I feel stupid.
"No, we're gonna ge- we'll dry you off."
"- I know, he's very dumb."
- I feel stupid!
Let's go to the bathroom.
Come on.
"I would have DDT'd that dude, but I pulled my back this morning... farting."
I farted really hard.
"I don't know about fighting anymore, you know?"
"If you hit somebody, and you kill them by accident, you're flying con air."
You couldn't have fought that dude.
You're guarding all the Molsons.
I had to guard the Molsons.
"If Jillian wouldn't have been such a fight hog, we would have scared that dude something no-nonsense."
He was intimidated.
- What was that?
- He was intimidated at first.
"Guys, come on."
We got punked.
I can't tell.
Uh...
Who is this?
We're her friends.
Do you have a problem with that?
"Yeah, I have a problem with that."
And I have a problem with you looking at me like that.
Who are you to look at me like that?
I don't like him.
Let's go.
Me neither.
Who are you to look at me like that.
"Come on, Kathy."
Bye.
Wait.
I can't.
"Friends are really hard to get, especially when you're pregnant."
I'll talk to you later.
Isn't it harder to get a boyfriend when you're pregnant?
(ALL GIGGLING)
Ben just wants to see his girl.
Ben needs some happiness in his life.
He deserves it.
"I don't feel like letting him pretend to date me, okay?"
I don't like that.
That would be using me to do something that I don't even think he should do.
And Ben's my friend.
He shouldn't ask me to do something I don't want to do.
I've got the harder part.
I have to go over and convince Dylan's parents to let her go out with me.
But I think I'm up to the challenge.
It could be fun.
Mostly.
"Are you two lazy bastards gonna get up and help, or what?"
So how do you know Will?
We volunteered together at Amnesty International a couple years ago.
"Yeah, that's right."
"How is the Burmese situation, Tom?"
Better?
I mean good?
"Yeah, and he called me up out of the blue for Christmas lunch."
"So, here I am."
Really?
"So, listen, what's the deal with you and Ellie now?"
Is she your girlfriend?
Are you insane?
Where did you get those trainers?
- Why?
What's wrong with them?
- Nothing.
What?
"By the way, I do think you and Rachel have a shot."
"- I mean, if you don't screw it up."
- Thank you.
I'd created a monster.
Or maybe he created me.
I don't know what Will was so upset about.
All I meant was I don't think couples are the future.
You need more than that.
You need backup.
"The way I saw it, Will and I both had backup now."
It's like that thing he told me Jon Bon Jovi said:
"""No man is an island."""

What's the matter now?
I think Grandma would like it not too spicy.
May I start eating?
I'm really embarrassed.
Grandma puts her hands together to worship what I cooked.
- And it was really delicious.
- That's true!
We're all counting on you from now on.
Look at this.
What is this?
"To convince her to agree to go to Hawaii, I talked about Suzujiro today."
Then Grandma started to remember the names of her brothers.
"""Tetsutaro."
"""Dozaburo."
"""Jushiro."
"""Shogoro."
"""Kuginosuke."
"""Natakichi."
"""Kuwata."
"""Suzukichi."
"""Nabe."
"""Kane."
"Kyoko. """
These names have the Chinese symbol for metal.
"Grandma's father, our great-grandfather, seems to have been a real weirdo."
"""Kane. "" So this is our Grandma, right?"
- Eleven!
- Eleven?
"And she says there must have been two or three more, but she can't remember them."
And Suzujiro is among the ones she can't remember?
"But you know, Tetsutaro, Dozaburo, there, is number two."
I think the brother between those two is Suzujiro.
That poor woman.
Father?
Yes?
I have to confess that my feelings were very hurt last year at the flower show.
"Ah, yes."
I am extremely sorry about that.
No.
"No, not just by you."
"When I looked at Edie's flower arrangement,"
I realised mine would never be as good.
And I think I've been punishing her for that ever since.
That was very brave of you to say so.
"And God, I am sure, will forgive you."
Thank you.
"Thank you, Father."
"Now, I'll see you back at St Mary's."
I just pray to God we're not too late.
"Me too, George."
Father?
"Good Afternoon, Lady Felicia!"
"Good work, Sid!"
George!
Father.
"How are you, Henry?"
"Mr Lee, the good news is we've got your man."
"Well, woman."
It turns out Iris Lightman did this to you.
Popped into your shed first thing yesterday and slipped hemlock in your teacup.
The one thing I don't understand is why she's tried to fit up George here.
"I've never met the woman, Henry."
"Don't have any thoughts on it, do you?"
I saw her at the shed... ..this morning.
"I'll do the dishes, honey."
You run down to the drugstore and get me tonight's papers.
I wanna see what they say about me.
"Okay, I'll be right back."
All right.
Get all the papers.
[door closes]

For goodness' sake.
A person has no privacy around here.
Mr. de Mario.
Mind if I come in?
"No, of course not."
My daughter--
"I just saw her going down the street, so I know you're alone."
Yes.
"As a matter of fact, I am."
"To what do I owe the pleasure of this visit, Mr. de Mario?"
Pleasure?
I just dropped in to give you a little piece of advice.
What about?
About the murder of Clara Nash.
I don't know anything about that.
"Yeah, I know."
But you've got an overworked imagination.
Clara used to tell me how you liked to dream things up.
She thought it was very funny.
Only it might not be so funny now.
I've already told them everything I know... and I didn't tell them anything but the truth.
That's what I'm worried about.
"- No, that was..."
"- I love ""Dawson's Creek."""
Listen to me.
I'm so happy.
And I think I just got worried that this part wouldn't work.
What are you talking about?
You haven't seen this in a while.
"Emma, I can't wait to see this."
"I know, but things are different, you know?"
They're a little wider and longer.
You think this isn't different?
"- Come on, man."
"- Look at this, look at this."
That wasn't there before.
That's something to grab onto.
Get your hands in there.
"Get a hold of that, see?"
"- All right, all right."
- How about this...
This mole here?
"That's new, that's interesting."
You should get that checked out.
"And, I'm sorry, check out these chicken legs, right?"
I'm just going straight chicken leg situations.
It's a two-piece meal.
"So yeah, it's different."
"But have you ever thought that it might be... much, much better?"

"The truck is full, we'll have to do another round."
I'm coming.
- Let's go.
He's a private patient of Dr. Gertel.
"He started taking one more Fusid a month ago, he's had three attacks in the past year and he's allergic to penicillin."
- Alright.
"There's a list of his medications in his pocket, so take a look at it."
Okay.
The name's Ben-Shmuel?
"- Yes, Yitzhak."
"He was here before, gave me those candies..."
Licorice.
His pulse is down.
"- Okay, hurry up."
What's going on?
- Stay here.
"I'll come back later, Daddy."
It's okay.
I promise I'll come back.
Hey.
Are you moving in?
"It's a nice building, the neighbors downstairs are cool, so are the ones on the top floor."
"If you need anything, I live right here, just say the word."
What's your name?
Goni.
- I'm Sharon.
"Okay, bye, Goni."
- Bye.
"Life goes on, as the cliche goes."
There's a murder every 3 days and a robbery every hour
We'll arrive precisely on time
"Precisely, not approximately"
We're talking about the perfect dream of a school.
- Okay.
- Animals instead of science.
Chickens and mice and iguanas.
"This is pretend, right?"
"No, angel, this is real."
I am going to find you a school with trees and frogs and eggs to gather.
"And maybe just a little bit of math, because you do need that, too."
"But... not too much, okay?"
It's Auntie Mara.
Can I say hello?
Of course.
"I miss you, Auntie Mara."
"I miss you to smithereens, little one."
Are they torturing you to make me do an interview?
With hot needles.
"Tell them three minutes, no questions about Tom, and, I'll call it an exclusive, tell the rest of the world to suck eggs."
- Mommy!
Language!
- Acceptable!
Borderline.
I'm on my way.
- But after I make these cookies.
"- Okay, bye."
This tough cookie.
You...
Maybe we should just eat the batter.
That's my favorite part.
What do you think?
"Hey, Ruby Tuesday."
It's me.
Come in.
You should disinfect it.
"Yeah, later."
"You know, earlier with the coroner, maybe I went too fast."
You weren't too hot for the idea.
"No, it's OK."
I'm sorry.
You didn't want to.
"Not really, no."
What is it?
"well, you know..."
I'm retiring in 3 months.
"Yeah, so?"
This case looks complicated.
"I might still have to go to court in 1 , maybe 2 years after I retire, so..."
We started and that's what counts.
You sure?
"Yeah, sure."
Found anything interesting?
"Yeah, actually..."
"Come, I have a question for them."
Who wears high heels?
We found fresh tracks.
"we just need to take prints, it'II be easy to find."
"He must be talking about the girl, the dancer."
The dancer?
What dancer?
You never mentioned a dancer.
"He didn't see her, she stayed in my truck until he left."
"When he came back, she had gone back to the hotel."
What's her name?
Samantha... so she said.
"A cutie, fully equipped."
Mm-hmm.
"Need anything else, agents?"
"Yeah, is Sheriff Hanscum around?"
Sorry.
She's out for the rest of the week.
"Hell of a time to take a vacation, right?"
"Okay, so, we have two victims, with seemingly nothing in common except, uh -- a love for eclairs."
Check this out.
What is that?
A birthmark?
Huh.
"So the weight had to come off somehow, right?"
What if it's a suction mark?
A suction mark?
Okay.
"Uh, changeling?"
"Yeah, but changelings don't take over kids."
Neither of the vics had any.
And we don't know if Wayne McNut had a suction mark.
Unless we missed it.
Yeah.
"Well, we should, uh, split up."
One of us should hit the morgue.
The other should stay here and question the staff.
I'll stay.
Ain't gonna happen.
Why?
Because you're weird around girls.
"What does that mean, weird?"
You're awkward.
"You know, weird -"
- Sam Weird.
- Right.
- This is Lewis Carroll's mirror.
Alice in Wonderland.
"""Off with their heads""."
"- That's chick lit, right?"
- Chick lit?
"I mean, come on."
Not everything in here is dangerous.
You got that cuddly little ferret from a cooking pot.
"- Yeah, he peed in my shoes."
- That was...
That was me.
- That's funny.
"- So what, are you still mad at Artie?"
"No, I'm not."
- I'm not mad at Artie.
I'm mad at you.
"- No, you're not mad at me."
"- Yes, I am."
- You're not mad at me.
"Because when you're mad at me, your neck gets all long until it looks like that."
It's like a giraffe over here.
"And when you're mad at Artie, your neck gets down over here to the right."
Just like that.
"Look, I know the MacPherson-DC thing is still bugging you, okay?"
But everybody has a past.
"But he lied, Pete."
"Artie's past is treasonous, hazardous, there's a crazy man who wants us dead and he wants the Warehouse for himself."
Would have been nice knowing that going in.
Artie should have told us about MacPherson.
"Yes, yes, I get it."
Daddy issues.
I don't.
I don't care if we fail.
Failing's fine!
"If we go down in flames, at least there were flames!"
Wow.
"If we're gonna do this, I want to do TV that's bold and thrilling and dangerous!"
I can be dangerous.
I-I can.
You don't seem dangerous.
That's what makes me so dangerous.
I like you.
"I like you, too."
I think you are so much more than you've been allowed to be.
Really?
You need to stop trying to please people.
Can you do that?
If that's what you want.
I don't think she's coming back.
Amazing.
She gave you another chance?
You are an evil genius.
You're too kind.
And you're okay with her getting married again?
Yeah.
Why not?
Your ex-wife ever remarry?
No.
I like to think she exhausted all her misery on me and then left the business.
So I'm guessing you don't miss her.
No.
I do miss my current wife.
"Yeah, you guys are idiots."
"He's not feeling well, kids."
I have to call it quits!
That hurt a little on the way out.
- What's this for?
- Careful!
You're going to break it!
"- Don't pull it like that, son."
- What's it for?
For balance.
Maria works with us in the circus.
"No, no."
"From now on, Maria doesn't work anywhere."
"She will simply study and play, right?"
What kind of work?
"She walks along a high wire, way up in the circus ring."
That was in the past.
This whole business about Maria in the circus is all done.
She uses this parasol to help her balance on the tightrope.
Are you her mother?
"No, I'm her godmother."
- What about you?
- I'm her godfather!
Take our picture.
"Right, that's enough."
"Can you walk for us, just a little bit?"
Walk!
Walk!
"Just a little bit, Maria."
Please.
Do you want to walk?
Want to walk the tightrope?
- Who likes magic here?
"Oi, don't start."
"Mom, you're the one who wanted us here."
"Listen, you're here a month and sometimes I know he doesn't come home at all."
What kind of people are these?
-What do you want me to do?
-Do?
What can you do?
He's not Jewish.
Did you know how these people live?
Did you know what they were like?
Your father never stayed out all night without calling.
Stay out?
"Daddy never went out at all, Ma!"
Keep out of it!
You don't know how I feel!
How do you feel now?
You don't know where he is or who he's with!
He's with his friends!
Dad!
Will you leave him out of this?
He's suffered enough.
The man hasn't been able to digest a decent meal in six weeks.
Where were you?
Why didn't you call?
We were worried to death!
A married man does not stay out like this!
Normal people don't act like this!
What's wrong with you?
You're not normal.
She's right!
"What's wrong with you, Henry?"
What kind of person are you?
I would know!
Nothing you see can harm or even touch you.
It's purely audio-visual.
- There's no physical sensation.
- Fuck!
"Yes, there was!"
"- Cooper, you need to calm down."
"- I know because I felt it, okay?"
"I felt her arm, it was warm, and I felt her fucking stab me in the shoulder."
- That's not possible.
"- Oh, my God."
"- It's not possible, Cooper."
"- Yeah, it is!"
"Yeah, it is!"
Physical sensations shouldn't be possible.
"- Unless, I mean..."
"- Oh, God."
Unless what?
I don't know.
"The neuron net, it could have maybe worked out some means of replicating physical experiences,"
- but that would be unprecedented.
- Jesus Christ.
"Okay, you know what?"
Stop the game.
I want out.
Just pull me out now.
"Stop, stop, stop."
Safe word.
Fucking stop!
"- Okay, okay, just let us work it out."
"- Oh, God."
"No, I want this fucking thing out now."
I'm sorry.
There was nothing to be done.
She has moments only.
"We saved the world, Clara, you and me."
"We really, really did."
Will you go back... to your cloud?
No more cloud.
Not now.
Why not?
It rained.
Run.
"Run, you clever boy."
And remember.
It's Christmas.
Christmas Day.
And what about the Intelligence?
Melted with the snow?
"No, I shouldn't think so."
It learned to survive beyond physical form.
"Well, we can't be in much danger from a disembodied Intelligence that thinks it can invade the world with snowmen."
Or that the London Underground is a key strategic weakness.
The Great Intelligence... rings a bell... the Great Intelligence?
Doctor?
"I never knew her name, her full name."
"Oswin Oswald, junior entertainment manager, Starship Alaska."
Souffle girl...
Oswin - it was her.
"Run, you clever boy."
And remember.
It was souffle girl again.
"I never saw her face the first time with the Daleks, but her voice, it was the same voice."
Doctor?
The great yoghurt investigation.
Oh.
I thought we would just be bringing our own lunch.
"Oh, I thought I'd bring lunch."
My treat.
"Oh, I thought we would just be having our own Tupperwares-type thing."
You weren't taking me out to lunch.
"No, but..."
It wasn't like a date.
No.
"I mean, two middle-aged people on a bench in Piccadilly."
"It's not exactly Roman Holiday, is it?"
No.
Be nice if it was.
# If life were movies
# Then I would be Fred Astaire

# Pert and petite
# Light on my feet

# I would be wearing
# Something quite daring with fur
# If I were her

You've had your wishes.
"Now, it's my turn."
And now I'll know when they're coming for me.
"And if I can see them,"
I can kill them.
I bet you didn't see that coming.
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
I had to use the Tesla.
He's dead.
You killed him.
"- Pete, what's going on?"
- Change of plans.
"What do you think, I'm an idiot?"
Don't answer that.
"Look, just stop, okay?"
Just put down the gun and let's think this through.
- I'm still taking the artifact.
- I can't let you do that.
"Die trying to stop me, Alice."
"Oh, clever boy."
What tipped you?
The real Myka... would never kiss me.
Never!
Not if her life depended on it.
- Which is...
- A shame.
You're a good kisser.
- So Artie hasn't figured this out yet.
"- Well, not yet."
"But when he does, he'll set the real Myka free, and you will... poof... disappear."
"It doesn't work that way, Pete."
!
"When you're hungover, it's like a car alarm."
"Ay. iHola, papi!"
Happy graduation day!
"(party horn blowing, laughs)"
That's delightful.
I need your sash and your gown.
So that I can press it.
I don't want anyone looking wrinkly.
(chuckles)
"I don't mean you, but it's fun that you're right there."
"I, uh, left them at school."
I'll run over there.
"Mama, I have a stomachache."
And my ankle is broken.
(gasps) And you can walk with your broken ankle?
I had a cousin got out of Vietnam that way.
"Whenever Manny's getting a lot of attention,"
Joe gets very needy...
"""my head,"" ""my arm."""
"In Colombia, we say,"
"""If it's not bleeding, shut your guinea-pig hole."""
We actually do eat guinea pig.
(beep)
"Call me back, Dad!"
It's an emergency!
What's wrong?
I kind of misplaced my cap and gown and sash.
Maybe they're at that strip club you went to last night.
Shh!
How did you know?
- It's all over your face.
"Bev, my wife."
"No, I know who bev is."
Who's rob?
Morning's brother.
With the truck.
What truck?
He had a truck!
"Anyway, last week, before we got back together, she slept with him."
No shit?
And she told you?
"To her credit, she felt we needed to be honest."
"What, is she stupid?"
"And this was gonna be your big, like,"
"""finally back together"" weekend?"
Yeah.
"For fans of irony, it's a real treat."
Man.
I figured you two would be fucking like bunnies.
More like bunnies with awkward silences and sullen looks.
I actually slept on the sofa.
Seriously?
"Well, I don't want to sleep in her bed."
She doesn't want to sleep in mine.
That's not good for the bunnies.
No.
"I'm sure, eventually, we'll get past this, but oh, my God!"
I was so not prepared for something else I had to get past.
"I mean, it would be one thing if he was the only one."
Christ.
Who else?
"Yes, yes."
We all love the draft.
- Yeah.
Are you ready for the hearing?
About that--do you think I could make it home before Thursday night?
Thursday night?
"Yeah, there's this meeting I usually speak at back home in Bedford, and I just don't want to be in Pittsburgh any longer than I have to be."
I don't think we can get it done that fast.
"Man, I just don't know."
I don't know what I'm doing.
What?
"I mean, you've seen her, you know?"
"She's beautiful, and she's grown up, and my life is a joke."
It's just-- l don't know. I don't-- [sighs]
"This is how I used to think about myself, I know."
"- l can do this, right?"
- Right.
"Because I'm better now, right?"
I can do this. I'm her daddy.
I can do this.
This is where l'm staying.
Nice place.
[laughs]
"Not really, but it's cheap."
"I live two hours away from here-- you know, in Bedford."
- Do you know it?
- No.
Bedford's really nice.
"It's quiet, it's peaceful."
"Do you want to come up for a while, maybe watch a movie?"
"No, no."
"I, uh-- l can buy you dinner."
There's a nice diner down the street.
Come on.
"Aw, good-bye, precious."
"If it wasn't for my Ed's darned old allergy,"
I'd get one just like you.
(chuckles)
"- I'll see you later, Alice."
"-Okay, Trix."
"Now, listen here, I want to tell you something."
"I have got work to do, and I have to do it right now."
I don't want you getting it into your head that all I have to do all day long is just play with you.
So it's back in the box.
Okay?
There.
Oh...
Don't look so sad about it.
"Come on, we'll go in the bedroom."
(door opens)
"- Hey there, Alice."
"-Oh, hi, Ed."
Aren't you coming home a little early today from work?
"Oh, no, I been, uh, showing up to work an hour early."
- We're breaking in a new man there.
-Oh?
Been with us a week-- he's still wet behind the ears.
(groans)
"Say, tell me, Alice, has Ralph, uh, tried to get in touch... (sharp exhale)"
Excuse me.
Has Ralph tried to get in touch with y... (sneezes)
- No.
Bless you.
-Excuse me.
Has he tried to get in touch with you about anything today?
No.
Then you bring me here?
How can i left you there?
Laxmi Narayan.
Now pain is gone?
Pain has just started.
What is she doing!
Why are you taking off your cloths?
How can i show you then?
No... no!
This is wrong... now i got your nature.
And you know my nature.
Laxmi Jee Relax... that's what happen in this age.
I am sorry... why?
Because of the way talked to you.
When?
When i told you to shoot me.
What was you fault...
I am not like that.
"If i didn't had problem, i would never say like that."
After my father left.
I am all alone.
Have to leave this house too.
"You know, that Mundaya was saying... if i don't pay him the money, i have to marry him."
"Better is that, i should kill myself i will kill you... if you talk like this."
"I am here, here it is, how much you need?"
I bought 25000/- only 25000/-?
"Don't worry... take this chain, worth 24000/- only?"
"Only means, its fake."
Take this ring.
It was for my just wife.
Just wife?
Yeah i just told Mina gay my wife.
I was winning.
"They're beings, Trelane."
They have spirit.
They're superior.
"No, no."
You saw.
"You'll grow up, Trelane."
You'll understand.
Now come along.
"Aw, but you said I could."
You promised.
I never have any fun.
"Stop that nonsense at once, or you'll not be permitted to make any more planets."
"Aw, but you saw."
I was winning.
I would have won... honest.
"No, Trelane."
"No, Trelane."
I would have.
I would have.
I would have.
I would.
I would.
I would.
I would.
"Captain, we regret that the life paths of yourself and your companions have been disturbed."
Who are you?
Who is Trelane?
You must forgive our child.
The fault is ours for indulging him too much.
He will be punished.
We would not have let him intercept you had we realized your vulnerability.
"Well, it ain't my fault, is it?"
"If you're worrying about that dame, I'll call her up."
No cracks.
I don't want her to know anything about this or me.
"Yeah, I see."
- Get back to that hospital and find out--
"- Jeez, I've been sleeping in the halls."
Get out of here.
Get back to that hospital.
Stay with him.
Get in bed with him.
- Back.
Move it on those two sides.
- Stay in line.
Move it faster.
Come on.
"Come on, get in here."
Come on.
"Come on, boys, hurry up."
"- Mr. Thompson, look at that."
"- Well, what's the matter with it?"
- Can you eat it?
Those boys can't.
"- Well, they don't have to."
It's worse now than it ever was.
"Miss Griffith, kindly understand that I want no more interference in things that don't concern you."
This does concern me.
We started something.
It was successful.
"Every day, bit by bit, you're tearing it down."
- That will do.
"- No, it won't."
"No, I'm not going to force my opinion on you."
Because no one has the right to control another person.
"Hey, medicine seller."
How did today's wedding go?
"Come here, come here."
"Cat, cat."
Come this way.
"Come here, come here."
No one else has come out since you went in.
Hmm no.
(female announcer) Previously on Angela's Eyes...
Where's the box?
What box?
(Angela) The Anderson family time capsule.
"Oh, you mean that thing that we buried with Mom and Dad when we were kids?"
"I came here to, uh, to wish you a happy birthday."
"Great, you act like this is a birthday present."
This is our family time capsule.
"This is a clue, Ang."
"You know, I could never keep track of how many shirts were at the cleaner's."
Maybe you should check.
See if I left any there.
Oh.
"[laughing] Oh, my gosh."
Are you kidding me?
Angela got some papers from an old Korean cleaner.
They're in a bright red folder.
And I want them.
"What the hell are you doing, Dylan?"
Nothing.
"Cut the crap, dog."
He was in for sex crimes.
Just got released two weeks ago.
Thanks.
Hello.
How are you holding up?
Fantastic.
What's a five-letter word for a cooking utensil?
A whisk?
That would be it.
We're all rooting for you.
I want you to know that.
Thank you.
I appreciate that.
You here to see Johnny Holt?
"Yes, I am."
We found his blood on Vince Nelson's throat.
Holt's a bad dude.
"If he gives you any problems, let me know."
I'll get in there and beat him up for you.
Whisk.
I knew that.
Never seen him before.
There's traces of your blood on him.
My blood's all over this city.
"Been shot nine times, knifed five."
We believe the victim was involved in child pornography.
Do you recognize this boy?
You implying I'm into kids?
Because I sure as hell don't fly that way.
Right.
"Right, you prefer to rape grown women. forgot."
They said it was rape.
"and half of you is man, and the other half is woman. (Chuckling)"
"Shame on you, how can you say such things to your elders?"
"Nevermind, come on, let's all have a drink."
Bastard!
I'll tear him to pieces!
"Hey, what are you saying?"
Let's not worry about those things when we have these two beautiful young ladies to enjoy ourselves with.
(laughing)
(banging)
I'm sleeping.
"Hey, what's wrong?"
"He's so cold to us, we've done nothing to him."
Didn't you see his pigtails?
He acts just like a woman!
(Laughing)
He is more like a woman than a man!
"Well, you're a man."
"So, does he love you?"
Shut your mouth!
"Come on, let's go."
"No wait, don't rush."
"No, I can't wait!"
"If you rush, then you're gonna spoil the mood."
What do you want?
I want you to come and undress me.
But not using your hands.
But how?
I can't wait!
Just how am I gonna do that?
"You idiot, you'd use your mouth."
Well?
Do you like that?
Blackjack's a great game.
"No, look, it's easy to learn and there's really not as much strategy to it as people think."
"I grew up on it, actually."
- You grew up on it?
- Yeah.
"Every night after dinner, my father and I would play."
"I knew basic strategy before I was, like, nine years old."
"If I won, he'd take me out for ice cream."
And what if he won?
He'd still take me out for ice cream.
"Oh, yeah."
"Sure, yeah, he's your dad."
"Ben, you should feel the thrill of winning more money than you can possibly imagine."
I think you should come to Vegas.
'Cause I'm guessing that you could probably use a break from this place.
I can't.
I'm sorry.
I just can't.
Okay.
"If you change your mind, you know where we meet."
Yeah.
You're welcome any time.
"You know, I think the best thing about Vegas is you can become anyone you want."
- What's the count?
- Plus 9.
- No.
- Plus 11.
No.
"- Dude, I lost count 20 cards ago."
"- Don't call me ""dude."""
- Plus 9?
- You're just following Jill.
"Come on, what are you going to do all by yourself in this gutter?"
"With me, you have a chance!"
You can all rot with her!
"This stare, not for me."
I've got to see Him!
Now I can't see a thing.
Now you can see for real.
"At the end of a regularfilm, I'd go on a killing spree too."
I'd be the hero.
But there are no more heroes.
Just the humiliated.
Stop your bullshit.
Let's walk out of here... barefoot.
"Made off, the rats, welfare!"
"This is the end, my only friend."
I won't have the lake.
There won't be any real revolution.
From now on don't budge!
Hear me?
Watch him.
Save me.
Take me.
Any place you want.
"This film was inspired by ""The Idiot"" by Fedor Dostoevsky."
It is intended as a homage to this great writer.
English Translation:
Daniel Bird and Andrzej Zulawski.
"Morena, get up on the dam."
I want you to deal with the radio room.
Come on!
José should be ready by now.
- I think it's strange.
Do you know how weird that makes me feel?
"A lesbian dream, and he's staring at me like I should include him."
I can't even fantasize in private.
Mom said you've been seeing someone steady.
Is he cute?
- What?
- What are you doing here?
I thought I'd meet you for coffee.
Is that a terrible thing to do?
Excuse me.
I'm going to the ladies' room.
Alone.
Can you believe this weather?
"It's almost April, and it's still cold."
I'm glad I have you alone.
Can I ask you a question?
"It'll sound strange, but..."
Is Claire happy?
"I mean, do you think she's happy?"
"Yes, I think she is."
Why?
I'm being silly.
"I'm a first-time husband, I guess."
"If she doesn't wake up and tell me she's ecstatic, I worry."
"Imagine, I have you to thank for the fact that we're married."
You made this possible.
Knowing you has changed my life.
- Don't do that.
- What?
What am I doing?
"You don't even know, do you?"
- We've got to go there.
- How?
Take a bus?
- We'll go in this.
"- Tia, the tires are flat."
Come on.
"If it doesn't start cooling soon, the chain reaction will start."
You hear that?
"In ten minutes, this place is going to be a hole in the ground."
"Now, let's be reasonable."
We have three and a half million dollars in the control room.
And the balance is on the way.
It's a deal.
I do not compromise.
"- Hey, what are you guys doing?"
- Nothing!
Nothing!
We're doing nothing.
"Hey, kids!"
How did these children get past security?
"Sir, the people destroying the furnace kidnapped my brother."
"If I could see him, I might stop them."
- She can do it!
- She can do it.
- Do what?
"Impossible, they're inside the room."
They've sealed the door somehow.
- What part has to be fixed?
- The emergency cooling system.
- Where is it?
- Five levels down.
But it's too late.
Why should I tell them about her?
Don't know why they had come without even knowing her name?
"Hey, please listen to me..."
I will not.
I don't want to hear flashbacks of split ups.
I like as I'm now.
I feel something fishy.
Why isn't he listening to me?
I suspect him...
Why are you silent?
Do something.
What is your plan?
Why are you staring?
Do something.
What can I do?
I suspect him...
Say something please...
"Check, where is Kalyan?"
Can't you do it yourself?
"What happened, Halwa?"
Was I here only?
"You're here only, right?"
"Though I'm here, I'm not and though I'm not here, I feel I'm here."
Do something.
Something is happening without my knowledge.
Hey!
If you've guts remove the veil and beat me.
"Whether you're in veil or me, I'm getting the stick, right?"
"If you've guts, remove the veil."
"How can I be afraid of you, Halwa?"
I'll tell her everything.
Go ahead.
Does anybody want coffee?
- What theory?
- Regular or decaf?
- Regular.
- I can make cappuccinos.
Would you like cappuccinos?
"Greg, why don't you help me?"
- Why don't you put the coffee on?
- I made dinner.
You put it on.
"I've raised two daughters, buried a husband, I've made my coffee."
Alone at last.
I've heard a lot about you.
- And I've heard a lot about you.
- Oh.
You've been seeing a lot of my daughter.
I hope you don't mind my asking...
What are your intentions?
My intentions?
What a lovely meal!
You're a good cook.
- I didn't oversell myself?
"- Not at all, but the trouble..."
Of course I had to go to that trouble.
It was your birthday.
"What are friends for, but to give each other presents and stuff..."
Happy birthday.
Open it up!
I really hope you like it.
- Dice?
- They once were dice.
"- Now, they're cuff links with..."
Is that what you think?
Definitely.
Have some tea while you catch up on old times.
"Thanks,Jenny."
Be careful.
- Here's my friend's hand.
- Here's your tea.
- Thankyou.
- A pleasure.
Is he another friend ofyours?
"No, he's thejanitor."
We don't have a janitor in this building.
"Oh, he's the plumber."
There's a burst water pipe outside.
Your voice sounds familiar.
Have we met before?
I met you in the night club.
"I loved your singing, but you wouldn't sing without Jeffrey there."
"Oh, I remember."
What a coincidence.
"Dumbo, take care of Jenny for a while."
I'm going to the bathroom.
So am I.
There's a second bathroom in the bedroom.
"Jenny, there's a rat in the kitchen!"
I'll catch it.
This hallowed home of ours... we hold sacred
Here we dreamt our dreams
Like a prayer in a temple
Like a ray from the skies
Here we find succor
"What, are they getting engaged?"
I don't know.
I was too busy covering my heinie on Amy's stupid astronaut story!
What astronaut story?
You texted me Penny's dating an astronaut.
"I texted ""architect."" That's amusing."
Auto-correct must've changed it.
"Yeah, it's hysterical."
"All right, look, just forget about the astronaut."
Architect.
Where would you have met an astronaut?
"Look, just find out what's up with this trip to India."
I don't want to do this anymore!
Don't you quit on us!
"Bernie, you okay?"
It was an architect!
"Thank you for coming with me, Sheldon."
You're a good friend.
I'm glad you think so.
That's what I strive to emulate.
"Okay, let's see if this drug works."
Can I help you?
"Forgive me for staring, but you're very beautiful."
Thank you.
That's a great accent.
Where are you from?
India.
"Oh, cool."
I've always wanted to go there.
It's a beautiful country.
You'd love it.
May I join you?
Let me make sure I understand.
You wanna keep your toothpaste in the tube until you're done brushing.
What are you talking about?
-What are you talking about?
"-Okay, okay."
Let me try again.
I don't wanna frost the cake while I'm still mixing the batter.
I don't get it.
She must have lost a bet.
-Excuse me?
-Nothing.
All right.
Here's what you do.
When you feel like the train is leaving the station... .
"You mean, going in the tunnel?"
"No, no, I mean leaving the station."
But you have to leave the station to get to the tunnel.
"Okay, okay."
Let's start from the top.
"And work our way down, right?"
You know what?
Just shut up and listen.
"When you're making love, the way to slow yourself down is..."
... tothinkof something completely non-sexual.
"-Well, what do you think of?"
-You.
That was a really great dinner.
I'm glad you enjoyed it.
You ready for dessert?
I've been ready since I was 1 4.
I'll be back.
Why don't you put some music on.
Please don't disappoint me!
"Amida Buddha, please turn back."
"No, I'll never go back."
I'll beg the Chief!
Behave yourself!
I want to go in!
Brother!
Behave yourself in the temple!
I want to be a monk.
Who's your chief?
We don't accept anybody as a monk so easily.
Mercy!
Mercy!
Shaolin was founded because of our ancestor's determinate spirit.
"Brothers, what's your opinion?"
We'll obey our chief!
Thanks!
Amida Buddha.
"From now on, you'll be known as Tat-chi."
"Since you're now a monk, you must remain single and stay here to practice and to train yourself."
Obey all our regulations!
Thanks!
"Tat-chi, you've learned kung-fu before, so you needn't start from scratch."
"Tomorrow, you'll practice with the Four Escorts."
Yes!
"Fat-tao, I'll hand over Tat-chi to you."
Yes.
Tat-chi!
Have a rest!
I wish to continue.
Tat-chi has made good progress!
Chin Kang Fist is really mysterious.
And I never left.
Yeah.
"You know, I understand."
You need a little R and R. Recharge the old batteries.
"But you know, after a while, why didn't you go back?"
I fell in love.
- Oh.
- Yep.
- Corvette?
- No.
I fell in love with this.
Whoa.
Look at that.
"Look, they're drivin' right by."
They don't even know what they're missing!
"Well, it didn't used to be that way."
"Oh, yeah?"
Yeah.
"Forty years ago, that Interstate down there didn't exist."
Really?
Yeah.
"Back then, cars came across the country a whole different way."
How do you mean?
The road didn't cut through the land like that Interstate.
"It moved with the land, you know?"
"It rose, it fell, it curved."
- Mornin'!
"- Nice day, huh?"
Cars didn't drive on it to make great time.
They drove on it to have a great time.
"Well, what happened?"
The town got bypassed just to save ten minutes of driving.
Chat up in the morning!
Death in the afternoon.
You're almost as pretty as my mother!
You should have let me know.
It was easier to take the train!
In which hole did you fall?
It was a woman who was being courted by a gangster!
I spent the night with her.
I don't know where she is.
I came here.
Have you seen the Eiffel Tower?
I lost my luggage!
"My mom's picture, my father's last letter, his tie, handkerchiefs too!"
I don't know where!
"""I loved her""."
That's not the truth.
She touched me... moved me...
You remind me of your father.
"He was handsome, your father."
"You always fall for beauty, especially when it doesn't buckle."
What use are your truths?
Does they wash whiter?
My shirt.
It was the journey.
The night.
The rain... the rain...
"Do you get a kick out of it, or is it just stupidity?"
I kick stupidity?
Stupidity!
"And when your mother came to Paris for the last time,"
I knew I'd never see her again.
I tried to talk myself into believing she was happy.
We could launch a drone off of any carrier in the gulf and hit any target we want.
"Excuse me, miss."
"Sir, you can't leave that there."
"Hey, buddy!"
"Twenty-four, I'm in the rotunda."
I got a maintenance--
"Eli, you all right?"
"Keep moving, let's go, push."
Get your security teams up.
Mr. Speaker?
Mr. Speaker?
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.
We have to get out of here.
You follow me.
- Where's the vice president?
- In the chamber.
Tell him we need to institute Continuity of Government.
- I tried.
He's been cut by some glass.
- Now stay close.
"Don't panic, take your time."
There's been an explosion at the Capitol building.
- And?
- I'm crashing the White House.
We're crashing the White House.
Get the CAT Team.
I want all nonessentials evac'd.
Get that hallway clear if we have to move.
"Sergeant, bolt these doors."
I need Marine 1 here as fast as possible.
"Sir, I need you to move away from the window, sir."
Anselmo called me.
"I knew the Mafioso had called him, but in this business, you don't trade names."
And I called Walter.
That's all there was to it.
I was doing Anselmo a favor.
Run caution lights all my life.
"This time you ran a red, and someone cut across the intersection."
A cop and a 6-year-old child.
That's with me forever.
That's not good enough.
Not good enough?
You think I don't know that?
"I hope so, John."
Scares me when you call me John.
Why's that?
Because I...
... Ithoughtaminuteago we were off to the White House.
I thought I could feel you come aboard.
The old menschkeit.
Horseshit.
Menschkeit is horseshit.
It's 1 20 years of graft and sweetheart contracts...
... featherbedsand inside information...
... andeverywherepeopleinpower gather to carve up the turf.
That's your menschkeit.
It's horseshit.
You know where you can put it.
Maybe spread it over the fields.
"If we cross our fingers, maybe a flower will grow."
It has.
Out of all this crap...
... youemerged.
There were three parts to the will.
Mr. Malhotra donated a huge sum to many charities... one million Euro to his staff and everything else to Tisha.
But that will was burnt.
"Which means, according to the law..."
Mr. Malhotra died without a valid will.
"And that means... his only heir, inherits all his wealth."
Tisha gets everything.
Correct.
How much exactly is everything?
10 billion Euro.
"Sia, it's Tisha."
She tried to kill herself this morning.
She did what?
"Attempted suicide, sir."
She's at St. Marks' hospital right now.
What the bloody hell is going on?
"Sia, you go to the hospital."
I'll meet you at HQ later.
Let's go.
"I'm sorry, but I need to question Tisha."
"- Any problem, officer?"
- No.
It's just routine.
I'll wait.
Dad...
"That's fine, thank you."
"Tisha, what happened?"
I...
I...
I don't know.
Why did you try to kill yourself?
What?
"I'm sad, too."
It's okay to grieve.
"I'm sad, too."
There'sgotto be something
"I'm sad, too."
There'sgotto be something I can learn to make this better.

"Well,whataboutall that accepting death stuff?"
"Well,whataboutall that accepting death stuff?"
Itdoesn'tmakeit accepting death stuff?

It doesn't-- less frightening.
It doesn't-- It doesn't make any sense.
It doesn't-- It doesn't make any sense.
What is it for?
It doesn't make any sense.
What is it for?
What do you do?
What is it for?
What do you do?

What do you do?
What are you supposed to do when a person dies?
Idon'tknow.
But...
It's okay not to know.
It'sokaynottoknow .
"Yeah,it'sokaynot toknow ."
"Sometimes you don't know, and you may never know, and that's okay."
"Come on, let's get you out of here."
I know you have a regular trusted doctor.
"But if you ever want a second opinion, I'm available."
"Well, I'll remember that."
Thank you very much.
My pleasure.
Danny.
"He's not here, Uncle Steven."
"You're looking awfully serious, L.B."
I guess.
Are you feeling all right?
"Uncle Steven, is Krystle mad at Grandpa?"
No.
"Krystle loves Grandpa a whole lot, you know that."
But I saw-
"There you are, L.B."
I've been looking everywhere for you.
"Hello, Steven."
"Hi, Krystle."
Mrs. Gunnerson just made you a big chocolate milkshake.
So you wanna come downstairs with me right now.
"Krystle, is there anything wrong between you and L.B.?"
"Well, of course not."
"Well, it's just that L.B.'s taken on a new habit, Steven."
He's begun to lie and tell little fibs.
"Oh, I know it's only because he misses Jeff."
I only hope it's just a phase he's going through.
I'm sure it is.
It's probably best for us just to ignore it.
Ignore it.
I guess you're right.
I know you're right.
"Tell me, Mr. Wales, are you still doing your hatchet jobs for World Finance Magazine?"
I thought you forgot about us.
I haven't seen you here in a long time.
I'm not who you think I am.
"Well, when his family disappeared... there was a lot of rumors."
Some said they had gone back to Russia.
Others said there was trouble with their grocery in Little Odessa.
Russian mob controls everything in Little Odessa.
Maybe that's why he joined them.
- How old was he?
- Sixteen.
Forced to live on the street.
You gotta be strong to be a white boy growing up in this neighborhood.
Did he ever mention me?
Your brother's.
He kept it here all these years.
- Was he happy?
- Yeah.
"The last I saw him, he had matured."
Got real serious.
- But he had choices.
- What choices?
- He was alone.
- I'd have taken him in.
He was a strange boy.
You should go back to France.
What you find here could be ugly.
Did he ever mention someone named Alex Bohemia?
But there's a nightclub in Little Odessa called the Bohemia.
"Your vodka, Mr. Suverov."
"Excuse me, I'm looking-"
"Mr. Suverov, you have a phone call."
Follow me.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
It's a miracle it's still here.
The guys forgot it and didn't lock the car.
Welcome.
Thank you.
You're kind.
"Here, even if your car's gold, no one will touch it."
"Opposite the school, the students are curious."
It's best to lock it.
All right.
Are you in telecommunications?
Telecommunications?
Yes.
This place is a world of communication.
Why're you here?
"Yes, that's obvious."
I've never seen a woman serve before.
Where did you spring from?
What?
"You have parents, don't you?"
Who served your father his tea?
My mother.
Why say you've never seen such a thing?
All women serve.
They have three trades:
"by day, they're workers. ln the evening, they serve and at night they work."
Except for your mother.
Thanks all the same!
I've told you time and again not to park here.
Park next to the engineer.
"When you start it up, you pollute the cafe."
"Yes, sir."
What are those things?
What?
Those things moving up and down.
Oil rigs.
"When those things are moving up and down, it means times are good."
Looks like times are good.
Shoot.
We must have left some of them back in Florida.
Left what?
I packed a couple of boxes with socks and things.
I could've sworn --
"Jimmy, did you find that one box?"
"Oh, no."
"It's okay, Mom."
"Don't worry, honey."
We'll find it.
I've never known a boy to get so upset about losing his socks.
His glove was in there.
His what?
His glove was in there.
"Oh, quit moping and grab a box."
Did you hear me?
There are more important things in life than baseball.
"The sooner you figure that out, the better."
"This Lee Ivaco-cocus guy,"
"I guarantee you, within two years, three years tops, he's gonna run that company right out of business."
"Ain't that right, young man?"
Eileen?
Eileen!
I guess she gone to lunch.
"Help you find something, son?"
Color me impressed.
This mode's got some serious power.
I'll say.
Let's turn this guy black and blue.
[all grunt] [growls] What?
I'm seeing red.
"Red rangers, it's time to get fired up."
"[grunting] [groaning] [groaning] At least it took five teams to beat me. [argus] If these setbacks continue,"
The prince will lose his mind.
Something must be done.
Leave it to me.
I've been working on something big.
It's a waste to use it on this little planet.
Consider this a test.
[grunts]
Maximizer.
Watch.
We no longer need zombats.
And we can enlarge more than one monster at a time.
[all] Huh? They're doing it without zombats.
Now they can grow four at once?
[alarm signal] That'll be Gosei.
[Gosei] Rangers.
You can see the aliens have new capabilities.
But you have some too.
"Along with your new powers, come new zords and a special skyship."
Summon them.
Thanks.
We're on it.
Summon skyship.
Wow.
Sweet ride.
"- Well, thank you."
And I love your scarf.
Really brings out your vagina.
How come I have never thought of that before?
[ Grunts ]
[ Chuckling ] That's funny.
[ Whispering ] How can she be above me?
Do you realize she's a woman?
- Yes.
Why are we whispering?
- Because they can hear everything!
"- She's a topflight chef, Steven."
She ran her own restaurant.
- Ohhh!
"I don't care if she's a world-class balloonist... who can whistle ""London Bridge Is Falling Down"" out of her ass!"
- This should've been mine!
"- You're preaching to the choir, buddy."
- What?
Pino doesn't trust me?
- Why would he?
You stole his Vicodin.
- We don't need another chef.
"- Yes, we do."
"We're getting slammed, okay?"
And I'm just giving her the scut work.
"You're still my go-to guy, huh?"
You're my right-hand man.
You're the Sundance to my Butch.
"- Oh, good."
So I'm actually in charge.
- No.
What's she ever done that's so great?
I think somebody needs to work on their sense of humor.
It was a joke.
Oh.
I'm Monica.
Got it.
Monica.
"So, Mike- Yes?"
What sort of impression do I make?
Come again?
If we were in a bar and you hadn't seen me before.
Oh.
Can I speak candidly?
I insist you speak candidly.
I'd think you were a hot piece of ass.
Good answer.
- Sarasvati.
"- Yes, Miss Mancuso?"
You told me you would have the opening day revenue report by now.
Where is it?
I'm afraid it's still being prepared.
Unacceptable.
Mr. Deline had some special requests.
He suggested you speak to him.
Come on.
Show some cleavage.
"It's a casino, not a convent."
"Okay, okay."
That's me taking the first counterfeit I found.
"Now, let's run it backwards... until we see that specific tray being removed from the cart."
All right?
Wow.
That's an easy gig.
Aren't you hungry?
I want to eat something yummy.
Will you treat me?
"Sure, what do you want?"
Something really tasty.
Like spicy rice cakes.
Spicy rice cakes?
Spicy rice cakes?
Don't know if they have it here.
Don't think so.
Do they sell rice cakes here?
"If they do, I can cook it myself."
I'm really good at it.
Really?
Let's check out the grocery store.
Don't go out of your way.
"Don't worry, stupid."
Let's go down to that sand dune.
There's something real neat.
What is it?
I'll show you.
What is it?
"You see, I got the splinter out."
"I didn't get it out myself, and didn't know when it happened."
But I think it was when I bowed on my knees.
You went down on your knees?
"Yeah, I think that's when the splinter got out."
Why did you bow?
Come on and see.
"You'll feel like doing it, too."
Why are you laughing?
"Alright, let's go."
She's very classy and even prettier in person.
I must say this could change everything.
Yes!
"Oh, are you gonna finish that sandwich?"
I've been driving all day.
-Please.
-Thanks.
Now we're just gonna need some proof of employment.
Some what?
Some pay stubs tax records.
Just something I can submit to the board.
Miss Montana pays in cash.
Is proving this going to be a problem?
Of course not.
[Growls]
How'd it go?
Stupid proof of employment.
Tax stubs.
No cookie.
I drove 200 miles just to say...
You want proof Cookie Lady I'll show you proof.
Hey uh why didn't you just use the emergency Hannah kit.
You keep in your car?
Because I forgot!
[Mimicks cat snarling]
Yes Miley the directions you gave me were perfect as usual.
Now if I could just find that incredibly competent and extremely attractive.
Admissions woman that you described.
[Gasps] Oh wait there she is.
You are the best.
"Kiss, kiss."
Bye.
It's going straight to voicemail.
Voicemail?
"Just chill, okay?"
Count your money.
"Combo, you seen Badger?"
Don't you cover for him!
"I ask you a straight-up question,"
I expect a straight-up answer!
Well?
They were too scared to tell me.
Badger got busted.
He's in jail.
"Honey, I'm home!"
Too slow!
What's up?
You've got more lives than a damn cat.
Now if I can only learn to lick myself.
"What's up, guys?"
Good to see you.
All right!
"Let's all go back to work, for Christ's sake!"
"In my office, man."
Let's see what you bozos have been up to lately.
You okay?
Hanging in?
What's it look like?
What's this from APD?
I been checking with them to see if they come across that famous blue meth of yours.
"Sure enough, last night."
Got themselves an honest-to-God dealer.
I was thinking of cruising over and saying hello.
Maybe you'd like to go with me.
You're fine?
You haven't seen Violet since she got home.
"You live with her for six months, now you won't even pick up a clean shirt?"
You won't talk about it.
Like you talk about you getting fired?
"I'm doing my job, Cooper..."
the one I have left.
My problems aren't getting in the way of that.
I have a patient.
"Echo is now a grand old matriarch, her crossed tusks make her unmistakable."
Hello.
"Violet, you're there."
Yeah.
"Well, that's how the telephone works."
You call people.
They answer.
You speak.
Right.
"Uh, look, I was just calling to remind you that if Lucas can't sleep, give him the sheep toy."
"And he likes the rain sound, but not the whale calls."
"Uh, well, nobody likes the whale calls."
They're eerie.
You're checking up on me.
Yeah.
I was hoping you'd be out.
"Well, Lucas is sleeping now, so, uh, I better go."
You know what they say...
sleep while the baby sleeps.
The Larsens?
My Larsens?
Yeah.
"Well, my Larsens now."
- Rape isn't a joke.
- No.
- It is in this line.
"It gets a big laugh, though."
"Hey, we're about to do..."
"Oh, no, we're not."
"This, you're being pulled by a, whatever that's called, a dolly rig."
- These guys are towing the...
- Not actually driving.
Is this the night...?
"Oh, no, that's gonna be in another scene."
- Is this a real or fake background?
- This is all real.
- We're really being...
- That's 1 st Avenue.
"I don't think we had a fake background in the Yugo, did we?"
No.
"Oh, except when I'm, like, driving into the city."
- In the van we had a fake thing.
- Seth Meyers.
"- And Lorene Scafaria, the writer."
- Our writer.
Screenplay writer.
- She's so hot.
- These guys were great.
"Some people don't realize that that's Seth Meyers, right, Mike?"
"Some, yeah."
"A lot of people, actually."
I've mentioned:
"""Yeah, Seth Meyers was the guy in the back."""
"They're like, ""No way, that was him?"""
"- Wait, what were they like?"
Caped Crusader probably has Black Widow under lock and key at this very minute.
- Commissioner Gordon.
-This is Irving Irving at the just-opened Heritage First National Bank.
"- Yes, Mr. Irving."
-I just had a call from Batman.
"He wants me to take $40,000 in a brown paper bag to the front of the bank at exactly 11:43 this morning."
"-Well, that sounds odd, Mr. Irving."
He says the Batmobile will be parked there.
And he's arranged for Black Widow to meet him and they will split the money.
"Oh, well, then do it by all means."
"- Thank you for calling, Mr. Irving."
"- All right, commissioner."
Ha!
"Apparently, Batman is springing a trap on Black Widow."
That's good.
Are you sure you're gonna be able to drive the Batmobile from the passenger side?
"Perfectly, Tarantula."
"What time is it, doll?"
Exactly 11 :37.
"Got to run, sweetheart."
Keep an eye on the Dynamic Duo.
While my Batman and Robin do their stuff.
"Ta-da, darling."
"Well, Chief O'Hara, Black Widow's caper should be just about over."
And I should be hearing from Batman now.
"Yes, right on schedule."
Why isn't he calling on the Batphone?
Commissioner Gordon.
"Ah, ha-ha-ha."
Ro-
"- Robin did what, Mr. Irving?"
Oh.
–Nothin'.
"Hey, it's cool."
You can tell me.
No.
It doesn't matter.
I gotta get back.
"Seeing the way you stiffed your partner, I figure you're just one big hard-on today."
–Excuse me?
–You know what an officer-involved shooting means?
It means that we're all involved.
–I told the truth.
–When it comes to your partner's career... the truth is like grits.
You don't serve it up plain.
You put a little salt on it.
You goddamn rookies.
$20 apiece.
I'll let 'em both go for 35.
That's real...
That's like chiffon.
And this look good with your eyes.
And this is silk right here.
This will look real good with...
"Drop the clothes, ladies."
"Although, you have got to have that one."
–She's keeping that one for free.
–Wait...
Whoa!
"–I got receipts for all this, man!"
"–Oh, yeah?"
That's funny.
I got a police report for it from Dress For Less.
"Dealin' stolen merchandise, Taylor."
So j... give me your skates.
What?
Why?
"You've dragged me so far, we're closer to my office than we are to the car."
Take 'em off!
He just wasn't ready.
But me?
I had a message for the small stuff that used to rule my life.
"Hey, Phil."
"Honey, how you holding up?"
Good.
"So, I'm at the beach..."
Long story.
"Anyway, I was hoping you wouldn't mind waiting at the house for Luke's tutor."
"Actually, I would mind."
I'd mind quite a bit.
I'm kind of busy.
"Okay, great."
"Suck it, small stuff."
Why are we stopping?
"For many, a near-miss with death is a wake-up call."
"But when a man misses his own near-miss, he truly sees what he's been missing."
No more putting my dreams on hold.
"Five years ago, I made a bucket list."
It was time to start crossing things off.
Scariest moment of my life.
Ohh.
"Oh, my gosh."
I thought I lost you!
"But amazingly, something great came out of it."
I found out how my sister truly feels about me.
"Girls, are you sure?"
"I think about my father, about my mother."
I'm searching in the mud.
- Don't you want to look at me?
- It's difficult.
Tough day?
Was it easier with the gangster's woman?
It was just a reflex.
She loved me.
So one has to be in love to reflect?
It's better for the other one.
- The neighbor?
- Up above.
Do you mean God?
Could it be just the two of us for two minutes?
It'd be too sad.
"But everything's sad, open your eyes!"
I can't see.
"I can see into, but not..."
"And how am I, into?"
Young.
Would you like to visit?
"I can be just as cheap a tart as your tramp, you know!"
No you can't.
You enjoy that?
"You really are fucked up, friend of a friend!"
It's André!
"André, meet my friend of a friend, Léo."
André is a man on the move.
"He's moving in Mom, who's moving him up."
"Forget sweet talk, when it comes to whoring, I'm his bet."
"""But once in America, what will we do?"
"""Monsieur de la Fayette will provide you with instructions!"""
I wanna hear what she has to say.
"Bloody Mary, shadows have power, I get it."
But what if that's not just a shadow?
That look on her face is somebody who's trapped.
"Believe me, I know that look and so do you."
"If things get hinky, you can pull the plug."
What do you got to lose?
I do need to do this.
"Wait, wait!"
Let me think!
Where are you?
So Mr. Whitman doesn't look good.
- No sign of any artifact.
- Not even a glimmer.
- What's up with his hand?
- I don't know.
"If you want to get rest, I'll stay with them."
- Not if they split up.
- I'll call you.
"No, no."
Let's...
Let's stay together.
"If they've got something, it's on 'em."
I want to know what it is.
I've been burned by this before.
They look real and they'll say anything.
Say something.
"Artie, when I get out of here, I'm hugging her and"
I'm kicking your ass.
"Yeah, well, that won't be happening."
Why?
"- Artie, it's me."
Take care of Jean!
How is it?
I see.
Hey!
The door is open.
The Doc..?
Probably inside the ark.
Why aren't you following them?
Well...
Look at that.
Light doesn't even penetrate it.
I've never seen or heard of such a thing.
This is the center of Noah.
This is Noah's control panel.
let's begin.
Are you alright?
Take care.
Professor.
The shield upon Noah is now undone.
Professor.
Yes.
It's..!
It's wonderful!
while arms reductions are progressing over the world the focus of our attentions is on environmental issues.
global warming... all of these problems can be solved.
Macdougal!
Our country must always be the leader of the free world.
So we wanted to obtain this by any means.
Why does the Pentagon have to have this?
they could end up destroying their own country.
What is your real purpose in all this?
Is it dead?
"So, um, so just out there."
Anybody could tell that old man wasn't...
You can't assume anything about anybody in a case like this.
That's the guy that's going to fuck you.
Damn right.
Shit.
"I been police chief here for, hell, going on, uh, six years."
I never even had to draw my gun.
"Good night, you."
Can you kiss your favorite mommy?
Get in the bed.
Get in there.
Get in the bed.
"See you in the morning, okay?"
"Good night, mommy."
Night.
Enjoying yourself?
Getting enough to eat and drink?
"Well, just about."
"That's your second bottle, isn't it?"
"Yes, it is."
I want to apologize about Dale's comment.
Bet John feels terrible.
Dale didn't mean anything by it.
He just grew up talking that way.
"Well, I understand, and I'm..."
I'm sure John does too.
"These people are pretty dangerous, aren't they?"
"Yes, ma'am, they are."
"You know, I've never seen Dale this excited before."
I guess this is about the biggest thing that's ever happened to him.

"To think Canada's got her, and we have Kelly Clarkson going to town at a Waffle House."
"That's it, I'm getting those sneakers."
"After all, shoes make the man."
"Gentlemen, take your marks."
(pistol fires)
(crowd cheering)
I'm a different kind of winner.
"Oh, come on, Dad, there's no cash in here."
"Just a bunch of cards that say, ""I farted on your car,"""
with his insurance info.
(moans sadly)
Busted.
"Geez, it's so weird that Mom and Dad would leave the house without their purse and wallet."
I wonder where they are?
Can I get you anything else?
"Uh, two more Cokes, please."
Could you excuse me?
(keypad beeping)
(phone rings)
Hello.
"Damone, it's Peter."
I'm at my date and I left my wallet at home.
"Will you please borrow your mom's car, drive to my house, get my wallet, and bring it back here?"
"Damone, are you there?"
We'll be moving the patients out as quickly as we can.
There is no bomb.
It's Haskell DeBray.
This is how he works.
I will not leave her side.
Come along now.
Hey!
Second floor!
The cops want to talk to you!
What do you want?
- Where's DeBray?
- I don't know.
"He came by to say hello, and then he took off."
That's not his apartment?
Why would I be in his apartment?
Should I sing you a lullaby?
Like your little boy never heard from you?
Help!
Help!
No!
Why don't you talk to her?
Why don't you find out why she's been stalking me?
"Why were you at the hospital, Mrs. Price?"
I'm a news producer.
I go where the story is.
Is he clear to go?
"Yeah, I'll discharge him."
Good.
"In that case, Haskell DeBray, you are under arrest for the attempted murder of Mimi Halderman."
You have the right to remain silent...
I have no plans to remain silent.
But I'll only talk to one person.
And they put me out in the streets.
"Well, child, that ain't nothing to cry about."
Look here.
"Here you got an apartment, right smack on the corner with the highest ceiling in Harlem."
'Look at that electric light.'
"'Why, you even got running water.'"
"Ah-h, child, with that smile you got everything."
"'Why, you're the richest gal in Harlem.'"
What do you care about being outdoor?
What will I do when it rains?
"If you insist on being inside, go in and tell that landlord.."
"[""I'm Livin' ina Great Big Way""]"
* You got a snap in your fingers *
Got that.
* And a rhythm in your walk.
Got that too.
* As the elephant say I'm livin' in a great big way *
"It's all the way you look at it, you know."
* Got a handful of nothin'
"Why, you're a rich millionaire."
* But I watch it like a hawk.
True mama.
"*Well, I'm doin' okay *"
*I'm livin' in a great big way *
Tell that to the landlord.
* I'm the salt in the ocean
* I'm the sun way up in the sky *
"Oh, no."
*I'm a Franklin D. Roosevelt *
*I'm a million dollars *
* Long as I got a snap in my fingers *
* Rhythm in my walk.
"Fine, okay."
"Sia, you won't believe it."
There was a call from the local police station.
Vikram Kapoor called the police to confess that he killed Maya.
What?
!
Just 70 rupees.
The latest from Bollywood.
August 22nd.
- He is dead.
Vikram didn't confess voluntarily.
He was forced to.
How does Neil figure in this?
"Sunil, who is the only one to have skipped surveillance?"
"Yes, sir."
"Where are you, Sia?"
"Mumbai, sir."
Vikram Kapoor is dead.
He was found in his house with slashed wrists... but his body has severe signs of violence.
"Sir, Neil Menon is on a killing spree."
Eliminating all the witnesses from that weekend.
Did I not give you a direct order to drop that case?
And to drop Neil Menon.
"Sir, if you could just listen to me."
"No, you listen to me."
I want you off that case.
Right now.
I will see you in my office tomorrow.
Sir...
"Sir, if someone in our department... is protecting Neil Menon..."
"That will be enough, Ms. Agnihotri."
What?
We only went to dinner and then a movie.
"Harriet is not your daughter, Miss Golly."
"She is mine, and you have no idea, none, what it is like to come home and find"
- that your child is missing.
- We had no idea that you'd be home this soon.
I don't care.
I don't care what you did or where you went or why.
All I know is this can never happen again.
Miss Golly... you are fired.
What?
!
No!
Just a moment.
This is my fault.
Please.
"Well, it seems awfully sudden."
Actually... maybe it's not.
"I think you're right, Mrs. Welsch."
It is time for me to go.
What?
What?
What?
"Now, look, I admit, I lost it... because, I just..."
I was frightened.
"But the thing is, the fact is we need you, Golly."
We can't do it alone.
"We all spoke out of turn, I think."
None of this is causing...
Absolutely not.
"Absolutely, no."
"I mean, I think we were talking about... our feelings out there."
"You were afraid and-and-and now what we should be focusing on, right?"
Who is receiving it?
- You might be knowing him.
Balwant.
See you tomorrow evening.
Come in.
The door is open.
"Balwant's briefcase contained 500,OOO worth of gold."
100/o is your share.
"That is 50,OOO."
Here...
- Keep it there.
Won't you count it?
-You must have counted it.
Any news of Balwant?
He's hiding in East View lodge in Kalina.
"Tony, where do you get this information from?"
"He'll vanish from Bombay for good ifyou don't arrest him today,"
Halt!
There's nothing to panic.
Bombay's highly reputed criminal lawyer will fight Balwant's case.
"I got it, Mr Daaga."
Tomorrow is Sunday.
He will be bailed out on Monday.
Fine.
But I think it's difficult to free Balwant from this case.
What's the use of my fees if I don't free your man?
Rest assured.
I'll be prepared for the case.
"I hear, you and Inspector Vijay are vey good friends."
Absolutely true.
Our friendship dates back to our childhood.
We studied together.
Traitor you get your hands off of me!
I can't breathe!
The girl was mine!
She's of no use to us.
Only our mission for the Führer matters.
"I wonder sometimes monsieur, if you have that clearly in mind?"
It was not to be cherie.
"You bastard, I'll get you for this!"
"Indiana Jones, adieu!"
Nooo!
Take this.
Wave it at anything that slithers.
Oh my god this whole place is slithering!
Indy!
"Aow, Jesus!"
Where did you get this?
From him?
I was trying to escape.
No thanks to you.
How hard were you trying?
Where the hell were you
"- Watch it, watch it!"
What are you doing?
Helping the fire!
How the hell are we going to get out of here?
"I'm working on it, I'm working on it!"
"Whatever you're doing, do it faster!"
Where are you going?
Through that wall.
Just get ready to run whatever happens to me.
What do you mean by that?
Indy!
I won't say a word.
"It won't be easy, but I promise."
Oh.
"Oh, I'd love to."
"Yes, I'll do some shopping, and then I'll meet you for lunch."
Okay.
Bye.
"- Who was it, honey?"
- Louise.
- What are you so happy about?
- She wants me to meet her for lunch.
"- Oh, boy."
Some life I've given you.
- What do you mean?
"A little thing like going out to lunch, and you're ecstatic."
I'm easy to please.
"I'll just go change, and then I'll drive you to the office."
"Honey, I'm a little late."
Only take a minute.
Darrin.
"Larry, I want to speak to you about the Waterhouse account."
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
"Well, I'm talking to you about it first."
Remember the Hoffsteddler-Douglas account?
"- Yes, but..."
- Before I took over Hoffsteddler hadn't spoken to Douglas in 30 years.
"- You did a fine job there, Darrin."
"- Yes, I did."
And let's not overlook the Michael Sales Company account.
"Before I took charge, they couldn't give away ice water in the middle of the Mojave Desert."
- A memorable job.
"Yes, it was."
And why things happen this way and not the other.
I think there's no much use in talking about what happened already.
Probably...
You're always trying to explain people what happens to them.
Instead of looking to yourself.
"Once, I was thinking of you.."
And then I got sad.
Then I'm not funny always.
You never put any effort in a better living.
"For example, you say you like living in the field."
Then why don't you move here?
Would you come with me?
Why do you say that?
I'm saying if you'd live here with me.
I don't know.
I told you I may not like the idea.
What does that mean to what we were talking?
Do you love me Sara?
And what did that come from?
I'm asking you.
How I couldn't love you.
You're my father!
And if I weren't?
Imagine for a moment that I weren't.
What a nonsense!
What do I know?
Could you give me a cigarette?
I'm going to bed.
We had a long ride.
Good night.
Bye.
Good night.
What?
- Don't you dare.
- What would you have me do?
- What would you do?
- Not this!
That's not an answer.
That doesn't help me.
I cannot let this fail.
It just has.
You're wrong.
"You've got what you wanted, so you can stop now."
It's OK.
"It's all right, you're all right."
You returned what you stole.
Your sentence is commuted.
Justice and mercy.
This is our law.
"You know, we're totally confident."
I've looked closely at the vaccine research and it's impeccable.
There's nothing at all to worry about.
And I'd like to thank you for your courage.
We're not the only ones.
There are survivors everywhere.
"People live, you know?"
The thought of Davy being alone.
That finishes me.
The rest...
It's a good life.
Thanks.
We'll bring the car back.
"Looking for her son Peter, 12 today."
There's an estate called Waterhouse.
"I was thinking, ""How am I gonna back up?"""
I don't even know how to drive forward on a stick shift.
- I can't believe you left her there.
- I can.
Good.
I think that's the first time anyone's sympathized for her character there.
People cheer.
I love how she checks her boobs to see if there's something wrong.
"Her boobs must be misaligned, that's why he backed away."
- That's so funny.
"- It's so sweet, though."
That's so funny.
"- Mike, you're..."
This is terrific.
- This is a great moment.
This is really late.
- Oscar.
Oscar.
- Right?
Really late.
"- Yeah, it's probably 5:30, 5:45."
"- Well, maybe a Golden Globe."
Look how great.
That was really me doing that.
I really actually did that.
"Mike, you're a handsome act..."
Good actor.
I just want to sum this up.
"If you wanna give us any compliments, feel free."
"- Yeah, go for it."
- You guys are handsome.
You're so good.
"Dale, Baby."
What you do here?
Wow let me guess...
Baby's mama?
Did you just call me a baby?
Baby she didn't just call me a baby now did she?
What?
Don't screw with me slut!
Excuse me?
You don't know her do you JP?
Yeah baby.
This is Dale.
Not anymore you don't.
Bye bye.
This is my first bitch slap but seeing the look on her Botoxed face.
You deserve him!
"Totally makes it worth it,"
I like!
And he's going to put me in his next movie.
But isn't he kind of old?
Aren't you going to have to you know...
Do him?
Probably.
Oh God!
If I have to stand here and listen to this bimbo yap about the blowjob she'll have to give to get a movie part.
I'll pee in my pants.
Um excuse me...
We're in line.
"Um, actually you're at the mirror which doesn't really constitute the line."
Well just go... fine.
I'll give you my number and then you know maybe we can hang out sometime?
You gonna give me your number?
No soldiers or militiamen.
- And the people who live here?
- They've fled.
The bastards' last visit must have convinced them to find a better place.
I'm picking up radio messages about troop movement along the border.
All right.
Drive on.
- I'm sorry that we have to say goodbye now.
- We'll meet again.
"- Goodbye, Mariá."
- Goodbye.
- Come on.
- I want to stay with Mariá.
No.
You're going with Padre Julio.
You're staying with him for a while.
"As soon as this war is over, we'll be together again."
I promise.
"Come on, Pablito."
- Goodbye.
- Good luck.
- Thanks.
- Don't drink so much Communion wine.
- We have a lot to do.
- It might be a small regiment.
They get scared when you say boo!
They're cowards.
Something must have happened.
They were talking about Ramírez.
It must be important.
Listen for as long as you can.
See you at the pass.
How are you?
All has been arranged?
"All, the meeting will be in Quito."
Shall we?
lets.
"Your attention please,"
Equatorian Aviation announces the arrival of flight 422 from Guayaquil.
Something for the press?
"Please, tell us something about the convention."
"Well,we have selected the best models."
and we will present the most exclusive of swimsuits.
I am certain it will be a big success.
As we all are.
"A photo please, thanks."
"""The Beach Club"""
"No, wait, Adriana!"
"Hold it, Adriana, its me!"
I can see you!
"My goodness, I know you have improved, but, you almost broke my neck."
Then why do you startle me?
I'll buy you a drink
When did you return?
I just came in.
This is my first night off.
is it?
First night?
Do you accept that drink?
Then we shall meet tonight!
"Say, Adriana, come here, wait!"
"Oh, excuse me."
Alex!
"Inspector, what are you up to?"
It's displaying that he is just in the car in front of yours.
"Varun, what are you doing?"
- Leave me!
I'll kill her!
Listen.
- Hey!
Don't do anything silly.
Don't move.
Everything will go in vain if you go there now.
We can't prove anything with what we have found out so far.
Have some patience.
She has a new scapegoat.
All we have to do is to catch her red-handed.
At least we have to know what they are talking
Or do you want to sit here and issue parking tickets?
Let's do that also.
Give me the Bluetooth earpiece.
Why?
"- I'll tell you, give it to me."
Wait here.
Where...
Juice will do?
Hello.
"- Yes, Sadhana."
Don't talk.
Stay on line.
"Had you not been here, I would have helpless."
How will I ever repay you Vikram?
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
- Hey.
Why are you so formal?
I wrote it before I left.
"I got my mum to send it, as an alibi."
E-Eleanor was right.
It was me.
"I'm sorry, Chris."
You convinced me the first time around someone else is going to have to own up.
"For fuck's sake, somebody please!"
"- Come on, don't go all gay on me."
- Fuck's sake.
"- Please, no!"
"- Man up, fella."
"Do you want the truth, Justin?"
Your brother was a creep.
"- No, that's not true!"
"- Yes, it bloody is!"
A creep!
"A weirdo, all twitchy and desperate."
- I thought you were his friends.
- He didn't have any friends.
No one liked him.
None of us.
So you just watched while Chris pushed him around?
I didn't see the fight.
But I saw Felix.
He was upstairs in the bedroom.
Eleanor was going down on me and...
- Felix was watching us.
- What?
"I was getting a blowjob and Felix was standing in the doorway staring at me, with my dick out."
"I told him to get lost, naturally."
"""Get lost, you bloody queer!"" were my exact words, I believe."
Are you saying my brother's queer?
- Knew it.
- Okay.
"All right, well, uh, what does his relationship status on his Facebook say?"
"""Facebook""?"
"I don't know, Grandpa."
We don't have a typewriter.
- Snap.
"- Oh, come on, Facebook is on a compute..."
"No, no, no, stop talking, because the more you say, the older we get."
"Okay, fine, I won't say anything."
"No, no, no!"
We can actually help this child.
"Unlike Lark, she's telling us what's wrong in words we can understand."
"Yeah, we're gonna tell you"
"- what you do here, okay?"
- Yes.
Just go over there.
"No, if we get too close, he might recognize us."
"Okay, well, uh, here."
He won't recognize us.
(stammers) He didn't know what we looked like before.
"Yeah, of course."
"Hey, will you put this on my birthday list?"
"Yeah, okay, one stupid hat."
Got it.
"What's up, Broseph Stalin?"
You looking for something special?
Maybe for a special someone?
You work here?
"- Yeah, we do."
We for sure do.
- Yeah.
Yeah?
What'd you learn in class today?
I don't know...
the usual.
Yeah?
You weren't learning how to cut class
With your little faggoty little friends?
Enrique!
"It ain't like I never cut class before,"
But don't lie to me.
Enrique!
"You can't follow me around, Papi."
Sit down.
I don't go following you around.
"What's up with your hands, man?"
Put your hands down and talk to me like a man.
I didn't raise you to be like that.
You didn't raise me!
"You can't just come in here and try to be ""Papi"" now."
"Well, I am your papi, I am!"
"Dejalo, Kike."
(Phone ringing)
"""Creating a vagina approximately"

"Look, you circled this one here."

That's one dusty ass flower.
"Hater, ew."
"Don't turn the page yet, I'm looking."
Confirmed.
"Set a course for Destiny, speed standard by six."
- Where's that?
- Confirmed.
- What have you got there?
"- Why are we leaving them behind, what's going on?"
Where is Destiny?
!
"According to Avon, it's a story that doesn't have an end yet."
"All right then, we'll start with the beginning."
Probe.
Does this mean anything to you?
54124?
"- No, I don't think so."
- Should it?
Is it important?
"Yes, it is important."
Monitor response?
- The air is stale in here.
- The ventilator's closed.
- Well?
- Zero response.
There's nothing I can do.
It will have to be replaced.
I shall need laser transfer linkage.
Have you got any?
"I think so, in the storage hold."
I'll go and check.
"Stay here, I'll get it."
You'll need a torch.

[ELECTRONIC HUM]
Then...
I'll go with someone else.
Don't forget to pick me up!
Didn't you say that you don't like movie?
"I did, but I didn't say I will not go!"
Xiaotian!
- Has the class over?
"- Yes, why are you here ?"
Didn't you say you have no vacation?
The brigade dispatched us here to borrow equipment.
"I just want too see you, so I asked for one day off."
But I have to report the task at 7 a.m tomorrow.
It just one night?
Many things you can do in one night!
Well...
"The key car, it's for you."
"There is some clothes for change, too."
"Inside the packet of clothes, you'll find something you need!"
What is it?
I'm feeling uneasy to tell it!
Isn't it distracting?
It is.
You may take that off.
- Xiamu...
- It's 6 p.m.
"Yes, it is."
6 p.m?
Sorry!
Sorry!
I forgot.
Come here immediately!
I can't go now.
"Let's go, Master!"
Let's go
Now you've offended Master Yeh!
Do you understand!
?
"This is his land, and the lease is up!"
To be able to keep doing business here I flatter him when I can
Now you've made trouble for me get out!
Get out!
Out!
Didn't you hear me?
Out!
Yes-out!
Out!
"Go, or I'll lie you up and send you to Mr.Yeh to be beaten!"
Best beat you to death to save trouble!
I told you so many times not to bother him!
It just goes in one ear and out the other!
Just pick up your wages and get out!
Yu-lu!
Here's 30 dumplings for the road
Please talk to Boss.
We can't leave!
Why not?
We stayed here for someone
That's right!
You'll just waste your time by staying
"No-where there's a will, there's a way!"
I won't ever agree!
What?
You won't let us study kung-fu?
You mean you stayed for Master Chang?
I've got a ride.
Emily.
"No, it's me."
Spencer.
"It's really very nice of you, but I'm here now."
I'm going with Spencer.
I see.
"Hanna, the man's ID checked out."
It checked out because there was a James Leland related to Mrs. Potter but this isn't him.
This is somebody else.
"If I tell the state people some story about the man being an imposter it'll just draw attention, which we do not want."
"Well, we have to do something."
I'm not doing anything based on what Caleb says.
Leland's coming to the bank.
I will show him the safe deposit box.
And we will go from there.
"- All right, well, call me when he leaves."
- I will.
Hey.
I thought you were gonna be gone all day.
"Uh, change of plans."
Good.
I'll take you and Mike out for dinner later.
Okay?
"Hey, Dad?"
How were the parent-teacher meetings?
"Oh, they were fine."
"You know, I really like that one teacher, your French teacher."
"- Well, how do you like Mr. Fitz?"
- He was okay.
Okay?
"All right, listen, I'm gonna tell you the truth."
I dunno.
A bag bag.
Was it a suitcase or an overnight bag?
"Yeah, that's it."
An overnight bag.
"He goes out for a jog, like you said, and then... ..he comes back out with a bag."
What was I supposed to do?
Did anything happen to spook him?
Did he see you?
Of course not.
What?
"If we mess this up, they will find you dead of an overdose and I'll be back in prison waiting for someone to stab me in the showers"
"Better hope he hasn't gone far, Calum."

What do you mean a runner?
Just took off all of a sudden.
Find him for me.
And then what?
Operation Merlin's all but dead and buried.
"""I want him dealt with, John."
"And this time no guns."""
"John, I finally cracked it."

What are you talking about?
Those Spanish doughnut things you dip in hot chocolate after you've been out all night.
?
?
"So again last night, the wife got a call around 10:30."
It's the husband calling to say good night.
Exactly.
He's always calling.
They must like each other.
- I have proof.
"You really did it, Lex."
You in here?
What happened?
- You okay?
- Somebody hit me.
They destroyed the picture.
But you were right.
I saw the picture.
It was Lex.
"When I went to see Lex, I found Lionel's locket."
"But without that photo, we can't prove anything."
- What about the key?
- I X-rayed the mansion.
It's nowhere to be found.
- Jimmy and Lois?
Where are they?
- I don't know.
And I'm worried.
"The last I heard, they were leaving the Daily Planet."
If whoever attacked me
- followed the photo from there to here...
- He may have stopped them from leaving the building.
I got to go.
"If Lex has both of those keys, not only will he discover your secret, but he'll have complete power over you."
That's not just your worst nightmare...
"It's everyone else's, too."

These aren't book pages.
But what else could they be?
They're punch cards.
It must be an ancient...
"It's a computer, and these cards program it."
"Kelly, slide these in where the symbols match."
"Professor, let me see the Torch."
Here.
But how does it run?
A computer needs electricity.
Maybe not.
The people of Atlantis tapped into the volcano for power.
They used geothermal technology.
You mean this thing runs on heat?
No.

"On chair, There are lot of chairs,"
"Which chair, left or right?"
Lefts one.

"My metric's question paper, here."
"Here, on this chair."
"Really, you're such a daring man,"
"Thank you Sir, You come straight here."
"If I called you then you won't come, You were busy that's why I came her,"
"Anyway Sir, Shall we finish the work,"
Sorry Sir!
"Don't get me wrong, I am in hurry."
"I have to finish one more job,"

"After finish my job, you'll go to finish for another job."

Everybody loved Stacks.
He was supposed to do was steal the panel truck and afterwards compact it by a friend of ours out in Jersey.
Only Morrie was driving us nuts.
Morrie...
Have a drink and shut up.
Just because he set this up he felt he could bust Jimmies balls for an advance on the money we were going to steal.
He didn't mean anything by it.
That's just the way he was.
I had everybody working for me.

is this the same baby you used last week?
"No, that one was my sister's."
This is Deirdra's.

"She looks just like you, Lois."
That's what the stewardess said.
-Yeah...
"Take it easy, Sandy."
"Come on, Henry..."

You got all day.
"Just make it last, all right?"
Take it easy.

Mr. Bulut notified me about the evening schedule.
Dance of Whirling Dervishes at 6 p.m.
A short speech at the end would be appropriate.
"Please refrain from mentioning Iraq, Syria,"
"Israel, the Kurds, Armenia, our federal issues and debt."
Soccer is a touchy subject as well.
Banquet starts at 8 p.m. Nine courses.

"Your speech, Sire."
"I fall because of that girl, my heat has become candle."

Then my bullet will kiss you.

Your every condition is accepted.
I will not kill him.
You will kill him.
No.
"No... don't do this... i have never even killed the bee, how can i kill a man?"
Teach him to kill bee.
You guys look very intelligent.
"Please let me go Sir,"
kill.
"Sir, what?"
Bee.
Bee?
Gently!
Its female.
Female?
Should not hurt.
"So we won't think about it now, will we?"
"No, sir."
"When I do go, it will break your heart, won't it?"
"Yes, sir."
Well...
What would my little cherub like to do this evening?
"Oh, sir, could we go out?"
Out?
"You mean gad about a bit, see the sights?"
"Yes, sir."
"Oh, you'd like it, wouldn't you, sir?"
"Well, now, I don't know."
I don't know.
That might be very charming.
Where would we go?
"Oh, they say that the Empire and such places..."
They do?
Who does?
"Well, Marcia, sir."
She says it's ever so gay.
"- Oh, really?"
- Yes.
"We can go, can't we?"
They say that the bill is ever so good.
And I haven't been out for so long.
No.
"No, that's right."
"You haven't, have you?"
You do look a little pale.
Yes.
"Yes, that's true."
"Not that I am complaining, you understand..."
"How are you, boy?"

"Believe me, my dear, I'm just as disappointed as you are."
I've never seen Razor take to someone so quickly.
I suppose you can't be all bad.
"My name is Noah Van Helsing, from along line of vampire hunters."
"Now, what do you want with Blade?"
"The rule still stands, old man."
No woman on board my boat.
Young lady...
- Who?
Why is this man threatening my husband with a gun?
- Do not allow...
- Shut her up.
"-Get down, you Nazi bitch."
-No no!
"Cookie, Cookie, Cookie!"
No no no no!
Cookie!
Do not!
Do not!
Please do not leave me!
It's a bad plan anyway.
"The best strategy is, to destroy the enemy from within."
He must defeat himself.
"Do not be an enemy, Bishop!"
The personification of the devil is a symbol of all evil.
In the form of humanoids.
"That's you, black blood!"
"Let me go, black blood!"
I'm going to kill them all!
"Just wait, I'll kill you!"
Keep your breath and keep the peace with God.
Shit!
What do the Noids know about God?
You are raised as rats in the laboratory.
Is the color of our blood so different?
Are not we all children of God?
God did not create you.
-We did.
You are an abomination without a soul.
- I am sorry!
I've never chosen my own company.
"Nyssa, it was you who contacted me and begged me to help you find your father."
"And, Tegan, it's your own curiosity that got you into this."
"And Adric, a stowaway."
-The Tardis!
-It's followed us from the Central Register.
-How can it get here when there's no one in it?
-Did I say there was no one in it?
It must be the man who brought me to Logopolis...
I don't want any further argument.
"One, two, three of you into the Tardis."
Quickly.
Go on.
"-Look, we want to help you..."
-It's impossible.
My friend in there will look after you.
I'm collaborating with the Master.
"Now, go on."
-Battle stations.
-The man's a murderer.
"Come on, Nyssa, he means it."
-Together?
-One last hope.
"So far, nothing but jungle:"
"How about you, Wilma?"
Picking up anything on infrascan?
"Negative, Buck:"
Just appears to be another out-of-the-way planet that time forgot:
"Uh, shouldn't Dr:"
Goodfellow have some information for us by now?
I'll check:
Say something!
Father...
"Are you all right, Esther-san?"
!
"Don't worry, the count is all right!"
"There was another girl here, named Seth!"
W-what is this?
This light is a mausoleuma grave- for all Methuselah's.
This island is a place for remembering the deceased.
Friends and family of the departed gather and reminisce for a night.
That is how funerals are in the Empire.
It must be difficult for him...
Being unable to attend his grandmother's funeral...
Your Lordship...
"Whew, security sure has gotten tight!"
What a pain!
Duchess!
Do you know where Radu is?
!
No idea.
"But if he's going to target Her Majesty, it would most likely be during tonight's funeral..."
He will come!
There's no question about it!
I'll go do my rounds again.
Don't worry!
I won't let him assassinate anyone!
Esther!
Yes?
!
The count is in your hands.
I'm coming with you!
No!
He used to scramble around like a goddamn maniac.
Doug flutie?
He's the doug flutie of fire?
"That's funny, dad."
"Hey, flutie, where we you on 9/11?"
"Yeah, doug, where were you?"
"Don't give me that, you know,"
"""if only I knew that you were running into the second tower"" bullshit."
"I only ran in because-- well, because it was the next goddamn job."
"But you, i can't figure it out."
What were you waiting for?
Too much of a goddamn pussy to go in?
"First tower comes down, they're yelling, ""pull out!"
"Pull out!"""
"All I know is if you're a fireman and you ain't carrying someone else and you've still got 2 legs and 2 goddamn feet, you move on to the next goddamn job."
"Doug flutie, my ass."
Doug flutie would have run in.
"No balls, tom."
No balls at all.
"- I was looking for you, asshole."
"- Why, huh?"
- Jesus christ.
- Holy shit.
Don't tell me you were afraid.
- What?
- He was afraid.
- I was worried.
- About what?
- You.
- Me?
"600, 700 fire fighters in there."
Thousands of other people needing to be rescued.
I looked through your suitcase.
How often do you shave?
Once every day.
That's better.
"Well, you're not going to give me away, are you, Mike?"
It's very important to Nancy that you don't.
She'll be in very big trouble if you do.
"Now, why are you dressed up like that?"
"Oh, well, to help Nancy."
"Okay, but why are you dressed up like that?"
To help Nancy.
"You see, I can't explain it now, Mike, except that if they find out, see, that I'm a grown-up man, it can get Nancy in all kinds of trouble, see."
We don't want that to happen.
"So you'll help me out, huh?"
Okay.
Good.
"Do you collect rocks, too?"
"No, not really."
Then what are you doing with this?
"Oh, that ain't mine."
I found this in your suitcase in your pants' pocket.
Oh.
It still ain't mine.
Can I have it?
"Sure, be my guest."
Thanks.
I'll run a test on it.
I'm going to be a geologist.
"Oh, that's swell."
What do we do now?
Let's go.
Let's go.
"You should go to Alexanderplatz, this is no place for trading."
"Do you wanna go to another pub, Franz?"
Please?
Stay calm.
Just wait and see!
Buy this really genuine piece!
Why does the wealthy man in the west wear a bow and the yobbo doesn't?
Ladies and gentlemen!
"1 piece 20, 3 pieces 50!"
Come closer!
Guys do you want me to sing the tie song?
Maybe Mr Biederkopf will now sing something for us.
"Alright, alright."
What could we sing?
"Band, what tunes can you play?"
"How about... ""Ich hatte einen Kameraden""?"
Who do you think we are?
A new pub for Mr Biberkopf.
What's up?
"The Mister seeks a new pub, this one isn't swell enough."
- Get off the table!
- Says who?
Me!
I'll pay for the glasses.
"Well Biberkopf, there was no need to terrify my customers."
"Come on Cilly, I know what's going on here."
- Let's go this way!
"- No, we go this way."
"Come on please, let's go this way."
- No!
We'll go this way.
"Come on, let's go!"
A flower van.
You know what you should do is a garbage truck.
"Seriously, and I don't mean to disrespect but if you put cops in the back of a garbage truck there's no way I'm seriously thinking that there's cops in the back of a garbage truck."
"It's a freebie, yo."
Just think about it.
"Think about it, boys."
All right.
I'm hitting it.
You dudes give up that easy?
I'm not a cop.
Then lift your shirt.
Show me you're not wearing a wire.
"All right, you know what?"
Just to show you you're being an asshole.
I'm blinded by white.
Douchebag.
Come on.
I was joking.
Come on.
Don't walk away angry.
Sit down.
Come on.
"I mean, what are you complaining about?"
"You got abs, man."
Kind of.
"Whatever, dude."
I'm not even sure I wanna buy anymore.
I think you turned me off to the whole thing.
Come on.
Don't be like that.
"I just need you to prove it, you know?"
Prove you're not a cop.
Now.
"I can't, sweetheart, we've got a plane to catch."
"Oh, every time we're close, I feel something good is about to happen."
You've got to be...
You said you didn't want to see my face or hear my voice.
I can't think in there.
"Well, it wasn't my voice."
I thought you'd keep him in check.
I thought I could depend on you.
"- Well, Cari told Bob..."
- That she's going to Brazil...
Please.
"Jon, please."
I'm two cases short.
What?
You gotta be kidding.
You know that baby food was on the way to the lab.
It was contaminated with botulism.
I know.
I probably lost them when I got this.
I gotta make a phone call.
Four were crouched behind their car.
"It was just me and my bike against four men, two. 45s and two sawed-offs."
"I pulled my gun, grabbed my mike and called for backup."
Then they opened fire.
I was hit by a bullet.
"Oh, I hurt real bad."
I went down.
I got up and I got hit on this side...
"Oh, you girls..."
I was speaking very low.
Baker.
What do you say?
Sit down.
"- How they treating you, Rocky?"
- Like a prince.
I get three square meals and real butter on my bread.
What a life.
- Is that a bad cut on your eye?
- Not bad.
Just a few stitches.
I thought you knocked your eye out.
You coming to my trial tomorrow?
"Rocky, I've been worrying about this all last night."
- I can't let you take the whole blame.
"- Pipe down, want the flapper to hear?"
Now get this.
"You got away, didn't you?"
Okay.
I wanna be a sucker.
"But, Rocky, maybe if they thought I was in on it, they'd go easier on you."
In a pig's eye.
"Just because you can run faster, you don't gotta eat yourself."
"- But it ain't fair to you, Rocky."
"- Look, so they send me up."
So what?
What've I got to lose?
The old man's got troubles enough without me.
Forget it.
"I got caught, and you got away."
"But you, Rocky."
"Supposing I was the one who got caught, you wouldn't keep quiet."
- You'd make them send you up too.
- What do you think I am?
"Fuck you, Kyle!"
# And you know #
- # We're together at school again # - # School again #
# With all of our friends... #
Aww!
# We'll be doing this forever... #
"Ugh, God, shut up!"
# What a special day... #
"Shut up, shut up, shut up!"
# Never #
# Going away #
"Hey, kid, what happened?"
I thought you didn't wanna sing and dance anymore.
"Yeah, well, my Dad blew a gasket when I told him, and then he beat my Mom."
"Dude, what did I tell you?"
You have to be tough and stand up for yourself!
"Mr. Garret, Mr. Garret!"
This kid wants to join the basketball team.
He's really good.
Really?
"Look, I should be getting to class."
"Hey, we sure could use you, kid."
I can never find enough kids that wanna play ball.
All the kids and the school funding goes to the theater department.
You see?
They need you.
"This is fate, kid-- fate."
I don't know.
"Look, just come in at recess and shoot some balls with the team."
"Yeah, just go in at recess and shoot some balls with the team, Goddamn it."
Okay.
"Hey, that's great, Bridon!"
"- No, you can't."
I'm staying.
"All right, on one condition."
That you play uncle.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
So long.
- Uncle Mike.
- Uncle Mike.
"- So long, Uncle Mike."
"- So long, Uncle Mike."
- Happy?
- You know I am.
How happy?
"Well, you can't get much happier than that."
Come on.
In the town of Hamelin Many years ago
The citizens were crying out A tearful tale of woe
"""Rats, rats, rats!"
They chase the dogs And kill the cats
"Rats, rats, rats!"
"They build their nest In our Sunday hats"""
The citizens of Hamelin
Were frantic with despair
They gnashed their teeth And stamped their feet
And shouted to the mayor
"""Rats, rats, rats!"""
"The people cried ""We've gotta get rid of the rats"
"Gotta get rid of the rats In Hamelin town"""
Rats!
Rats!
"Oh, I'm sure he'd never..."
"- No, that does sound quite like him."
Yeah.
And that's why I want him gone.
"You could be his role model, teach him how to beat it."
"No, no, no."
You've picked the wrong man.
I don't think so.
"Ah, Mitchell, my bro."
- Yes.
- OK.
"Brilliant, brilliant."
"OK, I know we all got off to a bad start but I'm thinking if we all pull together, this could be an interesting, enriching and very brief experience for us all."
"Yeah, level with me, Mitch."
How do you stick it with this sad-arse?
I think you need a new wingman.
"I, sir, am a registered poon hound."
"Have you ever actually had sex, Adam?"
"You know, proper balls-deep sex?"
Have you touched a boob?
"Be honest with me, Adam."
Have you ever even touched a boob?
Because...
Ha-ha-ha!
I have.
Loads!
"Ah, someone doth protest too much."
You don't come near me.
"But, Mitch, we're like brothers in arms."
I'll have a Scotch.
This is near me.
This is where I told you not to be.
-What shit are you talking about?
-Just stay away from the garbage.
"I'm not talking about what you did inside, you did what you had to do."
I'm talking about now.
From here and now.
-Why would I get into that?
-Don't make a jerk out of me.
Just don't do it.
Don't do it.
I want to talk about Jimmy.
Watch out for him.
"He's a good earner, but he takes too many chances."
I wouldn't take chances like Jimmy.
"Tommy's a good kid, but he's crazy."
He's a cowboy.
He's got too much to prove.
-You got to watch out for them.
-l only use them for certain things.
I ain't going to get fucked like Gribbs.
Gribbs is 70 years old and he'll die in prison. I don't need that.
So I'm warning everybody.
"Could be my son, could be anybody."
Gribbs got 20 years just for saying hello to some fuck who was selling junk.
"That won't happen to me, understand?"
You're out early because I got you a job.
I don't need this heat.
"You see anybody fuckin' around with this shit you're gonna tell me, right?"
.
That means anybody.
-All right.
-Yeah?
Yeah.
"Yeah, it's like a clever little twist."
"The motel's made out of caution cones, which, of course, cars try to avoid."
But now we're gonna stay in them.
That's funny.
"Figure that all out on your own, did you?"
"Cone number one, if you want."
Oh...
"Hey, do I spy a little pinstriping tattoo back there?"
Oh...
That's just a...
Oh!
"Oh, you saw that?"
Yeah.
Just gonna be going.
Gonna...
Yeah.
"You know, I knew this girl Doreen."
Good-lookin' girl.
"Looked just like a Jaguar, only she was a truck!"
"You know, I used to crash into her, just so I could spoke to her."
- What are you talking about?
- I don't know.
"Hey, I know somethin' we can do tonight, 'cause I'm in charge of watching' you!"
"No, Mater, I gotta finish this road, and I have to get out of here."
"Well, that's all right, Mr. I Can't Turn On Dirt."
You probably couldn't handle it anyway.
"Whoa, whoa, easy now, Mater."
You know who you're talkin' to?
This is Lightning McQueen.
I can handle anything.
- I'm not doin' this.
- Come on.
What?

"Welcome to London, Mr Heisenberg."
"I'm Major Julie Smith, Special Operations Executive."
I'm in charge of the debriefing of the German atomic programme.
Would you care to follow me?
Oh my God.
"You covered ""how will I know"""
And you dedicated it to me
And I sat there trying not to laugh.
Oh God.
I was so in love with you.
What are we doing?
Things were so much easier when we were younger.
Unlike our kids we just jumped into things.
"I mean, why can't we just be more like that"
Just figure it out as we go along?
Maybe this didn't turn out to be
The romance we thought it would be when we first met.
Well.
It's more like choose your own adventure.
Maybe it just wasn't the right time.
Maybe it never will be.
What if it is?
What if we're just too stubborn to see it?
I don't want to miss out.
Well...
Neither do I.
I don't have a ring
So this will have to do.
Rufus.
What are you doing?
"Marry me, Lily."
Marry me.
I know that'll make me your... uh your fifth husband.
So?
Yes.
Give me your hand.
Would you mind autographing this for me?
Where did you get my picture?
From a little frame out by the door.
"Oh, hold on, that's mine."
"Oh, well, I'd prefer whenever you're smiling."
"- Do you, ever?"
"- Yes, when I'm amused."
"You know, I think I could use you in my fall production."
I don't play animal-act.
"No, really."
I'm putting on a Broadway show next season.
"You're putting on your show right now, and it's a flop."
Wait a minute.
I'll meet you out front.
Hey.
[laughing]
I hope you make it in time for your fall production.
How did I get in?
"Oh, man!"
"Goodbye, partner."
[screaming] Help!
[intense music]
[tapping foot]
[swing music]
- You're a college graduate?
"- Yes, sir."
- Travelled here and abroad?
"- Yes, sir."
- How many languages you speak?
"- Five, sir."
"Well, I think we can use you."
"Salary, 22.50 a week."
Sheriff knows who did it.
I saw him going down to Peterson's a little while ago with some evidence some kid gave him.
He found it in an RV or something down there.
Those Peterson's will probably get that kid.
What kid?
"Some damn tourist kid, I don't know."
[Man on the phone] Yeah.
Yeah.
"You know, a sky pilot once said that angels carried messages up to heaven, Buddy."
He might tell him.
"Come on, don't cry anymore."
"[Buddy] All right, I won't cry no more."
"[Jim] Buddy, look here, you got to buck up and be a little man now."
"If Tater knows you was crying about him that way, he'd feel awful bad."
- Good morning.
"- Good morning, Miss Molly."
[Molly] ...how many people we should notify?
[Jim] I guess me and Buddy...
"Hi, Billy."
Go away.
"What'd you do that for, Billy?"
Now you've got yourself stuck in there.
- Just be quiet and go away.
- [phone ringing] [continues ringing]
It's the telephone.
Billy?
It's for you.
"I don't care, answer it."
"I'll tell you somethin', Billy."
What?
You got a hollow door here.
It's made in Japan.
I don't know where it is.
"Well, maybe you could find it."
"3,000 bucks."
"Well, that will get me back, but not in style."
I can get you another two when we get to the States.
"It's important, Marion."
Trust me.
You know the piece I mean?
Do you know where it is?
Come back tomorrow.
Why?
"Because I said so, that's why."
Ha!
"See you tomorrow, Indiana Jones."
"Good evening, Fraulein."
The bar's closed.
We...
We are... not thirsty.
What do you want?
The same thing your friend Dr. Jones wanted.
Surely he told you there would be other interested parties.
Must've slipped his mind.
The man is... nefarious.
"I hope, for your sake, he has not yet acquired it."
"Why, are you willing to offer more?"
"Oh, almost certainly."
Do you still have it?
No.
But I know where it is.
"Hey, how about a drink for you and your men?"
Your fire is dying here.
Why don't you tell me where the piece is right now?
"You know, it's funny."
Looking at these old cases makes me wonder-- did we make a dimerence?
"I mean, çan we make a dimerence?"

Are we the wind?
It's like the horses.
"You try to figure out which one's the best fit for the track, runs harder, or prettier."
But when you admit that it's chaotic--
"Alvin, thank you."
We can talk after the meeting.
I can take it from here.
"Yeah, you'll, uh--"
"Give you, what, a half hour or so?"
Probably.
Right.
"Uh, I might be gone by then."
"But, uh, maybe not."
Let's just see.
Right.
Let's just see.
"Now, this essay about why I want to be Samantha's dad."
"Um, should I read it to you?"
[knock on door] I think I'm going to head out to the track.
- Mind telling Lulu for me?
- OK.
Thanks.
Can I read this to you?
"Uh, no, that's fine."
"There's this part in it about my sponsor, if you think that's OK."
Um...
Your sponsor?
"Yeah, how he said it's OK for me to be in a relationship-- have a relationship, you know?"
I work right across the street.
Yes.
We work right across the street from it.
Did you ever own a firearm?
I already told you no.
"No, I've never owned a firearm."
Why are you hassling me?
Just call County.
- Where'd you say you were?
"- You know, I told you where I was."
- What kind of a doctor are you?
- I'm a med
- I'm a med student.
I'm a med student.
What difference does that make?
- What kind of doctor are you?
- I told you what I am.
"Look, we brought you in because you match the ID."
Because I match the ID.
What?
"Young, black and handsome?"
That's

He can't finalise the arrangements without him.
- Who is he?
I need a name.
- When my daughter is safe.
Last chance.
"Oh, you need Clare safe as much as I do."
You wouldn't be here otherwise.
People die.
I'm fine with that.
- You fucking prick.
- Shoot then.
Fuck.
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)
Hi Maggie.
I'm Eleanor Grant.
Can I get you a drink?
"No, but can you can turn off the recording device in your pocket."
This conversation is off the record.
We never met.
Do you understand?
Damien said you were a ball breaker.
"Well, Damien Scott talks too much and to people he shouldn't."
He knows he can trust me.
I protect my sources.
That's why I'm here talking to you.
- I want to protect him.
- Why were you not arrested also?
"Nobody knew I was there, just taking photos."
It's not like you've ever treated women in such a way that would invite some sort of karmic retribution.
You banged my sister!
"My sweet, little, innocent..."
Pierced.
Really?
Where?
Don't answer that!
Now I know why I felt everything you did to her last night.
"It wasn't a bro-nnection, it was a sis-nnection!"
"Oh, my God."
Ted... did you...
Big-time.
Nice!
High five!
Wait!
No!
No!
Retraction five!
"Hey, hey, you're the one who begged for a proxy bang."
"And while we're on the subject of family,"
I'm pretty sure you banged my mom-- mom beats sister.
I never banged your mom.
You just did the winking thing again!
"No, I didn't."
Fine.
"Hey, Barney, let me ask you something."
"Were you, uh, feeling a little sore this morning?"
Especially...
Friendship over!
"Oh, yeah."

I always carry my portable lobby along.
Sit.
Where do I sit?
Here.
Don't sit there you fool.
It'll crack the eggs.
So there are eggs inside?
No.
There are nails.
They'll pierce through.
Yes Mr. Thakur.
How can I be of service?
Are you going to kill Shiv in jail?
Why are you being so eager Thakur?
I know all about you.
First you clear the garbage and then your record.
Thakur.
If kill him in your jail... won't there be an investigation on you?
The media's been showing your footage with that boy... and boring you to death.
If kill him won't you be blamed?
He's right.
Then what do we do?
It's simple.
We won't kill Shiv in jail.
We'll get him out first and then...
Superb.
Let him escape.
What do you say Ayushman?
Let's make him flee from jail.
Stupid fool.
He lectures alcoholics on television.

Can we stop over and get those keys?
--My new bumper is there...
Bobylev...
"If we open up your brain, what will we find there?"
--Brains.
--A bumper!
"--One ball-point pen, please --Can you read, sir?"
It says we're on break from 14:00 to 15:00
It's 15:00 now
Can you hear the music?

"Lady, there's 3.5 billion of us on this tiny planet"

"And I shout over to you, lady, darling, sweetheart... please sell me that ball-point pen for 37 cents!"
I really need it.
My life depends on it.
And what?
How can one live this way?
What for?
Never mind.
"Mr. Rickman, can you hear me?"
"Now, don't move."
Just blink your eyes if you can hear me.
Thanks.
"Please, let this be a dream."
"I want a dozen double-stuffed Oreos, IV push... ready with 1,000 milligrams of peanut butter crackers and two amps of Nestle's Quik."
Good afternoon.
Hello.
My name is Christine Draper.
I'm a neurosurgeon.
Sally Druse.
Are you a good doctor?
As good as Dr. Hook?
No problem there.
Your hand's acting up?
Yeah.
Needles and pins.
And I need it for my pendulum.
I'm psychic.
I've been written up in several magazines.
Patient complains of needles and pins.
Noodles and prunes.
He's got one hell of a blood puddle in there.
I'm surprised the blow didn't crack his skull wide open.
"First, we open our craniotomy and then we excavate the haematoma."
"Capisci, Elmer?"
Yeah.
"Okay, there it is, Elmer."
I always pause here and imagine that I am the first neurosurgeon.
The first to boldly journey into the workings of a human mind.
Cool.
What are you doing here?
Oh.
"I, um--"
I came to pick out a dress for Hilla's funeral.
And to listen to her records while you read her diary?
"It's, uh, in German."
"Look, Stephanie, I am the coroner."
That doesn't give you the right to go through her things.
She was beautiful.
My camera loved her.
You took that?
It's a hobby I'd hoped to turn into a profession.
Hillie and I were gonna go back to New York together.
"She was gonna be a big fashion model, and I'd shoot all her covers."
She'd have made it too.
"I keep expecting her to walk through the door, you know?"
Hillie understood life better than most people.
Maybe because she'd seen so much death.
That's why I can't believe she killed herself.
Maybe she didn't.
- What do you mean?
- She may have been murdered.
"Oh, God."
Do you have any idea who may have done it?
No.
Everyone loved her.
No one... would want her dead.
What?
Nothing.
It's not nothing.
What are you thinking?
Truesdale fired her.
"Well, I know you can do it, and I'll help you every step of the way, Bob."
I'll help you every inch of the way.
"Emily, why are you making such a big thing about eight pounds?"
"Well, eight pounds are not easy to lose."
"Well, they are for me, once I set my mind to it."
"- Uh, what's that?"
"- Dr. Klein gave me this, calorie counter."
"You know, it's amazing how much food you can eat if you eat the right food."
"I mean, like, I could eat a whole cow, as long as I didn't butter it."
Come in.
Emily?
"Emily, wait till you see the present I picked out for-"
Howard?
"Bob- Bob, Howard's here."
"Hi, Bob."
I didn't realize you were here.
"Yeah, I kind of live here, Howard."
"Of course you do, and you should."
"Well, I can come back later."
"I just, stopped by to say hello."
- Yes.
Howard just... stopped by to say hello.
- That's right.
"Hello, Howard."
Hello.
"Howard, is there something you wanna discuss in private with Emily?"
"No, no, no, Bob."
"Uh, no."
Nothing at all.
"Uh, well, so you got a birthday coming up, huh?"
Wow.
Forty-one.
(ALL SCREAMING)
Lady.
"Hey, lady, you okay?"
(SOBBING)
"Yeah, they're gone, it's okay."
How can I ever thank...
You're one of them!
(SCREAMING)
"Not her type, I guess."
Maybe it's the eyes.
Or the fangs.
Well?
I'm feeling so...
NOAH:
I see.
Sunlight has no effect on you.
Extraordinary.
So you're a Daywalker. I never really thought they existed.
I'm a human being.
BLADE:
Why did you help me?
"Well, it's not every vampire that would apologize to his victims."
You were there?
"Well, after all, lam a vampire hunter."
I know their feeding grounds.
I hate this.
Every day I have to live with these cravings is a day too long.
But I've got a score to settle before I can leave this world behind.
Must be important for you to prolong a life you so detest.
Have you ever come across or heard of a vampire known as the Man with Four Fangs?
"No, I can't say that I have."
He killed my mother.
Of course I am.
Take your hands off me.
- Sir?
Am I in error?
- Thank heaven you're here.
- You can see I'm a gentleman.
- Look at his lovely clothes.
"- Take him, Dawlish."
- But you can't.
"- Vizard, you sail tomorrow?"
"- Yeah, Mediterranean."
- So you should count us out for now.
- No need.
Spread word to that fleet.
"If both fleets struck at once, we'd win our demands overnight!"
"- You'll act soon, then?"
"- Yes, soon every ship will mutiny."
- Before spring?
- Depends.
How's your crew?
Forty more pledges.
- We have half the ship already.
- Good.
"Poor men, driven like cattle."
I don't understand it.
Having to be pressed to go to sea?
- Not everyone wants to leave home.
- Think of it!
Sailing the Defiant and fighting the French.
You sound just like your father.
"Anyway, the admiral may not agree to let you go."
Father's back.
Hello..
- Are you Ria?
We admitted Karthi in the hospital.
- What happened?
He got 3 bullets in the shootout with gangsters.
Situation is too critical.
He actually wanted to retire from Police job but has continued for you.
"When he said to join as a stuntman, I refused."
I committed a big mistake.
It is a lie that there is another one like me.
I am not a Police as you are thinking.
I am a stuntman.
Bruce Lee!
I tried many times to tell this to you but could not say it.
It was not to cheat you.
Due to lack of courage..
Reason was the fear that you would leave afar.
I'm sorry!
I am loving you not your profession.
Love you

"Your honour, there have now been two very similar murders and I think it's quite probable they were both committed by the same person."
We agree.
Hm?
"Oh, good."
"Yeah, it's pretty obvious the Crim did this too."
Let's charge him...
For murder!
Two time.
You have a good point.
How can he have a point?
Crim was in jail at the time of the murder?
You have a good point.
"Yeah, I have a good point."
How can Crim have done it?
"It's called shape shifting, your honour."
Something that's pretty darn easy to do.
"In fact, in the big city we do it all the time."
No they don't.
That's crazy.
"Yeah, look, I'm getting taller,"
I'm getting shorter.
"I'm getting taller, I'm getting shorter."
I'm getting shorter.
He's just standing on his toes.
I'm getting taller.
He's standing on his toes.
Ohhh...
"Counsellors, you have both made very compelling arguments."
He didn't.
So let me deliberate.
Find Mrs. Cole!
I need to talk to Mrs. Cole.
Mrs. Cole!
Has anyone seen Mrs. Cole?
- Come on before they find us.
- Where?
I don't know.
I never come to the studio.
Mrs. Cole!
The boss wants to try a take without Uncle Frank's lines 'cause he says we are losing visual tension.
"Mr. Hilliard is talking about the integrity of the story, saying he will play the scene as you wrote it or not at all."
- Nobody's had any sleep and you're just--
- It's all right.
I'm coming.
No.
Let me deal with it.
"Once Hilliard gets his hands on you, he won't let you go for hours, and I was rather hoping to do that myself."
"Careful of big boy,"
- it's got a bit of a wobble on it.
Don't-
- Don't lean against it.
- Whoa!
Nobody move!
- Buckley!
"Nobody move, stay exactly where you are until we have some lights in here."
Stay where you are.
Back.
"Back, please."
Everybody get back.
Please take the girls away from the stage.
"Mr. Brown, please take them away."
Almost dawn.
"That lady cop from the Bomb Squad... got you the stuff to do this with, didn't she?"
You didn't know Monica was gonna be here.
"Did you, Figgs?"
No.
Monica said she was going over to her friend's house to watch some pay-per-view.
The thing was on a timer.
"I didn't know she was gonna be here, Freddy."
It's all bullshit.
"You, Figgs, are the bullshit!"
Smarten fuckin' up!
You even turned your back on Tunney when he needed your help!
Figgs!
"I'm gonna find Superboy, and I'm gonna bring him in!"
"And for once, everybody in this town's gonna tell the truth!"
"- You gotta find him first, Freddy!"
- I'll find him.
Listen to me.
"I got a check in my pocket for $200,000."
I got a chance to start my life again.
I don't give a shit about this town!
I don't give a shit about that town.
And I don't give a shit about your fucking justice!
"Bein' right is not a bulletproof vest, Freddy!"
"Go on, Figgsy!"
Go on!
Run away!
"Hey, Freddy."
- Ray's not home.
- I know.
I'm lookin' for your nephew.
I don't know where he is.
Why the hell would I tell you if I did?
"Expect we'd better bivouac at Elephant Rock, as usual."
"Yes, Markham sahib."
"I don't like it, Mitchell."
I don't like it.
Silence is unhealthy.
No word from Markham in 48 hours.
"Blast it, an officer and his patrol don't vanish into thin air."
"- Telegraph just got through, sir."
- Good.
What have you got?
Wires apparently down for the last two days.
I thought it was something like that.
"Emergency signal, sir."
Why doesn't he go on?
"Wire's gone dead, sir."
I don't like this.
Can't have the wires down.
Things start too quickly up there.
Higginbotham.
Find Sgts.
"MacChesney, Cutter, and Ballantine, and bring them here."
"That's a bit difficult, as they're all on leave."
"On some mysterious mission, they said."
It'll be a mystery if they come back right side up.
Bring them here at once.
- What do you want?
- Where's Sgt. Ballantine?
- Here.
- Where's Sgt. Cutter?
He's busy.
Buying a map for a buried treasure.
You ought to have your head examined.
"I'll be looking for you in the destroyed fields, Bishop."
"Ok Kix, since you have so much energy tonight  why do not you take the first guard?"
Have fun with your book.
Mara!
"Come on, Bishop."
"Get up, Spartan."
There is something in the trees.
I'll send you back to hell!
Yellow-eyed devil!
Bishop...
"I've marked it, Commander."
I marked it clearly for you.
"Bishop, I'm here."
Did you miss the fucking shot?
10 meters away?
"You are the total ruin, man."
Did not Trajan take you out of the sewer?
I would be a damned commander!
And my team would still be alive!
"Now it's your turn, Bishop."
"Alpha, Mike, Foxtrot  bye, son of a bitch!"
"Listen, or you'll never pull the trigger again."
You do not have the eggs.
Reckless bitch!
"Mara, they were wrong."
There is life in the area of death.
I will not resign.
"I will not stop, Before we find our daughter."
You are with me my love
You're here with me now.
Ash!
"Come on, my friend."
Let's get back to the 'Beast'!
How will I benefit if I succeed?
You'll become a nameless hero.
I said how will I benefit?
The League of Nations will thank you!
What benefit is that to me?
The whole world will love you!
That means I don't benefit at all!
More than that.
There's half a million!
- Japanese Yen?
- American dollar!
American dollar?
Where do I find the American?
Cafe Casablanca.
Take him to Room 44 here.
What does he look like?
Wearing a white suit and a pink rose.
"When you see him, just say:"
You want woman?
Worth's half a million.
"And he'll reply, 'Get some sort of toys'!"
Good. I'll go first!
"- Hold on, I'll go first!"
- Why?
So that I don't have to pay.
Tips?
"Book says don't give anything today, especially tips."
What a miser!
White suit and pink rose?
What a coincidence!
"Mister, you want woman?"
Boyz II Men?
ABC?
BBD?
It's the East Coast family.
[ Groans ]
Whoa.
You guys know nothing about the greatest era in music history?
That's it.
I am taking you to school.
We are at school.
"Figure of speech, Prius."
"Okay, so here's my business idea."
"You're in your 20s, early 30s."
- I love it!
"- That was a hypothetical, but I like your energy."
[ Chuckles ]
You and your friends are going out for a wild night.
- What do you do for a ride?
- Call Tom.
"Okay, we're having some problems with hypotheticals."
I'll move on.
You call a cab.
"But cabs are boring, and you and your gang want a memorable night, so instead of calling a lame cab, you call The Mystery Machine from ""Scooby-Doo""!"
"- Travis, this is great!"
"- Oh, The Mystery Machine!"
I always wanted to hang around in that van-- maybe try my luck with Old Velma.
- You mean Daphne?
- I know what I like.
"Okay, well, Tom loves it too, and he's a brain surgeon."
"Travis, you're a genius."
I think I can have this thing up and running in three months.
"What are you, crazy?"
Driven.
So let's meet up tonight.
9PM.
Alright.
I am really in a hurry.
See you bro.
Okay.
"This work is from my friend, Lisa."
She's having a gallery exhibition in New York.
Extremely urgent.
And this is part of her exhibition.
It's installation art.
And it needs some retouching.
Everything needs to be done quickly.
It's so urgent that I thought of you first.
"On this planet, no one but you could finish it in time."
Day 1
You have 2 weeks.
But you must send an update every day.
And Lisa will give you her feedback right the way.
No problem.
Kai.
"But this job, you must do solo."
Because she is very paranoid about her work leaking.
"If you can do this job, the Shibuya job Jerd did will pale in comparison."
"When you're done, let's go to New York together."
Day 2
"Yes, Peng?"
I sent you the feedback for the previous lot already.
Is this lot done?
Not yet.
Why are you so slow?
Here.
Any time.
Thanks.
Uh...
where do I start?
The first step is admitting to someone that you love and trust that you're powerless before your addiction.
That's not going to be easy.
"No, it's going to hurt like hell, but the program works, it really does."
Hi there.
STONETREE:
So how do we know it's the same killer?
Similar MO.
Kills with the victim's... choice of drug.
"Uh, Lewis..."
mind if I bum one?
Thanks.
If the killer knows their addictions...
He knows them pretty well.
"Maybe very well, if you know what I mean."
When?
Fairly close to the time of death.
After the meeting?
Yep.
How about the last victim?
"Uh-huh, that's why I checked."
Okay.
Well...
"Let's make some connections, uh..."
"Do we have the, uh... members' last names?"
"Yeah, and the telephone numbers."
Sign-in sheet from the meeting.
"Though, I got to tell you, I feel a bit like Judas."
Is the bar open?
I mean can I get a decent cup of coffee?
Now that's a classic portrait.
What do you think Angie?
I'm not a fan of black and white photos.
I had a black and white photo taken of me as well.
I looked really great.
"Just fabulous, like a film star."
But I don't look like that at all.
Exactly.
That's why I like black and white photos.
So you lie to yourself quite a bit.
Right?
I think you are beautiful.
- Hi.
"Angie, clean up back there!"
"One thing after another, boss."
"This one is good too, by the way."
"Right, quite good."
"Okay, I'll take that."
You want to buy me a drink?
Why not?
Thank you for the sign.
Now go to your brother and pull the money off the wall.
Go fuck yourself Toni.
"You could stay outside as well, or sit in the lobby and drink tap water."
- Can we get a coffee here?
Sure.
Two coffees?
- Black.
Me too.
Thank you.
"Well, can we watch ""Lost Boys""?"
I've heard of that one.
Those... those are different lost boys.
"(whistling ""Snowbird"")"
"Are you whistling ""Snowbird""?"
Yeah.
That's awesome.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, why do you get to ring it?"
Because I was into her first.
"(doorbell rings) Let's flip for it, or..."
I can't believe you did that.
I cannot believe you just did that.
(doorbell rings) Will you stop it.
She's going to think we're weird.
Hi.
Can I help you?
Hi.
Miss Murray.
My name's Brian Griffin.
"Uh, first of all, I just want to tell you what a huge fan I am."
"Aw, that's very sweet of you."
And I'm Stewie.
I'm the one who sent you the vibrators.
"Well, I'm glad you enjoy my music."
Would you like to come in?
We'd love to.
"Wow, nothing says success like free on a Tuesday at 3:00 p.m."
I'll get there.
"So, Miss Murray, the reason we came is that we have a question about ""Snowbird."""
"It's about a relationship, right?"
"No, no, it's obviously about the fear of growing old."
"You know, I think you're both kind of right."
"All right, y'all, it's almost time for the mele, the Kanikapila luau drum show!"
The special blend.
"Yes, this is a magical drink."
You know what?
I'm gonna go get a good spot for the show.
Do you guys wanna come?
"No, no, we're good here."
Okay.
You're fine?
Okay.
And then there was two.
"Listen, I want you to come back with me."
I'm not going back to the other side with you.
"I'm gonna stay right here, get my celebration on and get another margarita made up in my face."
I came a long way to find you.
"Well, I know you ain't come to get a drink."
You damn sure ain't come to dance.
So what'd you follow me here for?
No.
I did.
"I came here to drink, party, scratch records, do it all!"
Do it...
It's just...
Just...
Just...
You know?
What am I saying?
I don't want to do any of those things.
Truth is that I'm exhausted just saying them.
"All right, y'all, it's time for the Kanikapila luau drum show!"
"Cynthia, hi."
Excuse me.
Wonderful.
Great.
Um...
"So, a little bit about me."
"Uh, my service is called"
"""Goldilocks and the Three Dates."""
Katy...
I forgot to tell her not to tell you that.
"So, I've modeled my business after the charming story that it's inspired by."
"I send my clients on three dates, and like the beds that Goldilocks laid down in after eating the three bears' porridge, maybe one is ""too hard,"""
"and maybe one is ""too soft."""
But in the end we hope that maybe one is just right.
- Katy...
- Get after it.
You're losin' him.
Okay.
"Wayne, why don't you just tell me a little bit about yourself."
It's impolite to talk about yourself.
Keeps his truck clean.
Loves his dogs.
Enjoys a beer and a smoke.
Beer...
Beer and smoke.
That's...
"Wow, you know."
I get it.
Rustic.
"Trucks, got it."
We will make this work.
"I love it, okay."
"And then, um, Wayne, can you just tell me a little bit about your past relationship?"
You shouldn't air your dirty laundry.
I'd rather be stuffed in a coffin.
I don't mind the shooting. I wouldn't give much if you couldn't defend yourself but jumping bail is another thing.
It isn't square.
I want you to go into town and stand trial on your own feet.
Clear yourself or take the consequences.
"That's the only way to work it out, Brock."
"When you've got something more to say to me, I'll be around."
"That was nice, that was fine."
-Take it easy.
-You can hurt him more than anyone.
"-You know that, don't you;"
-Take it easy.
I thought you were leaving.
I gotta think.
How can a man think without a little music;
-Jim here;
-Around someplace.
"-Out back, I guess."
-Where's Brock;
"Hello, Mr. McCurtin."
"-You tell them about the shooting, Brock;"
"-Oh, hello, Mac."
"Sure, I told them."
What's the matter;
Horton died.
-l figured he was too mean to die.
"-l can get you off, once more, maybe."
You must've had good reason to shoot a man.
"You had one, didn't you;"
Good reason;
"-Why, sure, the best."
-Better come back in with me.
Everything's fine.
Sally Seidelman told me you were retiring.
"Yes, at the end of this year."
"Well, I just wanted to say... ."
"I don't know, I just... ."
I just wanted to say... .
- I don't know.
- Are you sure everything's all right?
- Tell her where you are.
- Donna?
I'm in the Oval Office with the President of the United States and it's because of you.
- Mrs. Morello?
- What a thing to say.
"- We're all very proud of you, Donna."
- She didn't do anything.
- Was that...?
"- It's Jed Bartlet, Mrs. Morello."
I've got a couple of questions.
"When you taught Beowulf, did you make the kids read it in the original Middle English or did you use a translation?"
"- We used a translation, Mr. President."
- Okay.
- We'll call that the James Bond version.
"- Yes, sir."
What are you doing with your retirement?
- My husband and I were gonna travel.
- That's great.
"I'd stay away from the Elk Horn, Idaho area for a little while."
You'll read why in the morning.
Let's talk about Twelfth Night.
- Twenty-two?
- Yeah.
- You haven't had a drink since 22?
"I've seen you on tv, mr."
"Nicholson,"
"In these big,huge trials."
Um... and that's why i came here--
Because i didn't know what else to do.
I'm not from here.
"I go to school here, and my parents are in nebraska."
I just don't know anybody.
I'm so scared.
Don't be.
All right?
I called my partners.
They're on their way down here right now.
"Thank you,tom."
Thank you for helping me.
"I swear,i didn't mean to hurt him."
That's exactly what we're gonna tell the jury.
The los angeles police
Are asking for help from the community.
This person of interest is believed to be a white female
Between the ages of 20 and 24.
We'll handle it.
I promise.
"These are my partners-- Luther graves,"
Alden tuller and ron trott.
"Ron,this is ann diggs."
She's the girl they're looking for in the stein murder.
"What did you use,a knife?"
"Yeah,from the room service cart."
Why did you come to a law firm?
Why not go to the police?
"Anything i say to the police could be used against me,right?"
And then what?
We depose those in power.
And once you've done that?
"Once you've killed Jeanine, who's in power then?"
"See, that's the part that she always conveniently leaves out."
Don't you tell me this isn't about you.
This is only about you.
I know where the remaining Dauntless are hiding.
Where?
They took shelter in Candor.
"As far as I know, they're still there."
Think about it.
"If we were to combine forces, Dauntless and Factionless, we'd be unstoppable."
That's not gonna happen.
"Thank you for your hospitality, but we'll be leaving in the morning."
"Four, maybe this is..."
"Tobias, please, reconsider."
Don't you call me that.
My name's Four.
"You wanna tuck him in, or should I?"
(DOOR SLAMMING)
"Well, this..."
This meal looks lovely.
Thank you.
I'm sorry.
I should have told you about her.
(SIGHS)
No more secrets.
Okay?
(GASPS)
(WHISPERING) I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to wake you.
Surely Lola was a good agent for the Ministry.
She made the Germans fall into her trap.
"Well, yes."
"We saved the Ministry, the door, and the damn history."
This is ready.
"Well, destroy it."
We'll take the prisoners to their car.
"No, wait."
We have to capture this moment.
"You, on the floor."
Take this.
Do you think I'm not going to impress my children with my picture of Himmler?
To see the face of a losing German... what a pleasure.
"Get used to it, with Luis Aragonés you'll learn all about it."
"¿Luis Aragonés is another Grandee of Spain, like Espínola?"
"Oh yeah, he's one of the great ones."
(CHATTER)
Quiet and hold still.
Cheese.
(CAMERA SHUTTER)
"(NARRATION) ""I am Amelia Folch."
I travel in time and I just fought against Hitler's army.
"A great victory, although there is no victory without victims."""
(Door closing)
I have the information you asked for.
-Thank you.
Are you sure you won't get in trouble?
-I don't care.
I told you I owed you one.
and we Vázquezes always pay our debts.
Iván.
My son.
Just pass me the bill.
Okay!
Sir Wong is looking for you.
What's wrong with you?
You used my money to solve a kidnap case.
You saved the guy but my money is gone.
Now my money is strewn all over the streets.
Isn't that too much?
Capturing the baddies at all cost.
"Bro, you think I'm the richest man in HK?"
"I'm not your bro, Mr. Mak."
I'm your son.
Are there other cops like you?
Using money to work?
You're too busy to spend your money.
Treat it as a good cause.
You think I'm a charity?
Fine...
You only call when I spend your money.
Meet and scold me in person.
Isn't that more satisfying?
I'm always free to meet you.
I never wanted you to be a cop.
"I warn you, I'll freeze your account."
Excuse me...
Where's the resource room?
You can't buy style.
Shit!
We've the same tie!
"I asked for resource room, not fashion advice."
"No resource room, evidence room is ahead."
Thank you.
You've seen that old knife Eric always has?
Maybe.
"Certainly, as far as weapons go, it's worthless."
"When I look at him, I wonder why is he trying to survive as long as he can?"
I have a feeling I might understand.
There's no need to ask.
The job of the hunter is not to protect.
But he exists to protect someone.
Who are you trying to protect by going after him?
Good Lord.
The coffee's gone ice cold.
I'm a silly old fool.
Forgive me for going on like that.
"How about a cup, young lady?"
"My special blend's pretty good, you know."
Go on.
It will do you good.
"Stop calling me ""young lady."""
The name's Makoto.
"All right, fair enough."
"As long as you promise not to call me a boring, old cont."
What is that?
I have no idea!
What is it?
Why all the ruckus?
MAN:
Mandurugo.
"Mandurugo, what are they?"
Winged vampires native to the Philippines.
Aim for the heart!
Make each shot count!
These silver bullets aren't cheap!
Okay.
Hey.
Hey.
"I love you, okay?"
"You know that, don't you?"
I know that.
And I love that little girl in that room more than anything in this world.
I know that too.
Come on.
(CAR DOOR CLOSING)
(ENGINE STARTING)
BILLY:
"Hey, I would give you every dime we talked about, if I had the money."
The problem is I just don't have it.
Your partner here is starting to make me nervous.
"Why don't you sit your narrow ass down, ponytail?"
"Look, I know you guys are on the run."
And you need everything you can get.
"It's better than nothing, right?"
Let's lighten up.
"Look, this town is hot, and so are you, brother."
You fucked up.
You're on every goddamn channel.
You got no one else out there you can trust but me.
And I'm gonna let you walk with one.
What I'm telling you is take it or leave it... (GROANING)
Fucker.
Eight fucking dollars.
Liar!
Ugh!
(EMPTY CLICKING)
"Hey, wait a minute, he's got to have more money than that."
"Hey, Pastor, do you know that... some of these ruins are well over 2000 years old?"
"Yes, but in Philly we have the Liberty Bell."
"Malaparte, tomorrow I'll see the Pope."
There's one thing I want to know:
What is his favorite sport?
I don't know.
But maybe he plays baseball.
Very good!
"Cameras, move forward!"
"You know, there's something sad about victory."
Each goes his own way and nobody knows... when we'll meet again.
"Sometimes, when they do know, they hide."
"Not us, I hope."
Let's set a date to meet... after the war in Capri.
"You know, it's all set between Maria Concetta and I."
She goes to Cleveland with me.
We'll go to Capri first.
"You don't believe me, do you?"
"I believe you, Jimmy."
"No, you don't believe me."
"You'll see, I'll be back..."
- Malaparte!
- General!
What are those monuments over there?
Tombs.
Tombs of ancient Rome nobility.
Whose?
That's General Silla's.
That's Cicerus'.
That's Julius Caesar's.
- Julius Caesar?
- Yes.
"Yeah, I know."
He's in the city on important business.
- He'll be back soon.
- Uh-huh.
That's what you think.
Everybody says he quit us for something better.
- That's a lie.
- What did he hang it on a limb for?
He didn't run out on us.
I'll beat up any guy that says he did.
"Well, I was only telling you what everybody's saying."
What's the matter?
Don't you like it?
Stinks.
"What's the difference, if it's a nice room?"
"Besides, you're only gonna be here a little while."
- Get down to that hospital.
Go ahead.
- I'll keep calling you.
Get that mug anything.
I don't want him to die on me.
What's the matter?
Just when I get everything set up at school.
I have to knock off that gorilla.
Don't tell me you're worrying about that joint?
Yeah.
Go on.
Get down to the hospital.
- Go ahead.
Beat it.
Go ahead.
"- Okay, okay."
"Oh, good for you."
Not really what I expected.
"Well, who is, huh?"
"You, for example."
No one had you down for such a cunt.
I see.
"90,000 Euros for this gentleman here, 95!"
95 thousand Euros here!
"Now, do I see one hundred thousand Euros?"
Get it out!
One hundred thousand Euros!
One hundred thousand Euros!
Gone to the man in the fine spectacles and now to the most coveted soprano in the world!
You got him to talk yet?
It won't be long now.
Mrs. Clios...
Are we nearly there?
We'll wait until the Service gates open.
Enter the property from both sides.
Hello.
Are you crying?
No.
So?
Boy trouble?
Not exactly.
Why don't you come back to the party?
Your brother's doing a very fine job.
I just lost out a dance with a beautiful woman.
"Maybe, I could have one with you."
"No, thank you."
Hmm.
"Well, surely there is something we can do to cheer you up."
"Die, you sucking pervert!"
"Dr. Corday, hi."
We need some Haldol here!
- You think that's necessary?
- Yes!
"Doctor C, looking good."
"Thanks, Malik."
"So, what's the GCS on this motorcycle trauma?"
"- Sorry, I didn't do the ride."
- Oh.
"Well, have the X-ray tech..."
- ... come down for portables.
- You got it.
- Hold the CT till we eyeball the patient.
"- Hey, welcome back."
Thanks.
So do you know any of the specifics?
"Sixteen-year-old girl, motorcycle versus utility pole, no helmet."
Carter's bringing her in.
- What's a chick doing on a motorcycle?
- What's anyone doing on a motorcycle?
"Have the rapid infuser primed and ready, draw her up 100 of fent four of Ativan."
Make sure the airway drugs are out of the box.
- It's like you never left.
- Yeah.
Vital sign.
- We need some O-neg.
- She got a rhythm?
- P. E.A. to agonal before arrival.
- Decreased breath sounds.
Intubated for agonal resps.
Didn't know you were back.
The movie director?
Yeah.
Shooting a film over on 1.
"""Gladiators."""
It's gonna make a billion in China.
"Oh, h-hold on."
You don't think that Austin had something to do with Phil's murder?
Was Austin filming last night?
He was supposed to.
"But for some reason, he shut down production early and took off."
About what time did he leave the lot?
I heard around 11:00.
Why?
Giving him lots of time to get to that cemetery.
Where do we find Stage 1?
You work out?
[Bell ringing]
Hayley:
"Oh, look."
There's Austin.
"So, how do you want to play this?"
"Well, if he did kill Phillip Harris, he's bound to be on guard, so we can't let him know that we are looking at him as a suspect."
Kendall?
!
"Oh, she's good. [Chuckles]"
How did she get onto Austin so quick?
We're done for.
"She's already got him wrapped around her skinny, little finger."
Don't say I never did anything for you.
"There you are, darling."
Mm.
"So, who's our new friend?"
"But then again, I do look good in purple."
Are you sure?
No cites for a loose load on the Golden State?
Of course.
Baker and Poncherello.
They came in this morning.
They didn't respond to the dispatches because they're not on their bikes.
They're at Poncherello's.
Does anybody have Poncherello's phone number?
Yeah.
I shouldn't have let them go home.
I shouldn't have...
I'm too nice a guy.
That's it.
I'm just too nice a guy.
You go to the drive-in very often?
I don't have to.
I can watch it from right here.
Saves me a fortune.
How do you know what's going on?
You can't hear it.
"Well, during the winter, you kind of have to figure it out, read lips."
"But during the summer, all the car windows are open."
It's like stereo.
"Hey, how do I get my nickel back out of here?"
Mr. Nice Guy.
I'm gonna have my name legally changed to Mr. Nice Guy.
"Boy, never again."
Never again.
"- Hey, sarge..."
"- Later, Park, later, later."
"This is your noon news update, Larry McCormick reporting."
"All of sudden she.said, ""Excuse me'"
"I said, yes please?"
"She said, ""My watch isn't working."
"Could you tell me the time?"""
I know.
This is an outdated idea to start a conversation.
Quite possible her watch must have stopped working.
You are unnecessarily suspecting her.
- No need to advocate for her.
What happened next?
- What else?
I told her the time.
Again there was a silence.
There was no sign ofthe bus.
I decided to walk. I had just put a step ahead and she said...
"""Listen""."
"-l said, yes, tell me."
"She said, ""You are leaving me alone over here"""
"""l am scared to be alone."
"Can you drop me home?"""
Why?
Was the bus-stop in a forest?
-Not exactly.
But she was afraid.
I told her to come along.
Then we started walking.
I felt like the poor thing was a bit tired.
"You know there are benches on the footpath, don't you?"
I told her to sit down for a few moments.
She sat down.
Then I saw that she was staring at me.
I asked Meena whatthe matter was.
The wounded go before the dead.
We thought we'd better not move him.
They zapped me good.
You're not gone yet.
"Would you do me a favor, sir?"
Would you take a touch with me?
I sure will.
"Thank you, sir."
"Another favor, sir?"
What is it?
"You remember the decision I was trying to make, about my name?"
KIRBY:
The signs?
I remember.
That's it.
"There it is, sir."
You're sure that's what he wanted?
Affirmative.
That's what he wanted and that's what he's going to get!
Maybe he liked the idea of having so many men think about him every day.
Besides it sings.
It sings?
That's what he said.
It sings.
ROBIN:
Provo's Privy.
It does sing!
"Last time we met, Colonel Cai and I were going to tell you about a plan we had and ""A"" camp 107 got hit."
This can't wait till you take over.
I want you briefed.
- Why way out here?
- This is top secret.
Right?
What?
Already expended it?
Just got 30 acres of vineyard.
Wine?
Yes.
"If I can make it, I'll send you some."
"That, will be a pleasure."
If we make through alive...
Today we will only look for garbage again?
"Bring a basket, a sandwich or something..."
It's like going hiking...
In a bleak place though....
A farewell to Arms ( Buki Yo Saraba )
Nice catch.
The UAV is back!
The camera!
The camera!
Prepare that one for the next launch.
Yes!
"Yankee, good job."
Under control.
Report status?
Arriving in about 5 minutes.
Before arrival we will launch an UAV.
Understood...
"About that protective suits... no matter how you look it, look awfully hot."
"It comes with aircon, you know."
You fool.
Look at the monitor.
"Take a look before you drop, idiot!"
I was looking down...
The retrovirus is acting quickly.
The human part of her is almost gone.
You said she killed the other Wraith and saved McKay's life.
"Yes, but I'm not sure she knew what she was doing."
She's operating on a purely animal level right now.
Is there nothing you can do for her?
"I might be able to reverse the effects, if you bring her back alive."
But I doubt she'll cooperate.
She's also stronger and faster than any Wraith I've ever seen.
Great!
All this time.
We thought you were dead.
There was no other way.
They never would have accepted us.
And I couldn't abandon her.
Why?
She... needed me.
"Colonel, this is Beckett."
Go ahead.
Zaddik's dead.
Understood.
She knows we're here.
She's watching us.
Ellia?
We want to help you!
"Dr Beckett can make you better, but you have to come with us."
We will not hurt you!
She took a blow to the head when Ellia hit her.
Stay with her.
- Sheppard!
- That's an order!
Teyla.
Do you guys want to go see a movie?
Ooh. hold on. hold on.
Hello?
Check your bank account. your money's back.
It's georgina.
Georgina where are you?
what happened to poppy?
You don't have to worry about her ever again.
You got your money. that's all that matters.
- Now you can go to yale. - well i'm going to n.y.u. now.
Oh. great. then i'll see you next year.
Wait. what does that mean?
Hello?
georgina?
What?
Georgina sparks?
Yes that's right.
I recently enrolled in gallatin.
Here's my paperwork and my check.
Thank you miss sparks.
Is there anything else?
I'd like to request a roommate-- blair waldorf.
She's my best friend and i just can't wait to live with her.
Serena.
Carter.
Aren't you supposed to be in dubayy?
You know you can't lose me for long. where you headed?
Everywhere.
I have something you might want to know before you go.
I hope it doesn't have to do with blair.
No it has to do with you.
It's about santorini what you were looking for there.
I think it was on last month's Power Vocabulary Builder.
I'm serious.
You're the antithesis of him.
"I have never seen 2 people who look so much alike, who are so different inside."
Be careful.
"And so one night in Innsbruck, before the entire Norwegian ski team, he proposed a toast."
Devon?
Are you all right?
You are a stubborn one.
Now we shall begin.
I have the formula.
Good.
One card.
This better not be another 10.
Ten.
"Thank you, michael."
That makes 21.
"I'm telling you, it's beginner's luck."
That's what you said yesterday.
I'm no longer a beginner.
"In addition to which, it's not luck."
The odds in blackjack are 0.6 percent in favor of the house.
"However, if one applies-"
"KITT, I wish your computers had less on odds and more on the key Rita gave me."
"A key from blank stock is extremely difficult to trace, michael."
april's calling.
"Hello, April."
"michael, you've got to come back right away."
"Why, what's wrong?"
It's Devon.
"He went out with an old friend last night, and..."
And what?
- What will I break?
- The head.
Now go to the shrine and pray.
- Shall I pray for something for you?
- Go ahead.
- Shall I pray for a wife for you?
- A wife?
All right.
Even if the wife is 60 years old she should have wealth amounting to one-fourth of 56 crore rupees!
56 crores?
is that all?
Move it now!
Come on!
You speak as if you are a King!
"Do you know, Pooja?"
First you will have to meet my brother at home.
"If my brother approve of you, it will mean everything's okay!"
What if your brother doesn't approve?
"Then you look for another boy, and I will look for another girl."
You are so scared of your brother?
I am not scared. I adore him!
You don't realize what a big person my brother is!
- 6 feet 2 inches.
- l am not talking of his height.
- His chest is 42 inches.
Right?
- You are right!
"I have flicked this jacket from him. lt's great, isn't it?"
That's why it's so loose-fitting on you.
- What did you say?
Loose-fitting?
- Yes!
So?
I don't get how a living person can be a ghost.
It's not a living human.
He died a long time ago.
He must have been human once.
But not anymore.
"So then, the ghost got inside him?"
"Well, that's how it started."
"Not everything that moves, breathes, and talks is alive."
Countless people have perished because they didn't understand that.
If it's not stopped... that demon will destroy this village.
Demon?
An evil ghost!
"Even among other demons, he's a master of evil."
"If that's true, why did it have to be... your daughter?"
What sin did that young girl ever commit?
Yes.
"If you go fishing, do you know what you'll catch?"
No.
He's just fishing.
Not even he knows what he'll catch.
"He just threw out the bait, and your daughter took it."
That's all it was.
Park Chun-bae
- This one?
- No.
Money.
"Yes, money."
21 dollars more.
- No!
- That's okay.
"Oh, come on."
All I know is how to sit down and order a meal.
Not for you.
Just a place to hang.
The chef is great.
The fuckin'shows are good.
There's a lot of whores coming in.
What do you want from me?
Tommy's a bad seed.
What am I supposed to do?
Shoot him?
That wouldn't be a bad idea.
I'm sorry I said that. I didn't mean to say that.
I just mean that he's scaring me.
I just need help.
"Help me, please."
You know anything about this fuckin' restaurant business?
He knows everything about it.
He's in the joint 24 hours a day.
"Another fucking few minutes, he could be a stool."
That's how often he's in there.
You want me to be your partner?
is that what you're tryin' to tell me?
You want me to be partners?
What do you think I'm talking about?
"Paulie, please."
It's not even fair.
You don't understand.
You run the joint.
Maybe I'll try to help you.
"God bless you, Paulie."
You've always been fair with me.
Now the guy's got Paulie as a partner.
"-Yeah, right."
-What?
-Joey cracks me up.
"""Have your ex-wife move in."
"That wouldn't be awkward."""
"Imagine, I go away for a few days.."
and my boyfriend is living with a woman he got pregnant.
"So, what'd you tell him?"
You didn't tell Mona Rachel moved in?
She seemed to think it was such a crazy idea.
"Plus, she got me taffy."
-Really?
I've never had any.
-Ever?
My mom was too busy planning her suicide to provide saltwater treats.
Thank you.
Are you gonna tell her?
I will.
I want to butter her up first.
"I'm gonna take her to dinner, do all this romantic stuff."
When she thinks I'm the best boyfriend ever..
I'll tell her my pregnant ex-girlfriend is living with me.
"If I haven't said it before, she's a lucky, lucky lady."
So where are..?
What the crap is up with this stuff?
Is it gum?
Is it food?
What's the deal?
"Oh, it's nice."
May I try a pink one?
So I just have to plan the perfect night.
"Hey, what's the best date you ever had?"
"OK, long story, short version."
I was going to marry his ex-wife.
(CHUCKLES) Seriously?
!
"What, and now you're mates, and everything?"
"(CHUCKLES) Well, mates is probably pushing it."
So where is she?
"His ex, your missus?"
She died.
Ouch!
Sorry.
- Mouth on me sometimes.
- That's all right.
You weren't to know.
- What about you?
How do you know him?
- Don't.
Not really.
"As far as I'm concerned, he's this random smurf popped up out of nowhere."
So why the...?
Long time ago my dad killed this girl.
"It was by accident and everything, but... he panicked."
Cut her up and whatnot.
- Put all the bits in wheelie bins.
- Jesus.
I'm sorry.
"So this bloke, Luther, was one of the coppers that put him away."
And your dad?
Killed himself in prison.
"Jenny, listen, I know how hard..."
how hard it can be.
Losing someone that way.
"No.No, I meant every goddamn word of it."
You don't want to take back any of that?
Nope.
Nope.
Ok.
"Oh, and, uh, I slept with frenchie."
"I'm sorry, what?"
I slept with frenchie.
And I got the note to prove it.
You're carrying that around with you?
Wouldn't you?
"Jeez, it sounds like the end of the world down here."
"Jesus, he's pounding the leather off that thing."
Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
"Yeah, no more spic jokes."
"No, F.D.N.Y. Boxing team."
"We get him in the ring, we get some side action going, pick up a little extra cabbage."
"I mean, with me and you coaching him, we'll clean up."
Whatever happened to no more mr.
"Nice guy, you guys don't give me any respect, buh-buh-buh?"
That's the job.
This is a chance to make money.
"And for that, I will revert back to my happy-go-lucky whore self."
"Just, uh, think he'll go for it?"
Can't hurt to ask.
"Christ, let's let him finish up first."
- You gavin?
- Yep.
- On your break?
"Sifu, Mousy's a good man."
Please let him be your student.
Mousy!
The injuries weakened his legs.
Your injuries are unique.
I'll have to give you a unique treatment.
How unique?
Your heart has been displaced.
I'll have to open your chest to heal you.
We'll open your ribcage and adjust the position of your heart.
We'll then close your ribcage and sew you up.
Then you'll be better.
He can handle it.
"Sifu Wong, is this knife suitable?"
Just about.
Hold him down!
I'm OK!
I'm OK now!
Come back.
Pay your respects to Marshal.
I'm known for being magnanimous.
"We're like brothers, and none of his ideas worked."
Forfeit for you.
"Sifu Wong, hey..."
Go and stand guard.
"- Sifu Wong, we're going."
- Glad you came.
Take your time.
We're on our way.
♪ It's such a joy to be entertained
♪ We'd be invited to more dinners...
"White Tiger, there are 17 criminal cases against you."
Because I am the man.
And that's the man's job.
Good news.
You may unbuckle your safety belt and move freely about the house.
Tyler is leaving.
What?
"Oh, thank God!"
Where's he going?
He and Clem are driving down to Tijuana.
What?
No!
No!
No!
- They are not!
"- Oh, I'm sure they'll be fine."
I gave them a whole bunch of cash and my dusty wallet condom.
And the mother bear's off to protect her cub.
"Tijuana, here we come."
(car engine starts)
- Oh!
- Oh!
Get out of the car.
You are not going to Tijuana.
You listen to me.
"Tijuana is a low-down dirty place where anything goes, which is why I love it."
But you cannot go because you are still a child.
So are you.
I think we can agree my childhood ended with that text.
"Okay, you know what?"
Listen.
I love your dad very deeply and I work hard to make sure that our marriage is strong and our love life is spicy.
And I don't feel like I should have to apologize for that.
Drop the weapon!
It's over!
Aah!
Aah!
Get away from me!
"Trevor, you don't want to do this."
Let me help you or you're gonna die.
You help me?
"Yeah, right!"
I know about Preston.
I know that he put you up to all of this.
You damn half-breed!
You don't know anything!
"Trevor, we pulled your phone records."
You called Preston 13 times today.
So what?
!
"We pulled his voicemail messages, too."
"He's using you, kid."
That's why he won't call you back.
Get out of here or I'll kill this bitch!
Listen to me.
Just listen.
"When those men broke in your house, you know who ended up buying it?"
It was your man Preston.
And he got it for nothing.
You're a liar!
All you people do is you lie!
"The men convicted of killing your family, they both said somebody paid them off to do that job."
They just couldn't prove it.
So now they're doing life.
"Yeah, well, they should have gotten the chair!"
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm a cop.
Jeffrey's a professional killer.
He murdered somebody.
I've been after him for months.
- I don't believe you!
-Jenny!
"- Listen to me,Jenny!"
- No!
"-Jenny, it's true."
- Chang!
"Jenny, calm down."
"Listen, please!"
Sit down.
Six months ago...
Jeffrey shot your face up by accident.
Now his employer wants him dead.
I don't believe it!
"I'd like to help, but I can't, in my position."
I hope you'll cooperate with us.
"Jenny, we're using you as bait."
It can bringJeffrey in this time.
I'll save his life foryou.
"Otherwise, the guy who hired him will kill him."
Name your price.
I want him dead.
He was recognized doing thejob.
"I want him wasted, the sooner the better."
"Deposit $1 00,000 into my account now... and $200,000 more upon completion."
"No money, no action, Mr. Weng."
Not even if I see his finger on the trigger ready to blow your head off.
- Put the hundred grand in his account.
Mike and I know this country.
- You don't.
"- No matter what you think, there's a missing chimp out there."
We can help find her.
"Captain, I'm afraid they make sense."
Our first responsibility is to find Sally.
"Well, ok, we'll release them."
"You guys better remember-- anything happens to Sally, you're gonna be responsible, you get that?"
"Believe me, Captain, we're just as concerned"
- about that chimp as you are.
"- Yeah, well, we'll see."
"Hey, no guns."
"It's just a dart rifle, Captain."
Here.
Look for yourself.
(CHATTERING)
(ROARS)
(JUDY SCREECHING)
- Got it?
- Yep.
There we are.
"Now I'll secure the tarpaulin, and then I'll call one of my men to stand guard over it."
Ok.
I'm gonna check in with Paula.
Marsh Tracy calling Wameru.
"Paula, do you read me?"
- Come in.
- Wameru.
"Go ahead, Dad."
"Paula, we found the space capsule and Sally's spacesuit"
- but no helmet.
"- Well, Dad, where's Sally?"
This was imported. lt came in two pieces.
Do you believe what they can do?
"-Nice, huh?"
-Come here.
Did you and Jimmy talk?
"Yeah, I talked to him..."
He's looking into everything.
"This'll make the Air France hold up look like Goddamned peanuts, man."
Come on.
-It's ok...
"He's gonna do it, right?"
-l told you.
He's looking into it.
We'll see what happens.
No promises.
Do you understand?
There's millions in there.
And I've been bleeding for this. I've been cultivating this son of a bitch for two years.
He owes me 20 grand.
Once in a lifetime.
I could retire.
No more nut every week.
No more bullshit.
My dream comes true.
Morrie Let's get a drink.
And these are the guys Jimmy put together for what turned out to be the biggest heist in American history.
The Lufthansa heist.
Tommy and Carbone were gonna grab the outside guard and make him get us in the front door.
Frenchy and Joe Buddha had to round up the workers.
Johnny Roastbeef had to keep them all tied up and away from the alarms.
Even Stacks Edwards got in on it.
He used hang around the Lounge and play guitar.
Because of his son?
Greg had a fling with Hillie.
A fling?
It seemed like he loved her.
"He loves a lot of the girls, but he's not gonna get serious with someone like Hillie."
His father would kill him.
"Stephanie, would you keep this to yourself for the moment?"
Of course.
Thanks.
- The blue one.
- What?
That's the dress you should bury her in.
The blue one with the bow.
"[ Al ] It's right here, Sam."
It's in the closet.
How long have you been there?
"Uh, well, long enough to know that you think Greg's old man murdered Hilla."
Or maybe Greg.
I thought the kid was in love with her.
"According to her diary, she met someone new."
She broke it off with Greg on the Fourth ofJuly.
"Well, maybe they made up again."
I don't know.
"After the fourth, there are no new entries."
Except she did put this in there.
What is it?
A blood test result.
Her beta H.C.G. was positive.
Uh-huh.
"Speak English, will ya?"
"Two people died in that lake, Al."
Hilla was pregnant.
"You're just jealous, Peku."
"You're a fucking tease, bitch!"
I'll tell everyone not to talk to you.
You're a traitor!
And you can donate this virginity barometer to the nuns!
Can't you just wear women's clothes?
This is so embarrassing.
You're the one going through people's grocery bags!
How do I look?
-Like a pervert dying to get laid.
Dad...
"You didn't have to, honey..."
I'll fight for you.
You picked these in the yard.
I rang your doorbell.
I brought you flowers.
Tore them from the ground.
I worked!
"I humiliated myself for you, Marjukka."
-Oh boy...
You're insatiable!
"I've got something better in sight, you stupid monkey!"
"You've got a guy here, I can smell it."
Go or I'll ask your Mom to get you.
Tell him to come out.
Hello.
Garbage Jesse!
"This won't do, Jesse."
You're far too crazy.
And lemma hates you.
I'm beginning to understand why.
L---
Maybe not.
"When I went back to search rebecca's place,"
I found this between the couch pillows.
Rebecca shot herself.
I think so.
"She lost a lot today Her fiancee,her life savings."
Her respect.
Could have been a failed suicide attempt.
Or a bid f sympathy.
Or an attemptto escape discovery that she had sex with finn the day she died.
"What's your gut tell you,boss?"
Take your shirt off.
Here we go.
I know it's kind of messy.
"Thshirt,mcgee,take it off now."
Take it down to abby.
Or would you rather wait for a search warrant?
Rebecca's dna.
I need to borrow one of your shirts.
You afraid all that white might burn out abby's corneas?
Do not make me walk around like this all day.
Come on.Help me out.
All right.
I can't resist a damsel in distress.
****************************
"Wow,it's just like chippende'S... without the bow ties or muscles."
Givee a second.
I just have to finish this e-mail to kofi annan.
Kofi can wait.
"What is it,jethro?"
The finn case.
Yes?
I'm really embarrassed.
Grandma puts her hands together to worship what I cooked.
-And it was really delicious.
-That's true!
We're all counting on you from now on.
Look at this.
What is this?
"To convince her to agree to go to Hawaii, I talked about Suzujiro today."
Then Grandma started to remember the names of her brothers.
"""Tetsutaro."
"""Dozaburo."
"""Jushiro."
"""Shogoro."
"""Kuginosuke."
"""Natakichi."
"""Kuwata."
"""Suzukichi."
"""Nabe."
"""Kane."
"Kyoko."""
These names have the Chinese symbol for metal.
"Grandma's father, our great-grandfather, seems to have been a real weirdo."
"""Kane."" So this is our Grandma, right?"
-eleven!
-eleven?
"And she says there must have been two or three more, but she can't remember them."
And Suzujiro is among the ones she can't remember?
"But you know, Tetsutaro, Dozaburo, there, is number two."
I think the brother between those two is Suzujiro.
I'm pretty sure of it.
"First, the Chinese character for Suzu has the symbol for metal."
"Even if she could remember, Grandma won't go to Hawaii."
No.
"Young man, how much cash do you have on you?"
"It's not a girl after all, it's a boy."
Who would've guessed?
"Fine, have it your way."
(BLADE GRUNTING)
"Noah, hurry up!"
"I've prepared a stronger dose, which I'm hoping will make it last longer."
"The problem is, you're developing a resistance to the retrovirus."
"Fine, fine."
"Enough talking, old man."
Just do it!
(GRUNTING)
(GASPING)
BLADE:
Stop!
"Get out of here, little girl."
Shame on you.
"Not very sporting, killing your prey in his sleep."
Let's let him rest a bit longer.
No?
"He's a hybrid, half-human, half-vampire."
What they call a Daywalker.
"The drug helps suppress his thirst for blood, but the side effects are excruciatingly painful and get worse every time."
Coffee?
"No, thanks."
(CHUCKLES)
"You know, I've known Eric for along time."
We first met on a night much like this.
"Dover, England"
"I'm sorry, mister."
I had to.
When I was broke I would go out and rob some more.
We ran everything.
We paid off cops.
We paid off lawyers.
We paid off judges.
Everybody had their hands out.
Everything was for the taking.
And now it's all over.
That's the hardest part.
Today everything is different.
There's no action.
I have to wait around like everyone else.
Can't even get decent food.
After I got here I ordered spaghetti with marinara sauce and I got egg noodles and ketchup.
I'm an average nobody.
I get to live the rest of my life like a schnook.
What the fuck is that?
Jimmy?
-What's up?
-Did I hit something?
What the fuck is that?
Maybe you got a flat?
No.
What the fuck?
You better pull over and see.
He's still alive.
You fuckin' piece of shit!
"Die, you motherfucker!"
Look at me!
Look into my fuckin' eyes.
Die!
"But with some sound advice and the proper introduction, who knows?"
I'll tell you one thing.
You've got the right product.
"Anything that gets the DEA's panties in this big of bunch, you are on to something special."
And I would like to be a small and silent part of it.
"Full for thought, yeah?"
"So, if you want to make more money and keep the money that you make,"
Better call Saul!
Hey.
You...
You selling?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Okay.
That's cool.
"I'm just saying, you know, if you were selling I could maybe do with a teenth."
"You're kidding, right?"
"Dude, I so smell bacon."
What?
What are you talking about?
"Oh, gee, I don't know."
How about over there.
That brown van.
"That's yours, right?"
What brown van?
Parked all inconspicuous.
It's a cop van.
"Yeah, another one right over there."
"""Duke City Flowers""?"
Come on.
Can't you at least be original?
"Dude, I just wanna get high."
No more mummy wife from now on.
Your eyebrows are going to be attached to here soon.
Then you'll be a monster.
"I'm warning you, this is really the end."
I feel like death.
"When you're sleeping next to a mummy, you yourself feel like you're dead."
Do you know how scary it is to see a mummy moving around at night?
Do you have nothing else to talk about?
I'm only saying it because it's us three.
Why are you still wearing that?
Is there still some bruising?
People will find out.
Stop it.
And the kids?
"They're here, they wanted to take a look at some things."
My husband's almost here as well.
The guest has arrived.
I'm not late.
I'm five minutes early.
I just got here as well.
Hello.
Hello.
Take that off.
"Right, shall I?"
Why is it so hot?
I'll be taking this off.
Sure.
She's got a sty in her eye.
She didn't want you to see it so she got surgery.
Oh...
This color!
"Oppa, pretty, right?"
- I need your help.
- Oh.
You're not gonna handle this one on your own?
"You just couldn't help yourself, could you?"
"Sadly, no."
"Take Doug back to the loft, lock him down tight."
"- You can handle that, right?"
- Have I ever let you down?
"- Be careful, Fi."
"- Don't worry, Michael."
I never let my guard down.
What the hell do you mean you can't get ahold of her?
She doesn't have some kind of-
Yeah?
All right.
"Well, keep trying."
"Mike, she's in some kind of a meeting with a new client that just called this morning."
"I mean, it might be nothin'."
"It's not gonna be nothin', Sam."
- Hello.
"- Michael, if I had known... you were this much fun to work with..."
I would have come to Miami sooner.
I'm glad one of us is having fun.
"You're not missing the damsel in distress, are you?"
"Michael, my son."
I'm afraid.
"Please, Michael."
Please.
- You changed.
- This is more my style.
"Oh, for crying out loud."
I'm not gonna shoot you here.
"Calm, we will put an unforgettable injection to him."
"That is, dont move..."
Quiet...
"Good, the analyses, are not of the best ones."
-Dame the x-ray.
"-Immediately, Professor."
This one is not a wonder either.
"It is clear, tomorrow we will make a small intervention and we will fix to him definitively."
Contentment?
"Cicchirini, take care of the preparations."
"It neglects, Professor."
"-Oh, Professor."
"-You let me pass, young lady?"
Water...
"Well, we followed with the habitual injections."
"You are in charge, Ms Cappia..."
Cappa...?
"Cappi, Profesor."
List.
"We made use to him, Doctor?"
It is already all preparation.
-All ready one.
-Calm.
Calm...
To this one it is necessary to operate to him emergency.
"Tomorrow no he can, happened is strike,"
"Now comes the weekend, we will operate Monday to him."
What happens?
Who has died?
You!
-You have been!
-No.
"If not, you'll have to bottle it into him, but do be careful."
You can choke a beast that way.
"Anyhow, nurse is on the job."
Yes.
I have the distinct impression that I'm under supervision.
Hmm?
Is she always like this?
Aye.
Funny how they are in their ways.
Judy here thinks she's responsible for all the stock on the farm.
"Well, sheepdog..."
"Keen instinct, I suppose."
"Oh, it's more than that."
She likes to take charge.
"Newborn calves, new kittens all get licking and nursing treatment from old Judy."
It'll be all to the good for this little chap.
It might give him a new interest in life.
"You're a rummer, all right, are you, lass?"
"Hello, James."
"- Hello, siegfried."
Savaged?
"Hammer blow, actually."
I trust you weren't using it on a patient at the time.
Sorry.
Can I do the honors?
That's okay.
- Come on.
"Thank you, James."
Pleasure.
James...
- Mm-hmm?
May I ask you a very Frank question?
But they do not know how to wait‎.
Thank you‎.
"Hey‎, what's wrong‎?"
We have to take an alternative path for Saint Andreasberg‎.
"So we get to ""emptiness"" and go‎."
"Sorry‎, gentlemen‎."
We were told that the bridge is broken‎.
So we have to divert another way‎.
I do not mind the trip‎.
It is actually pleasant‎.
"But here we have a guy on the other hand‎, it ‎.‎.‎."
I'm not sure who likes shortcuts‎.
"You can go in the cabin if you want‎, sir‎."
I'm Lieutenant Goss‎.
Sergeant Jesse Owens‎.
"A pleasure to meet you‎, Lieutenant‎."
"Jesse Owens‎,‎.‎.‎."
How Olympic medalist Jesse Owens‎?
Exactly‎.
"Must be nice to confuse you with him‎, I guess‎."
‎
- Looks like a good guy‎. ‎
- Do you think‎?
‎
"- The man won 3 gold medals‎. ‎- 4 medals‎, sir‎."
Four‎?
It broke a world record‎.
I did seem to others as fools‎.
I can be liked‎.
¡Going‎!
"Danny boy‎, do you have gum‎?"
‎
We would have met him coming in.
Fantomas could not have escape.
Let's be coherent.
Where do you believe he's hiding?
Guess.
Guess?
Instead say you know nothing.
You made us lose enough time.
You would be better looking through the floors.
Useless.
Fantômas has not left these four walls.
This is absolute madness!
"Mr Nanteuil, would you please do me a service and draw plans of this floor?"
I can not draw.
Do your best.
Fine.
If you insist...
"I will prepare the ink and paper, Mr Nanteuil."
But what are you doing?
Oh!
I brought a little snapshot:
These prints are identical.
And these are the fingerprints of Jacques Dollon.
What is this story?
This is madness!
Mr Juve.
This is a journalist's trick!
It would be easy to make another print from my finger.
You'll see I'm not Jacques Dollon.
No need.
I saw through your act a second ago.
The hand of Jacques Dollon.
- You gotta go ?
See yourself home.
- Fuck you !
"- Bitch, I'm gonna--"
- What the hell is your problem ?
You gonna take that bitch's back and won't even cover mine ?
"- 'Cause you wrong, Malakai."
"- No, you're wrong."
You been wrong.
You ain't even worth shit no more.
"Get outta my face, college boy, and take that trailer trash ho with you."
"Honey, his blue pajamas are at the bottom of the bag."
"If it's as cold as it was today, put those on him."
"Hey, whatcha all doing with my nephew here ?"
Come on now.
There we go.
It's okay. lt's okay.
- What's wrong with him ?
"- He don't know you, Kenny."
"I'm his father, he knows me."
What should I do ?
- Come around more often.
"- See, I can't talk to you."
And I can't depend on you.
- Shh.
- [ Baby Crying ]
"What do you think I use to raise this baby, oxygen ?"
"He has needs, Kenny, and his needs require money."
- Here we go.
- And we're gonna keep going... until I get what I need from you to raise your son.
I'm doing the best that Ican.
But do you think your mouth helps the situation ?
New Bern is on its way.
There are 70... maybe 80 men.
Is that tank there yet?
They're trying to load it with that mortar round right now.
I think you're gonna need it.
"All right, let's get ready!"
They're coming!
Get some ammo down here!
What is it?
I'm being tracked.
Tracked?
What do you mean?
Someone is trying to trace my location through the satellite.
"Well, can they?"
"If they have time, yes."
Do you know who it is?
"My guess is, it's, uh, Valente."
"What, him?"
"From, uh..."
from Homeland Security?
"I don't know who he's working for now, but he told Sarah to get the bomb any way she could and to eliminate all witnesses."
All the witnesses.
Shut it down.
"No, I can't."
We just have to make sure we disconnect the feed before he finishes the trace.
Hey.
I don't get it.
Why are they just standing there?
I don't know.
Do we fire the first shot?
New Bern's here.
Get into position.
What's left of it.
This is the place that you're trying to save?
Mm-hmm.
It's so beautiful.
You think so?
Yeah.
Why would anybody want to ruin this?
Well...
Look...
A glossy ibis.
I watch a lot of documentaries on TV.
"You know, maybe I don't have to leave."
"I mean, it's so safe here and nobody knows about this place."
Except you and me.
Just you and me.
And the 20 of us.
What makes for good television?
"The story as it breaks, live, coming to you from the bad guy himself?"
"I mean, we wouldn't want your viewers to change the fucking channel, would we?"
What the hell's this world coming to?
- Nice.
- I'm sorry.
I'll buy you a new one.
Subject has just passed Flowerbowl.
I'm about 30 yards back.
- Stay with him.
I'm coming on your right.
- I can't see him.
Where is he?
- He's in front of the Pier One truck!
- All right.
We just passed the Flowerbowl.
"Yes, sir."
This is driving me up the wall.
Don't pay any attention to the crazy girl's talk.
Not her.
I'm talking about this.
Family Tragedy Linked To Wild Mushrooms
"""Murdered by... wild mushrooms""?"
What did the dermatologist say?
Mushrooms?
"He wasn't sure, so he referred Heung-guk to the hospital."
Told you.
It can't be the mushrooms.
It's not impossible.
Shut your hole.
You know that story Byeong-gyu told you?
There are so many.
The one about the naked man eating the deer carcass.
What's gotten into you?
At a crazy time like this?
It's because things are so crazy.
"You know the guy who saw it, right?"
"""Herbs  Tonics"""
Over here.
"You may not believe it, but I saw it with my own eyes."
Look at this.
Can you see it?
Sure.
I got 22 stitches.
From falling on your head while you were drunk?
What are you talking about?
I'm too old to make shit up.
You got proof?
Agreeing to have sex with someone you haven't even met.
"Grace, what's going on?"
Where are you?
"Uh, at a hair salon."
"In fact, I-I have to go."
Bye.
"- It's Neil, right?"
"- Yes, Neil."
"Oh, he is gorgeous."
"Strong chin, warm eyes."
Whew.
I can almost taste him.
Adriana never sent anyone to meet me before.
Why now?
"Oh, it's just something we do for our most valued clients to ensure you have the most enjoyable experience."
I'm flattered.
"So give me a sense of what you're looking for, and how you envision your night with Neil."
Do you mean like the perfect date?
Sure.
Let's start there.
I want to fall in love.
It's not just about the sex.
It's about the before.
And the after.
"Lying there in messy sheets, drinking him in while he tells charming stories."
Running fingers through his hair as he soaks in a steaming hot bath.
You know.
Yes.
I think I do.
"This one, Adriana says is one of her best."
So I hear.
Neil.
You could always stay at my house lt's better there I have a fireplace and supplies
Are you asking me to move in with you?
"- Well, I suppose..."
- l thought you didn't like children
Me?
- It was you who didn't want...
"- OK, just leave it"
"Anyway, we're not coming"
Your friends are here
"We may have caught your attacker ln fact, he could be dead"
Simon Delaître.
He attacked the waitress from the bar
Simon Delaître?
He can't hurt you now
Hi
- Hi
- Has Léna called?
No I told the police.
They don't care.
They think she has just run off
Who is in here?
"Hello, Jérôme I might have guessed."
What have you told them?
The truth
"Jérôme, listen to me"
Frédéric knows about Camille.
She needs protecting
She needs protecting from him
You can't trust him.
"He's a fraud, but you can't see it"
"Please, stop it"
"Camille, go upstairs"
She's given her statement.
Read it.
Shiv brought me to Kurukshetra... which is 142 kilometres from Delhi... and raped me in this car.
Enough.
I'll handle it from here.
Heard that.
Anything that you say anything that you don't say... will definitely be used against you.
Ayushman you don't know...
You don't know that rape is a serious crime.
No bail and along prison sentence.
You'll live like a dog get that.
You're trying to trap me in this.
Dimple's lying.
- You know...
- Who's lying?
She's lying.
Will a decent girl defame herself?
Did she bring you here?
Did she bring you here?
You didn't bring her.
She... drugged the water.
She made you drink it.
She got you unconscious.
Listen boy.
It's all about facts and figures.
You were stuck on her figure.
And the fact is... that you're a bloody rapist.
Understand.
Come out.
Ayushman what are you doing?
Come on.
Ayushman this is wrong.
Can't make a perfect world.
"No matter what, shit happens."
It felt really nice to be desired today.
It meant a lot.
Thank you.
"Honey, i always desire you."
"Usually, it just annoys you."
No.
You want to have sex all the time.
"Today, you desired me."
okay.
Okay.
We still don't know the truth about jane.
I'm just saying.
Madeline had anger issues.
Itty bitty ball of rage.
Wanna see her rage issues?
"Call her ""itty bitty."""
"Renata had the whole kind of ""sexy praying mantis,"
"Bite your head off after sex"" thing going."
"Oh, yeah, that bonnie's just the sweetest thing."
"Yeah, right."
"Celeste-- she is an accomplished attorney,"
And some people in this town resent that.
"Rich, beautiful, madly in love."
Something had to be wrong.
Hey.
Hey.
What are you thinking?
I'm trying to decide whether i'm happy or sad.
People usually know.
I'm sad because--
I hoped to find him recovered and so I'd explain to him everything.
But when he came back...
I won't say he was worse.
It's not that.
But he was a total helpless person.
I don't know what would he told you.
He told me the same.
I couldn't leave him in that spot.
It was a terribly unfair situation for me.
I thought that with me by his side I could help him.
How is Luisa?
Who told you about Luisa?
I heard from mom.
"Well, from Berta."
She was talking to her.
"What a lousy, filthy bad omen bird she is!"
What's omen?
"It's a sign, a premonition..."
I sense your eyes like dark violets...
Who wrote that?
Mine.
-It's beautiful.
And why wouldn't it be?
Are you gonna write more poetry?
I don't know.
What did Berta say about Luisa?
"That she's a whore, more or less."
But why do you care?
And what did your mother say?
Nothing.
"She said she knew you were dating some girl already, but she didn't know her."
And Berta said she was very tall and young.
"-Look, they're red on the inside."
-Nice.
-Look at that.
"-Quite cool, huh?"
You look like some sort of sexy secretary.
"Let's move out, men!"
e've got days off scheduled.
"Hey, have fun going home."
"See you later, yeah?"
"Have a fun flight home, you."
"I'II try but I'II miss you too much, Liam!"
See you later!

But do actually look forward to going home.
"Sing it, O2!"
"Let me hear you, London!"
How we doing in the back?
So baby if you say You want me to drive o KFC
I Iove chicken.
I Iike holmes chapel.
Pretty much every other part of my Iife has changed apart from coming down here.
It's just exactly the same.
My first kiss was down there.
"I kissed a girl, Iike, a bit further down."
"We were, Iike, against a tree."
It was pretty steamy.
"Come on, come on."
He just missed an open goal!
"Oh, we're gonna catch this."
e don't realise how much we appreciate our family and hometown until you're gone.
"Yes, I know, honey."
Get in the car.
I`m just fixing the license plate.
"Do you see that, kids?"
That`s the St. Louis Arch.
"""The Gateway to the West. """
"It`s over 600-feet tall, and there`s an elevator all the way to the top."
That`s 60 stories to you and me.
"Dad, can we go up on it?"
No.
"Dad, what river is this?"
That`s the Mississippi.
The mighty Mississip.
"""The old Miss."""
"""The old Man."""
"Clark, I think this is the wrong exit."
"What`s the difference, as long as we get across the river?"
clark?
What are you doing?
"Just relax, ellen."
This is so dangerous!
We have no business being in an area like this!
This is a part of America we never get to see.
That`s good!
"No, that`s bad."
We can`t close our eyes to the plight of the cities.
"Kids, are you noticing all this plight?"
This will just make us appreciate what we have.
roll them up!
I`d better ask these fellas how to get back on the expressway.
I wonder if you could tell me how to get back on the expressway?
Fuck your mama!
She left
I'm scared
What do you know?
I'm scared too
See that bird?
He can fly across a continent and never land once

"Yeah sure, baby, sure"
Don't speak to me like that
"Ok, baby"
Juve!
Juve!
Mr Thomery is waiting for the Baroness.
You could have told me earlier.
"My dear Mathilde, this portrait of you is beautiful."
This little Jacques Dollon has talent.
"We can clearly see the influence of Tamara de Lempicka, but you're a greater influence on him."
Oh!
What do you think?
Jacques is 25 years old.
"Since I've read ""Cheri"" by Colette..."
How is it going in Santo Domingo?
Very well.
I just bought 2 acres of land.
I was able to extend my sugar cane plantations.
"Sure, I have some problems with indigenous people, but..."
"Production increases, this is what counts."
Lots of cake.
We love cakes.
"I got the green one for you, that's your favourite, right?"
I'll have the marzipan cake.
"No, the Goosey Whipped Cream."
"- You're far out, Thomas."
- Sure I am.
I'm expected to be.
- Stop it.
- Bums like me are skinny.
"I'll get so fat, people won't see the bum."
They'll nod and say:
What a good citizen with a double chin and all.
- Why don't you eat your cake?
"- I want to stop, Thomas."
I can't take it anymore.
Really?
Then I'll have it.
I can go on all day.
I don't know why.
Stop it!
You know what I mean.
"I'm talking about us, not the cakes."
About us?
Our relationship and stuff?
"Crisis, intimacy, presence, closeness."
- I'm serious.
"- Listen, the two of us have a pact."
We love each other.
"Even when we're apart, we're together, anyway."
"It can't be any different, Tilde."
- It's an old pact.

I killed many officers investigated on me in the initial stages.
Daniela.
- Close.
- It's Vanessa.
But thanks for trying.
Please let me go with you.
I'm always doing what everyone else wants.
I wanna do something for me.
We'll go as friends.
It won't be romantic.
Unless we drink a little too much in Vienna one night.
How could you say no to that?
Seriously.
As long as you take off that ridiculous tie so I can maybe picture you with a backpack.
- What's wrong with my tie?
- I need a coffee.
He's always wearing a tie.
"So I'm the one who does the good deed, and that guy goes off with the girl?"
"Yeah, it's good to be that guy."
Do you go to NYU?
- I'm starting in the fall.
- I just transferred from BU.
Scott.
I'm Dan.
"Nice to meet you, Scott."
Maybe I'll see you around.
We got this for you.
"- I'll take that, thank you."
- What are you doing here?
What I should have done months ago.
"In five seconds, your phones are going to go off with the latest Gossip Girl blast."
[PHONE BEEPING]
She is nothing if not punctual.
- Where even the buffalo wouldn't roam.
Okay.
That's it.
Lecture's over!
Class dismissed!
"Except you, Pierce."
Since you insist on behaving like a dunce... you can cap it off by staying after school.
- Why me?
They were bad too.
"- Yeah, but you're the top Katzenjammer."
"Since I gave Klinger the day off, you can fill in for him."
Here.
File these.
"Ah, the X-rays."
"I should've known he'd file them under ""E."""
"Good morning, Captain."
You people certainly divide up the diddly work democratically.
That's why we're over here...
to make the world safe for diddly.
[Chuckling] I'd like to leave these for your C.O.
It's the names of all the reenlistees.
- How many pigeons did you bag?
- I signed up two fine young men... who realize they have a solid future with Uncle Sam.
Let me see them.
I want to know who to untie.
"""Rizzo, L."" Mm."
"""Klinger, M."" Klinger?"
That one was pure gravy.
Six years.
He wasn't even on the list.
"I'm afraid the gravy's on you, Vickers."
- Klinger is strictly a homing pigeon.
You're a guy.
"Well, you used to be."
"So, what do you think?"
I've still got it.
-Why did you get me this?
-What is it?
"It's yelling, bleeding, dilating."
"Oh, the dilating!"
Is this the video of the birth?
It's Phoebe's.
Why were you watching it?
I thought maybe you got me porn for Valentine's Day.
If you thought I was gonna get you porn for Valentine's Day..
you were right.
It's about a girl who moves to the city in search of stardom..
but ends up having sex with a lot of guys.
It got four stars.
Wait a minute.
Those aren't stars.
"-Anyway, you wanna take a look?"
-Well..
-I'm not really in a sexy mood.
"-Hey, what's going on?"
Remember the first time you saw Jaws..
how long it took to go back in the water?
We can't let this tape wreck Valentine's Day.
You gotta get past it.
Just get back on the horse.
"Otherwise, the horse is gonna go into the bedroom and change into her sweatpants."
"-Okay, you don't know."
You didn't see it.
-Childbirth is beautiful.
She could have just been saying that so he'd have to marry her.
Got a lot to lose.
Harvard Law School's coming up.
All this one day.
A kid and an unmarried mother... could ruin everything.
I was gonna marry her.
What?
We were gonna elope the night she died.
- I don't believe it.
- Neither do I.
- Hilla broke it off with you.
"- No, she didn't."
"On the Fourth ofJuly, she told you she loved someone else."
"You fought, and she ended it between you."
Who told you that?
Hilla.
In her diary.
"No, that wasn't me."
Not that weekend.
I was at a tournament in Boston.
That's right.
The kid won.
Brought back a real big trophy.
"Whoever she broke it off with, it wasn't me."
Wejust started dating each other around that time.
And you didn't get her pregnant either.
"Next time you come around here with wild accusations, get your facts straight, Melvin."

[ Hilla's Voice ] That's what's missing from my life-- someone to love.

That's a beautiful melody.
Take a shower.
They're gonna be here soon.
You need to clean the grill.
"Why can't we just stay in, just the two of us, and just not do that?"
"You mean like when I'm up and I am doing things, and you're asleep?"
Let's save that for another afternoon.
Get up.
The joke's on you.
I'm not a ventriloquist dummy.
- That's all right.
- It's all right.
It's all right.
- You could use that in your act.
- I could.
You want cheese?
- Cheeseburger.
Cheeseburger.
- It's funny.
Can I do it?
Do you mind if I...?
I just don't need everybody touching my cheese.
Just...
No.
This will be mine.
- I'll have cheese.
No cheese for this guy.
- I can't have dairy.
I'm taking this cooking class where we're learning how to make a curry carrot corn queso.
It's like a dip.
"It's for Christmas and couples, or you can put it on salad."
- Was it sponsored by the letter C?
- Ha-ha-ha.
They're so much better than regular bars because worse is better.
"I know, right?"
"They're my favorite, too."
I'm quirky like that.
I've got quirky taste.
I'm a quirky girl.
It seems like we would be perfect for each other.
But really we're terrible for everyone.
ANNE MURRAY:
♪ And though I...
What the hell?
Are you listening to Anne Murray?
"Uh, I am experiencing Anne Murray."
Why?
That music is complete crap.
"Um, excuse me?"
"It's all just vapid, overproduced tripe."
It has no edge whatsoever.
"Yeah, neither does a soft summer breeze, or a letter from an old friend."
I'm pretty sure envelopes have edges.
"Fine, an e-mail."
Dick.
Whatever.
You know what?
I don't care.
"I think Anne Murray sucks, and that's my opinion."
"Oh, yeah?"
"Well, I'm going to make a believer out of you, Brian."
I am going to show you the true meaning of Anne Murray.
"Don't waste your time, I'm not going to change my mind."
"I don't know, Bri, I can make things happen when I want to."
Just ask my twin brother.
I don`t want you dozing off.
I`m not tired.
Are you kidding?
I couId go another 100 miles.
No problem.
"""I stay at home at night"
"""By the phone at night"
"""But you don`t call"
"""And I won`t hurt my pride"
"""Call me Mister Blue"
"""I`m Mister Blue without you"""
"Sparky, why don`t you turn off the TV and come to bed?"
"Okay, honey."
"well, up and at `em."
We`re here.
clark!
"Can I do your back, honey?"
I`ve already done my back.
Can I do your front?
Go do your own front.
We should call Catherine and Eddie and tell them that we won`t be in until tomorrow afternoon.
"If we`re not there by 10:00 a.m., we`II be completely off-scheduIe."
I planned very carefully so we`d be at WaIIey world first thing Saturday morning.
"Sparky, I know how much this trip means to you and that you want all of us to have a great time, but it`s a Iong way to WaIIey world."
I think it`d be easier on all of us if you`d just try to relax.
"I`m way ahead of you, honey."
When did you get these?
I have my little secrets.
What a nice thought.
Don`t drink yet!
Ready?
I would Iike to propose a toast.
Like being so co-dependent you flunk your test.
You are like a detective.
I'm close to identifying the bad guy.
You already know half my life story.
Some of your questions even my mom has never asked.
Are you saying I'm nosy?
No.
"Why would I say that, doc?"
"You should get more sleep, doc."
How do you know I didn't?
I am an expert on this.
"Just looking at your eyes, I can tell."
"Lately, I have exams."
I recommend Redbull mixed with coffee.
You can stay awake until dawn.
And that's good?
It's okay.
It's not like we're 20 anymore.
"Back then, staying up 2 nights was nothing."
"But in our 30's, our body starts breaking down."
How long can you stay awake?
5 days.
Like the X-men.
It's my special power.
But I'm okay.
I feel totally fine.
"I can do it, doc."
It's... necessary.
I think you should stop.
"This is my profession, how can I stop?"
"If you can't stop, can you do less?"
I can't.
- You're welcome.
Is that your car stuck there?
We're waiting for a tractor to pull it out.
"I see, thank you very much."
I'd really like to repay you somehow.
- Don't worry about it.
- But still.
It was really nothing.
Let's go.
- Thank you for your help!
- You're welcome.
Get her keys.
"We're just gonna grab some stuff and then we're gone, all right?"
"hey, hey, hey."
Come on.
Army food.
Yum.
- Which one's the key to the boat?
- The red one.
Let's get out of here before I start puking again.
"Look, look, I won't tell anybody you were here."
Just take the boat and go.
Please.
"Actually, we don't really need this."
I'm gonna find them.
The people who did this are not gonna get away.
Just tell me she's gonna be all right.
"She lost a lot of blood, but her pulse is strong."
We just have to keep watching her.
Bad heart valve.
She's had it since she was born.
"so Yawang, you have to be happy!"
Yawang!
Yawang.
You will never know that my basic wish was
just to admire the paradise together with you.
I think we will see each other in the next life.
"At that time,"
I'll be waiting for you!
"At that time, if you don't come,"
I will stay young!
"At that time, you would not loose me again."

"Hey, Esther, how're you doing?"
Want a jelly bean?
"Oh, some of these are wet."
That's weird.
They should all be wet.
I'm going to go boil my hand.
MASON:
There's nothing to be scared of.
Just relax and go with what feels right.
CLARK:
This is all too much at once.
You can't deny your feelings.
[whispers]:
It's not that easy.
Ours is a forbidden love.
-Your town;
-My town.
"-Oh, maybe you'll do, huh, colonel;"
"Well, it's the same old place, same...."
-l'm gonna leave you here.
-Where are you going;
At Charley's.
Cards are pretty hot for me today.
You better not get fresh with Charley.
He can teach you.
Yeah;
"Charley said you were pretty good at cards, but I was better."
I can take Charley the best day he ever lived with you standing on his shoulders.
"Try it any time you say, colonel."
Any time at all.
I'll bet the women spoil him silly.
-Yeah.
"-Not only the women, either."
Jeff says he can charm the gold out of your teeth.
"How is Jeff, Papa;"
"Well, he's like everything else around here, lost his bite."
JEFF:
Not much like the nightgown you wore when I put you to bed.
"-Oh, Jeff."
"-Ha, ha."
How do you like the way I fixed up your room;
"-Oh, it's beautiful."
"-ls it, though;"
Got my idea from one them magazines.
"-Well, if you want anything, yell."
"-Oh, don't go, I wanna talk to you."
-l wanna know about Brock.
Is that your friend?
Your friend Clementine?
"Yeah, you know, as long as people are coming over, maybe she could come over too."
To the apartment with Grace and Jack?
"Wouldn't she be, like, the third wheel?"
Wouldn't she be a fifth wheel?
"Fine, I don't care."
Might as well get that out of the way.
What out of the way?
Making friends with your friends so that hopefully she'll leave you alone.
She's an old friend from a long time ago.
"I never slept with her and I'd never sleep with her and if I tried to sleep with anyone other than you, she'd probably kick my ass."
What does that mean?
That means I said the wrong thing.
I just want her to meet you.
And John.
Fine.
Bring her over.
"Sorry, sorry, sorry."
I wasn't thinking.
Were you on the phone with your wife?
"Yeah, that was Amy."
She wants you to come over tonight.
She wants to meet you.
Why?
You're my friend.
She thought maybe you could be her friend.
Really?
"Okay, I thought maybe you could be her friend."
My friend and her friend.
I don't know.
Why not?
No chicks.
"Yeah, like you'd know what to do with one, you virgin!"
I know more than you!
Are you forgetting about that fox at the lake I boned all last summer?
How come we never met her?
I told you she died of leukemia.
Last time you said it was polio.
"Polio is a gateway disease to leukemia, stupid."
"Hey, look, Claire's here."
"Oh, she's so fine."
"Why don't you fuck her, Kevin?"
I blew my shot with her.
She was just about to touch it when my stupid brother boner-blocked me.
I'll never get laid.
"Hey, you know, I heard about this loose girl that goes to Roberto Clemente High."
She asks you to come to her house for a free haircut.
And then she fucks you.
"Well, that's something."
What's her name?
- I don't know.
Haircut Girl?
- That's no help!
"Oh, fuck it."
I'm gonna go talk to Claire.
"- No, you're not."
"- Oh, yeah?"
Watch me.
I will not die a virgin.
Ow!
My dick!
"Goddamn it, Maureen."
Don't sit like that.
"You didn't believe in me, and you still don't."

"Venom is a bit scrunched, but still alive!"

"Mickey Micheyan sewed the shit, now he has to drink it."
"They're assholes, those kids."
"It's the moon, Mercury."
"Mickey, he's a marked man."
The stars are my thing.
You've got the jitters?
Wanna split?
There's a door behind.
I couldn't.
- Because of her?
- Yes.
What's her ass got that mine hasn't?
She's fragile.
That's all in your head.
And your head is here.
"You, the slut!"
"And you, the missionary, you wait long before you get it!"
Here they come!
My comrades...
"It's not the same syndicate, commissioner."
It's private here.
"It's not them, detective."
The landlord assured me they've been here since 9.
"Oh, I know these guys."
Is that what I'm doing with Erica?
Making her decisions for her?
What do you think?
You can't deny the fact that Kai...
He has become a distraction.
Maybe he has.
But why does that preclude him from being a necessary part of Erica's journey?
Especially if she wants him to be?
How did you know when--when I was ready?
You knew.
And you let me know.
Thank you.
Fred?
Hey.
Cheers.
"So, what do they do to doctors who crash and burn?"
Same thing they do to doctors who quit.
I heard about that.
Yeah.
"Uh, not my finest moment."
Mmm.
"You know, this thing that we do, it's not easy."
No kidding.
I can't reach him.
I've tried everything I can think of.
Sometimes you need a little help.
I did.
"Yeah, well, no one's offered."
"Well, consider this an offer."
"Hey, I'm not saying it's gonna change anything,"
"But if you wanted me to,"
I'd be happy to give it a try.
"Maybe I should've listened to you, Seth, and done it the way you said."
"Come on, don't talk like that."
- We're gonna get you help.
- Seth.
"Seth, I can save him."
- No.
- He was right.
This world  ain't the same no more.
[laughs weakly]
I don't even know what that was.
Hey... hey.
I thought I could handle anything you two punks throw at me.
But I ca...
I can't dance on this dance floor no more.
"You were right, Seth."
Time for me to hang up my wingtips.
[sobbing] No.
"You two knuckleheads, you gotta promise me..."
You gotta take care of each other.
[exhales softly]
To Eddie Cruickshank.
Uncle Eddie.
Rest in peace.

"- Richard, say something."
- What do you want me to say?
I don't know.
"Something, anything."
He never got his Shangri-La.
"Son of a bitch would never admit it, but we had more in common than he knew."
"You know, from the moment he took us in, all I ever cared about was making sure he didn't regret it."
"Man, did I screw that up."
Don't get sore.
"Oh, I'm not sore."
I suppose it's natural for a chap to be a bit edgy before his first jump.
Is it?
Everybody is.
"It's nothing to do with, well, being frightened, you know?"
That's interesting.
"There, now you can stop worrying and relax."
It's a special I keep on one side.
It's the best chute I ever packed.
Good.
I wouldn't like to have to repack it on the way down.
"Hey, what's your name?"
Gardner.
What Gardner?
Just Gardner.
Working girls don't have Christian names.
I haven't seen you around.
I don't get around.
"Oh, officer material?"
I said we work here.
"On your way, Mr Maple Leaf."
"Left, right, left, right..."
Squad halt!
"One, two."
Fall out.
"Take the ropes, Corporal Dawes."
"All right, who's going to have the first go?"
No ugly rush now.
All right.
We'll have to pick out volunteers for the first stick.
"Canada, suppose you show us how it's done?"
Because my eyes are filled with someone else.
What are you smirking at?
Huh?
You are in serious trouble.
You're going to need fucking flippers... to wade through the shit you're in.
The lady was so upset...
I had to sack out on her couch.
Hysterical crying and shit.
"You know, I'll have to write this up."
You know that?
"Oh, yeah."
"Oh, yeah."
There was one time... me and my friend Dennis...
we were 8 or 9... we were in the front row of the grand stand... and I had a Coke in my hand.
And when I looked down...
"I mean, it was a direct hit."
And I said right there and then...
"I said, ""I'm going to live in one of these buildings... with a view like this."""
What?
You want to go inside?
Shh.
"Wait, wait, wait."
Open your eyes.
I want you to look at me.
My face is so fat...
I don't think Ray wants to sleep with me anymore.
I'm growing a mustache.
"No, it's the medication."
They're not here.
Ray took them to the movies.
"Look, come over."
I haven't felt this good in years.
"You'd think if it had been anybody else's dog,"
It'd have barked or done something.
"My god, the dog's a monster who must weigh 125 pounds."
"Boy, I'll tell you, I wouldn't want to try to strangle anybody"
With that critter around.
No one saw or heard anything?
"Uh, nothing."
It was a total blank.
And the guy was by myself for only three minutes or less.
We timed the trip back to the tennis court.
"Doc, are you absolutely sure he was strangled?"
You want to come see for yourself?
"Oh, no, no."
There is another thing.
The victim apparently fought back.
How is that?
The knuckles on his right hand were bloody.
"OK, Doc."
This one I've got to see for myself.
Let's go.

"Well, young man?"

"[clicks tongue] they didn't get along so well after, you know, the incident with... little tim."
- what happened with tim?
- [sighs]
"- hey, hey!"
what happened to tim?
- oh. oh. oh.
"so suddenly you care about tim, huh?"
- i've always cared about peepers!
- [sighs]
- what happened to my harley?
"- remember the phrase,"
"""i'd rather push a harley than ride a honda""?"
- yeah.
- that's for people who could afford them.
"you were too good to ride a honda, but too lazy to work to make the money to keep a harley."
"now, come on."
this is hurting me just as much as it hurts you.
- [sighs]
- makes me realize i was a bad mama.
"you never did learn how to cook, and wayne took to eating the pimento loaf at the dollar king all day long."
- dang.
wayne!
"[scoffs] wake up, you lard."
it's time for work!
- [sighs] it's christmas.
- so?
the dollar king ain't never closing!
- i quit.
- quit?
- Stop walking around on your leg.
- I'm fine.
What do we do next?
Just tell me what we do now.
Timetable updated.
We'll have you out of there in less than two hours.
Has everything been taken care of at your end?
I can't confirm that.
Is there a problem?
- No.
"- Get it done, immediately."
What?
Two hours.
This drilling is driving me nuts.
I wanna find David and Meredith.
You sure no one else could be in here?
- What?
- Nothing.
I was just thinking they wanted something in the broadcast room.
Gotta get over there.
- Think they got what they came for?
- Let's find out.
It's pretty standard activity.
Two broadcasts yesterday.
Three last night.
There's gotta be something.
What?
What do you got?
Fifteen broadcasts this afternoon.
What?
Just 20 minutes apart.
Whoever broke in here didn't do it to stop the broadcasts.
"- Write, I guess."
Write?
What about?
You've had no life!
"Anyway, it doesn't matter."
I don't want it anymore.
I didn't know you before.
You were just some bloke.
But now...
We're friends.
I think.
I don't want to do it.
The money's not important.
"It might not be to you, but it is to me."
I want some of that to go to Frances.
Ten grand.
"Look, Paul, son."
"If this weekend showed me anything, it's that I want some good to come of my passing."
"Now, if I jump from that bridge, the only thing I would've left behind was a traffic jam all the way up to the Angel."
This way...
I get to give something to me little girl.
That's something I wasn't able to do when I was alive.
And you'll get your money.
Everyone's a winner.
- Now that's how I want it.
"- For fuck's sake, I don't want the money!"
I'm an idiot.
I didn't think things through.
"It seemed like a good idea at the time, but it's not."
It's crazy.
I can't do it.
I won't.

"Well, your investigation."

Do you think I'm going to start investigating just because some bird smiles at me?
Who do you think I am?

"Good morning, Jerry."
Some things in people's homes ring continuously.
And some don't.
-Not with 10.2 million euro.
-Solenergi is the new oil.
They are doing groundbreaking research on nanocrystals.
They are close by cracking fourth generation code.
-It have I heard that before.
-I think it's worth checking.
"Leong, have I ever disappointed you?"
-I will send Degang.
"-No, I will go myself."
-I speak the language after all.
-Do you speak Norwegian?
"Yeah, I was born there."
-You have never told me.
You never asked.
All right.
Send me the numbers.
"And if I like them, you go in."
Do whatever you Vikings do.
-The press is waiting downstairs.
-Good.
I just want to coordinate a little with you first.
"I want us to tell them that we are dealing with new opportunities,  and we are optimistic."

"Someone called in the evening, but I said you were performing."
They didn't leave a message on your cell phone?

Won Kang Hwi was not a Hallyu star from the beginning.
Do you think people will believe this?
"No matter who looks at it, it is obvious that it is fake."
It is not fake!
I took it personally!
You went to Playground (Bar) yesterday.
Manager Kang said... &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;that you left with Kang Hwi.
"Still, if these photos are revealed, the blow will be severe."
"You know, don't you?"
I am close to Reporter Choi in Sports A.
Don't you remember who introduced you to Reporter Choi?
Jae Hee...  no Jong Chul!
"This business is not such an easy arena. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I don't expect anything big. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;The commercial that Won Kang Hwi is shooting again.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; If you hand it over to me, I'll keep my mouth shut.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
You should have chosen your opponent well.
Leave the originals behind  and get out immediately!
Do you know that Won Kang Hwi has a sponsor?
I mean it.
This was filmed yesterday at JY Hotel.
Check it out.
She lodged in the suite room.
That's enough.
Star Entertainment!
"Star Entertainment, on the condition that he brings Lee Tae Ik, proposed a huge contract fee to Won Kang Hwi."
Did you know that?
I also heard that personally.
I heard that you were dating a member of a girl group.
If you don't want to be no.

"- We actually position us as European, as international."
"Of course Europe is a very mature market in terms of internet, so we decided to adopt .eu as the main domain of the company."
"- We felt hat if there was a dot-EU, we should clearly be part of it. - .eu Is used because it is a European congress."
- Europe has become an open space in many ways.
"- We are in the European Union, ... yes?"
"Why not use .eu, we are European."
"- In Portuguese, EU spelled e-u, means ""I""."
"- I would say that we are a Portuguese company, but we are also a European company."
We are not a global company - yet.

THE ELUSlVE AVENGERS
"Based on "" Little Red Devils ""  by P. Blyakhin"
Screenplay by Sergey YERMOLlNSKY Edmond KEOSAYAN
Here's our token of appreciation from us to you.
Paul:
"Aw, thank you."
That's a beautiful knife.
"Diallo ""Torpedo:"" Read it."
"Rio ""Wolf:"" What's that say?"
"Diallo ""Torpedo:"""
What does it say?
Paul:
"It says, ""Prepared for life."""
"Diallo ""Torpedo:"""
"""Prepared for life."""
Paul: ...I'd like to think I was.
Paul:
I let my Scoutmaster down because I dropped out of
Scouting and it's a big regret for me now.
"But I came out here today, I felt like I've redeemed myself."
I think Scoutmaster McCauley would be proud of me.
I really think he'd be proud of me.
"In the last video, we set up this definite integral to evaluate the volume of the solid of revolution that we set up using the shell method."
"So now, let's just evaluate this thing."
So the main thing is just simplifying this expression.
I'll start off by trying to simplify this part of it.
So that's going to be y plus 1.
"I just ate an apple, so something weird just happened in my throat."
"But anyway, that's done with. y plus 1 minus y squared minus 2y plus 1."
I just expanded out this binomial.
And then that would simplify to-- another apple in my throat moment-- so that's going to be y plus 1 minus y squared plus 2y minus 1.
So this 1 and this negative 1 cancel out.
And let's see.
You get negative y squared plus 3y.
equation.
Do you know what that bunch of points will be?
It's a plane.
"If we have a linear equation, then,"
"fortunately, the graph of the thing, the plot of all the points that"
solve it are a plane.
These three points determine a
"plane, but your lecturer is not Rembrandt and the art is going to be"
the weak point here.
"So I'm just going to draw a plane,"
right?
There's a plane somewhere.
That's my plane.
That plane is all the points that solves this guy.
"Then, what about this one?"
Two x minus y plus zero z.
So z actually can be anything.
"Again, it's going to be another"
plane.
Each row in a three by three problem
gives us a plane in three dimensions.
So this one is going to be some
other plane -- maybe I'll try to draw it like this.
And those two planes meet in a line.
"So if I have two equations,"
"just the first two equations in three dimensions,"
those give me a line.
The line where those two planes
meet.
"And now, the third guy is a third plane."
And it goes somewhere.
"Okay, those three things meet in a point."
100 plus 20 plus 160 is equal to-- what's 50 times 8?
That's 400 plus 30 plus 10F.
What is this?
"2, 50 times 8."
"Right, that's 400."
"OK, this is 120 plus a 160 is 280."
"280 is equal to 430-- this is a good example-- plus 10F, I just realized."
Subtract 430 from both sides.
So what's 430 minus 280?
It's 150.
So it's minus 150 is equal to 10F.
So F is equal to minus 15 Newtons in the counterclockwise direction.
"So F is minus 15 Newtons in the counterclockwise direction, or it means that it is 15 Newtons."
"We assumed that it was in the counterclockwise direction, but when we did the math, we got a minus number."
[SNEEZE]
Excuse me.
I apologize if I blew out your speakers with that sneeze.
"But anyway, we assume it was going in the counterclockwise direction, but when we did the math, we got a negative number, so that means it's actually operating in the clockwise direction at 15 Newtons at a distance of 10 from the moment arm."
"Hopefully, that one was less confusing than the last one."
"So let me do another problem, and these actually used to confuse me when I first learned about moments, but in some ways, they're the most useful ones."
So let's say that I have some type of table.
I'll draw it in wood.
It's a wood table.
That's my table.
"And I have a leg here, I have a leg here."
Let's say that the center of mass of the top of the table is here.
It's at the center.
And let's say that it has a weight.
It has a weight going down.
What's a reasonable weight?
Let's say 20 Newtons.
It has a weight of 20 Newtons.
"This challenge tests skills for rifle shooting, pioneering, and first aid merit badges."
There are three tasks.
One... ...hit three targets at a 22-rifle range.
"Two, complete the fourth wall of a pioneering tower."
From the top of this tower... ...shoot a slingshot... ...and hit three targets to retrieve this map.
"Three, follow the map to Lake Ida, then handle a life-threatening situation."
"Paul, you and Will are up on the rifle range first."
Go ahead and take your spots and we'll get started.
"Keegan ""Yeti:"" Get him Big South"
"Will ""Big South:"" All right."
"All right, you guys."
Paul:
I am determined to win this competition.
"I, I want this bad."
And I really hope that my Scoutmaster... ...gets to see me do the best that I can.
Somebody's going to have to cut off one of my limbs to stop me from winning.
"Will ""Big South:"" Honestly, I think the targets are kind of big."
"So I think this is a matter... of speed, and who gets it off first."
NARRATOR:
All right.
Eyes and ear protection are on both.
Rounds are being chambered.
Will is sighting in.
Stand by.
"Three, two, one, commence firing."
And Will has a miss on his first target.
Paul:
I hit something.
NARRATOR:
Paul's first shot takes down his target.
"All right, Will takes down his target."
Paul is sighting in on his second target.
"I could compare the process of  goal-setting with a matrioshka: one goal in another, and so they go on; there are many of them, they accumulate."
"And paradoxically in contrast with  this Russian doll, there is not always reduction of size, they could be of the same size."
But they are inserted in one another  and overflow from each other.
The second very important thing:  museum process and museum activity are more important then the final result.
"We don't seek this result  but we go forward to it, always by making goal-setting."
"And finally, the most important resource for museum activity which is not always estimated and used  is cooperation."
"It is a valuable resource  which needs much openness and, believe me, really less money."
So my appeal to the community:
Let's become more complex!
(Applause)

"Hey Donovan, do you have anything to drink?"
[Donovan]
"Yeah, in the fridge."

"Hey Josh, grab me a glass of ""melk""."

"They don't have any ""melk"", but I can get you some milk."
[Donovan]
That's what he just said.
[Julian]
"Yeah, I just want some ""melk""."
[Josh]
"Nah, you're saying it wrong."
"You're saying ""melk""."
Like it's a disease.

"- No, Your Honor."
- Very well.
"Excuse me, Your Honor... ...but the jury would like to make a recommendation... ...regarding the sentence."
- Objection.
"Sit down, counselor."
"It's only a recommendation, and I would like to hear it."
We recommend a sentence of time served.
I'll accept that.
"You are guilty, Father Moore."
And you are free to go.
- This court is dismissed.
- All rise.
Thank you.
"Well, you shocked us all."
Everyone at the firm sees this as another victory.
The archdiocese is pleased.
They feel the trial has raised public interest in the Church.
Have you seen the news?
"There's our priest, leaving the courthouse a free man... ...right next to you."
Just like James Van Hopper.
"All right, I'll say it."
I was wrong.
But I'm ready to make it right.
I'm offering you a full partnership in the firm.
Keep it.
Will you be able to return to your parish?
I can't go back.
Not now.
Once you've looked into the darkness... ...I think you carry it with you for the rest of your life.
What about you?
I believe you've seen the darkness too.
I don't know.
"Let's go, aunty."
I welcome you on behalf of the Delhi Citizens Committee.
And I request the chief guest to start the function.
In today's function we have gathered to congratulate... ... those brave young pilots... ...who have risked their lives for their country.
And in the process they have set such standards of bravery... ... that every citizen of India is proud of them.
The State has already honoured them and will continue to do so.
But I believe that there is no greater award... ... than the love and good wishes of the people.
The first name in the list of award winners is...
You're surprised because you've seen flight lieutenant Arun Varma.
You look like Arun Varma.
I am his son.
Arun Varma died...
I shall tell you everything after the function.
But permit her presence here when I receive the medal.
You mean...
The person because of whom this day is a part of my life.
She's responsible for what I am and for the award that I'm receiving.
Please permit her to be a part of this happy moment of my life.
I would consider it the greatest honour.
I would also like to meet this person.
Please call her.
Mother...
"Come here, mother."
"Go, Vandana."
Suraj is calling you.
Me?
"- Yes, mother."
I am calling you.
Did you tell Suraj everything?
"No, a son has recognised his mother."
Go.
"Come, mother."
Is me.
Sing your song at the beep.
"Hi, M.J."
This is Peter.
I was on my way to your show and...
"Well, I was on my bike..."
Are you there?
I really was planning on it all day.
And... ...I know you predicted I'd disappoint you.
Bingo.
"Is amazing, isn't it?"
How complicated a simple thing... ...Iike being someplace at 8:00 can become.
"Actually, there was this obnoxious usher."
"Somebody has to talk to that usher, M.J."
Your time has expired.
Please deposit 50 cents for the next five minutes.
I wanna tell you the truth.
Here it is.
I'm Spider-Man.
"Weird, huh?"
Now you know why I can't be with you.
"If my enemies found out about you... ...if you got hurt, I could never forgive myself."
I wish I could tell you how I feel about you.
Ladies and gentlemen... ...my wife Rosie and I would like to welcome you this afternoon.
"But first, before we start... ...has anybody lost a large roll of 20-dollar bills in a rubber band?"
Because we found the rubber band.
Is a terrible joke.
But thank you for coming.
Today... ...you will witness the birth of a new fusion-based energy source.
"Safe, renewable energy and cheap electricity for everyone."
And now let me introduce my assistants.
These four actuators were developed and programmed... ...for the sole purpose of creating successful fusion.
That's what we've got to do.
"Now, some of you aren't in the optimal position to hit the"
lattice.
I invite you to come down and get a little closer.
That is okay.
"Now, are you roughly ready?"
Yeah.
All right.
But there is one other piece of information that is very important that I have got to tell you.
And that is that only fools aim for their chemistry professor.
[LAUGHTER]
"Okay, go to it."
Watch your ball.
Okay.
Have all the alpha particles been launched?
Yes.
Fantastic.
All right.
Now comes the moment of truth.
How many of you had an alpha particle that backscattered?
"Okay, so now I've got to count."
Keep your hands up because there are some lights that make it a little hard for me to see.
Anybody in this section here?
Yes.
"One, two, three, four, five."
Six.
Anymore?
Did I get everybody?
That's it?
Six alpha particles that backscattered.
"Okay, so now we have to calculate some probabilities here."
The probability of backscattering is the number that backscattered.
All of us.
[Julian]
"No, we are not filming something like that."
[Josh]
Why not?
[Julian]
It's so dark.
I don't know.
(Signing softly to the cat)
"Josh I need to call you back, man."
I'm really busy.
(Gunshot)
Hi today I am going to tell you about three different kinds of pasta.
The first pasta I am going to tell you about is capellini.
"CAP-A-LEAN-E, also known as angel hair."
This pasta is long and thin.
The second pasta I am going to tell you about is spaghetti.
"SPA-GET-EE, spaghetti is similar to capellini in that it is long and thin, but it is a little bit thicker than capellini."
The third pasta I am going to tell you about is linguini.
LlN-GEEN-EE.
Linguini also means little tongues.
Linguini is flat and long and thin.
So next time you're ordering pasta you will know just what to ask for.

Don't do anything to give them a reason to make it an issue.
It's my rightful duty to see you twice a day.
"You still don't call me ""mother""."
It seem like you are spying on me.
You are making me very uncomfortable.
What do you mean by spying?
You still don't have a heir and have not gotten a concubine  either.
Others are saying I am making you this way.
I'm just sorry for the one who has already passed.
There isn't any other reason.
"Although I am your new mother,  you must understand that I still care for you."
"Then, please seek out for a new candidate for the queen's position."
I will start seeking a new queen.
Who's out there?
"My prince, please, come in."
"Oh, my prince."
How...How can you...How can you do this to me?
"Oh, my prince."
How...How can you...How can you do this to me?
It's very late.
Let's go inside first.
Didn't you promise me already?
"Yes, I have promised you."
But I could not go against palace instruction...
Why?
Did she say that she doesn't want me?
Please let's step inside first...
Tell her to come out.
Very well.
Tell her to come out.
Very well.
"Needless to say, camel blood is different."
The red blood cells are oval-- not round like a human's.
When water rushes in... the cells of most species rupture if they swell past 150%.
Camel cells can increase 240% without bursting.
A camel may drink more than a third of its body weight as it rehydrates.
In lands barren and inhospitable as any on the planet... camels do more than survive.
They race.
[gunshot]
[camels groaning]
Camels can hit speeds of 25 miles an hour.
The races are big business in the Middle East.
Racing stables in search of breeding stock import wild camels all the way from Australia.
"When it comes to survival in the desert, the camel wins by a nose."
Our first two animals survive storms at sea... and on land.

A storm in the desert.
Short.
Violent.
Sand soaks up rain slowly.
So water falls off hills.
Flash flood!
You can run... but you can't hide.
"In the desert, floods soon subside."
"For the animal crawling into number 8, the water is both life and death."
Desert ants make the most of the flood.

"In the Amazon, there are two seasons."

This number line counts by tens.
We have two hundreds; there's the number two hundred.
"Five tens, hmmm... there's different ways we can do that."
Let's just count by tens.
"Ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty."
"Five tens and three ones; not three jumps, but three small ones."
"One, two, three, and we're at two hundred fifty three."
Let's try two hundred fifty three again because there are a number of ways we can do this.
"Again, our number line is counting by tens."
"We're going to start at two hundred, but this time instead of five tens,  let's do one jump of fifty."
"So, we're at two hundred fifty."
"We need three ones, one, two, three, and we're at two hundred fifty three."
"In this lesson you have learned  how to show numbers on a number line by thinking about hundreds, tens, and ones."

"We have not one, but two special guests for you today."
"We've got Julie Klausner, author of the book, ""I Don't"
"Care About Your Band,"" and host of ""The Hit"", and one of my favorite podcasts, ""How Was Your Week?"""
"And if you've listened to ""How Was Your Week?"" Then you've heard the theme song by funny man and indie punk rock legend"
"Ted Leo, who's also here."
"We're going to be playing lots of games, including another round of Fuck, Marry, Kill."
You know how it goes.
"Three names, you know."
Give us some suggestions for that in the chat.
We'll use them.
"First, though, I want to talk about chairs."
"You're going to lift one hand and one foot, tap."
"Then the other hand and the other foot, tap."
So see how the both come up and down at the same time?
I want you to try it.
OK ready?
Great job!
OK we're going to put one foot on the line here and put this foot on the carpet.
And we're going to put our hands on our hips and we're going to walk and put one foot in front of the other.
"OK we're going to come over and put one foot on the balance beam hands on our hips, and we're going to look at the target in front of us."
We're going to lift this foot behind us with our toe pointed towards the ground and you're going to stand on the balance beam on one leg until I tell you to stop.
OK?
Ready?
Begin.
Stop.
Good.
Thank you.
We're going to try this activity one more time.
I just want to make sure you keep that one leg up behind you and look at the target until I say stop.
OK?
Ready?
Begin.
Stop.
Thank you.
We're going to come over and we're going to bring this leg up behind us again with our hands on our hips and we're going to jump.
You're going to jump on the end of the line here until I say stop.
OK?
Ready?
Begin.
And stop.
You're going to catch it after it bounces once OK?
Like that.
You're going to catch the ball with two hands until I say stop.
-Soft taco.
-[Elmo voice]:
Soft taco.
With sour cream and a Pepsi.
"-I want a chalupa, with no lettuce or tomato."
-A little chalupa.
No lettuce or tomato
And I need a number nine again with no sour cream.
"-Yeah, well, that's not a bad Elmo impression."
"Yeah, the video's funny, it's a decent prank I admit it."
"The video's now at over a 100,000 views and it's gaining fast."
"But you know, my question is, what the f--k is Elmo doing at Taco Bell?"
"I always just assumed that Elmo was on a strict diet of, you know, sunshine and unicorn meat."
"But no, he apparently eats the sh--ty Mexican food that even real Mexicans don't even eat."
"Now if you listen closely at the end of the video, you can actually hear the cashier laughing."
-Elmo needs lemonade.
-Lemonade?
"-Yes, ma'am."
-[laughs]
-Let's be honest.
The cashier finds it funny.
She's probably high too.
You know this is probably the best thing to happen to a Taco Bell worker since that f--king chihuahua died.
"Yeah, I do have one criticism though."
"You know, Elmo's a Muppet and it would've been ten times funnier if another Muppet had answered back like,"
"""Uh, this is Kermit the Frog here and you need to take your punk-ass back to Burger King."""
"Or, if Liza Minnelli worked there and was suddenly like,"
-Balls to you!
-But I didn't order any balls.
"Well, you're getting 'em."
But you know what probably did order balls?
"The comment question of the day, which comes from a user named, bam!, and he said..."
"You could have dropped me by the subway, you didn't listen to me and got stuck in this traffic down the drain."
"Oh , don't prolong it.-You 'il miss your lesson."
I still have time.
I will take you to your neighborhood... and I will also see the place where you lived.
There is nothing to see...
"I mean, you can't look at things there as you look to an aquarium. .."
what sort of a man are you?
You take out your spines right away..
Do I want to look at your life as one looks an aquarium?
Is that the way you see me?
No... of course not..
Last night I told you my secrets.
"I put my head on your shoulder, I trusted your sincerity."
"Should I think "" I wonder if..."""
Okay i am sorry... - But you are are doing it always. .
"Whenever I want to come close to you, you push me away.."
Last night it happened the same way...
"Why do you hide yourself so much, I don't understand."
I mean what are you afraid of?
You put on your armor right away!
Why are you afraid?
What harm can I do to you?
Get out of the car then!
"Get out, if you don't want my friendship, don't look at my face from now on."
What's all this now?
"Ok, come on, let's go, I will show you every place, but you won't insist saying:"
"""I will see your home"""
Why can't I see your home?
Because I want to forget the way to it too!
Don't you miss your mom?
I will get out! &amp;gt; Okay!
There left..
On my wife's advice.
Look.
My first premium was for 1501 rupees..
There's a well-known temple in the South.
I paid it there.
"Then, I've been paying 1000 rupees every year.. ..at Lord Ganesha's stall."
It's called a mandap.
"And, your honour, my mother-in-law used to be very sick."
"So, the temple authorities said, "" Pay us 11,000.. """
""" ..perform a veneration and watch the miracle "" ."
We performed the veneration and my mother-in-law passed away.
"That was a good thing, but I also lost 11,000."
And they didn't refund a single rupee.
"And then, donation at the mosque.. ..blanket at the shrine, candle at church, alms for beggar.. ..incense sticks, veil for Mother Goddess."
ln total I've paid around 10 lakhs in all these stores.
Enough!
Enough!
Don't call it a store.
It's called a temple.
And people donate willingly at the temple.. ..for the peace and prosperity of their family.
Even I gave this amount.. ..for the peace and prosperity of my family.
And not for fun.
But your God snatched all the peace from my life.
Because only God can cause earthquakes.
Humans cannot do it.
"So tell me, don't I've a right to ask God for compensation?"
Mr. Kanji.
"You've a tiff with God, don't you?"
- Yes.
So why don't you ask Him directly for compensation?
Why are you asking the temples?
Which company supplies electricity to your home?
1 cup of sugar.
1 cup of corn.
"In a cup, you measure a finger of oil."
And dye.
The color that you like.
This is optional.
If you don't have an popcorn maker.
"You can do this in any pan, just need to cover with a lid."
Add sugar.
Water.
Oil.
And corn.
Also add a little bit of dye.
"Well guys, when the popcorn start to popping."
It's just pay attention and mix.
"It takes a while anyway, because it will still make syrup."
Don't worry.
And this is result of our popcorn.

Thanks for watching.
I'm here today representing a team of artists and technologists and filmmakers that worked together on a remarkable film project for the last four years.
And along the way they created a breakthrough in computer visualization.
So I want to show you a clip of the film now.
Hopefully it won't stutter.
"And if we did our jobs well, you won't know that we were even involved."
Voice (Video):
I don't know how it's possible ... but you seem to have more hair.
Brad Pitt:
Chandra:
"So, do they ask you then?"
I'll make it clear.
It's before we start dating.
They'll know that I'm an asexual person.
"And I'll make it clear when we're, you know, when we're still in the friend stage."
Elisabeth:
Do they see it as a challenge?
"Do they think, ""Well, I'm gonna get him to be sexual."" ?"
[laughter]
David:
"A couple people have, but it hasn't worked out."
Star:
"So, do you not have sex?"
"I mean, do asexual people not have sex at all?"
No sexual contact?
David:
"There's a couple of aexual people who, kind of as a compromise because they're in a relationship with sexual people."
It's not like a code.
It's not like we kick you out or something.
Joy:
"Well, let me ask you something."
[laughter]
Do you ever have sex with yourself?
[laughter]
David:
It's a valid question.
[laughter]
"Perfectly, perfectly, valid question."
[applause]
Joy:
You may not be attracted to anyone else but that doesn't mean you're not attracted to yourself.
Tanning accelerator for the pastiest inner thighs on a planet?*
They don't make that.
Guess I'm standing here.*
"Mom, do you trust me?"
"Right I mean you think I have a good judgement, right?##"
"Well, you're smarter than I'm."
You've been telling that since your 4th grade.
"Great, can I get a tattoo"
No.
I'm not a totally square.
"Alright, last year when you wanted the magenta stripe in your bangs"
We've got this stripe.
"Yeah, and I hated this stripe because it turned on me."
I thought it was so daring and cool.
I showed up last year and everyone had color hair even the special-ed kids##
"No tatoos, Sam"
"No bikers named Satan showing up here asking for date, no Sam."
No
It's been two years mom.
You have to let go.
Dad wouldn't let you carry him around like this.
"You and your father having that discussion about tattoos, that's something I would like to have seen."
Yeah
"Come on, let's zip this sucker up"
You'll have a great time
Are you ready?
"Dear Diary, How many calories are in grape*?"
I gained 1.7 pounds this weekend.
"It was a box of rasin nuts, that Josh brought on Friday that did it."
I know it.
"He just stopped* holding my hand halfway through the movie and I crashed into into this total panic thinking he's disgustedby me, he's dumping me"
This is so stupid.
Gossip magazine:
Mister ASK left a broken heart behind him again.
Go straight on from here!
"We came until here but you didn't see anyone, if you want to meet any friend or something like that, I can wait or I can go..."
No thanks!
-Don't you have a friend or you don't want to meet with anyone?
I don't have friends.
To the left!
The guy from the meatballs place?
He is my brother's friend.
"Come on, jump out here!- Papa, at least you could drop me by the shop.."
Tell the master I will be back late from the test.
"I understood, you're going away again!"
"Man, get out, I am in a hurry.- Come on, go on, quick, quick.!"
Why did that boy upset you today?
He talked a bit rudely.
I don't like him that much.
Did he say something bad?&amp;gt; No.
Do you do it intentionally?&amp;gt; What?
"You say a thing, then you keep mum for a while.As if I make you talk by force."
You tell everything half...
It's because I have nothing to tell.
You saw my life... there is nothing else good except the meatballs.
You're doing an injustice.
"Err... you're not late for your lesson, are you?"
I still have time.
We fell again here...
"It's okay, no problem..."
Do you have lessons every weekday-Two days in a week.
There was a school you mentioned the other day... did you get an answer from it?
No Word from there.
But even if they don't accept me I won't be so surprised.
What happened?
What did they say? &amp;gt; Why? &amp;gt; Tell us Yaman!
Later.
"Come on,Mert!"
"What's happening?- I have something to do, I will solve it and be back."
Come on man!
You will take the exam.- I will come until then
"What can be more important than exam? &amp;gt; Yaman!- I will come, don't worry!"
Your exam is at 3 o'clock you have to be her at 2:30.
Can it be that the interview was bad?
Wait for me..
Subtitles brought to you by Ebb and Tide Team @ Viki
"Hello, can I come in?"
"Please Mr. Selim, you're welcome.- I won't take your time..."
I wanted to ask how was the interview?
Take a sit.
Don't say it wasn't brilliant.
"Actually as you said, Yaman is a very intelligent boy."
He shows this with the grades from the previous exams but...
"But... -I don't like these ""but-s"" at all ...by God,"
Really..- I don't think he is suitable for this school.
He is a tensed boy and I found him emotional too. which one of us wasn't like that in that age?
"Yaman is very intelligent, very wise and... hardworking..."
"A determined boy,"
I believe that if he has an opportunity he will be very successful .
Be sure..&amp;gt; You did what you could about him Selim.
After this he will find the opportunity for himself on his own.
According to the grade he will get in the last exam otherwise...
I don't even want to think about a contrary possibility!
Have an easy work!
"Master, I need 1000 TL urgently!"
1000 TL??- As an advance payment. you will cut it from my weekly salary.
Good catch.
"Alright, alright."
So now let's shift some stuff.
"Shift happens, you guys just deal with it."
"So here we go, shift to everybody."
Let's shift.
We're going to we're going to shift E2.
Ready?
We're going to make it back to E3.
I don't have enough time to do it.
Here's how it's going to work.
And let's just see if you.
Are chill with this?
"I grab the first one and -one components of u two and I should make it second to n com, second to n components."
Sorry.
That should be.
"So I take the first one through n minus one of e two and make it the second n component here, and then finish this off I take the last component of e two and make it."
The first component.
Of E3.
And I'm going to drop E3.
Right here and this is at one.
Go.
There it is.
"See that I just took this, shifted it up, dropped it down."
"Alright let's finish this off, let me take this row here, this E4 and I am going to shift it down one over here and I do this the following way."
"I say I'm going to make the vector E5 and the way this is worth the same way, two and one is equal to E4."
"And, the first component is the last component."
And I put this E5 right.
"Right over here no p5, p5, and this is at, minus then plus, plus one."
And if I spy that.
There it is.
This is the matrix we built in class.
"Okay, I'll sort of start it the"
"same way, say maybe 2x-y and maybe I'll take"
no zs as a zero and maybe a -x+2y and maybe a -z as a --
"oh, let me make that a minus one and, just for variety let me take,"
"-3z, -3ys, I should keep the ys in that line, and 4zs is, say, 4."
Okay.
That's three equations.
"I'm in three dimensions, x, y,"
z.
"And, I don't have a solution yet."
So I want to understand the
equations and then solve them.
Okay.
So how do I you understand
them?
The row picture one way.
The column picture is another very
important way.
"Just let's remember the matrix form,"
"here, because that's easy."
The matrix form -- what's our matrix A?
"Our matrix A is this right-hand side, the two and the minus one and"
"the zero from the first row, the minus one and the two and the"
"minus one from the second row, the zero, the minus three and the"
four from the third row.
So it's a three by three matrix.
"Three equations, three unknowns."
And what's our right-hand side?
"Of course, it's the vector, zero minus one, four."
Okay.
"So that's the way, well, that's the short-hand to write"
out the three equations.
The dad.
Good question.
What about the dad?
[ Silence ]
[ Inaudible ]
"Oh, come on."
I don't have to do all the talking.
Who would be-- who was the dad?
Something to do with the dad.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Maybe the baby was illegitimate. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Bingo.
Okay.
"So if the baby's illegitimate, who would the dad be?"
"And who would be mad at Lucy for having the baby with the dad? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; The wife [inaudible] &amp;gt;&amp;gt; The wife of the father, exactly."
Okay.
"So Lucy wasn't married, and the baby wasn't legitimate, and I went with her that day."
She-- we went and confronted the wife schoolteacher who happened to be the father of the baby.
"So Lucy took the baby; we walked to the other end of the village and she said, listen, I had this baby."
Your husband is the father.
We had an affair.
The affair is over.
I don't want him anymore.
"You know, the baby is an innocent."
So let's please all just get along.
And then she went back.
Did the baby get conjunctivitis anymore? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; No.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No.
Absolutely.
That was not a very serious illness.
But Ferdinand's was.
"He first had minor aches and pains, turned into a fever, got steadily worse, and into the second week he couldn't stand up."
The family was searching frantically for the witch that was causing his illness.
They were trying witch after possible witch after possible witch after possible witch.
"Now the kids get all excited and say ""Alright, I am going vegan!"""
And just God knows what they are telling the parents.
"If your diet consists of nothing but Oreos, Skittles, Airheads, Fritos,"
"Sour Patch Kids, and Big League Chew you are going to die."
This is not healthy.
I do not know if kids hear that.
"""I am going to live."""
"On a healthier note you have your scrambled eggs, I have my scrambled tofu."
Pancakes.
"You don't have to use cow's milk, use soy milk, oat milk , rice milk, almond milk, coconut milk, hemp milk."
Fruits and vegetables.
Spaghetti.
Pasta.
Refried beans.
"Even have vegan sour cream,"
"Guacamole, comes from the avocado."
Soy cheese.
Rice cheese.
They even have this magical cheese I'll get to in a sec.
Veggie burger.
Veggie dog.
"Cupcakes, they have egg replacer."
I think I got them here.
"So you can replace the eggs with bananas, applesauce even."
"You can use soy milk, oat milk, more flour, water."
Coconut milk ice cream.
One of the best ice creams in the world.
"Again, it's not healthy, but healthier than cow milk ice cream."
"I've always said to people, ""Wait a minute, if you can put a man or a woman on the moon, how hard is it to make a cheese that doesn't come from a cow, or a goat?"
"How is it hard to make a vegan cheese?"""
"Well, they heard me."
"This is called a Daiya cheese actually, and it's great thing."
"- I went to meet him, he didn't show."
"I called his office, I called his house."
Okay.
"Go to the hospital, ask around."
Somebody's gotta know where he is.
What the hell happened?
Tell Father Moore I'm sorry.
Tell him I know the demons are real and I admire his courage... ...for standing and speaking against them.
Tell him I know what they can do.
- Cartwright's dead.
- I heard.
Are you drunk?
"- Not yet, but I'm working on it."
- Have you seen this?
- What the hell were you thinking?
- Karl...
You told me you'd talk him out of testifying.
"Instead, you put on a freak show with taped demons... ...and a dead girl speaking in tongues... ...and your client testifies that the archbishop sanctioned the exorcism."
We'll be lucky if the archdiocese isn't named...
I had a doctor who was gonna corroborate.
"Besides that, Father Moore's testimony's crucial to his defense."
Did you forget the archdiocese is paying for this defense?
The archdiocese isn't on trial.
I swore an oath to do what's best for my client.
"Spare me the law school pieties, Bruner."
You cashed in your conscience at the door.
- People can change.
- Like James Van Hopper?
It's not over.
I can put Mr. Rose on the stand... ...to corroborate Father Moore about the exorcism.
And there are the girls.
"Her sister Alice, she saw part of it."
That's the least significant stage.
"What we make sure is that all these animals have been ""grass only"" for at least a year because we do buy some calves from places we're not sure how they're handled."
A lot of these are getting ready to go to slaughter.
"Yeah, twelve of them will go tomorrow."
And how old are those that are going?
They are probably 28 months.
They don't grow as fast as they would on grain.
On grain they would grow faster.
"But they don't require any tillage, and this whole thing works on real time solar energy."
You're seeing it here.
"There's no fertilizer, no tillage, no annuals."
And you're creating topsoil.
That's exactly right.
America needs more topsoil.
"Yes, you're exactly right,"
America needs more topsoil.
That's for sure.

My dear!
Why dont you please relent?
If you are angry you will not walk with me till the end
Will you drench me instead of being my umbrella
You are the rain who throws away the umbrella
When I look beyond the curtains .. ..
I found that my impression in your heart.
Since I know the value of love I did not forget like you.
He is always thinking about me but does not talk to me
Even a second lost will never come back
Bye.
"Hey, I am talking to you."
Why are you thundering?
Do you think I am afraid of you?
"Even if you thunder, eventually you have to come to me."
"Hey, I am talking to you."
Cant you hear?
Are you deaf?
Dont make such a fuss.
I know that you also want to speak to me.
You are only trying to placate your ego.
Come to me now.
"Hey rain, you were the witness when a big man promised me.. ..that he will keep me in his heart and my ring on his finger."
He kept the promise too.
I also promised that whenever you come I would hug him.
Should I not keep my promise now?
Even if he is angry with me I am going to hug him.
Venkat!
What is the use of killing a minion like you.
I am sparing your life.
Go and tell him that he cannot harm.. ..even a single strand of my hair.
"Uncle, why are you looking at me like that?"
And we'll have to pay the scrap dealer.. ..to have this cleared.
Why pay?
"We'll give him one of the broken idols.. ..and say "" It appeared from the ground in Amarnath "" ."
"What are you saying, brother-in-law?"
You'll soon be bankrupt.
Do you know the losses you've incurred?
40 lakhs.
Goods worth 25 lakhs bought on credit.. ..and 15 lakhs spent on renovation last month.
40 lakhs?
Where did you get that kind of money?
We borrowed a part of the amount by mortgaging the house.
And I borrowed 10 lakhs from a friend.
And 5 lakhs from your own pocket.. ..for earning 18% interest.
"Pravin, you fool."
You didn't even ask me.
How will we arrange for such a huge sum?
There's hardly 30-40 thousand in the bank.
And we don't even have jewellery.
Sushila.
We'll manage.
- How?
Why don't you understand?
lf you hadn't spoken ill about the Lord.. ..He wouldn't have caused this earthquake.
His justice is silent.
Will you please stop preaching?
"You mean to say, that the Lord.. ..who doesn't exist, razed down my shop.. ..because I spoke ill about Him?"
"So, just to prove Himself.. ..he razed down just my shop in a fit of rage."
And if I still don't believe in Him.. ..he will make me incur more losses?
- Yes.
What yes?
I still don't believe in You?
I haven't incurred any loss.
You know what I'm saying?
We're going by the lyrics.
"Although you may want to wrench your fingers from embarrassment, you have to."
"Now we'll be filming the scene of where I reminiscence about a ""Coffee Shop"""
I say this a lot but acting is very difficult and it doesn't match well with me...
I think that's what it is.
But today's weather is great.
"Wait, no it's not."
I didn't realize because of my sunglasses.
Anyway I have to film the scene where I'm reminiscing about an ex-girlfriend.
But people are staring so I'm embarrassed.
"Still, I gotta try my best."
"Today is the day before the last day of filming for ""Coffee Shop""."
Tomorrow is the last day and today is the day before that.
Many passerby's are taking photos of us.
It feels strange and interesting.
I like it.
I like it a lot.
There isn't much time until we go back.
Tomorrow is the last day of shooting and we leave the day after that.
I want to enjoy NY more while I'm here.
There hasn't been enough time to look around.
What do you want to do?
Me?
Just walking around here a little bit would be fantastic.
"You have a lot of time, walk around."
I'm done filming.
I feel down.
I'm wearing my own gear today

Answer me.
Why don't you speak?
- I'm speaking so loudly. . . and you say I'm not speaking?
You have fallen in love.
- Wish what you are saying was true.
"But no, I have not fallen in love."
"Pitambar, he is not telling you, but me and Shalu."
"Oh, so you were talking to these two and I was interrupting . . . and adding to the confusion?"
But what were they doing?
"We have never done it, so how do we know? and reached the garden so soon."
- And will reach marriage stage soon.
"But remember, no kiss, no risk."
"Sir, the information is confirmed."
The diamond dealing will be done in Hotel Blue Diamond's swimming pool.
"Sir, the diamonds are worth 100 million rupees."
Which police officer has been given the responsibility of such a big case?
"Sir, a very capable officer, Inspector Gorpade."
Gorpade?
The one who could not attend the meeting of his own case. . . how will he nab the culprits?
"Sir, agreed that you and Gorpade don't share a good relationship."
That doesn't mean you don't consider him capable of any job.
Even he has solved many big cases.
Is it?
"Gentlemen, what time was this meeting scheduled?"
I was trying to find something that didn't look quite so horrible.
Just a second here.
"Here, we'll just do this."
- Not much better.
"- OK, OK."
Everybody is a fricking art critic.
"- If you wanted ugly discussions, this is the slide for you."
- Hold that.
I can't do this.
"Oh, oh no."
This is like way more than my French can handle.
You can deal with the blue.
I'm sorry.
I can read cereal boxes and soup cans but....
I decided it will be a fiery topic.
It makes spaghetti bindings.
"- I use it a lot, but it still can make spaghetti bindings."
"- We validate that, by the way, now."
"- [indecipherable] ""bindings are spaghetti [indecipherable] ""?"
- We validate.
"Even the bindings part, oddball expression."
"At least, it might be spaghetti, but we'll tell you if you have a bogus binding in the middle."
"Personally, I like WOOgnl, we use it all the time."
But I've talked to some people who thought it was harmful.
- I feel bad every time I use it.
"But yeah, we use it, definitely."
"- Just wash your hands afterwards, and everything will be fine."
Right?
I think that's it.
"Thank you, everybody."
The Hungarian Association for Free Birth Choices presents:
Csaba Madarász
"Keep in mind how many times he threw up and then, tell the doctor."
Hold on.
Then call the ambulance.
"This is 119, right? after that.."
Bring him to Parang University Hospital.
He's an elementary school student.
I'll get there as soon as possible.
Oh Ha Ni..
Take care of Eun Jo.
It's a type of intestinal obstruction.
An intussusception has occurred in the affected region.
An intussusception?
"It's when part of the intestine folds into another part, sort of like a collapsible telescope."
It's pretty far in so we must operate on it immediately.
Surgery?
Complications can arise due to a perforated intenstine so you need to hurry and make a decision.
But....
What to do?
"It's not a serious surgery. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Oh Ha Ni, take care of Eun Jo."
I understand.
Begin the surgery.
You came?
Yes.
Eun Jo is having surgery.
I heard about it.
How did it go?
It was as I had thought.
His intestine was folded into itself.
Did the surgery end?
"Yes, it went well, you don't have to worry."
"A part of his intestine was folded into the bottom of it, so we opened up his stomach,"
And returned it to normal.
What okay?
"It's not , far from it."
What's all this hurry to achieve your interests from every opportunity?
What does that mean madam?
We didn't do anything yet.- Sequestration officers are here.
How do you know?&amp;gt; I know.
What's happening Selim?
Can something like this happen?
You brought the officers to our door without notifying us.
"Just a minute, I am the representative of the claimant, Mr. Umit didn't demand me for something like this."
"The claimer is Safet Orhun, not Mr. Umit."
"Mert, you go, I will come after."
Can I take a look to the documents?
:
"I am saying there is a mistake in this issue, why don't you listen?"
Is there any news from your brother?
"Don't worry,"
This issue will be solved today.
It's not my trouble.
If there is no money there won't be a sick certificate either.
Then you will be moved to prison way.
OK...
I said I would find it.
It will come today.
We will see.
Did he enter inside?-Yes he did.
Why did you choose this school?
Because I want to have a good education.
"Can you define ""Good"" to us?"
"How, in the lexical meaning? &amp;gt; No, no..."
"What do you mean when you say ""Good education"", I am curious about that."
Good.... promising in every way.
Wave to each other.
How many work with young people outside of school settings?
"Ah, yes, wave to each other."
How many would like to be working with young people?
(Laughter) Alright.
How many of you are parents?
Look at that.
"Alright, I work with young people who have dropped out of the school systems."
"People from low income background,  ages 16 to 24."
"And what they say to us in the Youth Build program as they come into, is,"
"""They didn't care about us in school."
"Nobody cared about me."""
"So, I just want to say, from all  of young people in Youth Build, tens of thousand have been in Youth Build, who have experienced good teachers as I think most of you probably are."
I know that you've started-
"Jon, your blessing to them was very appropriate- you started your career because you want to make a difference, I know that."
"From all the young people in Youth Build who know the teaching makes a difference,"
"I am standing for them to say thank you  very much, it does make a difference."
I am bringing some voices of some young people I work with.
"There are 3.5 million young people  who are between ages 16 to 24, who are out of school, out of work and raised in lower income communities."
"Here is one of them, Mike Dean."
"Well, so much for order."
(Laugh)
I am OK.
(Laughter)
Mike's is in here somewhere.
Staplers are very useful.
(Laughter)
Mike says:
"""I've never had an easy year growing up in Columbus, Ohio."
I lived in a drug-infested home  without a father.
My neighborhood was drown  in confusion and negativity.
The lack of positive goals and dreams led me to a life of crime.
I will come with you to Rome
But I want something in return
"Anything, I can be very generous"
Let my son rule Egypt
"Not for the moment, no"
Then let me give Antony an Egyptian burial
"Here, in this place"
"Then I will come to you as the Queen of Egypt, bowing to the might of Rome"
Very well
I'll need time to prepare
And the emblems of my office?
"Of course, you can have them I have no use for them"
I have what I want
Make sure she doesn't harm herself
"Wait for me, Antony"
I won't be long
Where is our Queen?
What have you done with her?
"Why weren't you here to protect me, Rufio?"
"I regret that it was not possible, Your Majesty"
We need to be alone to pray
Away from Roman eyes
I'm afraid I can't allow that
You should know our ways by now
Don't you trust me?
I've trusted you all these years
Where is our Queen?
What have you done with her?
We want our Queen!
We want our Queen!
"Open the doors, Your Majesty!"
Open them now... or I'll have to break them down!
This is step 2.
"OK, what is this?"
"In the figure above, three wires are braided."
"That is, by starting in the order A, B, C--"
"OK, so this is A, B, C-- and then the order changes to B right, because the yellow line is B-- A, C."
"And then we get B, C, A. Right?"
"There's just the order of the strings, left to right."
"Or the braids, or the wires."
OK.
"That is start with the order A, B, C, the outer left wire is brought over wire B, right?"
"This is brought over wire B, to the middle position forming the order shown in step 1."
"Than the outer right wire C, this one, is brought to the new middle position shown in step 2 and so on."
Alternately bringing each new left and each new right wire to the middle.
"At what numbered step does the braid first repeat the original order A, B, C?"
"So what you do is, you first bring the left over the middle, then you bring the right over the middle, then you bring the left over the middle, then you bring the right over the middle."
"So at step 3, what do we have to do?"
So step 1 we brought the left over the middle.
"So we went from A, B, C."
You essentially switch the left and the middle.
"And then step 2, you switch the right and the middle."
"So step 3, we switch B and C again."
Because we're back on the left-hand side.
"So you get C, B, A."
"And then step 4, you're going to switch to the right-hand side."
Step 3 we switched these two.
"Now step 4, we're going to switch these two."
"So you get C, A, B."
"Then in step 5, we're back switched on this side."
"So then you get A, C, B."
"And then step 6, you're going to switch to the right-hand side again."
"So you get A, B, C."
"So by step 6, we repeat."

What is your domain?

Very beautiful
Have you worked in places other than Istanbul?
He worked in so many locations that we forget the number
My mother is right
But the last location would be Istanbul
I mean this is what it looks like
I'm going to see Nakiye
"I didn't expect to get to know you in such occasion, Mr. Murat you can call me Murat only"
Do you have a fiancee? mom what kind of question is this? not yet for now
What are you doing here?
What do I do I could not eat in front of them
My head is spinning from hunger you too take one
It's really very delicious
How did it turn out that delicious with all the rush ..
I don't know does it need more salt?
"No, it is perfect"
Look at what I'm doing?
I'm eating dolma with you
What's happening inside
They're gazing at each others wondering what to talk about they didn't ask for my hand yet?
Did he abandon me? he didn't..
Everyone is waiting for the coffee Nakiye
Am I to prepar it? don't drive me crazy Nakiye.. of course you'll prepare it.. who will?
I am in shock Mrs. Nesrin
Thank you all
An good evening to you all.. bye bye get up again .. again ..
Again
See they want us to sing again
No again
That's what linear dependency means.
That one of them can be represented as a scalar multiple of the other.
"Well if this is true, then I can just substitute this back in for vi."
And what do I get?
I get c times vj-- which is just another way of writing vi because I assumed linear dependence.
That dot vj has got to be equal to 0.
This guy was vi.
This is vj.
They are orthogonal to each other.
But this right here is just equal to c times vj dot vj which is just equal to c times the length of vj squared.
And that has to equal 0.
They are orthogonal so that has to equal 0.
Which implies that the length of vj has to be equal to 0.
"If we assume that this is some non-zero multiple, and this has to be some non-zero multiple-- I should have written it there-- c does not equal 0."
Why does this have to be a non-zero multiple?
Because these were both non-zero vectors.
This is a non-zero vector.
So this guy can't be 0.
This guy has length 1.
"So if this is a non-zero vector, there's no way that I can just put a 0 here."
Because if I put a 0 then I would get a 0 vector.
So c can't be 0.
"So if c isn't 0, then this guy right here has to be 0."
And so we get that the length of vj is 0.
Which we know is false.
The length of vj is 1.
This is an orthonormal set.
The length of all of the members of B are 1.
So we reach a contradiction.
This is our contradiction.
Vj is not the 0 vector.
It has length 1.
Now I am employed.
As a driver?
To 25 lorries.
I am a supervisor.
"10,000 salary."
Is it enough to feed your daughter?
"I can earn 10,000 in one day if luck smiles at me."
"Do you see, because I said those words that day.. ..he became determined and got a job."
I know that you are capable.
But you need a little push.
I have given green signal to your love.
What are you doing?
Take my son-in-law inside.
I will order to print the wedding cards.
But there is a small problem.
My scooter is not starting.
Can you order to drop me since you are not the driver?
"No need, I will take my way."
Stop wearing a girls dress and.. ..let your beauty be magnified by a saree
Dont jump like a small girl and.. .. let me tie you down with a nuptial not
let me reach you quickly and.. ..let us fulfill our naughty desires hold this beauty in your embrace
"see this, how can I stop the youth.. .. when the my heart became an enemy"
Why should we feel lonely.. .. when we have each others company
Accept me as your bride
Drive away your shyness and repay this sweet debt
The girl is very delicate.
How can I touch her
It is difficult to remain alone at this age
"Here I am, twist around me"
Fulfill my desire by owning me
Hi!
How are you?
Really?Tell whether the allegations are true !
"You stole a truck,didn t you?"
"Okay, I understand... we have decided tobring Mahir Karato trial,"
He will remain in hospitaluntil it recovers and then we will take himto prisonuntil the next hearing.
You can go out .
"I could startwith the caseyou were talking about with Mr. Prosecutor,"
So Icould prove...
For this person who is on trial for murderand risks to be sentenced to death...
What? ?
Who do you think you are ?Huh?
Who do you think you areto be able to search for such an important case?
"One of the most important figuresin this country, was killed... killedMy friend and colleague..."
"Do not you ever playwith something about which you have no idea,and want to prove ityou are smart!"
Do you understand?dont Do it again!
Did you knowState Prosecutor?
Do you have any ideawho could kill him?
You with your level of knowledgeyou want to solve it ?!
"Boss,we have not found it yet."
"We've searched,but nothing. he fellinto a black hole!"
He fell!- And then what?
"But we""il find him"
"he can not escape. you will turn everything upside down until you find him,don""t you?"
"Behold, the warrior, you find Ibo or I'll kill you all."
"Now I have somewhere to go,I leave you all to worry about it ."
"All right, boss."
Brother...once again we go back...
Feride hasclose all the doorsfor me and my father...
"She'll hang my father,and throw me in jail..."
"Feride has decided,I know that."
"We'll find a way,do not worry."
"There is no moreno way,bro..."
Just one...
David:
"Over 6,000."
Elisabeth:
"Over 6,000?"
"So, there are plenty of people, um, experiencing this as well, like you do"
"So, can you just explain for everybody exactly what being an asexual actually means and how it is to live that way?"
David:
An asexual person is someone who doesn't experience sexual attraction.
David:
"So, the way that, you know, most sexual people walking down the street and you see someone or you're in a relationship with someone at some point, you feel like introducing sexuality into that."
That just never happens to asexual people.
Joy:
And is it a problem?
David:
"No, it's not a problem."
Joy:
"So, then, why do you need to organize?"
[laughter]
David:
There's a lot of things that are not a problem that you can organize around.
"We need to organize, well, partially, because it's not getting talked about."
"Because, um-"
Star:
"If you're not talking about sex, what's there to talk about?"
[laughter]
Joy:
Thank you!
[laughter]
Star:
"I mean, I don't understand."
[laughter]
David:
It depends what this bx term does.
"But if we look at the choices, the only choice that intercepts the y-axis below the x-axis at a negative y-intercept and opens down is choice A."
"There's only three choices that open down, and only choice A intercepts in the negative area, so the answer is A."
"It actually looks eerily like what I drew, just out of the blue."
Next question.
Problem number 12.
"OK, so they drew a square."
"And I will draw a square, because they drew a square."
"And they say this is A, this is B, this is C, D."
And this is P.
This is Q.
And out here is R.
"I don't know where this problem's going, but it looks interesting."
"Figure not drawn to scale, of course."
"In the figure above, ABCD is a rectangle, with"
BC is equal to 4.
AB is equal to 6.
"P, Q, and R are different points on a line, not shown, that is parallel to AD."
"So P, Q, and R are apparently all on the same line that is parallel to AD."
"Well, I guess that is the way they drew it."
So let me erase.
Let's just say this is Q.
That R is down here.
This isn't R.
So they're all on the same line.
"And they say the line isn't shown, but it's parallel to AD."
So let me draw that line.
So that line looks something like this.
Let me draw it straight.
"And on that line, you have P, Q, and R, and it is parallel to AD."
Good enough.
Points P and Q are symmetric about line AB.
Would you like something to drink?
No thanks.
And the reason you wanted to see me...?
We found something while investigating this accident.
I thought I'd better show you.
And these were found in Mr. Lee Jin-woo's clothes.
Soo-jeong.
Me too.
I love you too.
Sad Movie
They say that I'm an optical illusion.
They say that I'm just a social construct.
They say that I'm a racist because I'm white.
They say that I'm a racist because I'm white.
The same people who say that it's fine for black and brown people to organize themselves for their own benefit say it's evil if my people do the same.
Why?
Who makes these unfair rules?
Asia is Asian.
Africa is African.
Where are the white countries?
They say that white countries don't exist.
They tell me to be loyal to humans but they all step on me.
People are saving endangered species like the whales and the spotted owl
What about my sub-species?
Would you call me a Nazi if want a happy future for people like myself?
Does Israel need diversity?
Whites are 8 percent of the world population and decreasing.
If they are against racism why don't they fight for me?
Why don't they fight for me?
What about a future for me?

Look not for the permanence of job but of love.
Listen to me and apologize to him.
What about our parents?
It is you who have to live together.
Not your parents.
Go quickly.
If you delay then he may not accept you.
Why are you still thinking?
Go now.
"Kiran, I did not come to say sorry to you."
But to tell you that I will live or die with you only.
Stop there.
What are you doing with my son now?
Have you gone mad?
What was the need for you to go to him?
I will bring a much better boy for you than him.
Get who ever you can.
But this marriage will never happen.
I wont agree for this marriage even if you fall at my feet.
Stop it.
Our marriage will take place.
We are not concerned with your standoff.
Our love is important for us.
She realized her mistake and.. ..apologized me.
Now if I bow to your adamancy.. .. then I will lose her forever.
Whether or not you agree we are going to marry.
Will you not shed your anger over me?
How can I bare that anger?
Stop your acting I will not surrender to you
Show some mercy on your girl who approached you
Does our paths ever combine?
Please stop your angry scolding
"- Zeynep, I almost died today."
"- Don't be silly, Burak."
How would he know that you'd use the elevator at that time?
- I don't know but he just did it somehow.
- Stop torturing yourself.
Throw those thoughts out of your mind.
I wish this was just my paranoias as you say.
I know you're going through a difficult period.
But you need to calm down.
It will be over soon.
I am with you.
And no one is gonna kill you.
Are you carrying a gun on your belt?
- I need to be prepared for anything.
- So is this how you protect yourself?
I need to carry this until I can feel safe again.
"""Kuzey, I crossed out one more day."""

My captivity is over.
Yours is next.
On 4th of February.
"A new page will be opened for us, you'll see."
I'm filing a divorce suit against Barış.
"I'm with my mom, since that day."
"I won't go to that house again, not even to get my necklace back."
"Yes, Barış was so mad he seized the necklace you gave me."
I tried to get it back.
"But I had to leave it as pawn in exchange for my freedom, until I divorce."
It's a miserable effort by him.
"He will see that nothing can separate you and me, as everyone else will also see."
"Until today, I didn't know what it really meant ""to miss somebody""."
I missed you so much.
Which is it?
"Please stop asking me this, I..."
"Well, just tell me what you really think."
"No, that's okay..."
Tell me.
No... it's fine...
Tell me!
I... like it...
"Tell me, tell me, tellmetellmetellme!"
All right!
Since you really wanna know...
"The arm's sized tight, the middy collar doesn't go with the shawl lapel... ...the hems are clearly machine-stitched, the pleats are uneven, the fabric looks like toile... ...you used a backstitch here when it clearly called for a topstitch or maybe a traditional blanket stitch... ...and the overdesign is reminiscent of prêt-à-porter and not true French haute couture."
"But, uh... you know... um, whatever you want to do is fine."
"Now, the stars on my belt need to be technically accurate."
"Orion has three stars on his belt, not four."

"Pinkie Pie, the color's too obtrusive"

I'm sewing them together!
"Don't you think my gown would be more ""me"" with some lollipops?"
"-Well, I think..."
-Balloons?
-Well...
-DO EET!
"Hour by hour, one more change"
"I'm sewing them together, take great pains"
"Fluttershy, you're putting me in a bind"
"Rainbow Dash, what is on your mind?"
"Oh my gosh, there's simply not much time"
They lived in that
little house around the corner.
There was one brother that would be here - one or two that would be here
like all summer.
Coordinate stuff.
"Do you recall their names, or?"
Not really.
But they'd play ball
Baseball?
Yep.
And they'd go for walks after supper every night.
Walking down the middle of the road.
With their habits on.
"And then Larry McDonough was just getting into the riding stable thing and they'd - he had 6, 8 horses."
That was one of the things they'd do.
They could rent the horses.
They had one day to be back and forth on them.
And they just seemed a real pleasant bunch.
They never preached.
They didn't do anything like that.
"They were just more friendly, you know."
They were all teachers out of Chicago.
Some Jesuit college or something down there.
"Not Jesuit, but you know."
But we'd always haul them - pick up their luggage with the truck and - same as like when boy scouts come.
You'd load all their gear in the truck and take it up to Fox Lake or into that little road into
Barney's Lake.
"It's fenced off now, but down there."
"So, the brothers would come here."
They were teaching at the colleges down in Chicago there.
Their time here was for what?
That was their retreat.
So let me do that.
So let me connect the dots as best as I can.
"This should be a line, not a curve."
"My hand isn't 100% steady, but I think you get-- let me do it a little bit better than that."
I think I can do a better job than that.
Let me draw-- that's even worse.
All right.
Last attempt.
That's throwing me off.
So last attempt right here.
There you go.
So that's that first line right there. y is equal to 3x plus 1.
So let me do the second one now.
"So it's written in standard form right now, 2y plus 4 is equal to 6x."
"We want to get this in slope-intercept form, y is equal to mx plus b."
So a good place to start could be to subtract this 4 from both sides.
So it goes on the other side.
So let's subtract 4 from both sides of this equation.
"The left-hand side, we're left with just a 2y, and then the right-hand side becomes 6x minus 4."
So 2y is equal to 6x minus 4.
"And then to get everything in terms to solve for y, we just have to divide everything by 2."
"So let's divide everything by 2, and we get y is equal to 3x minus 2."
So that's the second equation in slope-intercept form.
So same drill here.
The y-intercept is negative 2.
"So we go-- that's negative 1, negative 2 right there, and its slope is 3."
And notice its slope is the same as the other line.
So it's going to have the same inclination.
"If we move 1 in the x-direction, we move up 3 in the y-direction."
"1, up 3."
Just like that.
"If we go back 1 in x, we go down 3."

Hello!
Could I get some invisibility powder please.
"Yes, would you like the older or the newer kind, the patented powder."
"Of course the patent power, I've heard that it's better, it was invented abroad after all."
"Yes, indeed."
"It's called ""Through the walls"" powder, I recommend it."
"Look, dear young sir, if you ingest this powder, not only do you turn invisible but you can also walk through walls."
I have 1kg of sugar?
I'm going to use 100g of vanilla.
The ideal is using refined sugar or caster sugar.
Moustache:
"And what about the ""brownd"" sugar, can't it?"
"You can, actually you can use any sugar."
But we use more...
"The brown sugar has more flavour, right?"
So it'll mask the vanilla's flavour.
It's easier a sugar that doesn't have much flavour.
"It's better with the refined or with the caster sugar, because they are more thin."
"The caster sugar isn't the Icing sugar ok, guys?"
The Icing sugar has starch.
"It's not this, ok?"
"So, or the caster sugar or the refined sugar."
"But I don't have any of them here, so I'm using granulated sugar."
"I've never seen, really, anywhere, this unique support for cancer research."

Now I'm f&amp;amp; excited if I've left something more than just ... the usual rations.
See if there is anything else that could be eaten.
Just think if I left some candy.
That would be great.
IS THERE ANY CANDY HERE?
"I don't think there is any, but one can always hope."
"Matches, even more Vaseline I don't really have use for."
Zinc ointment.
"Very much in here, apparently good."
YEAH!
YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
YEAAAAAAAAAAAA -
It has different legendary levels.
"It is very good, you teach me..."
"OK, I showed my dad a new game and..."
Yes...
You have completed your things!
I made my registration to the reeve here.At this house.
It was necessary like that for school.
Did you talk with the prison management?
When can I see my brother?
"I was busy with Faruk Beylice's lawsuit , so I couldn't take care of that but I will solve it."
I promise!
Is there any development about that issue at least?
"No, unfortunately, it looks very hard..."
What's that Suzan?
Have you ever seen us eating dessert after dinner...
Yaman bought it with his first weekly salary.
Oh...
My dear...
The master gave us our weekly salary and I bought it to thank you..
You bought us dessert...
This dessert will take away the whole sadness and tiredness we had all day.
Exactly..
May God give you abundance.
- Enjoy it!
"Oh, my brother..."
"Good that I bought half a kilo, if I bought one kilo we would have floods here."
Are you comfortable my sweeetie?&amp;gt; yes.
"Don't worry for anything, okay?"
Don't be sad for anything!
Everything will get better.
We will sleep and wake up and everything will be better.
"Don't treat me like a baby, it's okay."
You don't even see -
"After suppertime would hit, Jule would put out a set of sawhorses up by the church and up by the museum and the road gets in the winter - packed down."
We'd slide down hill until 10 o'clock at night.
"Kids don't even know what a sleigh looks like, you know."
Sliding down like where the...
"Actually, there was a tennis court where the church is."
But you'd be sliding down like where the rectory is and where the medical center.
"Hell, you're kids, and that was a big hill then."
And we'd go up to where the tower is.
But that's when you're older.
Go down there in a homemade toboggan and kill yourself.
What was Old Patrick Bonner like?
"Nice, pleasant fellow."
A little brogue.
He had one eye.
Accent and everything.
A lot of the guys did.
I don't know what's going on over there.
The seagulls are swarming all over.
Must be some [?] coming in or something.
"But, yeah, he was nice."
"Regular, pleasant guy."
Had the farm up there.
Otherwise...
Was he the only fiddler at that time?
Yeah.
Guy ...
King Strang might have done a little fiddling.
I can't think of...
He pretty much - and Jule played the guitar and he played the steel to the ... he played that really good...
"And Walter McCauley, he was just out of school."
Maybe sailing a little bit.
SPEAKER 28:
"I don't really have to worry about it that much as a guy, I feel like, so."
SPEAKER 29:
"Being a guy, I feel like it's less of a concern."
SPEAKER 23:
And I'm not scared of personally being assaulted.
SPEAKER 20:
"As a boy, I would be less likely to be sexually abused or something like that."
SPEAKER 30:
To protect myself?
I don't really feel like I'd be too much of a victim.
"I'm more focused on my girlfriend, my female friends."
SPEAKER 31:
"Yeah, I don't think there's much I actively do or at least consciously do to protect myself [INAUDlBLE]."
SPEAKER 32:
"Um, I don't really do anything."
SPEAKER 29:
I probably don't do anything on a day-to-day basis to protect myself from sexual violence.
SPEAKER 31:
Essentially nothing.
SPEAKER 33:
Nothing.
SPEAKER 34:
This video is not intended to demonstrate what women should be doing to protect themselves.
"Rather, it is intended to highlight a social reality."
100% of women experience the threat of sexual violence every day.
This is a lived reality that most men never personally experience nor are aware of.
SPEAKER 35:
"Additionally, women are often blamed for the violence committed against them."
"She should have worn a longer skirt, or she shouldn't have drunk that much are victim-blaming phrases."
Rape is never the victim's fault.
SPEAKER 34:
"Well, when the Bradley went down, I flew the guy named Don Hanson."
He was a pilot... coming here all the time.
He had a nice Cessna-180 and the first day...
I have the radio in the basement now.
"Every year, the guy that owns Zenith, it was a fish dock."
Him and my grandfather become really good friends.
From like 1920s or right whenever they started.
"Every time Zenith made a new radio, come out with a different model he gave him a free radio."
He came up in the summer and gave him a new one.
There were Zenith radios with their eyes and everything all over.
And I got the last one.
"Says ""Made expressly for and stolen from"
"Jim Gallagher."" My grandfather's name."
"But anyway, we'd listen to it all night."
We could hear them search and stuff.
"Another uncle of mine, Jack Colton, is in Charlevoix."
He's going to have his 90th birthday here this fall.
He was the exec in the [?].
"And when the call came in, he just took off out with half a crew."
The indicator that tells him it's [?] was painted on both sides.
The engine.
I've been in the basement of one of them
They have different settings.
They're diesel electric.
You go up to like 10 is wide open and then you can push a button and get it up to like twelve.
They went out like that.
Emergency power all the way to Gull Island.
"Those gales, you know nasty."
But the next day I flew with Don and they plowed the runway and just about started to ... up to about that part of the runway.
And it was just slush.
And we took in - As we were getting close to it
The Bradley?
When I see you I can't help but want to tease you.
But isn't the one with the problem you?
You even drop those kinds of things.
"It's good that you two have gotten closer... but before marriage, it's good to be a little more careful."
Since Eun Jo is here too. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net
When are you going to select your major?
During my second year.
"Then, when you decide what major you're going to take..."
Will you be able to do it?
"If a bunch of people choose the same major,"
"They decide using grades, and I'll have to compete in that manner..."
But it seems that those circumstances are unlikely.
"Well, I'm just saying..."
It would be nice if you went into business.
I'm not interested in that area.
"Ah, Why?"
Please drop me off right over there.
Are you going into class?
Seung Jo!
Again?
"Hey, when you think it's going well with him..."
Why is he so fickle?!
Is he being mean again?
"This time, it feels different from the last, though."
I don't know.
"What-  I mean, you said you even kissed."
Like this... you said you hugged too.
"But, I mean, why in the world is he being like that??"
I don't know if he's interested in me or not.
It's very frustrating.
"Min Ah, don't you have any good ideas?"
To find out if he's interested in me or not.
That sounds nifty!
"I think I'll head to the writing center right now!"""
"""That's the spirit, Timmy!"

"The Dover Boys at Pimento University or ""The Rivals of Roquefort Hall"""
Pimento University
Pimento U.
"Good old P.U. ♪ Pimento U. Oh, sweet P.U. ♪ ♪ Thy fragrant odor scents the air. ♪ ♪ A pox on Yale. ♪ ♪ Poo poo, Perdue. ♪ ♪ Pimento U., my college fair. ♪"
"Out and away, the most popular fellows at..."
"Out and away, the most popular fellows at old P. U. are the three Dover boys."
"Tom, the fun-loving member of the trio."
"Dick, a serious lad of 18 summers, plus a winter in Florida, as related in The Dover boys in the Everglades."
"And Larry, the youngest of the three jerks... brothers."
"A gay outing at the park has been planned by the merry trio and they are off to fetch their fiancée, Dainty Dora Standpipe at Miss Cheddars' female academy, close by."
"With their usual punctuality, the boys arrive at the appointed hour of 3:00."
Yoohoo!
Yoohoo!
Yoohoo!
And are soon on their rollicking way.
"Forced to pass a certain public house, a tavern of unsavory repute, our young friends meet the distressing situation with their usual uncompromising, moral fortitude."
"Little do they know that even now, within this very tavern,"
"Dan Backslide, the former sneak of Roquefort Hall, coward, bully, cad, and thief, and arch enemy of the Dover boys, squanders his misspent life."
"Hark, the Dover boys."
Drat them.
Double drat them.
They are escorting Dora Standpipe.
"Dear, rich, Dora Standpipe!"
How I love her... father's money.
Confound those Dover boys!
"Oh, how I hate them!"
I hate Tom!
I hate Dick!
Because.
But yeah.
"Uh, we're thinking."
Okay.
"You kno w, as."
"Responsive design, it's kind of a buzzword but it is also a necessity."
"Um, and..."
"And lot of designers are now saying, well, everything I design, by default has to be responsive."
And now it's fine when you're starting fresh.
"But um, when you have to look behind you what's already been done since, you know, in a lot of cases."
Your content.
The content you are working with has existed since the beginning of internet.
And things were not pretty then.
Oh no.
"In fact, we still have sites that look like 1993."
"And that was my biggest, even iii..."
"Ah, I have no doubt."
"But we're not going to redesign another 1993 looking website with all those blocks and squares. we gotta get away from that, please."
Yeah.
To try to be a little more hip.
"In fact, the girl was just showing us ."
"We, we were looking at, um, presentation on the"
"Tuesday on of the pages that they had ah, doing test on."
"And, and that was one of the web comments there."
"I said, yeah, yeah."
"You don't have to stick with those 1995. , Mm-hm."
"No. , I said, oh no, is he? see how terrible we are."
"We are like the, we've got to get, we've got to get this stuff."
"I mean, they have some of the coolest science around and they show it and."
And those interval waves sometimes.
"I mean, our site looks pretty good."
"Um, cause we did the redesign at MPS and stuff."
"Because in this case, n could be-- could this would be n and this is would be n plus 1-- so n is either equal to 2 or n is equal to minus 3."
That's a little tricky.
The intuition is to just assume that n is positive but it doesn't have to be positive.
So n could be 2 or minus 3 here.
That's a tricky one.
So that one by itself does not help us solve the problem.
"The second part of it, point two it says, 2 to the 2n is equal to 16."
"And whenever you have these in the SAT or the GMAT or anything whenever you have a variable in the exponent, your goal really is to just get everything in the same base."
So we could write the left-hand side the same.
So that's 2 to the 2n.
And how do we write 16 with the base 2?
"Well, 16 is just 2 to the fourth, right?"
And so we get 2n is equal to 4. n is equal to 2.
So this statement alone is enough to figure it out.
This statement alone is not.
So the answer is B.
Statement two alone is sufficient.
40 is B.
"And this was tricky because one, you think that 1n alone is sufficient but it is ambiguous because and n could be minus 3."
41.
41.
OK.
"They've drawn a bunch of, if I see this right,"
They draw a bunch of-- two lines.
Let's see if I can draw this.
So a line and then there's a bunch of circles.
"One circle, two circles they have, and then they keep going."
"Three circles, and then one more."
It's going to be right there.
Four circles.
I think that's about right.
And they say essentially that the circles just keep going on and on.
"The kind of artists . ,, ."
I said I know they're on here somewhere cuz I watched a really good one.
"Cuz I, I only got to it through the newsletter that's why, I, I saw I clicked and went to that, you know greatest artists or something like that."
But then that's why I'm actually going to find him.
"Like what do, what do they have that under?"
"The documentary to me is uh, is kind of more like the."
Plus something for me to learn how to do a documentary.
"Uh, right."
Yeah.
"Which is, it actually being an inspiration story."
"Huh, that makes sense."
"Right, of artists."
And a featured artist or something like that would be a great place for a start.
Okay.
This is so helpful.
"You know, sometimes we just get so insular in how we loko at information that it's so helpful to hear how other people."
Consume.
Right.
"Well like I said if I meet with engineering teams, and we always get to see it then."
"It's a terrible job on your, on your back."
"Um, people like to go hiking and stuff and there's , too."
"Oh. ,, , so even we, we don't a very good job on stuff. ."
Yeah.
"We all do the best we can, and then we re-evaluate and start again."
Right.
"Yeah, but you had some good stuff too.'Cause my Dad said I'm, I'm creative on the outside ."
"I do children's illustrations, and things like that."
"So you have, like, some children's book illustrator."
Mm hm.
Programs.
The illustrating stuff is good.
I don't think .
I beg at you.
But... - Otherwise...
"Otherwise, I'll become widow before marriage."
"Don't say that, Radha."
We're with you.
I'll speak truth and none other than the truth.
Inspector Damodar... ...don't you think you should have come in your uniform... ...for giving your statement?
"Your Honour, actually we become little tough in uniform."
While giving our statement we forget the human emotions.
I'd just repeat few lines of this Geeta.
It says... if a sinner confesses his sin... ...and is ready to go through it's punishment... ...he is no more considered a sinner.
"Your Honour, we, the police officers tried our best to arrest Jackie."
And finally what did we get?
Nothing.
Total flop.
Order... order...
"Your Honour, isn't this evidence enough... ...that Jackie has surrendered."
Your Honour.
He was a criminal.
But now he is not.
There's a lot of difference between both the tenses.
We must forget the past.
And think about his present and future.
"If he wants to mend his ways, I'd request the court... ...that the law should show mercy upon him."
"So that he can be a good man, a good citizen... ...why..."
"Your Honour, I think I've said too much."
"Sorry, I became little emotional."
"But whatever I said had some weight, right?"
Yes.
Under the IPC section 362. court orders... ...2 years imprisonment to Jackie alias Jaikishan.
Jackie!
Jackie!

"Of course, madame, anything you want"
"Gülnaz, What are these conditions?"
Just leave.
"Boss, honestly."
"If it was about a goon, we'd have managed."
This girl is very sharp.
We can't control her.
We're trying to explain her that we're the police officers...
And she's in the police custody for her wellbeing.
But she's not ready to believe us.
We've to keep her here for 18 days.
How will you manage?
It doesn't suit to tenderly girls like you.
You all are goons.
You've kidnapped me.
But I'm Radha Mathur.
I know how to tackle with goons like you.
"Never try to do that with me, is that clear?"
I beg of you
You can take away all my jewelries.
But please let me go.
"Look, you are misunderstanding us."
We're government servants.
We'll have to follow our senior's orders.
Then why don't you arrange for me to talk with my father?
What's all this?
This is the result of your father's enmity with a goon.
That goons is planning to kidnap you.
That's why our IG has ordered us to keep you... ...in our safe custody away from the city.
But how do I believe you?
This is a not a drama.
Do you have any evidence?
Wait for the 24 hours and you'll get the evidence.
That's a tape.
"Detroit and I started going down there, well then that changed that."
She had a good job at [?].
She was the [?]
Detroit area automobile association
They must have a hundred dealers
But she came back to Grand Rapids and we got married and that was it.
Picked up a couple of part time jobs.
And then when the kids got in high school
She didn't work until after they were in high school
And then she started out with a part-time job.
The kids were working part-time.
They went to [?] and Catholic Central
Worked janitor work over at the school and different things
No problem.
They're good workers.
Few grey hairs but that happens.
They didn't get in jail.
So they're both doing good and I'm doing good but we came up here every summer.
We rented over at Archie's.
Archie's Place is there.
We rented there for 30 years.
Even though I'd had some property up where [?] is and I sold it to him and bought this.
What year did you buy this property?
"Let's see, we built in"
"'98, so probably bought it in '94, maybe."
"So, when you say you never left the island?"
"I went some, like, 28 St. Patrick's Days and never missed one."
You never missed a funeral or a wedding or vacations.
We worked 4-day weeks at Spartan so you could switch.
You could work Sunday to Wednesday one week and
"Tuesday to Friday the next, or something like that and get a 4-day weekend to shoot up here pretty easy."
How did your bride like Beaver Island when you first brought her out here?
"They are a little cold but, I thought it will serve."
"Oh, thank you..."
"Okay then, tomorrow in your last exam,no?"
"I have the interview and exam too, they come in package."
"Interviews are very important, you know."
You have to show them you have sufficiently capacity to study in that school.
"I would say something for their capacities but...anyways..,"
From tomorrow you will be a university student.
With God's willing!
What?- I will say something... but don't get angry right away.. don't say:
"""Don't interfere"", okay?"
"Call your mom too, talk to her."
Tell her that your exam is tomorrow.
Let her be happy too.
"Okay, i'll call her."
Of course I won't call her.
"Mira we'll talk properly about this in a suitable time but let's not talk about it at the last night before my exam,OK?"
Good!
I am sorry.
Good luck !&amp;gt; Thank you.
Success!
I will ask something...You will be angry with me too...
Ask..
"Last night, why did that blighter make you cry?- Are you spying on us?"
He alarmed the whole street with the voice of his burned plastic.( applying breaks on tires)
Do... you really love that man?
Good night.
Kenan calling...
What's up Dwarf ? &amp;gt; Brother!
- It means you remembered you have a brother.
"Brother, where are you calling from?"
"Don't make a show man, as if you don't know I am at the hospital."
"Go bring the instruments now, hurry."
"Yes, sir."
Is he not being able to breath?

"With her father and left minister (war minister) gone, she won't have a chance."
"Your Highness, we need to do something before the Queen Mother does something."
The Queen Mother has the right to choose the successor.
Do you think they're that easy to persuade?
"Your Highness, if we retreat from here you and the young prince's life could be in danger."
"Also, this is the chef's record."
There were no records for the day His Majesty became ill.
You mean ..?
That's right.
Even the person who writes the record is missing as well.
There hasn't been enough time for them to take the recorder  out of the palace.
"That means, she is hidden somewhere inside of palace."
Inside of palace?

And we'd go out and then we'd make changes.
"And back in, and back out."
"There were always 4 or 5 of them or 3 or 4 of them on the plane with us, just..."
And there was that original 8 or 10 astronauts.

No.

So that was -

I spoke with her
"Kader Altun,of all those letters that you sentto your son, are missing, right?"
"Maybe theylost in the mail,"
It probably happenedBefore I sent them to my niece in Trabzon. did you ever mention in any of these lettersyour relationship withmr.
Sulejman?
Never!I never mentioned it
"Nazif from Trabzonwas very honored one . to tell him about my relationshiplt would hurt him,and also make him so angry."
"How can we comprehend,you have not to mention it To protect Suleiman's life?"
"Not at all,"
I did not writebecause it was inappropriate...
In the town where I'm fromthey do not accept easilythis kind of relationship.
Maybe Nazif Kara learned about your relationship from someone else?Is that possible?
Maybe some offriend or relative?
No.Nobody knewabout our relationship.
"Many years passedsince I escapedfrom his family,"
"That's why I changed the name,I never used the name Kader,only Nihan"
So I couldnot be found.

That was the day ofMahir engagement...
I wentand saw my son from a distance...
It is so difficultfor a mother not to benear her only sonon such a beautiful day.
I stood thereas a foreigner...
Then I wentby Suleiman cryand share my pain with him.
Suleiman was alwaysvery compassionate and promised to help meto meetwith my son...
He promised me he would call Mahirand called him to come totalk to him.
"Wait a minute,just a little bit..."
So that was the reasonwhy Suleiman sent the policeto bring in Mahir Kara that day?
I do not know...but I think so...
He promised to call him... mr.

"And of course, we're probably 16 years old"
"I mean, what the hell."
"We all skate, and we weren't experts, but we started skating."
"Now, you don't see a kid out there."
"Sunday afternoon, and nobody knows how to skate."
"But anyway, they're all watching that damn TV, or..."
We got out there and finally one of us had enough brains.
I don't know who.
I ain't gonna take the credit because we looked around and here the island was just a little bit of a smudge like this.
And the mainland
looks like from here to Garden Island.
"So one of us had enough brains to say, Maybe we better..."
"We had good, sharp skates"
Not a drop of snow or nothing.
Just like skating on a groomed rink except for the pressure through the cracks.
One of us finally had enough brains to turn around and come back.
"Now, you were 16 when you - ?"
"Probably was, yeah."
So you've kept pretty close and expect to see all nine of them?
"Well, eight of them."
Kenny died in Texas.
The guy that was in the Navy.
He died from cancer in Texas here a couple years ago.
Good friend.
"That was probably the whole graduating class, then?"
"Oh, yeah."
Yeah.
"In fact, freshman year I was the only boy."
Gary was in seminary and Kenny was a grade ahead of us.
I was the only boy.
What other exploits did you have together with that group?
The ice is melting.
But the frog is dead.
Unless it can kick start its heart.
Blood flows.
Nerves twitch.
The frog is back from the dead.
"There's no frostbite, no damage."
The spring ponds of the north are free from competition.
No other frog can survive life in the deep freeze.
NARRATOR:
The next incredible story of survival comes from down on the farm.
[rooster crows]
"It's September 10, 1945."
Farmer Lloyd Olsen is having chicken for dinner.
He selects a five-month-old rooster called Mike.
The headless chicken carried on as though nothing had happened.
A blood clot prevented him from bleeding to death.
"Mike's head was gone, but most of the brain stem and one ear was intact."
And a brain stem provides all the thinking power a chicken needs to survive.
Mike the headless chicken became famous.
Feeding was a problem.
Farmer Lloyd dropped water and grain down what was left of Mike's gullet.
Mike not only survived-- he thrived.
Mike the chicken struts into number 4 because he lived for 18 months without a head.
"Unfortunately, Mike had a mucus problem and needed an eyedropper to clear his airways."
"One day, Lloyd couldn't get to the eyedropper fast enough... and his headless chicken died."
But Mike's legend lives on.
The animals crawling into number 3 thrive in the underworld.
Rats.
We think they're dirty.
Disgusting.
Diseased.
I can't see another explanation.
Luminus Devastatus is a spell that priests unlock at the level 100.
"Yes but with the update version, it can set up a new deal."
"No, no, no, I have checked twice."
"No, wait, it's better to :"
Bandaid !
"Come here my boy, come !"
"What's going on dudes, are we going to do a new quest ?"
"No, no ,no."
We just want to know where did you got that beautiful staff.
The staff ?
"But I already told you, on Dardane."
"No, that cannot be Bandaid."
Dardane doesn't loot this kind of item.
"Yes he does, and it's Golgotha who killed him right in front of me."
"And when she left, she said she didn't need this kind of item, so I took it for myself."
"- Yeah, me, I think he is lying."
- Why would he lie ?
"I don't know, perhaps he bought the staff from Ash the chinese farmer."
And he doesn't dare to say it.
I am not Chinese !
You really think behind his blank stare there's enough grey cells to bamboozle us ?
Yes. good point.
"However, nothing can explain how the worse priest from Horizon 1.0 is able to cast level 100 spells."
"And me, I think you're jealous Omega Zell."
"What !? m-me jea, but he's insane, never ever, it's you who is jealous !"
- Why do you say that Bandaid ?
"- Yes, why do you say that ?"
"Well, because I reached level 100 before you !"
And even Tenshirock the hacker has said that I was super whacking of the dead.
He also said that I was the Chosen one !

"During the 1930s in France, a Russian philosopher named Alexandre Kojeve gave some courses about the Master-Slave Dialectic to some people who had gone to...pretty important philosophers like"

I can't believe what an awkward position I've put you in.
"But believe me, I never planned for this to happen"
"I know, I made your schedule."
This was not on it.
"Stacey, I've been looking high and low### for you"
"Well, maybe you should try getting out of the chair"
That'll increase your odds
"Stacey, I need you to testify for me at the people's court."
"Listen, I can't possibly take off walk."
I'm sorry.
It's a definite no
"Alright, I'll go on### TV myself, fine."
National TV?
Millions of cute guys watching?
"Alright, I'll do it"
"Here, I want you to look at these books."
I highlighted some of the cases that are similar to mine
And I've made some notes on some questions that they are likely to ask.
You know what to do.
"Call up the law library, see if they can dig up some legal precedence that we can cite"
"I'm on it, Paulie."
"Hey, Ma."
I'll be on TV.
I don't know.
Some stupid thing
"We just got together to talk like old friends, and the next thing you know, we wind up in my hotel room"
"If this conversation goes any further, I might be forced to go on a tri-state killing spree."
I don't blame you.
You're embarrassed.
"Nah, look, it's all right."
"I mean, growing up together, we had embarrassing moments all the time."
We did not.
And they're both going to be negative because their sum is negative.
And there's something interesting here.
49 is a perfect square.
"Its factors are 1, 7, and 49."
"So maybe 7 will work, or even better, maybe negative 7 will work."
And it does!
Negative 7 times negative 7 is 49.
And negative 7 plus negative 7 is negative 14.
"We have that pattern there, where we have 2 times a number, and then we have the number squared."
This is a perfect square.
"This is equal to x minus 7, times x minus 7, is equal to 0."
Don't want to forget that.
Or we could write this as x minus 7 squared is equal to 0.
So this was a perfect square of a binomial.
"And if x minus 7 squared is equal to 0, take the square root of both sides."
You'll get x minus 7 is equal to 0.
"I mean, you could say x minus 7 is 0 or x minus 7 is 0."
But that'd be redundant.
So we just get x minus 7 is 0.
"Add 7 to both sides, and you get x is equal to 7."
Only one solution there.
Let's do another one in pink.
Let's say we have x squared minus 64 is equal to 0.
Now this looks interesting right here.
A bell might be ringing in your head on how to solve this.
"This has no x term, but we could think of it as having an x term."
We could rewrite this as x squared plus 0x minus 64.
"So in this situation, we could say, OK, what two numbers, when I multiply them, equal 64, and when I add them equal 0?"
"And when I take their product, I'm getting a negative number, right?"
This is a times b.
It's a negative number.
So that must mean that they have opposite signs.
"Just basically, you know, so how do they make their marriage work?"
You're just trying to take the concentration off of the sex end.
You're like where is the relationship?
"Where is our, where is the rest of our intimacy?"
David:
Yeah.
The point is love and sex are different things.
Chandra:
Correct.
David:
"And for a lot of people, they are very lined up and when they think about their relationships, sex is kind of really at the center of where it is."
"But if you set up a relationship and from the get go,"
"I mean, everyone has really close friendships, right?"
Star:
Yes.
David:
"Which are different, but you can form a really close relationship where sex isn't at the center of it."
"And so it's...it's abstract, but it's thinking about how do you form a relationship that's closer, that's more committed than, you know, can be the basis for a family?"
Joy:
But what about kissing and cuddling with a girl and having a little of that stuff?
David:
"Oh, I personally like that."
Joy:
"Oh, you do like that?"
"So, what if the girl gets aroused?"
What are you going to do?
[laughter]
David:
"I mean, she's going to know from the get go."
Joy:
She might change her mind once you embrace her.
[laughter]
"-	If they can that would be huge, but the Infestors are waiting below."
"Umm, viOLet is too good for that!"
He is not going to let that happen.
"-	Yeah, I think viOLet has actually done this, he's gonna kill the last Orbital, and with that, Polt is just going to run around the map with these Marines."
-	He is trying to get Vikings though..
But again he is supply blocked.
-	He can't build anything.
"He's got no supply, he's got like two Depots in the back of his natural, and that's..."
Just about it!
Is there a Command Center floating somewhere?
"-	There is a Command Center being built in the middle-right hand side of the map, but will viOLet see that?"
"-	Yeah, there is no Orbital, so viOLet can just burrow Drones right next to extractors."
"-	Wait, where is viOLet's last building?"
Where is it?
-	Oh My God!
-	Ohh!
"Another Yamato gets planted, and now we start to see the Yamato's incoming for Rain."
Oh no!
BoxeR loses the Ghost!
No EMP's possible now.
And there are the Yamato's going down.
He is picking off one Viking at a time.
He needs to avoid those Seeker Missiles.
"Huge number of Point Defense Drones, a very tense micro situation."
"Now we see the big engagement, this could be the final battle."
"The Ravens on the wrong side, trying to move forward, if he can get a big.."
"Ohh, big Seeker Missile could go off, but no!"
They are all out of energy.
"And it looks like in terms of the air battle, we do see 31 Vikings, more are falling for BoxeR, can he pick off all of the Battlecruisers?"
"And it looks like BoxeR might come out on top in the sky, but the seven Thors from Rain give him the victory there!"
"-	There are still 66 Probes up for HerO, so his economy is still fine."
"-	Yeah, wow."
I tried a little college.
Picked up a job.
Which was dumb.
I was making about five hundred with my flight pay in the Air Force...
Took a job for a hundred a week when I got out.
I would...
I'd go there for seven years and...
Driving truck where now?
"Oh, just a laundry truck all over Western Michigan."
"We had all the Kroger stores and all the Spartan stores under contract, with aprons and towels, and..."
With Richie Gillespie?
"No, with Richie O'Donnell."
"One of the drivers got hurt, and he knew I was looking for better pay."
And I'd always bonded with him and I went there
I drove there for 7 years.
"I got there, there were 32 drivers, and when they got laid off they were down to - I think it was either 9 or 11."
Synthetic stuff.
"Synthetic smocks, table covers"
"Restaurants quit using cloth napkins and cloth table covers, and the fancy banquet covers, and that was our main business."
"The guys retired, and they'd just never fill them in and never did, and never did."
"So, 7 years later, I was..."
I went to... a year and a half and got a big layoff there.
"'75, I think it was."
What were you doing for Steel Case?
I just worked the shipping department
I was in shipping - file shipping.
"And when I left there - I was laid off from there, and of course, Steel Case always called back, back then, back in the 70s"
I couldn't get a job.
"I was working 3 jobs, $2.50 an hour."
Bartending on weekends for the Amvets.
Because they wanted a guy there Friday and Saturday.
Mowing grass for another guy for $2.50 an hour.
"And this holiday season, let us reaffirm our commitment to each other, as family members, as neighbors, as Americans, regardless of our color or creed or faith."
"Let us remember that we are one, and we are a family."
"So on behalf of Malia and Sasha and Michelle and our grandmother-in-chief, Marian -- (laughter)"
"-- I wish you all the happiest holiday season, the merriest of Christmases."
"God bless you all, and may God bless the United States of America."
(applause)
"And with that, I'm going to invite the entire Obama clan up here to light the Christmas tree."
"I need some help, and there's a lot of technical aspects to this."
(laughter)
"Come on, guys."
(applause)
All right.
"Okay, we're going to start counting down here."
We've got the switch right here.
The First Lady:
"All right, come on."
The President:
Everybody ready?
And this is the new tree.
"I know it's not quite as big as the old tree, but it's going to take time to grow."
But we're going to fill it up with some spirit and start a new tradition right now.
"All right, everybody ready?"
We're going to start counting down.
"Five, four, three, two, one -- (applause)"
There you go.
That's a good-looking tree.
"Thank you, everyone."
Now I have come to the crossroads in my life
I always knew what the right path was.
"Without exception, I knew."
But I never took it.
You know why?
What's a joke now?
"No, I'm afraid you're going to notice everything I do."
Gee!
I don't --
Do you want me to?
"I want you to help me become more relaxed, yes, but I don't want to be so defensive with you."
I don't like to feel so defensive.
"Uh...you're acting like -- you're treating me as if I'm stronger than I am, and I want you to... protect me more, and be nicer to me."
Are you aware of your smile?
You don't believe a word you're saying.
[laughs]
"I do too, and I know you're going to pick on me for it!"
"Sure, you're bluffing, a phony."
Do you believe -- you mean that seriously?
"Yeah, if you say you're afraid and you laugh and you giggle and you squirm...that's phony."
You put on a performance for me.
"Oh, I...I resent that very much."
Can you express this?
"Yes, sir."
I most certainly am not being phony.
I will admit this.
"It's hard for me to show my embarrassment, and I hate to be embarrassed, but, boy, I resent you calling me a phony."
Just because I smile when I'm embarrassed or
"I'm put in the corner, does not mean I'm being a phony."
Wonderful.
Thank you.
You did this work for the last minute.
"Well, I'm really mad at you."
That's right.
You didn't have to cover up your anger with your smile.
"Now in that moment, in that minute, you had not a not a [indiscernible]"
"Well, at that minute I was mad at you though,"
We will burn his house.. .. with a tank full of petrol and bring Shailaja back.
Are you out of your mind?
He is not an ordinary person.
He is a powerful man in entire Telangana.
That will be our strength.
He cannot imagine .. ..that we will dare to rescue Shailu from him.
Even then we should not be careless.
With a perfect plan.. ..we should rescue her tonight.
"Bhadra, listen to me."
She is not even taking any food.
How would she possibly marry you and lead her life with you?
Dont do it.
If you decorate your feet with Mehendi.
They look beautiful with that red color.
If you decorate your hands they too look beautiful.
But dont let blood smear your hands.
It will not be nice.
I could have done anything with you.
But my father told me in his death bed.. .. not to hurt any woman.
That is why I have caused no harm to you.
But I will definitely marry you.
I dont like you.
Then whom do you like?
That Venkat who left you and ran away?
Why do you think him so much about him?
I am the person who is standing all your abuses.
Think about me.
Change your mind.
It is not me but you who has to change your mind.
"Whatever you say, my fancy for you is only increasing."
What do you ladies have?
Even kings become your slaves.
"POLlCE STlLL CAN'T IDENTlFY REPRESSOR, INVOLVED IN MANY CRlMES."
"This one here... the teacher, is my husband, Mario Portela."
We got married in 1976.
For me it was stupid having a white wedding because I wasn't a virgin.
But you know people.
Sometimes you must pretend to be what you are not.
"I had already made love with Mario for the first time on October 3, 1975."
It was beautiful.
Though I haven't got the photo.
And this thin kid here is Sebastian Garcia.
"When he was 16 years old, the ""Triple A"" kidnapped him."
"The ""Argentine Anticommunist Alliance""."
They said he was a subversive.
He went to a rally and they took his picture.
"The thing is when they tortured him, the poor kid, they wanted names and he didn't know what to say."
"So they used a cattle prod because he was silent, and he just said the first thing that came into his head."
"The names of his classmates, his teacher..."
I remember coming home that day.
"They'd broken the door down, they grabbed me, and I saw Mario with a hood over his head."
"Amanda, you don't have to tell me this, or hurt yourself."
"No, honey, you're wrong there."
This doesn't hurt.
It shouldn't hurt me.
What I...
You know what hurt most?
"Not the cattle prod, or being raped, or that son-of-a-bitch... flaying the soles off my feet with a razor blade..."
What hurt most was seeing Mario alive for the last time.
They brought him back after a session... two or three minutes...
"I remember he looked bad, and I thought I must look like that too."
Like looking in a mirror.
He could barely stand up.
His body was mangled.
On edge.
"Frustrated, 'cause I was like, ""Where is the paper?"""
I was pretty creeped out.
"Very, very scared."
Scared.
How else would I feel?
Am I supposed to be happy or something?
The sounds they had
I didn't think were going to affect me as much as they did.
"Just, ""Boom."""
Just constant bass is just nerve-racking.
"(Finebros) So, the villain in the game is called Slender Man, which is an Internet meme that's been around for a while that some people have even started to like to say is real."
"Oh, my gosh."
(Finebros) And people will post pictures of sightings of the Slender Man.
Someone just walked by.
"(chuckling) Oh, my god."
(Finebros) What have you seen?
What do you know about the Slender Man mythology or whatever?
"It was like some mythological creature, and it was like this man who's really tall with a suit and everything and no face."
He was there before mankind.
"He kidnapped children and whatnot, and there's, like, several accounts of it too."
"Like, there was this picture--"
"Oh, God, I just got chills from it."
I don't like it.
There's this picture of a park and there's a bunch of kids.
"In the picture, he has four or five arms, and the kids in the picture later on went missing."
Those are just Photoshopped.
I've seen those pictures.
Photoshop.
"Oh, my God."
(Finebros) What is it about the Slender Man that is making people care so much that they're creating so much content about him?
He's scary and people seem to like being scared.
"Keep your voice low, he is the king of entire Telangana."
"Hey, where are you going?"
"- It is raining, mother."
"If your father sees you, he will.."
Your husband is busy elsewhere.
Look there.
Silk drops which make the young girl happy
Like the colorful parrots and like sugar crystals .. ..the rain drops are falling to enhance the youth
Did you remember me after such a long time
How long will you hide in the skies
You come and go like a guest
If you promise to stay with me forever.. ..I will hold you close with my hands.
If you want to come will I stop you?
O beautiful rain drop stay with me like my nose ring
O beautiful rain drop stay with me like my ear ring
"like my bangles, and anklets and.. ..like ornaments I wear everyday"
Shall I preserve you like a childhood friend?
Like the blooming youth of a girl shall I see myself in you?
"Like the song on my lips, like the poetry of a poet and.. ..as the dreams in my eyes if you wish to be with me"
Father is very serious.
He wants to see you.
Let us go.
Shall I kidnap her?
Find her details.
The train started but where is your father?
Did father not come?
What are you searching for?
My father did not board the train.
You dont worry.
By the way how does he look like?
How does he look like?
I am asking about his appearance.
"Ball, car, picture."
Can you repeat those back to me please?
"BALL, CAR AND PlCTURE."
Fantastic.
"I'm going to ask you that later, again, so try and remember please."
"Starting from 100, can you take away 7 and tell me what that is? then keep taking away 7 and tell me what the answer is each time and I'll tell you when to stop and you can stop."

Hello.
Today we are going to use fabric to make a crane.
Inflate four balloons
leaving about six inch flat tail.
I use different color balloons for this instruction.
Twist the first yellow bubble.
We are going to twist all bubbles of the same about two inch size.
Twist the first gray bubble.
Lock the free end of the first gray bubble with free end of the first yellow bubble.
Now let's connect two more balloons.
Twist the first red bubble.
Twist the first pink bubble.
Lock the free end of the first pink bubble with the free end of the first red bubble.
Twist the second yellow bubble.
Twist the second red bubble.
Lock the free ends of the second yellow and the second red bubbles in one lock twist.
OK.
Now twist the second pink bubble.
And twist the second gray bubble.
Lock the free ends of the second pink and second gray bubbles in one lock twist.
It is the bottom view of our sculpture.
Twist the third pink bubble.
It's fantastic every step of the way.
Dorm life is great.
"I love, love living here."
It's a great way to meet new people.
It's alot of fun.
You make so many new friends.
I have a big room.
That's nice.
Living in the dorms is probably where I've met the most diverse group of people.
"Here at U.R.I., we have this thing called the Living and Learning Community."
I lived in the Living Learning Community at Morrow.
"If you need help, you'd go to your neighbors."
"If you have some kind of random question, all you'd have to do is poke your head out the hallway and ask someone, which is so convenient."
Chances are somebody else will understand it.
The food's phenomenal I really like how we have a variety of food.
The grilled cheese.
I have never had onion rings like I have at home.
Well I'd definitely say that my favorite food in the stir fry.
The stir fry.
"They're crispy, the onions are soft."
I like to get the omelettes at Butterfield.
"On weekdays, there's omelettes."
All you can eat buffet.
"Its alot of variety, there's alot of options here on campus."
I like to put yogurt and granola and banana in a bowl and mix it up.
It's healthy if you're trying to eat healhty.
"Usually every Friday, it's nacho night."
"There's plenty of pizza and chicken nuggets, everything a college student needs."
I love the campus.
I fell in love with the campus.
A ton of nice people here.
"You can't help but smile, it's so nice here."
SO its 2 times 2 minus 3 times 4
SO that's 4 minus 12.
"So its -8i minus, remember we have to swap signs, plus-minus-plus when you are taking the determinant."
"So you ignore the j, so its 4 times 2 = 8 minus 3 times 3 which is -1."
So this would be a -1 here but there is already a negative here so its a +1j.
"And then finally the k, you cross out that column."
4 times 4 is 16.
16 -6 =10.
So plus 10.
Let me be sure I got that correct.
"So the first one, I always have to make sure, so i I got yup, 4-12 = -8 and negative j ... 4 times 2 is 8 minus 9 = -1 but j has a negative so that's right."
"And then k, 4 times 4 is 16."
16 -6 = 10.
So that looks right.
So plus...plus 10k.
So this vector right here is the vector d.
I just figured it out.
"Now if we take the cross product of d with vector a the vector that was....you can kinda view it as lying along this line over here, then we will get a vector that is normal to this plane."
"We can call that vector n, for normal, that is normal to this yellow plane that will actually sit on this white plane."
"So lets figure it out, we will see in a few steps, probably in the next video why is that actually useful."
"So lets take, lets find what is d cross a... this is equal to our normal vector which is = same thing. i..j...k."
"We are gonna take d which is -8, 1, 10 and take the cross of that and vector a which is 2,3,4. and we will get, actually, I will continue this in the next video so that I do not make these videos too long."
- Her Grace is gone.
Find her.
- My lady.
"- You men, with me."
- Sir.
"So, she's definitely left the palace?"
"Yes, sir."
We saw her guards ourselves.
Get me more details.
Sir.
Motherfucker.
"Oh, hey."

You see?
"And a lot of people on the Internet can rant and rave about how much this guy's a fucking idiot, but I think you really need to go back in your mind, mostly guys, and think about all of the girls that you thought were really manly and gross and, like, athletic-looking, because they had their tits squished down."
Probably a little bit more than you'd like to admit.
Sun just went behind the clouds.
"So while you're watching the rest of the Olympics, and the rest of life, if you see a girl with some flat titties while she's working out or competing for a gold medal, it's not her titties."
It's her fucking bra!
"Sorry that you don't understand sports bras, because us girls have since the day we started growing fucking boobs."
"Right, Marbles?"
Where are your boobs?
In your shirt.
"Kermit, look at your ears, buddy."
You look like Princess Leia.
Yes you do.
Ohh!
"All right, make sure you subscribe to our channel."
We put out new videos every Wednesday!
And we hide our boobs sometimes when we work out so that they don't hit us in the face!
"Right, Kermit?"
"Yeah, you love boobs."
We'll see you next week.
Bye!

It's got to that stage in Scotland now where people recognise me.
But never where from.
I got followed by two guys in Glasgow who thought I was Wee Bear from Bo Selecta.
You wait for years for that Proclaimers sign to go away.
My favourite thing I saw this year was an article in one of the women's magazines on Valentines
...
"Hari bol, Gaura Hari bol."
"Hopeless position. hatāś hoiye, hari, tava nām ucca kori"", boro duḥkhe ḍāki bār bār"
I am [ampulating??] all these things with each to the highest position of disappointment whence sometimes somehow or other there comes:
"""Gaurabde ha!"
"O, Lord!"
I'm helpless.
"Save me""."
"""I'm helpless, I'm [soheart??]-powered."
In my home I'm in the midst of so many enemy in there.
In the hand of my enemies.
"No, no freedom."
I'm [clotery??] under control of so many enemies in the form of friends.
The real me such hopeless position.
"I hope, my Lord, You'll come without agression with anger, agressively, otherwise no hope."
Even I'll not be allowed to my connection with you. kāmādīnāṁ kati na katidhā pālitā (CC Madhya 22.16)
From time immemorial I'm serving all my these masters.
But they are not satisfied with my service.
"I may be slave, eternal slave, impossibility of getting of [position??] unique to me."
"Now I find this helpless position, my Lord."
"If you, when thee come on your own accord asserting or serving any way then these, they will fly away."
Otherwise no.
No chance I have got. sāmprataṁ labdha-buddhis tvām āyātaḥ śaraṇam abhayaṁ māṁ niyuṅkṣvātma... (CC Madhya 22.16)
When little attention of some engagement if you extend to me then these will fly.
In the fear of you.
"- Oh, God!"
He's right there!

"- (laughs and curses) - Oh, he has tentacles!"
Oh!
I never saw that before.
What?
Poor guy.
(Finebros) Why are people uploading videos of themselves getting scared?
"Uh, 'cause it's hilarious."
All YouTube videos-- the reason they upload it is to get views.
"(Finebros) Do you think that everyone was being legit scared, or were some of them pretending to be scared?"
"I feel like a lot of them were exaggerating,"
"'cause if they were videotaping themselves, they knew what was happening."
"Tobuscus, I felt the after part was a little overdone."
But I bet you most of the people are legitimately scared.
"(Finebros) So, this game is a fairly simple game and there's not much to it and it's short, but it's so popular."
"Why do people love playing ""Slender""?"
"I didn't love playing ""Slender."""
"I don't know why people love playing ""Slender."""
"Because it's so hard to win and it's so fun to play because of the suspense, I guess."
"There's not a whole lot to do with it, so, like, anyone can play it."
"The simplicity of it could, like, attract them."
It attracts a lot of people that maybe aren't into gaming that--
- (cracks up) - (Finebros) There's nothing there!
"People like to be scared, you know?"
People like to have that adrenaline rush.
I don't do well with scary movies.
"I got nightmares from ""Harry Potter."""
"(Finebros) And what advice would you give to somebody who is about to play ""Slender"" for the first time?"
Just don't do it.
Just don't.
Far from it!
You should be thankful that he isn't the man of your life.Look!
We came to ask if there is anything we can do for you?
Where is Faruk?
"I don't know, just left, and went away."
Maybe he threw himself somewhere. or maybe he is getting ready to throw himself.
His life- insurance will pay his debts then.
"Do something ,Selim..."
Please ..-You know that i am Ümit's lawyer.
But I'll help you.I can recommend a good lawyer for him.
We're finished.
We simply got ruined.
"Thankfully, land register of this house is on me."
Could something happen?
Could we lose this house?
It depends on amount of the debt.
"But of course, as his wife you're debt's -partner.."
God damn it...
God damn him !
This incompetent guy!
"Come here, we can go outside for a bit if you want."
Since you couldn't carry out this work successfully why did you take such a risk?
Wait let me see the dimensions of this issue tomorrow first.
"Let us first see what's the issue befor you maul yourself, right?"
I 'il check on Beeren.
Everything is clear.
"In the middle of the business world, they proved that he is a thief."
"Even if he can get out of this mess, who's going to work with him again?"
He played with the future of the children.
This is the most important thing.
It looks like Mira will go from here before than that outskirts boy.
They will go away from here.
"July 24, 2010."
"It's nearly midnight now, and I'm running out of time to make this."
"I worked all day long, on a Saturday--yeah, I know."
The sad part is...
"I spent all day long hoping for something amazing to happen, something great, something to appreciate this day and to be a part of it and to... show the world that there's something great that can happen every day of your life, in everyone's life."
"But the truth is, it doesn't always happen."
"And for me, today... all day long, nothing really happened."
I want people to know that I'm here.
I don't want to cease to exist.
[thunder rumbling]
"I'm not gonna sit here and tell you that I'm this great person, because..."
I don't think I am... at all.
"I think I'm a normal girl, normal life."
Not interesting enough... to know anything about.
But I want to be.
"And today... even though... even though nothing great really happened, tonight I feel as if something great happened."

What are they saying?- I didn't see any of them since the evening.
How am i to look in their faces?!..
"Don't be like this Mira, please!"
"It's all because of uncle Umit's stupidity,"
He did a very shameful thing.
"Whatever it is, was there the place to settle accounts."
Can one attack like savage in that way.
That was definitely barbaric...Inhuman...
"No one cares about what he did, dear Eylul."
Every body will talk about my father.
About our disgrace..- What disgrace ?
"This is business life, one can sing and get out..."
"Uncle Faruk was a good person when he earned money for them, when he lost it he became a bad one?"
Empty words!
Mom..
"Where?- To fix our reputation (honor), which is licking the dust."
Any news from dad?
"No, his phones are switched off."
I will have to find a solution on my own.
Good morning. &amp;gt; Good morning.
"Wow, my dad did the omelet, I knew it from the smell."
"Sit down, it will get cold.."
What is it? &amp;gt; Nothing.
There is something...
"Everybody is tensed because of what happened last night Mert, don't force it if you want."
If I get anything I will be Darth Vader
"Yaman, you have to take care of the official documents for the school.."
Birth and citizenship certificate and so on.
"Don't neglect it, Friday is the last day."
"Ok, I will prepare them someday."
"-This is important, get it done today!"
"When I take their sum, I get positive 4."
So I can rewrite this equation here.
"I could rewrite it as x plus 7, times x minus 3, is equal to 0."
"And now I can solve this by saying, look, I have two quantities."
Their product is equal to 0.
That means that one or both of them have to be equal to 0.
So that means that x plus 7 is equal to 0.
That's an x.
Or x minus 3 is equal to 0.
I could subtract 7 from both sides of this equation.
And I would get x is equal to negative 7.
"And over here, I can add 3 to both sides of this equation."
And I'll get x is equal to 3.
So both of these numbers are solutions to this equation.
You could try it out.
If you do 7-- negative 7 squared is 49.
"Negative 7 times 4 is minus 28, or negative 28."
And that does indeed equal 21.
And I'll let you try it out with the positive 3.
"Actually, let's just do it."
"3 squared is 9, plus 4 times 3 is 12."
"9 plus 12 is, indeed, 21."
Let's do a bunch more examples.
Let's say I have x squared plus 49 is equal to 14x.
"Once again, whenever you see anything like this, get all of your terms on one side of the equation and get a 0 on the other side."
That's the best way to solve a quadratic equation.
So let's subtract 14x from both sides.
We could write this as x squared minus 14x plus 49 is equal to 0.
"Obviously, 14x minus 14x is 0."
This quantity minus 14x is this quantity right there.
"Now we just have to think about what two numbers, when I take their product, I'm going to get 49, and when I take their sum, I'm going to get negative 14."
"So one, they have to be the same sign because this is a positive number right here."
"Just think: all the cars, tractors, trucks, ships and planes in the world added together emit fewer greenhouse gasses than livestock farming!"
Oh really?
"Wow, I thought it was mostly cars."
Wow!
Wow!
Wow!
Livestock?
"That's crazy, so more than the cars."
Are you serious?
"Yeah, I didn't know that."
That's insane.
"No, I did not know that, no."
That's news to me.
I haven't heard that.
"I've never heard the livestock connection, no."
"Well I knew there was some, but I had no idea that it was so extensive."
How does it come from livestock exactly?
What do you call cow farts?
What do you call that?
OK ...
"Yeah, the methane gas coming from the cows."
Yeah.
"It's cow shit, right?"
Doesn't cow poop?
"It's what the emissions, right?"
"I thought it was just fat people here in the South, here in America."
"But no, apparently it's cattle as well."
It's quite worrying.
"Well I saw an article and they say, because it is the cow, what they fart and then actually the farting they make the global warming."
And how can it be that farm animals place a heavier burden on the environment than the entire transport sector worldwide?
"Well, actually it is rather simple."
Once upon a time a farmer was someone who owned land and some animals.
"Here it is, here's the two seconds."
-Balls to you!
"-Yeah, that's it."
Ballz to you!
"Yeah, now that clip's been floating around, it was posted like three days ago and suddenly it's everybody's catchphrase."
-Balls to you!
-Now I don't know why she said it.
I don't know the context.
"I can't imagine what the interviewer could've asked her to get her to say,"
-Balls to you!
-But everyone told me the rest of the interview went normal and that...
-Balls to you!
"-Was just one soundbite and she wasn't yelling, ""Balls to you"" to everyone."
"I mean, I would've yelled it to everyone, but she didn't."
But I'm on board.
Balls to you is hilarious.
"It's probably the best video that you've ever watched, you just don't realize it yet."
"Don't worry, you'll get it in like a week."
"You'll wake up in the middle of the night like,"
"""Oh, balls to me."""
And I sincerely hope that one of those YouTube guys makes a Balls To You remix.
"-Balls to you, b-balls to you"
"-Yeah, or something like that."
"Come on, balls to you doesn't have to be insulting."
It could be a term of endearment.
"Balls to you guy, sir."
[chuckles]
"Balls to you, sir."
Now I remember you guys sent me this video like a year ago and I thought it was funny but I didn't get time to review it.
"But now suddenly the video's blown up, which suggests that it aired on TV somewhere."
Now the concept of the video is simple.

Why exile left her son?
I am the one who was exiled
And lived in paths and its staleness
I sang to your name's letters
I stayed up for it
It grew old
It only cries that only left

That doesn't cured

The insurance people said that.. ..God has razed down my shop.
"Or, he's the One behind your shop's destruction."
"So, I said fine."
Ask God to compensate for my losses.
Case closed.
But why will God raze down your shop?
Fool!
Please.
Please come to the witness box and speak.
May Lord forgive his naiveness.
May Lord forgive his naiveness.
May Lord forgive his naiveness.
Why will God raze down my shop?
"Exactly, why will God raze down my shop?"
He has other important things to do.
"So, tell the insurance company to pay me."
End of matter.
Why will the insurance company pay you?
You've agreed to the terms and conditions.. ..of the insurance company.
"Exhibit no.1, sir."
Right.
Then God will have to compensate for it.
"Call upon, Lord Ram, Shiva, Ganpati.. ..Whoever you get along better with."

"You're turnover is in millions, and this is a small settlement."

Really.
There would still be music left to write
What else could I do
I'm so inspired by you
That hasn't happened for the longest time
Once I thought my innocence was gone
Now I know that happiness goes on
That's where you found me
When you put your arms around me
I haven't been there for the longest time
"Oh, oh, oh, oh"
For the longest time
"Oh, oh, oh"
For the longest
I'm that voice you're hearing in the hall
And the greatest miracle of all
Is how I need you
And how you needed me too
That hasn't happened for the longest time
Maybe this won't last very long
But you feel so right
And I could be wrong
Maybe I've been hoping too hard
But I've gone this far
And it's more than I hoped for
Who knows how much further we'll go on
Maybe I'll be sorry when you're gone
I'll take my chances
I forgot how nice romance is
I haven't been there for the longest time
I had second thoughts at the start
I said to myself
Hold on to your heart

Um-hm.
And I was surprised.
I went on there and that was really good.
"And it actually had the, uh."
"And then actually be able to watch it um, ."
Oh cool.
Yeah.
At first it had a mobile version on it.
Yep.

"Uh, we."
Redo.
Mm hm.
Are you talking about responsive design and the need for mobile compatibilit y?
That's come up.
I know that the directive of the White House wants the government to start making mobile devices stuff and there is a plan in place.
"It's a matter of how you take all that content because there is a lot of it, there is a large bit of it."
"It's really, it's very hard to design for it because they do every science in the world, right?"
Every type of science?
Right away!
You will talk with the foreman and will get the permission.
Thank you.
Is there any news from uncle Faruk?
What will happen if they find him?
Will he go to jail?
"He has to pay his debt, of course first he has to appear."
Give it! ~ Faruk calling.
"Yes, Faruk."
-Hi -I guess you need me more than you need her?
"Thanks, ..Thank you very much."
"How bad is the situation ,Faruk?"
"Very bad, very."
I am totally in a mess.
We guess so.
"Of course you're Umit's lawyer, you must know it."
But now I am here as a neighbor.
As much as I knew you were a hardworking man who loved his work.
We knew that everything was going well.
What happened that you came in this state?
"I made an investment in Japan,"
"I was in reserve incomes and a little risky but... ... the business was a flop, and the money lost."
Exactly.
"For a time being I managed by taking in cash from the account .. but after the rumors, everyone started to withdraw their money at the same time."
I was disintegrated.
How do you think to pay your debt?
Actually not everything is over...
There are also other investments I am waiting for the return.
"Those are solid, but I need at least 3 month till the money is back.. can't postpone the debts anymore."
"My problem is time, I don't have any other worry."
"Let's consider that you postponed your debts, how much can you pay?"
Everything.
A man who no longer believes in himself?
Stand up!
Stand up and fight!
Be a man!

"Yes...Antony, look at me!"
Look at me!
We'll fight!
"You may tell your Queen, Rufio, that I've received her tokens of submission and am most grateful"

Why are you still loyal to her?
Has she enchanted you as well?
I'm under orders from Caesar...
Caesar is dead!
I am Caesar now
You could be my ears in Alexandria
"Very well, then"
"Tell her that, before I can accept her offer,"
I would require some gesture of sincerity...
tell her to deliver to me... the head of Marc Antony
You may go...
Provide Octavius with what he requires and you'll find him most grateful
No
You must
"Your Majesty, in the name of lsis, please, do not forsake your country, your own child"
Not for love
It would be like stabbing my own heart
Better Antony than Egypt
Better that than your own son's life!
Take the knife
I want to share something with you
"I was hanging out with my sister the other day and I was, I was sitting in this chair, and my sister told me to stop fidgeting."
"To which I was like, A, rude, and B, I'm not fidgeting."
"I just, I really like sitting in different ways."
And I do.
"You know, if you know something about me, you know that."
So I thought I'd just quickly show you guys my favorite ways to sit on a chair.
"So to do this, I just need like, I need a chair, this one, this will do."
"I'll use this one, this will be fine."
"Basically, I mean, we can start with just a simple, a classic cheeks on the seat maneuver."
I really like to center myself.
"So I'm like, in position to sit down."
"Then I just, then I go from right here just to plopping down."
"And it, you know, like, it takes a little settling in on the sit bones to like, really find the comfort spot."
Some people find it right away.
"I have to search for it a little bit, and then you're"
"like, this is it."
And then that's it.
And you stay there.
Second move is just a little-- you guys know it.
It's the leg cross.
Knee over knee.
"I like to sit, I like to cross to the left."
"It's nice way to get, like a bit of a stretch in the glutes, as well as generally air out the situation."
There's nothing worse than a sweaty sit butt during a long meeting.
That's the worst.
"So I just, those are two."
JULlE KLAUSNER:
"Hi, Beth."
BETH HOYT:
Julie.
"Julie Klauser, everybody."
JULlE KLAUSNER:
"No, to the - We searched all the islands."
"We spent that first day just flying around the island, looking."
"So, we're coming in to land."
"Of course, it was slushy"
He touches the brakes - his right brake is froze up.
No brake.
"So, he's doing this with the 180."
You can see he's going to - didn't want to do something.
"So he said, ""Okay, hang on Brian."""
We're getting from here to the water or whatever it is.
"And he hit the rudder the other way, goosed it and shut the one brake flipped it around and goosed it."
We literally backed up to stop like that.
That was some pretty cool flying.
But I used to fly all the time with Joe.
We'd run over to the other island and we'd check and see if -
We hold all the mail on the freights from the airplane so he'd have two loads to do.
I'd jump in with him and
I'd handle the plane when I was twelve years old on the way back to Charlevoix sometimes.
I did get interested in the Air Force with stuff like that.
You actually handled a plane at twelve years?
"Oh yeah, he just flipped it over onto 195 to cross over."
I took a run at it.
"Not good, I'm sure."
But then the next day we'd help Johnny at a Model A pickup.
We all had
Model As.
"Not all of us, but 6, 7 of us had Model As."
So we went over to... the bodies at the Coast Guard station.
So we went over and picked up a map
And Kenny went with us.
"Kenny McDonough, the guy that died in Texas."
We jumped in Donegal Bay and went up to Iron Ore

"Well, we continue to look at the case of Assata Shakur,"
legendary figure within both first the Black Panther Party and then the Black Liberation Army.
On Thursday she became the first woman ever to make the FBl's Most Wanted Terrorists list.
"In addition, the FBI and the state of New Jersey doubled the reward for her capture to $2 million."
AG:
"To talk about her case,  we are joined by two people."
"Here in New York, Lennox Hinds, Assata Shakur's longtime attorney, he has represented her since 1973."
He's a professor of criminal justice at Rutgers University.
"And in Chicago, we're joined by the world-renowned author, activist, scholar, Angela Davis, also a professor at University of California,  Santa Cruz."
"And she is the subject of a recent film, Free Angela and All Political Prisoners."
Angela Davis and Lennox Hinds both wrote forewords to the book Assata:
An Autobiography.
"We invited the FBI to join us on today's program, but they did not respond to our request."
"I wanted to start with you, Lennox Hinds."
Get it off!

Emily was taken to her room and soon fell into a deep sleep.
The whole thing was a complete failure.
Describe her behavior from the night of the failed exorcism... ...until the time of her death.
Violence towards others and herself.
Sometimes she screamed for hours on end.
"She drove her head through windows, tried to bite..."
"Tried to bite holes in the walls, breaking several more of her teeth... ...as you saw in the postmortem photograph."
- You witnessed this?
"- Some of it, yes."
I tried to visit every day... ...and the family told me the rest.
Did you attempt another exorcism?
"I wanted to, but Emily refused."
"produces a zero, and in the second component I have a"
"minus one and a four, they combine to give the three."
But look at this picture.
So here's our key picture.
I combine this column and this column to get this guy.
That was the b.
That's the zero three.
Okay.
So that idea of
"linear combination is crucial, and also -- do we want to think"
about this question?
"Sure, why not."
What are all the combinations?
If I took -- can I go back to xs and ys?
This is a question for
"really -- it's going to come up over and over, but why don't we see it"
once now?
"If I took all the xs and all the ys, all the combinations,"
what would be all the results?
"And, actually,"
the result would be that I could get any right-hand side at all.
The combinations of this and this would fill the whole plane.
You can tuck that away.
"We'll, explore it further."
But this idea
of what linear combination gives b and what do all the linear
"combinations give, what are all the possible,"
achievable right-hand sides be -- that's going to be basic.
Okay.
Can I move to three equations and three unknowns?
Because it's easy to picture the two by two case.
Let me do a three by three example.
What if I told you that I wasn't getting older ... but I was getting younger than everybody else?
I was born with some form of disease.
Voice:
What kind of disease?
BP:
I was born old.
Man:
I'm sorry.
BP:
No need to be.
There's nothing wrong with old age.
Girl:
Are you sick?
BP:
"I heard momma and Tizzy whisper, and they said I was gonna die soon."
But ... maybe not.
Girl:
You're different than anybody I've ever met.
BB:
"There were many changes ... some you could see, some you couldn't."
"Hair started growing in all sorts of places, along with other things."
"I felt pretty good, considering."
Ed Ulbrich:
"That was a clip from ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button."""
"Many of you, maybe you've seen it or you've heard of the story, but what you might not know is that for nearly the first hour of the film, the main character, Benjamin Button, who's played by Brad Pitt, is completely computer-generated from the neck up."
"Now, there's no use of prosthetic makeup or photography of Brad superimposed over another actor's body."
We've created a completely digital human head.
So I'd like to start with a little bit of history on the project.
This is based on an F. Scott Fitzgerald short story.
It's about a man who's born old and lives his life in reverse.
"Now, this movie has floated around Hollywood for well over half a century, and we first got involved with the project in the early '90s, with Ron Howard as the director."
We took a lot of meetings and we seriously considered it.
Let me see.
Copy and paste it.
Let me copy and paste the next several problems.
We could just move-- be streamlined about it.
"OK, they all fit."
Good enough.
What is the equation of the line that has slope of 4 and passes through the point 3 comma minus 10?
"So if the slope is 4, we know that the line-- so just rewrite it in slope y-intercept form again. mx plus b."
They're telling us that the slope is 4.
So we know the equation of the line is y is equal to 4x plus the y-intercept.
And then we could figure out the y-intercept by substituting in this point that they say it goes through.
So it goes through the point 3 comma negative 10.
So y is equal to minus 10 when x is equal to 3.
So 4 times x. x is equal to 3.
Plus b.
So what is that?
That's minus 10 is equal to 12 plus b.
"We could subtract 12 from both sides of this equation, and we get minus 22."
Minus 10 minus 12 is minus 22.
This 12 obviously goes away.
Is equal to b.
"So the equation of our line is y is equal to 4x plus b, which we just figured out is minus 22."
4x minus 22.
That's choice A.
Problem 30.
"The date in the table show the cost of renting a bicycle by the hour, including a deposit."
"If hours, h, were graphed on the horizontal axis-- let me see if I can draw that."
"So that is on the horizontal axis I have hours, h."
So this is h.
"And costs were graphed on the vertical axis, so let me draw the vertical axis."
So cost is on the vertical axis.
What would be the equation of the line that fits the data?
Please....
"Okay, here's the deal."
I have an explanation for### this picture
I'm gonna back it up as soon as this hooker comes in here and tells you she's not with the mayor last night
Having the police pick her up right now.
On what charge?
"I don't know, James."
Let's keep our fingers crossed and hope she does soemthing illegal while she's trying to get people to pay her to have sex
Don't bother Mike
I already talked to her.
"And she 's already writing a book detailing### her 5 year-relationship with the mayor, sorry buddy"
"Carter, do something"
"So, we still on### for tonight?"
"She's lying, Jason."
How could you possibly know that?
Do you have some kind of alibi?
No.
I don't
Mike's mom is the perfect alibi
Should I go remind him?
Only if you're bucking#### for a promotion.
Wait a minute.
So close!
"Under three, high twos."
I had a two hour and fifty-something.
Thanks for coming!
"As Gerry said, I tried to avoid giving  this talk, but couldn't get out of it."
I came here to tell you that  I organize TEDx events.
I have three under my belt and  a fourth is due in a couple of months.
"And I do it because my Mom  inspired me to do so as her father inspired her,  to do things wholeheartedly."
"Well, it turns out that it's been  a year since she passed away."
"She had been struggling  with cancer for two years and she had a stroke three days  before my last event, which left her quadriplegic  and unable to speak or move."
And if I'm offered to drive in a
Ferrari I don't ask questions.
I just drive it.
The problem with this situation is that I'm now at
least a year late to reviewing the Spider.
You've all read about it and watched the video so you need to see something different.
"Now I've searched YouTube and there are lots of beautiful shoots and factual films, but there isn't much bad behavior."

Very direct steering.
I've got the suspension in full firm at the moment.
But I might just try and soften it off a bit and see what it does.

"Well, get back the ball!"
But you shot it!
"Yes I did, but it bounced back from you!"
"Oh, Coward, coward!"
"Coward, are you afraid of dogs?!"
Why are you sitting at home?
On your own ...
Well ...
"Mind you Mitya, don't touch these pills!"
They are magical.
"Wow, That's great!"
Yeah-yeh.
If you'd eat one you'd immediately turn to stone.
Why didn't YOU turn to stone?
Only children turn to stone For grown-up it's just a cure for the common cold.
Will it turn dogs to stone too?
"Yes, Mitya, It will, very much so."
What do you want?
"I say, ""Time out."
"Stop."""
"You guys know the show, we use take one, we don't do take two."
"There's no writing, there's no scripting, there's no nonsense."
"We don't fool around, we don't rehearse -- we shoot what we get!"
"I said, ""Stop."
"This is nuts."""
"I mean, you know."
(Laughter)
"""This is crazy."
"We can't do this."""
"And Albert's like, ""What?"""
"And I'm like, ""I don't know what just happened, but there are testicles in this bucket and that's not how we do it."""
"And he said ""Well, that's how we do it."""
"And I said, ""Why would you do it this way?"""
"And before I even let him explain,"
"I said, ""I want to do it the right way, with the rubber bands."""
"And he says, ""Like the Humane Society?"""
"And I said, ""Yes, like the Humane Society."
"Let's do something that doesn't make the lamb squeal and bleed -- we're on in five continents, dude."
"We're on twice a day on the Discovery Channel -- we can't do this."""
"He says, ""OK."""
He goes to his box and he pulls out a bag of these little rubber bands.
"Melanie picks up another lamb, puts it on the post, band goes on the tail, band goes on the scrotum."
"Lamb goes on the ground, lamb takes two steps, falls down, gets up, shakes a little, takes another couple steps, falls down."
"I'm like, this is not a good sign for this lamb, at all."
"Gets up, walks to the corner, it's quivering, and it lies down and it's in obvious distress."
"And I'm looking at the lamb and I say, ""Albert, how long?"
"When does he get up?"""
"He's like, ""A day."""
"I said, ""A day!"
"How long does it take them to fall off?"""
"And they gave them to 1,500 people."
It's in a book called Break Point and Beyond.
"And on the protocol of the test, if you scored  above a certain level, you'd be considered to be a genius at divergent thinking."
Okay?
"So, my question to you is, what percentage of the people tested, of the 1500, scored at genius level for divergent thinking?"
You need to know one more thing about them.
These were kindergarten children.
"So, what you think?"
What percentage at genius level?
(Audience member) 80.
"(Ken Robinson) You think 80, okay."
98%.
"Now, the thing about this was, it was a longitudinal study."
"So, they retested the same children five years later."
Age of eight to ten.
What do you think?
50?
"They retested them again, five years later,  ages 13 to 15."
"You can see a trend here, can't you"
[laughter]?
"Now, this tells an interesting story."
"Because you could have imagined it going the other way, couldn't you."
"You start off not being very good, but you get better  as you get older."
But this shows two things.
"One is, we all have this capacity."
"And two, it mostly deteriorates."
"Now, a lot of things have happened to these kids as they've grown up, a lot."
"But one of the most important things that happened to them,"
"I am convinced, is that by now, they've become educated."
"They know, they spent 10 years at school being told there's one answer."
It's at the back and don't look.
"And don't copy, because that's cheating."
You have to do 3 minus i over 3 minus i.
"I'm doing that because when you multiply a complex number by its conjugate, you end up actually with a real number."
Then you're going to end up with a complex number up here.
"A conjugate, all it means is you keep the real part the same, and you change the sign on the imaginary part."
That's all that word means.
"All right, now let's figure out what this is equal to."
"2 times 3, just same distributive properties as always."
Let me do it in green.
2 times 3 is 6.
"2 times minus i is minus 2i, all of that over 3 times 3 is 9."
3 times minus i is minus 3i. i times 3 is plus 3i.
"Then i times minus i, you can view that as minus i squared."
Let's think about what this is equal to.
"Well, this plus 3i and the minus 3i cancel out."
What's i squared?
"Well, this is equal to negative 1."
So you end up with a minus of a negative 1.
Minus a negative 1 is a plus 1.
So you're left with 6 minus 2i over 9 plus 1 over 10.
"Actually, we can reduce this some."
We can divide the top and the bottom by 2.
So that becomes 3 minus i over 5.
We just divided both the numerator and the denominator by 2.
That is choice B.
"Problem 29, these go fast."
No systems of equations and all that.
What is the product of the complex numbers 3 plus i and 3 minus i?
They just asked us that.
That was in the last problem.
"When we multiplied 3 plus i times 3 minus i, what did we get?"
We got 10.
We did this whole thing.
But that was some of the stuff.
"There's a lot of routine stuff, a lot of fun."
Different countries.
50-something countries I got into.
"You can see just, some of them listed and..."
"Bangkok, Tokyo, got all that stuff over there in Vietnam"
Different things.
Fun.
I almost stayed in but there were some conflicts and I didn't...
Conflicts with - ?
"At home here, little things were going on."
"If I had stayed in, at Staff Sergeant, I had orders direct from headquarters from Air Force by name."
They were going to ship the first squad of 130s over to Vietnam.
And I was the instructor.
"And there was another guy who just - he had probably 5 or 6 years, he was just a little more than me, and he would have been the NCOlC in charge, and I would have been in charge of instructing and creating the instructions."
"As soon as I put my foot there, the job called for"
"Master Sergeants, both jobs."
"And the Air Force can fill them with one rank less, if they didn't have a Master"
Sergeant.
"So they guaranteed me Tech Sergeant, so I would have been in the Air Force four and a half years, and would have been Tech"
Sergeant.
"And, hell, this guy was retired with that."
"But, maybe I wouldn't have come out of Vietnam either."
But that wasn't the reason I got out.
Different things were going on at the time.
So about what year did you get out?
The end of '64.
The end of August.
I was just in for four years.
Two thousand hours flying time and another... other airplanes too.
"When you got out, where did you come to?"
I went to Grand Rapids and stayed with one of my sisters.
I was struck that these students knew more than I did.
I was in med school and was one of the best in my class in Uppsala.
But these Indians knew more than I did.
"I was thinking, ""This can't be right."
"They're Hindu!"""
"""They have caste marks and limited schooling."" But they were brilliant."
The first day I attended a course in internal medicine.
The instructor questioned us on renal cancer.
"After the fourth question I couldn't answer any more, but they knew more."
It was a strange experience.
Stockholm City Hall - Have you lectured here?
"- No, but I've eaten dinner here."
This ceiling is Stockholm's best big screen.

Rehearsal Knowledge Gala 2008 Let's see how close we can get...
- Hi!
Hans Rosling.
- We're testing your equipment.
"So, that's it?"
"Wow, that's gorgeous!"
So you take care of this machine?
And then you project from here...
Doesn't that cause distortion?
"It creates a nice feeling, like the ceiling tilting."
Our presentation comes from page...
Here!
This is a great picture.
Mom and Dad are in our basement in SvartbŠcken with the box for us in Mozambique where Agneta and I worked.
Food was extremely scarce in communist Mozambique.
"They packed crispbread, fish balls, spaghetti and raisins."
The kids loved it when the box from home arrived.
"In autumn 1967 I helped arrange a meeting in Uppsala for Eduardo Mondlane, first leader of Mozambique's liberation front."
Janelle I'm so sorry.
I should've talked to you first
You're nervous.
I understand.
Let me make it up.
We're going to that Italian restaurant we saw
I'll get you a nice-a table by the fireplace-a.
"Hey Ross, Rachel."
"Hi, I just wanted to come in and say that I think it's great."
Two peopel who work together are having an open and honest relationship
"Well, I think that relationships that could potentially ruin people's professional careers should be left confidential."
For how long
Five months
"So, what do we do now"
"Well, sir, it's not like we can just make it go away."
"I mean, let's face it."
You let the genie out of the bottle.
We only kissed
What's up Carter
James.
Romantic complications.
The guy I'm seeing is a boxer.
"Yesterday, I was overcome with emotion and I accientially outed### him."
"Personally, I think bennet should be proud of who he is, but, uh, I may have irreparably damaged his career."
"Bottom line is, I care about the guy."
He's not returning my calls
I'm here for you buddy
It was an awkward moment and somehow it led to a kiss
But we're both single consenting adults and if we choose to move forward as a couple
Ms Cooper would undoubtedly take a different job here in city hall.
"I however, would still be the mayor"
Why are you being so upfront with us
It's not because of that...&amp;gt; get in..
"By the way I am sorry,yesterday your night was destroyed because of us."
It wasn't my night.- Your date with Eylul was left incomplete.
"It was not for me, Mert and Eylul had a date."
Mert didn't want to be alone as it was the first time and I had to do it.
I understood.
Ehh?...
What are we doing now?
"In fact this is the whole bazaar but there are two more places i can show, or we can go... if you want"
Then show me ...
I will be pleased... !
I wish I could see your home too.
"Okay, you're a very stubborn!"
Are you hungry?
"In fact, I didn't eat properly since yesterday."
"Let's go then, I will take you to eat the best meatballs you can ever eat in your life.&amp;gt; Okay."
It's superb..
"There is no one,who doesn't enter if this smell gets on his nose,if there is money in the pocket,can't escape this place"
Excuse me!
"- Tell me , what do you need?"
"Please , sister."
Can we have some red pepper flakes - Of course- And from those little pickle peppers if you have.
I'll bring it right away.
Shall I ask for one more portion from the grill?
"In fact my stomach is full , but my eye not."
I will share it together.
"Master, can you prepare another one in the grill please?"
"The engine is ruined , master."
"it can't be repaired, it has to be changed."
"You talk with that man, if he agrees we will get it done."
"No, impossible, it can't be done before a week."
We also had a place where we ate meatballs in the way Bodrum.
"I start at the beginning of each list, and I say is one less than three?"
Sure.
So that says one should be the first element in my merge list.
"Now, compare the first element in each of these lists."
"Two is less than three, so two ought to be the next element of the list."
And you get the idea.
What am I going to do next?
I'm going to compare three against four.
"Three is the smallest one, and I'm going to compare four games twelve, which is going to give me four."
And then what do?
"I have to do twelve against thirty, twelve is smaller, take that out."
"Seventeen against thirty, twenty-four against thirty And by this stage I've got nothing left in this element, so I just add the rest of that list in."
"Wow I can sort two lists, so I can merge two lists."
I said it poorly.
What's the point?
How many operations did it take me to do this?
"Seven comparisons, right?"
I've got eight elements.
"It took me seven comparisons, because I can take advantage of the fact I know I only ever have to look at the first element of each sub-list."
"Those are the only things I need to compare, and when I run out of one list, I just add the rest of the list in."
What's the order of complexity of merging?
I heard it somewhere very quietly.
STUDENT: n.
PROFESSOR:
"Sorry, and thank you."
"Linear, absolutely right?"
And what's n by the way here?
What's it measuring?
STUDENT:
[UNlNTELLlGIBLE]
PROFESSOR:
"In both lists, right."
Because it is one of the best music schools of the world.
They accept very few students.

Go Mira!
- Don't Yaman!
"Your mom saw you, it's a shame...!"
"Mira, I said go .please!- Don't do this Yaman, it's a pity for the woman..."
While that man is by her side I won't take a step to her again.
Go for the sake of your mom..
"Mira please, can you continue?"
Let's go to the other side before traffic starts or you will miss your lessons.
"You also go as soon as possible, I will send these to a reeve..."
"Look here, don't act like this!"
"See, he is in a good mood."
He came to see you from a distance.
"He is in beautiful cars,with beautiful girls.What do you want more?"
He has a real job!
I won't tell your brother you are here.
He has an opportunity to save his life.
He will take exams for a scholarship at university .. and I don't want anything to distract Yaman until then.
"Lawyer, you tell Yaman I want to see him,"
let him decide whether he will come.
You can see him only at the end of the month.
Then find a way so they keep me here until the end of the month.
"Mr. Selim, please."
"Soon I will be in front of the committee, they will send me back to jail."
"I think they should send you there, because you're more intelligent than me..."
Stay in jail like a man for 11 months.
Don't involve your brother too.
"Just this morning you were ranting man, what changed now?"
"I came back from a big mistake, Yaman."
Eylul didn't betray Mira.
it is one of the first column and two of the second column and let's
just see what we get.
So in the first component I'm
getting a two and a ten.
I'm getting a twelve there.
"In the second component I'm getting a one and a six, I'm"
getting a seven.
So that matrix times that vector is
twelve seven.
"Now, you could do that another way."
You could do it a row at a time.
And you would get this twelve --
and actually I pretty much did it here -- this way.
Two -- I could take that row times my vector.
This is the idea of a
dot product.
"This vector times this vector, two times one plus five"
times two is the twelve.
This vector times this vector --
one times one plus three times two is the seven.
"So I can do it by rows, and in each row times my x is what"
I'll later call a dot product.
But I also like to see it by
columns.
I see this as a linear combination of a column.
So here's my point.
A times x is a combination of the
columns of A. That's how I hope you will think of A times x when we need
it.
"Right now we've got -- with small ones, we can always do it"
"in different ways, but later, think of it that way."
Okay.
"(Male announcer) This is the &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Masterchef&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; kitchen, where, for one home cook, dreams will become a reality."
[Cheers]
"After searching across the entire country for America's finest home chefs, we've narrowed it down to 18."
I'm a food photographer.
I'm a graduate student.
I'm a stockbroker.
This is the opportunity of a lifetime for me.
"(Announcer) But to earn the title of Masterchef, they must impress three of the biggest names in the culinary world..."
Joe Bastianich...
"The hallmarks of a Masterchef are elegance, sophistication, and finesse."
- (Announcer) Graham Elliot...
"- To me, a Masterchef is constantly innovating."
(Announcer) And Gordon Ramsay.
A true Masterchef puts perfection on every plate.
"(Announcer) Tonight, the competition officially begins."
We're looking for one stunning dish.
(Announcer) And with that comes twists...
What the heck is gonna happen now?
(Announcer) Turns...
Fire.
Fire.
(Announcer) And tears.
The search for America's next Masterchef begins now.
"Thousands of cooks have already been eliminated, and only 18 remain in the search for America's next Masterchef."
Now it's time for these top home cooks to take their place in the &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Masterchef&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; kitchen.
(Michael) Walking into the &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Masterchef &amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; kitchen for the first time is incredible.
"It's such a beautiful kitchen, you know."
It's the kitchen that I've always dreamed of.
(Josh) The &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Masterchef&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; kitchen even has its own bar and restaurant.
"Man, this is crazy."
It's freakin' awesome.
I have never seen so many glorious bottles of wine.
But I think it's too early to say exactly how it will be played out.
We're
looking forward to the partnership announcements later this year. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Thank you. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; PAARGlA:
"Florian Samuel Paargia, TWN."
What about the responsibility from Google?
"You asked where can I find the Egyptian things and stuff, then you got the answer at the Pergamon Museum."
"I assume most of the people believe that now, but that answer is wrong."
"Your time is--in Berlin, I assume, very limited, so if you want to see the Egyptian stuff, you get that information, now, you're ending up in the wrong museum."
Thanks. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:
"Okay, so what was the right museum? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; PAARGlA:"
It's in the so-called Old Museum and Altes Museum.
It's very close to it... &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:
"Okay. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; PAARGlA: ...but the Pergamon Museum is, as far as I know, not known or famous for Egyptian stuff."
It's famous for something--other things.
Thanks. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:
Okay.
"Well, I will--I will defer to the--to the unique knowledge that this audience has to debate that point."
Thank you.
More questions. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; KELVlN:
This is Kelvin from Shenzhen State
Micro Technology in China.
First question is about the applications to Hugo.
"Just now, you were playing the Lady Gaga, Just Dance, and you will have to stop it by finger-click, right?"
You can't stop it by yelling at it?
Can you stop it by yelling at it? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:
"Can you yell at--if you yell at the Lady Gaga video, it will stop? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; KELVlN:"
To stop it. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:
Or will she yell back?
"Do you have a personal relationship, Hugo, with Lady Gaga? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; KELVlN:"
"Oh, I don't know."
"The question actually is about, is your Android platform the ear of your supercomputer, or if the voice control can control the mobile phone itself? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:"
"Hugo, do you want to go ahead and answer? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BARRA:"
"Btw, another great medicine that reduces inflammation is aspirin."
S:
"Aspirin, I've heard of that!"
Dr:
It's a helluva drug!
"Again, there are side effects to aspirin, it can effect bleeding, but at the same time, it gives dramatic effect by lowering inflammation."
S:
Right.
"And that is the main side effect, it's an age-old drug, and it's a blood thinner, if you get a cut or you bleed while taking aspirin, you might bleed more."
Dr:
Right.
"Blood thinner is a funny word, I'm not sure what it means."
I keep thinking paint thinner when you say that.
S:
That's how I imagine it.
Dr:
"It binds to the platelets and blocks them from activating, it stops them from working very well."
S:
It's more anti-clotting?
Dr:
Right.
"And platelets are one of the key components in clotting, and they certainly affect it."
S:
"So your blood will have the same viscosity, it just won't clot as easily."
Dr:
Exactly.
And you could certainly paint a wall with either one.
S:
That's a little morbid.
Thanks so much
"For one of these things to be in the return value, two things have to be true."
"First, it has to actually match this regular expression."
You're worse because you have the power but you won't use it!
You are the one that doesn't know how to protect.
I have forgotten too much.
I have to go to China in this ship to pay you back.
So that's why you agreed to such a high interest.
"Since my ship is not setting sail, you're the only one that's making money here."
Ten thousand yang a day.
Am I the only one that's benefitting from the ship not setting sail?
That is why I am going to put the bait out tonight.
"If the bait is out and we put out the trap, the mice will be caught!"
He's showing him the girls!
Does he suspect Gil Dong hyung?
"He must have gone along with him to not arouse suspicion, but how infuriating!"
We have to come out aggressively so that they will fear us.
But isn't this too much?
"You know this business well, don't you?"
"Be gentle, won't you?"
I'm scared I can't even look at them!
You will get your money only if the ship sets sail.
"If you stand here, you will have a nice view of all the mice."
Throw them in!
"Yes, sir!"
Help us!
Help us!
"We'll send them into the water, so they can have them back!"
Save us!
Please help us!
What is it?
You want to help them?
"If he does something, it's all over."
Then should he let them all die?
"When he gives the signal, we go."
Thank God.
"It would have been sad if I wasted two videos and ended up with a careless, negative number."
Anyway.
"So now we have s squared plus a squared, over s squared, times y is equal to this."
Multiply both sides times s squared over-- s squared plus a squared.
"Divide both sides by this, and we get y is equal to 1 over s squared-- And actually, let me make sure that that is right."
"It's 1 over s squared. y is equal to 1 over s squared, times s squared, over s squared plus a squared."
And then these cancel out.
And let me make sure that I haven't made another careless mistake.
Because I have a feeling I have.
Yep.
There.
I see the careless mistake.
And it was all in this term.
"And I hope you don't mind my careless mistakes, but I want you to see that I'm doing these things in real time and"
"I am human, in case you haven't realized already."
"Anyway, so I made the same careless mistake."
"So I factor out an e to the minus st here, so it's plus."
But it was a over s squared.
So this is an a.
That's an a.
And so this is an a.
And so this is an a.
And so this is an a.
Right?
This was an a.
And this is the correct answer. a over s squared plus a squared.
So I hope those careless mistakes didn't throw you off too much.
These things happen when you do integration by parts twice with a bunch of variables.
"But anyway, now we are ready to add a significant entry into our table of Laplace transforms."
"And that is that the Laplace transform-- I had an extra curl, there."
That was unecessary.
"When they got back to [?] and found out about three days later, the nun gets a letter from the - the nun that was the principal there and she'd never want to see us here at Beaver"
Island again.
"All we did was, they had Lloyd's cabin out there"
A bunch of the cabins like that.
And the chaperones are in one and the kids are in one.
So Gary and I and a couple of - we just showed up and we went and had refreshments for them until about 5 in the morning.
"Poor kids get on the boat, and Dad was on the boat going over to Charlevoix at the time."
He was the manager.
I had to go over for some reason or other.
I forget what the reason was.
It was rougher than hell.
So I just called the airplane.
I flew.
I wasn't gonna take the boat.
So I get over there and get cleaned up and everything.
I hadn't had enough sleep either.
You had to hollow them all down.
Now you got them all partied up and we had to take them all down to the boat.
The students at the party we went to all night.
"So, your high school class was hollowing what students now?"
The students from [?] that were over here - going back and forth to visit.
So then I got to Charlevoix because I'm down at the dock.
The old man was catching the line and stuff.
I'm looking up and here they are.
And they are green.
Some thought it was the greatest thing that ever happened.
I ... at a cattle sale.
A restaurant there.
Because they're working in the restaurants and stuff like that.
It was - I thought I was in love with this one but she was pretty rich so that didn't help any.
For the night.
We had a dance you know.
I'm going to do this problem thinking out loud.
"So you can actually, honestly hear what's going on in my mind while I do a calculation of this size."
"Now, I have to apologize to our magician friend Lennart Green."
"I know as a magician we're not supposed to reveal our secrets, but I'm not too afraid that people are going to start doing my show next week, so --"

(Laughter) (Applause)
"So, let's see,"
"let's take a different row of people, starting with you."
"I'll get five digits: one, two, three, four."
"Oh, I did this row already."
"Let's do the row before you, starting with you: one, two, three, four, five."
"Call out a single digit -- that will be the five-digit number that I will try to square, go ahead."
Five.
Seven.
Six.
Eight.
Three.
"57,683 -- squared."
Yuck.
Let me explain to you how I'm going to attempt this problem.
I'm going to break the problem down into three parts.
"I'll do 57,000 squared, plus 683 squared, plus 57,000 times 683 times two."
"Add all those numbers together, and with any luck, arrive at the answer."
"Now, let me recap."
(Laughter)
Thank you.
(Laughter)
While I explain something else -- (Laughter)
"-- I know, that you can use, right?"
(Laughter)
"While I do these calculations, you might hear certain words, as opposed to numbers, creep into the calculation."
Let me explain what that is.
Do you know what goes on on the internet?
Are you sure you are my teacher?
Are you sure you are my teacher?
(echo)
Are you going to learn how to use the technology?
I am a digital native.
Do computers scare you?
Are you afraid to use them?
Have you been on facebook?
Have you been on twitter?
Have you been surfing?
Do you even know what is on the internet?
Are you going to be my teacher?
Or just that textbook?
Because I want to know... what the world has to offer
And if you are not on the internet... and know nothing about computers. you can't be my teacher!
I said you can't be my teacher.
Make room for somebody who knows how to use the internet.
Do you think I am going to be ready?
Do you think I am going to be ready?
Do you think you are preparing me for the world that I have to live in?
Do you think I am going to be ready?
That's your job!
That's your job!
(echo)
Do you really think it is possible to be an educator in the information age and not use the internet?
"Continue to pretend, maybe the internet is just a fad."
Life was sort of stressful.
I couldn't sleep because of the fact that I was always thinking about how I could pay the creditors.
One of the ways that I thought I could solve it was having a lot of jobs.
At it's peak I had six jobs.
It was hard work because I was taking my annual leave and working weekends and evenings.
They planned to and succeeded in deflect the blameto my father...
"Did you say 'they', sir."
Mahir!Who are those who want to accuse your father?
Some mobsters wanted to imposecost on store owners...
"My father and I, stopped themand protect them than from the racketeering"
We will never allowto exploit our peopleand steal their money...
We wanted to prevent these bastardsto get closer to our neighborhood...
And how did that work?Are you the police? no
I understand.
"That's what you do with force,as gangstersprotect your people, do not you?"
"My father and Iwe are not gangsters,Mr. Judge!"
"We just defendedour neighbors and their lives,their efforts..."
That's all we've done!
Whatever!...This is not a the main subject...
We will not discussthe racketeering
"I do not wantthat to mention it any longer ,Do you understand me?"
Ma'am.
"Judge,It is very important for the trial..."
"That is not in the file,let's go back to our case..."
You are invited todayto witnessabout what you know about the relationship of your fatherand your biological motherand where are you in all this!
"Mrs. Judge,you will ask me if my fatherwas an enemy of the late Mr. Sulaiman!"
"Do not guess,but answermy questions!"
did My fatherhate mr.
Suleiman...
I've never heard him mentionProsecutors Suleiman .. well.And what about your mother Kader Alton ?What 's wrong with her ? did your Father separated from her?
"You do not knowmy father , sir."
Judge !
He never intended toseparate a mother from a son...
Really?
Did you father evermentioned thatYour real mother lives in Istanbul ?
Neither I nor my father did not knowshe's in IstanbulMrs. .
Judge...
He is cautious of us as well.
We haven't been able to find his headquarters.
"After the ship has left, we will send our men as we agreed."
Please do not concern yourself any longer about that ship.
You mean there is no evidence of any trade of weapons by Yongmun?
Yes.
They have amassed great wealth by trading with China.
But they have never traded in weapons.
Alright.
But there was a small commotion involving Yongmun.
"Although they weren't directly involved, someone filed a report against the loan shark Choi Chul Joo, who borrowed a warehouse from Yongmun."
Choi Chul Joo?
What kind of man is he?
He is a loan shark rumored to have a past as a bandit.
So Yongmun has business arrangements with such a man?
It's Yongmun.
It looks like a funeral procession.
Let's stand aside and let them pass.
"The dead girl is said to have died while running away from Choi Chul Joo. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Oh, how terrible!"
How terrible!&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
They... they are one with the men that killed our daughter!
They're one with them!
- What do I do now?
- Compose yourself!
Move along!
- No!
- Will you kill my son too!
You evil men!
Sheath your swords!
Let's go!
- You evil wretches!
- Are you alright?
"Okay, so put some ones down here."
This is the last n-by-n block.
"Put some ones there, and this is N plus one down."
Put it there.
Put it there.
"So let's put these 1's down, cuz it's easy."
Then we'll work on these last four.
Everybody good with that?
Okay.
"We'll start this back up, we can have the lights back down, mood lighting."
"There we go, so first of all I guess we'll have to do that, get rid of that seven."
So first let's go ahead and put in those 1's.
So first of all we have -four on the diagonal not one.
"Second of all, we have 1's on the edges."
"We have a, two 1's out there, and then we have two ones over here."
"And what do they, where are they located?"
"Well, the two, if you look at what we did here, and at my notation this at, all the way at negative N, minus M. And this is it, minus M."
"And is five, this is, so there are four by 4s that are sitting inside of these things, right."
"Cause I picked five points, but really it's the interior four that matter, okay."
Alright.
And then over here I have M and N minus M. If I do a spy on that.
Here's what I got so far.
Look at that.
Kinda nice.
Laying down some diagonals.
Everybody cool with that?
Alright.
I've laid down the easy ones.
"So, so what I'm working with is the M I picked is how many points I'm going to happen this way and this way."
"So, right?"
"I have five points, but remember the last point is the same as the first so it's really and four."
"That's why I come down here and say, I have a four by four block right here, and at the fifth location, I drop this."
side.
I just cooked it up by adding this one to this one.
"Now, what's the solution with this new right-hand side?"
The solution with this new right-hand side is clear.
took one of these and none of those.
"So actually, it just changed around"
to this when I took this new right-hand side.
Okay.
"So in the row picture, I have three different planes,"
three new planes meeting now at this point.
"In the column picture,"
"I have the same three columns, but now I'm combining them"
"to produce this guy, and it turned out that column one"
plus column two which would be somewhere -- there is the right
column -- one of this and one of this would give me the new b.
Okay.
So we squeezed in an extra example.
"But now think about all bs,"
all right-hand sides.
Can I solve these equations for
every right-hand side?
Can I ask that question?
So that's the algebra question.
Can I solve A x=b for every b?
Let
me write that down.
Can I solve A x =b for every
right-hand side b?
"I mean, is there a solution?"
"And then, if there is, elimination will give me a way to find it."
"I really wanted to ask, is there a solution for every right-hand side?"
"So now, can I put that in different words -- in this linear"
The guys haven't finished the cake.
The was 1 whole piece and and one piece already bitten
The birthday party was interesting and joyful!
INTERESTlNG AND JOYFUll!
When the guests left the pupil was alone and he started to think
First he thought:
"""Where should I look to?... yet... to all the sides: upwards and downwards, in breadth and deep down to the left and to the right, forward and backwards expands a pointless space of our arythmic efforts and claims"
"So, which side sould I look at?"
MOTHER
THANK YOU
MOTHER
THANK YOU
MOTHER.
Mother gave 1 rouble to the pupil.
"And told him to buy 3 packs of milk 16 copecks each and 1 long loaf of ""RlGA"" bread, if there will be one."
AND WHAT IF THERE WON'T BE ANY???
"Then, buy a half of any ""black"" (rye) bread, but a fresh one!"
The pupil has done everything as the mother told him.
"He has bought 2 packs of milk and a half of ""Borodinsky"" bread"
"Since the ""RlGA"" bread WASN'T THERE!!!!!"
When he came home the pupil has given the purchase to the mother and the change left from 1 rouble
But not all of it!
The mother has allowed him to keep the copper coins
The pupil took a place near the window and started to think
First he though:
"""Twelve per night!?"
"Around 100 - 120... """
Then he thougt:
"""The circle is outlined."
"And nowere to go..."""
"""But if to think properly, the is always one correct solution"""
"At the same time other voices are persistenly saying, that YOU are not alone here."
"Good, so, I'm not gonna write it out, but you can write this out, ok?"
I'm gonna put dot dot dot there which means you finish the argument.
Ok?
"The other thing, of course, to check is that q and q are not zero."
Are they not zero?
"Well, by the ordered pair... the set we defined, it's not."
So you don't have to worry.
"Ok, great."
What is the second thing that you might check?
Symmetry!
"Ok q... is p coma... ok, what does that mean?"
"If p q tilde m n, does that imply, m n tilde p q?"
"First of all, do you agree that this is what we have to show?"
Good.
"Secondly, do you... can you see how you write this out?"
"Which, I won't bore you with."
"Yeah... this condition mean p m equals q n and this condition means this this equals this this, m q equals n p, is that the same thing?"
"Yes, Adam says it's the same thing, so, again, I'll let you finish that argument."
"Now, the third one is perhaps the most interesting one."
The third thing to check.
"Because if you look at it, it's actually not so obvious."
"Oh, I realize I could have used that board, but that's ok."
"Ok, this one says if p q tilde m n..."
"I gotta check that this... and if m n tilde... give me another pair of letters, maybe a b, then, is it true that p q tilde a b?"
There is a question.
Is that true?
"Ok, so this actually where it is very important to just be a little careful, ok?"
"So I'm gonna give you a hint as to how one goes, and you can verify this, ok?"
For a little bit of homework for next time.
"So one thing that you'll have to use... so try this... so, you'll have to use a property of the integers, which is the cancelation law."
"You don't have division, but it's the next best thing to division."
Ok?
"Tom Hanks, Haley Joel Osment, and Robin Williams."
I'm going to connect together actors who were in movies together with lines that represents those movies.
"So Bruce Willis and Tom Hanks were in a movie together called,"
"""The Bonfire of the Vanities"" that seemed like it was going to be very good but it was not."
"Bruce Willis and Cloris Leachman were in a movie together called ""Beavis and Butt-Head Do America""--it was not a very popular movie."
"Tom Hanks and Stanley Tucci were in a movie called ""The Terminal."""
"Haley Joel Osment and Bruce Willis were in ""The Sixth Sense."" They were the stars of that movie."
"I will not tell you the ending, but Haley Joel Osment was also in ""Forrest Gump"" with Tom Hanks."
"Robin Williams and Stanley Tucci were in a movie called ""Deconstructing Harry."""
"Cloris Leachman and Stanley Tucci were in a movie called ""Gambit""."
"Danny Devito and Robin Williams were in ""Death to Smoochy."" All right!"
"Next I'm going to connect Bruce Willis and Danny Devito, who were in a movie together called ""I'm Still Here."""
"And lastly, I'm going to connect Bruce Willis and Stanley Tucci, who were in a movie called ""Billy Bathgate."""
All right!
"Now that we have the diagram, I'm going to start off with one of the actors."
Let's say Bruce Willis and I'm going to move around on this structure visiting all the movies exactly once and so let's see how that goes.
So there's lot of different choices to start off.
"Let's say, I'm going to go from Bruce Willis to Tom Hanks, Tom Hanks to Stanley Tucci,"
"Stanley Tucci back to Bruce Willis, Bruce Willis to Cloris Leachman to Stanley Tucci again, to Robin Williams to Danny Devito to Bruce Willis to Haley Joel Osment, and then to Tom Hanks, and now you can see that I've visited all of the movies exactly once and I ended up at Tom Hanks."
All right!
So let's try this again with a different set of actors.
"Now we've got Susan Sarandon, Dustin Hoffman, Julia Roberts,"
"Kevin Bacon, Robert De Niro, Anne Hathaway, and Meryl Streep."
And then we're going to put in some of the movies again.
"Robert De Niro and Dustin Hoffman who were in a movie together called ""Wag the Dog."""
"Robert De Niro and Meryl Streep were in a movie together called ""Marvin's Room."""
"Dustin Hoffman and Susan Sarandon were in a movie together called ""Moonlight Mile."""
"Dustin Hoffman and Julia Roberts were in a movie together called ""Hook."""
"Dustin Hoffman and Kevin Bacon were in a movie together called ""Sleepers."""
"Susan Sarandon and Julia Roberts were in a movie together called ""Stepmom."""
"Kevin Bacon and Julia Roberts were in ""Flatliners."""
Nobody can tell from some of the movies and the actors that I've picked that I watched more movies in the 80s than I watch now.

"Serving attitude must be there and the seed must be proper seed, bonafide."
Two things necessary.
Everywhere.
"Sadhu-sanga, that is also bonafide."
We are to differentiate it from the sham.
From the apparent.
That is from mayic conception.
Which is not so.
You have to appeal to more of their senses in your teaching.
You should almost check a checklist.
"OK, we got sound going on, all right."
Hearing?
Hearing.
What am I doing on visual?
Am I doing any art work?
What am I doing on touch?
Am I getting their hands engaged?
All of that.
I think that happens a lot in the elementary or lower grades.
"And we figure high school, they don't need to do that anymore."
"And I think we're very, very wrong."
It's really the first time Adam Dunning has any positive feelings about
learning.
I feel good about going to school.
"I mean, school here is fun."
It's like the teachers care.
They help you out like regular school should be.
He has come to believe jail time is actually good for him.
Me being locked up was good for a learning experience for me.
"Because if I stayed out, if I didn't get locked up, I'd probably be dead or in a lot worse trouble."
I probably wouldn't be at a treatment facility.
I'd probably be back wearing an orange suit.
"For years, Adams says, he used drugs and alcohol to blunt the pain of his failures in school."
He's clean and sober now but worries about how long that can
last.
"The only thing I'm really afraid of going back to school are the kids around me, pressures."
They seen me before.
The know how I acted before.
I never been to high school when I was clean.
"I mean, it wasn't 30 days where I wasn't using."
"How can I say, you don't learn only the things written in books, but also you prepared for life."
I heard like that.
I know it like that.
Isn't that so?
You learn to differentiate the wrong from good.
"You don't have a diploma only, but also have a specialty that everyone would ask from you."
What kind of privilege is this?
"The simplest one, diploma from here opens many doors for you, you find a job easily, you establish your life even easier... you have a chance to reach your dreams."
This school provides possibilities like this.
So you want an opportunity?
Who doesn't want?
"Good, but what's your dream?"
I want to be a man.
What else can I ask?
Which profession do you want to choose Yaman?
I want to be an architect.
I want to draw the houses where people will be living.
I want it to be like this.
Shall we do something after the registration?
Okay.&amp;gt; But can't let me down at the last moment!
"No, I promise!"
But first let's get these things done.
"The school ambient hit me, I am in a huff in two minutes."
~Mira calling...
Yes sweetie.- Orkun where are you?
"I am at school, what happened?-I need you, can you come to me for a little?"
Where are you?
"By the seaside.- Why are you crying, what happened?"
I started a nightmare day...
I took my car from the sequestration police a little before.
This is all I can tell you.
"Oh no ! &amp;gt; My dad said, take it away quickly."
"But It, itself,  is not an appearance."
Hm?
What are we speaking about?
You!
"It's not  some abstract principle, somewhere behind here; that's also an idea."
"And when you  keep on looking and seeing that everything that has form depends upon a formless seer  of them, somehow."
"All of them report back, as far back as the attention can follow."
It evolves into emptiness.
Everything is coming back  to emptiness.
You have to prove this  for yourself.
This is why  I don't say it's a teaching; it's pointing.
Look.
"Ultimately, can what we are be a phenomenon?"
And a phenomenon  cannot witness itself.
"We say the ego  is aware of itself, but what's aware of that?"
So that awareness somehow comes into emptiness again.
And it is  the experience of this that brings clarity  and peace to the mind.
'What does the third eye see?'
"First, the second eye  and the first eye, then they are seeing  only things."
"And the third eye  is seeing what, also?"
"They call 'eye of intuition,' what is that one seeing?"
Hm?
[Music plays in the background]
[M:]
"Its light  is understanding, that is the light  of the third eye: intuitive understanding."
"But what sees third eye, also?"
Can the Seer of the third eye  be seen?
And by whom?
"All these questions,  they can be solved here."
Okay.
[M:]
Okay. www.mooji.org
"So, if these things are true, than we'll say that these two pairs are equivalent."
Ok?
Ok.
"Now, that's a relation."
Is it an equivalence relation?
There's some things to check here.
Right?
"We won't do them all, but do you want you to think that..."
"So here's the important thing to do, once you have a construction, the work is not done, you should check that it is an equivalence relation."
Check tilde is an equivalence relation.
"So, for instance, is it reflexive?"
Some of you said yes right away and some of you hesitated.
How would I check if it's reflexive?
What would I have to check to check the reflexive condition for this relation?
Which is on pairs of pairs?
Right?
"You give me a pair and another pair, how would I check... what would I have to check for reflexivity?"
What do I wanna check?
What's the condition I wanna check?
What corresponds to a R a over there?
"Yeah, is p q equivalent to p q?"
"Now, does everybody agree this is what we have to check?"
"It's not the only thing, but it's one of the things."
Yeah?
"Ok, good, now, is this easy to check?"
"Well, then you go back to this definition, since this is why definitions are so important in Mathematics, because we know what we mean, we have a definition."
What does it mean to check p q tilde p q?
It means checking that... p q equal q p.
Is that true?
For integers.
Yes.
Ok?

These tiles were placed in a slot, giving the player two letters. The player would then choose a letter to place in the word. If the letter was in the word, it was placed into the word. The player then made a guess to the word or placed the other tile. If the player could not guess the word after placing the tile, they took two more tiles. Play continued until the player guessed the word (done by the player hitting their buzzer) or there was only one letter left in the word. If a correct guess was made, the player won the word. If an incorrect guess was made, play passed to the other player. Three words won the game. Two games were played with two different players."

Siegbert Tarrasch
"Siegbert Tarrasch (Breslau, now Wrocław, 5 March 1862 – Munich, 17 February 1934) was a German doctor, and one of the strongest chess grandmasters of the day."
"Tarrasch was born in Breslau, in Prussian Silesia. He left in 1880 to study medicine, and qualified as a physician. He lived most of his life in Nuremberg, Bavaria, and later in Munich. Tarrasch was born Jewish, and converted to Christianity in 1909. He was a patriotic German, who lost a son in World War I, but he faced antisemitism in the early stages of Nazism."
"Tarrasch won more strong tournaments in the 1890s than any other player, and drew a 22-game match against Mikhail Chigorin, the leading Russian player. Tarrasch was also an influential chess writer, who summarised the chess ideas of the 1890s. It was his ideas against which the hypermoderns reacted in the early 1920s.&lt;ref name=""H/W""&gt;Hooper D. and Whyld K. 1992. ""The Oxford companion to chess"". 2nd ed, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;p411"
"Occupied with his profession, Tarrasch did not challenge Steinitz, and turned down the young Emanuel Lasker's request for a match. This turned out to be a mistake, for Lasker then challended Steinitz, and won the world chess championship. Later Tarrasch unsuccessfully challenged Lasker for the world championship, in 1908. He was by then past his best, though he continued to play in tournaments for many years. His best result in later years was to reach the final pool in the strong St. Petersburg 1914 tournament. He came fourth, behind Lasker, Capablanca and Alekhine."
Chess author.
"Tarrasch was a highly esteemed chess writer. His ""Dreihundert Schachpartien"" (1895; 300 chess games) was a landmark; it was the first 'best game collection' with in-depth annotations. The notes were readable and could be understood by ordinary players. This led to his being described as the ""praeceptor mundi"", which is Latin for 'teacher of the world'. The book was called by the American grandmaster Reuben Fine ""One of the monuments of our game"".f/w"
"Tarrasch regularly wrote tournament reports and notes for games in the ""Deutsch Schachzeitung"", the German-language chess magazine. These annotations were read throughout the world, since that was the leading chess magazine of the day."
"In his later elementary textbook ""The game of chess"" (1931) he wrote"

Article Seven of the United States Constitution
"Article Seven of the United States Constitution explains what needs to happen for the Constitution to be approved. It says that nine states need to ratify the Constitution before it takes effect. To ratify the Constitution, a special group in each state called a Convention would have to approve the Constitution."
Text.
"In Simple English, this means: The approval of nine states' Conventions will be enough to make this Constitution official in those states."
Background.
"Before the United States Constitution was passed, the United States had another constitution called the Articles of Confederation. These Articles made the United States into a confederation. The legislature of the confederation government was called the Congress of the Confederation."
"After a few years, the Founding Fathers decided the United States needed a new constitution and a new form of government. They formed a group called the Constitutional Convention to write a new constitution. The group finished its final version of the Constitution on September 17, 1787. Three days later, the Convention gave its suggested Constitution to the Congress of the Confederation to get its support."
"The Congress debated a lot about the Constitution. Members of Congress did not agree on whether Congress should support the new Constitution or not. On September 28, the Congress came to a compromise. They decided just to give the states the Constitution and let them vote on it. Congress would not suggest that the states pass the Constitution, or that they not pass it. This way, the decision would truly be up to the states; no state would be affected by Congress's opinion."
Approval.
"In 1787 and 1788, there were debates across the United States about the suggested new Constitution. Each state's Convention would have to vote on the Constitution. For a state to ratify the Constitution, more than half of the members of its Convention would have to vote for the Constitution."
"American bombers dropped 1,400 tons of bombs onto the Cassino Abbey."
"German paratroopers went into the abbey's ruins. Between 17 January and 18 May, Monte Cassino and the Gustav defences were attacked four times by Allied troops. The German defenders were finally driven from their positions, but with many losses for the Allies."
Background.
The Allied landings in Italy in September 1943 were followed by an advance north in two parts. An advance was made on each side of the mountain range in the middle of Italy.
"On the western side, U.S. Fifth Army moved from Naples. In the east General Sir Bernard Montgomery's British Eighth Army moved up the Adriatic coast."
The Fifth Army made slow progress because of difficult land and German defences. The Germans were protected in positions. The original plans that Rome would be captured by October 1943 did not occur.
"Although in the east the Ortona was captured, the advance stopped in December because of snow. Going to Rome from the east was not possible. Highway 6 ran through the Liri valley. The south entrance to this valley was Cassino. It was an important part of Gustav Line, the strongest defensive positions in the Winter Line."
"Because the old Benedictine Abbey was important to history, German units did not put defensive positions in the Abbey."
Some Allied aircraft saw German troops in the Abbey. The Abbey looked over the valley. This made it a good place for German artillery observers. This made Allied commanders want to bomb the Abbey.
First battle.
Plans and preparation.
"The plan of U.S. Fifth Army commander General Clark was for British X Corps to attack on January 17, 1944. The British 46th Infantry Division was to attack on January 19. This would support the main attack by U.S. II Corps on their right."
The main central attack by U.S. II Corps would start on January 20. The 36th (Texas) U.S. Infantry Division would cross a river five miles from Cassino. The French Expeditionary Corps would move towards Monte Cairo.
"Fifth Army had only reached the Gustav line on January 15, having taken six weeks and getting 16,000 casualties."
Attack.
"The first attack was made on January 17. Near the coast, British X Corps crossed the Garigliano. General von Senger, commander of German XIV Panzer Corps did not think he could stop the attack. He asked for more troops. The 29th and 90th Panzer Grenadier Divisions were sent to him. X Corps had 4,000 casualties during the first battle."
"The central attack by U.S. started on January 20. They were attacked by General Eberhard Rodt's 15th Panzer Grenadier Division. The attack was a failure, with 36th Division losing 2,100 men killed, wounded and missing in 48 hours."
The next attack was on January 24. The U.S. II Corps attacked across the
Rapido valley north of Cassino. The 34th Division pushed back General Franek's 44th Infantry Division.
"On the right, the Moroccan-French troops made good initial progress against the Germans. The two Moroccan-French divisions had 2,500 casualties in their battles around Monte Belvedere."
"The U.S. 34th Division had to fight southward. By early February, American infantry had captured point less than a mile from the abbey. By February 7 a battalion had reached a hill below the Abbey. Attempts to capture Monte Cassino were stopped by machine gun fire from the slopes."
Afterwards.
"On February 11, after a 3-day attack on Monastery Hill and Cassino town, the Americans pulled back. U.S. II Corps was tired after two and a half weeks of fighting. They lost 80% in the Infantry battalions, about 2,200 casualties."
Second battle.
"This was called Operation Avenger. With U.S. VI Corps under threat at Anzio, Freyberg asked to help at Cassini. Freyberg thought there was only a 50% chance of success for the attack."
Destruction of the abbey.
"Allied officers started to think the Germans were using the abbey of Monte Cassino as an artillery observation point. The Allies thought of bombing with ""blockbuster"" bombs."
"The bombing in the morning of February 15, 1944 involved 142 Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses heavy bombers followed by 47 North American B-25 Mitchell and 40 Martin B-26 Marauder medium bombers. They dropped 1,150 tons of bombs on the abbey. This turned it into rubble. II Corps artillery shelled the mountain. The German positions above and behind the monastery were untouched."
After the bombing.
Pope Pius XII said nothing after the bombing. Cardinal Secretary of State called the bombing “stupidity.”
It is now known that the Germans had agreed not to use the Abbey for military purposes.
"Following its destruction, paratroopers of the German 1st Parachute Division occupied the ruins of the abbey. They turned it into a fortress and observation post."

History.
"According to Klimt's website, Bloch-Bauer was his mistress. She is also the only woman he ever painted twice. Adele's husband, Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer, hired Klimt to paint both paintings. Klimt painted ""Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer II"" in 1912. Some artists also think Adele Bloch-Bauer might be the woman in ""The Kiss"" and ""Judith and the Head of Holofernes""."
"Before Adele Bloch-Bauer died, she said she wanted the painting to go to the Belvedere Gallery. But, at the time, the painting belonged to her husband and not to her."
"During World War II, the Nazis stole the painting from Bloch-Bauer's family. It did end up in the Belvedere Gallery."
"One of the reasons this painting is famous is that it was in a United States Supreme Court case, ""Republic of Austria v. Altmann"", in 2004. Adele Bloch-Bauer's niece, Maria Altmann, tried to get the painting back from the Belvedere Gallery. The Supreme Court said the painting was Altmann's.

UDP is sometimes called the Universal Datagram Protocol. The protocol was designed by David P. Reed in 1980 and formally defined in ."
Ports.
"UDP applications use datagram sockets to establish host-to-host communications. Sockets bind the application to service ports that functions as the endpoints of data transmission. A port is a software structure that is identified by the port number, a 16 bit integer value, allowing for port numbers between 0 and 65,535. Port 0 is reserved, but is able to be used if the sending process does not expect messages in response."
"Ports 1 through 1023 (hexadecimal 0x3FF) are named ""well-known"" ports and on Unix-like operating systems, binding to one of these ports requires superuser (root) access."
"Ports 1024 through 49,151 (0xBFFF) are registered ports."
"Ports 49,152 through 65,535 (0xFFFF) are used as temporary ports usually by clients when communicating to servers."

Goalkeeper
"A goalkeeper is someone who protects a team's goal. There are goalkeepers in sports like football (soccer) and ice hockey, for example.

"Until the early 20th century, the goalkeeper would often wear the same coloured strip as his teammates, with the only different item of clothing being his cap. However, in 1909, the Scottish Football Association took steps to ensure the goalkeeper would wear a different colour from the outfield players. This was to show his different role, as the only player allowed to handle the ball."

The hockey stick of the goalie is much wider than the stick of other players. The bottom edge is also longer and flatter. The goalie has a very large leather glove on one hand. This glove has a large area to help catch the puck. Goalies normally wear masks that give protection to the entire face and head as well as the neck."

1583
"In the 11th century, Richard II of Normandy chose an Italian architect called William de Volpiano to build the abbey of Mont-Saint-Michel. Volpiano had already built the Abbey of Fécamp, in Normandy. He designed the Romanesque church of the abbey. He chose to place the transept crossing at the top of the mount. He also built a lot of crypts and chapels below the ground. These are to support building above, because it is very heavy. Today, Mont-Saint-Michel has a church of Romanesque style."
"Robert de Thorigny was a great supporter of Henry II of England. Henry was also Duke of Normandy at this time. Thorigny made the structure of the buildings stronger. He also built the main façade of the church in the 12th century. In 1204, the Breton ""Guy de Thouars"", a friend of the King of France, attacked the mount with an army. He set fire to the village and killed lots of people. However, he had to retreat (leave) under the powerful walls of the abbey. The fire extended to the buildings, and the roofs burnt. Philip Augustus, Thorigny's friend, was unhappy about the cruel actions and the destruction. He offered Abbot Jourdain some money to build a new Gothic-style architectural set. The abbot added the refectory (""dining room"") and cloister."
"Charles VI added big fortifications to the abbey-mount. He also added building towers and courtyards, and he made the ramparts stronger."

"Mont-Saint-Michel is also the subject of a traditional rivalry between Normans and Bretons. Bretons say that the Couesnon River marks the limit between Normandy and Brittany. It is only because the river has changed its course over the centuries that the mount is on the Norman side. This legend amuses the area's inhabitants.

Other ways of measuring alcohol content.
"Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac (1777-1850) and Johann Georg Tralles (1763-1822) developed other means of measuring alcohol content. These units are usually measured in degrees, noted °GL, or °GT. The scale Gay-Lussac developed is almost equal to the ABV scale described above. There may be slight different, because Gay-Lussac measured the alcohol content at 15° centigrade, and not 20°."

The Ghan
"The Ghan is a passenger train between Adelaide, Alice Springs, and Darwin on the Adelaide–Darwin railway in Australia. The train is operated by Great Southern Rail. It takes 54 hours to travel the with a four-hour stop in Alice Springs."
The name.
"The train's name is a short version of its nickname ""The Afghan Express"". This nickname is said to have been first used in 1923 by one the train crew. The train's name honours Afghan camel drivers who arrived in Australia in the late 19th century to help find a way to reach the country's unexplored interior."
"Another view is that the name was an insult. In 1891, the railway from Quorn reached Oodnadatta. This was home to about 150 cameleers, known as 'Afghans'. 'The Ghan Express' name was used by train crews in the 1890s as a joke because, when an expensive sleeping car was put on from Quorn to Oodnadatta, 'on the first return journey the only passenger was an Afghan'. As early as 1924, it was known as 'The Afghan Express' because it was so unreliable, often days, or weeks late. By 1951, when steam engines were replaced by diesel-electric locomotives, the insult of the names, like the cameleers, had faded away. Modern marketing has turned the name into a term of pride in its heritage."

Homology (mathematics)
"In mathematics, homology is a certain procedure to associate a sequence of abelian groups or modules with a mathematical object, such as a topological space or a group. The word homology has the Ancient Greek root ""homos"", which means ""identical""."
"For a topological space, the homology groups are generally much easier to compute than the homotopy groups, and consequently one usually will have an easier time working with homology to help with the classification of spaces."
"The original motivation for defining homology groups is the observation that shapes are distinguished by their ""holes"". Since a ""hole"" is defined by something that is ""not there"", this poses the problem of how to define what a hole is, and how to distinguish between different kinds of holes. Homology is a rigorous mathematical method for defining and categorizing holes in a shape. As it turns out, there are some kinds of holes that homology cannot ""see"" — in which case homotopy groups may be what is needed."

"The Nashya Shaikh or Nashya Sekh(Bengali: নইস্য শেখ) is a Muslim community found in northern parts of the state of West Bengal in India. They are culturally and linguistically similar to both Rangpuri people of northern Bangladesh and Goalpariya people of Assam. A small number of the community are also found in the neighboring state of Bihar, where they are known as the Bengali Shaikh. These people are more commonly known as Rajbongshi Muslims. The Nashya are considered to be an important indigenous group found in northern West Bengal. They are homogeneous with the Koch Rajbongshi people and are bi-linguistic speaking both Bengali language and Koch language with Koch Rajbongshi language being replaced by Bengali language among the newer generations."
Etymology.
"There are descendants from Koch-Rajbonshi, Mech, Rabha, Bodo and Indo-Aryan people who converted to Islam. They mainly speak the Goalpariya dialect . They are mainly settled in the districts of Dhuburi, Goalpara, South Salmara and Kokrajhar. These people were loose followers of Hinduism. But when a small section of these people converted to Islam, the act was frowned upon. The local Hindus started calling them ""nosto seikh"" meaning ""spoiled Shaikh"". But as more number of people got converted to Islam with time these people came in contact with mainstream Muslims, and the term ""nosto seikh"" slowly got islamicised into ""Nashya seikh""."
Origin.
"The Nashyas trace their origin to the indigenous communities of Koch Rajbongshi of northern West Bengal, though some of them are also from Mech community. There conversion to Islam is said to have taken over two to three centuries, and the Nashya still retain many cultural traits of their pre-Islamic past. Most people of the community are non-practicing Muslims though the newer generations are becoming increasing Islamic due to globalization. From historic evidence, it seems a segment of the indigenous population of north Bengal converted started to convert to Islam when the region fell under the control of Bakhtiyar Khilji. Some of the earliest converts were the chiefs Ali Mach and Kala Pahar. Tradition also ascribes the conversion of several lineages to Sufi saints such as Torsa Pir, Pagla Pir, Shah Fakir Sahib and Shah Gari Sahib."

Green bromeliad frog
"The green bromeliad frog, Jamaican green tree frog, or Wilder's tree frog (""Osteopilus wilderi"") is a frog. It lives in Jamaica. Scientists have seen between 120 and 880 meters above sea level."
The adult male frog is 24.3 to 27.9 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 24.2 to 29.2 mm long. There is no webbed skin on the front feet and a little webbed skin on the back feet. This frog is usually yellow-green in color but it can be red-brown in color. The belly is lighter in color. Some frogs have spots on their sides.
"This frog lives in bromeliad plants. Bromeliads are plants that can live on the ground or high up on other plants. Rainwater collects in the leaves of the bromeliads. The frogs lay their eggs in this water. The first tadpoles to hatch eat the other eggs. Scientists think the tadpoles may also eat each other. ""Osteopilus brunneus"" tadpoles do eat green bromeliad frog tadpoles if they are in the same plant. But ""Osteopilus brunneus"" lays its eggs in larger bromeliad plants, and the green bromeliad frog lays its eggs in smaller ones. Scientists think green bromeliad frogs do this so that the ""Osteopilus brunneus"" tadpoles will not eat their young."
The green bromeliad frog lives in tropical forests and subtropical forests.
The adult frog eats insects. It eats leafhoppers.
This frog is in some danger of dying out. This is because human beings cut down the forests where they live to build houses and to collect wood for building.

Goryeo.
In the year 918 the kingdom of Goryeo began. The name Korea comes from Goryeo. The kingdom of Goryeo had power until the year 1392.
"The kingdom of Goryeo wrote the law in books, and had a big government. Buddhism was very important in the kingdom of Goryeo. Bronze-type printing technology was invented in Goryeo Dynasty. This is known as the world's oldest bronze-type printing technology."
"The Mongol empire conquered Goryeo and forced Korea to pay a tribute in Korean girls and eunuchs to the Mongol court with about 500,000 Korean girls and eunuchs taken to Yuan China. Mongol and Central Asian Semu Hui Tammachi army officials in Korea itself also took Korean women as concubines and Korea officials complained about it, begging the Mongol court to withdraw them from Korea. Koreans wrote erotic songs about how Korean women were seduced by Central Asian Muslims in their bakeries."
"An amusing incident is reported as having occurred about this time. A courtier named Pa-gyu observed to the king, “The male population of the country has been decimated but there are still plenty of women. For this reason it is that the Mongols take so many of them. There is danger that the pure Koryŭ stock will become vitiated by the intermixture of wild blood. The king should let each man take several wives and should remove the restrictions under which the sons of concubines labor."" When the news of this came to the ears of the women they were up in arms, as least the married portion ; and each one read to her spouse such a lecture that the subject was soon dropped as being too warm to handle. When the king passed through the streets with Pa-gyu in his retinue the women would point to the latter and say “There goes the man who would make concubines of us all."""
Joseon.
"In the year 1392 a man from the military of Korea went to China. His name was Yi Seonggye. His job was to attack Yuan China. But he returned without doing it. When he came back to Korea, he changed the kingdom. He became king."
"The name of the kingdom was Joseon. In the year 1394, the people of Joseon moved the capital to Seoul. The religion of Buddhism was not important. A new religion, Confucianism was important. Confucianism came from China."
In the year 1443 King Sejong ruled Joseon. He invented the Korean alphabet Hangeul.
"In the year 1592 and the year 1598 the people from Japan fought Korea. A man from the military made very strong ships, including the famous turtle ship. The name of the man was Yi Sun-sin. With the strong ships, the people of Korea won."

The people of Korea wanted to be independent. The United States and the Soviet Union agreed the people of Korea would be free and independent. But soon the United States and Soviet Union were not friends and the Cold War started. United States and Soviet Union refused to settle a deal. In 1948 the people in the south made an independent country called South Korea (also called the Republic of Korea). The United States helped them. In 1948 the people in the north also made a country North Korea (also called the DPRK or Democratic People's Republic of Korea). The Soviet Union helped North Korea.

Thrace
"Thrace (: ""Thráke""; ; ""Trakiya"", ) is a historical and geographic area in southeast Europe. It was bounded by the Balkan Mountains on the north, Rhodope Mountains and the Aegean Sea on the south, and by the Black Sea and the Sea of Marmara on the east. Thrace included areas which are now southeastern Bulgaria, northeastern Greece, and the European part of Turkey. The Thracians were an ancient Indo-European people. They lived in Central, Eastern and Southeastern Europe."
Ancient history.
The indigenous population of Thrace was a people called the Thracians. They were divided into many tribal groups. Thracian troops were known to be used in the Persian army. Many of them went with neighbouring ruler Alexander the Great when he crossed the Hellespont (which is next to Thrace) during his invasion of the Persian Empire.
"The Thracians were divided into separate tribes. They did not form a lasting political organization until the Odrysian state was founded in the 4th century BC. Like Illyrians, Thracian tribes of the mountainous regions had a warrior tradition. The tribes based in the plains were more peaceable. Recent funeral mounds in Bulgaria suggest that Thracian kings did rule regions of Thrace with distinct Thracian national identity."
"Thrace was conquered by Alexander. It later regained its freedom. It was conquered after several attempts by the Romans in 46 AD, in the reign of Claudius. They became a province, and later four provinces, of the Roman Empire. Finally, as the Empire crumbled, Thrace suffered more than a thousand years of conflict and conquest by stronger forces. It never regained its independence."

"Tak'alik A'baj' is an ancient ruin in Guatemala; it used to be called Abaj Takalik. It is one of several Mesoamerican sites that have Olmec and Maya features. The site was inhabited the during the Preclassic and Classic periods, from the 9th century BC through to at least the 10th century AD. It was an important place for trade. It traded with Kaminaljuyu and Chocolá. It is one of the largest sites with carved monuments on the Pacific coast. Olmec-style sculptures include a possible colossal head, rock carvings and others. The site has one of the biggest collections of Olmec-style sculpture outside of the Gulf of Mexico."
Takalik Abaj shows the first signs of Maya culture that happened by about 400 BC. The site includes a Maya royal tomb and examples of Maya writing that are among the first from the Maya region. Studies continue at the site; the monumental buildings and long tradition of sculpture in a variety of styles suggest the site was important.
Finds from the site indicate contact with the distant city of Teotihuacan in the Valley of Mexico. They imply that Takalik Abaj was conquered by it or its allies. Takalik Abaj was linked to long-distance Maya trade routes that let the city take part in a trade network that included the Guatemalan highlands and the Pacific coastal plain from Mexico to El Salvador.
"Takalik Abaj was a large city with the main buildings in four main groups spread across nine terraces. While some of these were natural, others were man-made, needing a lot of work and materials. The site had a clever water drainage system and many stone sculptures."

Manslaughter
"Manslaughter is the crime of killing a person. When a person is killed, lawyers also look at the reasons, and motives why this person was killed. If the death of a person was not on purpose, but the killer did something that resulted in the death of the another person, this is usually called manslaughter, in English. It is less serious than if a person was killed on purpose (sometimes with planning involved), which is called murder, in English. Killing someone in self-defence may be manslaughter. Depending on the circumstances, killing in self-defence may be no crime at all. Negligent homicide is an even lesser crime."
"Manslaughter is a relatively new legal concept. It was first mentioned in an English statute in 1547, but was interpreted very loosely and not earnestly enforced, instead usually charging with murder. Very few countries had manslaughter on their books until the latter half of the 20th century. In fact, no jurisdiction in the United States had manslaughter on its books until the 20th century. England and the United States were the first two countries to introduce manslaughter into their laws."

Since then Knowles filmed a Prager University video called “What is the Alt-Right. Knowles said that the alt-right actually had much more in common with left-wing politics than with right-wing politics. Knowles wrote a book called Reasons to Vote for Democrats about all the reasons to vote for the Democratic Party of the United States and the book had no words in it as a joke. It was praised by Ben Shapiro and Donald Trump.
"Knowles also filmed a Prager University video called “Control the Words, Control the Culture”. It is about how language can be used as a political tool. And inspired by that video, Knowles wrote a book called Speechless: Controlling Words, Controlling Minds. He argues that conservatives should support certain forms of censorship and cancel culture to fight back against left-wing politics."
He also filmed a Prager University video called Conservatives Are the Real Environmentalists in which he says that right-wing politics are better for the environment than left-wing politics are.
He also made a Prager University video called Celebrating Columbus. He says people should continue to celebrate Columbus Day despite criticism of Christopher Columbus.

History.
"The M Ocean View line began operation on October 6, 1925, as a shuttle service from St. Francis Circle to Broad and Plymouth in the city's Ocean View District. It went through the Twin Peaks Tunnel to the downtown Ferry Building on October 31, 1927, but went back to a shuttle service on February 27, 1928. The shuttle service was replaced by buses on August 6, 1939, but streetcar service returned on on December 17, 1944. On June 6, 1948, the Transbay Terminal became the inner terminus of the line."
Changes in 1980s.
"While many streetcar lines switched to bus operations after World War II, the M Ocean View remained a streetcar line due to its use of the Twin Peaks Tunnel. On August 30, 1980, the line went further to Balboa Park BART station. The full line switched to light-rail operations with the opening of the Muni Metro system on December 17, 1980."

History.
"On January 10, 1998, Muni opened the Muni Metro Extension to 4th and King/Caltrain. It was originally served by a temporary shuttle service, the E Embarcadero, which ran between Embarcadero station and 4th and King/Caltrain. On August 22, 1998, the E Embarcadero line was removed and the N Judah line was extended to its place."
"A lot of service changes took place at the time when the T Third Street line began service on April of 2007. The N Judah was cut back to Embarcadero station; the surface part on the Embarcadero was served only by the T Third Street line, plus the J Church line at peak hours. The changes were unpopular with the public; they caused big delays in the Market Street subway and made N Judah riders transfer to reach the Caltrain station when they did not before. On June 30, 2007, Muni reversed several of the changes; the J Church and N Judah were put back to their previous routes."
Future plans.
"Future plans, according to the SFMTA Rail Capacity Strategy, include a new subway tunnel which connects to the Market Street subway to 9th Avenue. Additionally, the N Judah line will be rebuilt to run three car trains. Further plans include a connection between the L Taraval and N Judah lines, which may run on 46th Avenue."

It runs along the newly constructed light-rail tracks on Third Street and Bayshore Boulevard in the Visitacion Valley, Bayview/Hunters Point, Dogpatch, and Mission Bay neighborhoods, connecting to the existing Muni Metro system along the Embarcadero and under Market Street."
"In the future, the line may be going to Caltrain's Bayshore Station (to which it was originally planned to run) and, in the other direction, to San Francisco's Washington Square in North Beach through Chinatown Central Subway route."
Operation.
"The T Third operates seven days a week, beginning at 5 a.m. weekdays, 6 a.m. Saturdays and 8 a.m. Sundays, operating until 1 a.m."
History.
"Following service changes on June 30, 2007, the K Ingleside and the T Third Street lines were combined inside the Market Street subway tunnel. Though keeping their line designations, resulting in an upside-down, horseshoe-shaped route from Balboa Park to Bayshore and Sunnydale. At West Portal Station, inbound K trains heading towards downtown change their signs to the T line; at Embarcadero Station, T trains heading into downtown change signs to the K line."
"The underground section of the line was closed west of Castro station from June 25 to August 24, 2018, due to the Twin Peaks Tunnel shutdown. On August 25, 2018, at the end of the shutdown, Muni began running two-car trains on the K/T line."

Free State (province)

Bir Tawil
"Bir Tawil or Bi'r Tawīl (بيرطويل in Arabic; Bi'r or بير, meaning water well), is a small, , area. It is along the border between Egypt and Sudan. It is claimed by neither country right now. It is sometimes given the name the Bir Tawil Triangle, because even though it's not an exact triangle, it's made out of two triangles that share a border. The longer side is in the north of the area. It runs along the 22° north circle of latitude."
"The administrative boundary of Sudan and Egypt was made in 1902. Their political boundary was set in 1899. It was set as the 22° north circle of latitude. This area lies south of the 22° parallel. East-to-west, the area is between long in the south. It is long in the north. It is between and wide north-to-south. It is also in size."
"The Bir Tawil area came under Egyptian administration in 1902. This was because it was grazing land of the Ababda tribe based near Aswan, Egypt. At the same time, the Hala'ib Triangle north of latitude 22° north, and northeast of the area, came under Sudanese administration. This was because the tribes of this area were based in Sudan. The two ""triangles"" border at one point, a quadripoint."
History.
"In 1899, the Anglo-Egyptian Condominium Agreement for Sudan set the border between the territories at the 22nd parallel. At that time, the United Kingdom ruled the area. In 1902 the UK drew a separate ""administrative boundary"". Using this boundary, a triangle of land north of the parallel was placed under Sudanese administration. It was because its inhabitants were closer to Khartoum than Cairo, both geographically and culturally. The area was ruled by the British Governor in Khartoum."
"Egypt claims the original border from 1899, the 22° north circle of latitude. This would place the Hala'ib Triangle within Egypt and the Bir Tawil area within Sudan. Sudan claims the administrative border of 1902. This would put Hala'ib within Sudan, and Bir Tawil within Egypt. As a result, both states claim the Hala'ib Triangle. Neither state claims the much less valuable Bir Tawil area, which is only a tenth the size and is landlocked. There is no basis in international law for Sudan or Egypt to claim both territories. It would also be difficult for any other state to claim the area. This is because only Sudan or Egypt border the land. As a result, Bir Tawil is one of the few land areas of the world which is not claimed by any state. The offical currency is the but this is no longer circulated."

In 1596 he worked as a pastor in the church in Birstein near Frankfurt am Main in Hesse. There Praetorius worked for a prince and wrote church songs and books of religion in the year 1597.
Fight against the chase of witches.
Praetorius fought against torture and against the hunting of witches. Some women were accused of being witches. People thought that witches can do harm to others. So these women were arrested and put in prison.
In 1597 Anton Praetorius protested against the torture of women accused of witchcraft.
Praetorius was so shocked about the torture of the accused woman that he demanded a stop. His protest was successful.
"In 1598 he wrote a book to protest against torture and the prosecution of witches. The book was published again in 1602, 1613 and in 1629. Praetorius described the terrible situation of the prisoners and protested against torture."
Theological argument against witchcraft.
"Praetorius was a Protestant minister. He believed that man can do either good or bad things. However, God chooses certain people to do certain things. Those things can be good or bad. According to Praetorius, witchcraft can only be a fall from the favour of God, and a pact with the devil. But, neither the devil nor sorcerers can do more than is in their nature (and predestination). God will punish those who are witches or sorcerers. This however, does not give human courts a right to put those to death, they believe are guilty of the crime of witchcraft. For Praetorius, witchcraft cannot exist, because it is beyond the faculties of either man or the devil. It is also against Nature."

The Holy Spirit is described in many situations, but the most commonly known one is the tongues of fire that rest upon Jesus' 12 disciples' heads and it empowers them to speak different languages and preach the good news of Jesus the Christ. His teachings and way of life allow us to find peace and harmony and help others in need. By doing as he taught us, we can become better people and show God's love through us mortal beings."
"In the Incarnation, normally defined, the divine nature of the Son was joined but not mixed with human nature in one divine Person, Jesus Christ, who was both ""truly God and truly man"". The Incarnation is commemorated and celebrated each year at the Feast of the Incarnation, which is better known as the Annunciation."
"This is center to the traditional Christian faith held by the Roman Catholic and Eastern Catholic Churches, the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Oriental Orthodox Church, the Anglican Communion, and most Protestants. Other views on the subject have been considered in the past, but all were rejected by mainstream Christian bodies."
"In recent past, another doctrine known as ""Oneness"" has gained credit amongst Pentecostal groups (see below), but has been rejected by other Christians."
"Maria Clementina of Austria (24 April 1777 – 15 November 1801) was an Austrian archduchess and the tenth child and third daughter of Leopold I, Grand Duke of Tuscany and Maria Luisa of Spain. She was the mother of the famous ""duchesse de Berry""."
Infancy.
"Archduchess Maria Clementina was born at the Villa del Poggio Imperiale, Poggio Imperiale then located in the Grand Duchy of Tuscany which was then ruled by her father Leopold I (later Holy Roman Emperor) since 1765. She was named after Prince Clemens Wenceslaus of Saxony, her mothers uncle and brother of Maria Amalia of Saxony, Maria Clementina's maternal grandmother."
Marriage.
"She was married by proxy to Prince Francis, Duke of Calabria, her first cousin, on 19 September 1790. On 26 June 1797 in Foggia, Maria Clementina married the Duke of Calabria, eldest surviving son of Ferdinand IV of Naples and, Maria Carolina of Austria. Prince Francis was the Heir apparent to both the Neapolitan and Sicilian throne's. This marriage was the last of three between the Austrian and Neapolitan royal families, the previous two being between Archduke Francis, her oldest brother and Maria Teresa of Naples and Sicily in 1790 after Archduke Ferdinand and Luisa of Naples and Sicily. They were double first cousins as they shared all their grandparents in common. They had two children. She died in Naples after giving birth to a son the previous year which undermined her health. She is thought to have died from lung disease or tuberculosis. She was buried in Basilica of Santa Chiara, Naples with her son."
"After her death, her husband married Infanta Maria Isabella of Spain, again his first cousin, the youngest surviving daughter of Charles IV of Spain (brother of Maria Clementina's mother) and Maria Luisa of Parma."
"Her only daughter Carolina, married Charles Ferdinand, Duke of Berry in April 1816. He was the son of Charles X of France and Maria Teresa of Savoy. They were the parents of the French pretender Henri d'Artois, Count of Chambord and the Duchess of Parma making Maria Clementina an ancestress of the present Duke of Calabria and his rival the Duke of Castro."

Texas Stars
"Well, you know, these guys that gambled high lost big you know."
Yeah.
That's true.
"And, uh I'm insulating myself from that problem."
Exactly what happened to them.
I'm building my own house.
"Oh, that's nice."
"And as I look out the window of my trailer, I can envision all the insulation that's going up today"
"Oh, really."
Yeah.
Are you doing it yourself?
Yeah.
Wow.
I used to be a builder.
"Oh, that's nice."
And I retired about five years ago and  started college.
"Oh, I see."
Huh.
And now I'm a college educated builder
"There's still no work, you know."
Yeah.
"So, uh, you know, I decided this summer that, uh, you know, we had enough credit on the credit cards to buy the materials"
so I did.
That's great.
"And, uh, see the, the, the state has a law that says you cannot borrow the money to build your own home."
is that so?
I didn't know that.
You can borrow the money to pay somebody else to build your house
but you can't borrow the money to build your own.
Well that sounds kind of dumb.
"Well, it's to protect the, the banks from guys that say yeah I want to build my own house and go out a build a spec home"
Uh-huh.
"Uh, I do have my radio going most of the day though,"
"so about every hour it breaks in and gives me news too, you know."
Okay.
"Do you  get like one of the talk stations, the news stations?"
"But,"
No.
Uh-huh. *listen; mistranscribed 'uh-uh'
"I just have a channel that has music except for, like every hour, you know, say eight o'clock, nine  o'clock, they come on for just a little bit of the news."
Sure.
Right.
"But as far as the actual news, I get that from like a call from the,"
can you hold on just for a second?
Sure.
Just a minute.
answers the other Hello sir comes back to speaker
Yes.
"Yes,"
I'm sorry to keep you waiting
Okay
"Uh, I was calling from work"
so and that was a call waiting.
Right.
"it sounds like you, uh, like the news a lot more than I do."
"Me, I figure if it's something really important, somebody will tell me about it."
"But, uh, you know, I, the thing is if, if I catch the news all the time, it just makes me depressed because they tend to produce a lot of bad news."
Or that's what  comes on first.
"Yeah,"
That's true too.
"And, uh, you know, also late at night, you know, I don't like watching the news late at night"
but my wife is usually up then
and so  I can't go to sleep with the T V on.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"and then, you know, if you didn't have a car that had one, then your insurance would go up enormously,"
"Uh-huh,"
"uh-huh,"
"uh, I've got to go"
"my son's in a performance tonight,"
"I have to leave, in a couple of minutes."
"Oh that's okay,"
"Uh, I think we've probably spent a reasonable amount of time."
Okay.
"It was good talking to you,"
"Well, you, you too."
Okay.
Good night.
All right
bye bye.
"Okay,"
"Dee, are you familiar with the Latin American policies?"
"Yeah,"
"to a point,"
it's not my best subject.
"Really,"
yeah
"it's not mine either,"
"but, uh, I know, I know our policy,"
"like in Nicaragua, I am familiar with that because we have, uh, some friends that live on the Nicaraguan border"
and they are missionaries there
"and they, they live there"
"and they have to travel by boat forty-five minutes to get to their car and stuff,"
"and uh, I know that they helped a lot of those Sandanistas refugees coming across the border"
and they housed them and stuff.
"They have been down there about three years now,"
"I really haven't,"
"no,"
huh-uh
I did  test drive a Corvette last year. Maybe the year before.
"It was brand new, white,"
it was like a big marshmallow.
"When you sat in the seats, they adjusted to fit around you."
uh.
I mean they came in and up and out
"and I mean, they did whatever"
"and, and we went for a test drive in that"
and I was able to open that up pretty good
and that was really fun.
"And I wanted it,"
but I had a choice of that or my house
"and I thought that I'd continue,  to live in my house"
so.
"Yeah,"
"there, there's something about having a place to live,"
I don't know.
"Yeah,"
"you know, it's just necessary."
"And I did, I thought well a tent wouldn't be bad but probably not practical."
Could sleep in the back of the 'vette.
"Yeah,"
right
"So,"
"I find that, uh, that the Corvettes are, are becoming really, really nice cars."
"They are, they're pretty aren't they lately"
Yeah.
"And  they, they've improved, the performance and the suspension such that they're actually a lot of fun to drive."
They really are.
"and in Orlando, there's, crime is getting to be a bigger problem than ever,"
so.
"Oh, yeah."
What part of California are you from?
"San Jose, California."
"Oh, really?"
I have a good friend there.
"Here, you know, the real problems are the gangs."
Yeah .
"A lot of gang related, a lot of murders, uh, just in general the whole,"
we've only been here a couple of years.
"Uh, before that we lived in Colorado"
"but in comparison to Colorado, it's real noticeable."
Oh yeah.
Uh-huh.
"I mean you can just feel, I mean, I can just sense,"
"I mean I won't even, I won't go to the grocery store at night."
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
that's
You know.
"And it, it's that kind of thing"
"and, uh,"
"That's really a shame when it has to constrain your activities like,"
Yeah.
"We have a neighborhood watch program in the house, uh, the development that we live in, which I think is a great way to reduce, uh, home theft, burglary, and things  of that sort."
Sure.
Do you have that where you live
"or,"
"Well, uh, interestingly enough, right before I moved up here,"
I'm an intern
and then I go  back down in May.
"Where, where are you?"
I'm in Dallas.
"Oh, yeah."
Are you in Dallas also?
"No,"
I'm in San Antonio.
"Oh, really,"
okay.
I get my news from a combination of sources.
I take the paper every day
Uh-huh.
"and I read it on the way in to work on the, in a carpool."
"Oh, really."
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, and I watch the, uh, actually I watch the morning news before I leave for work."
"And then, you know, usually over lunch, there'll be a big topic of conversation on something from the news."
Uh-huh.
"I normally find that uh, I'm probably the most, um, news hungry of my friends,"
"so I don't, we don't normally talk about the news at lunch."
"I, I find that I have to only subscribe to the paper on the weekend, simply because I used to get it during the week"
Uh-huh.
"but, um, I would always end up arriving at work late, because I would always end up skimming the headlines, spending too much time, reading it in the morning."
Yeah.
"So I have to cut myself down to the weekend, plus after work."
"Um, the MACNEIL LEHRER news hour is on public television"
Uh-huh.
and I enjoy that quite a bit.
Yeah.
"Um, one of the women that I work with, her husband is Iranian."
Uh-huh.
So here lately with all the Middle Eastern news we've had some very interesting conversations over lunch.
"I will admit I work with, uh, someone who's Iranian,"
"did you vote in the last, uh, national election?"
"Yes,"
"we, uh, uh, I haven't missed a one since I've been eligible to vote."
"Oh, that's good."
Did you get to vote at the last one?
I voted in the last national one.
"Yeah,"
I'm not sure *slash error; one utt with next
if I got the last local one.
"Oh, uh-huh,"
"yeah,"
"and sometimes the, the local ones aren't as publicized it seems that, uh, they should be."
"Yeah,"
you're not sure where to go and vote and all that.
"Right,"
"and, uh, there's usually nobody running against, you know, the incumbents."
"Right,"
"or you don't know what they you know, where they stand or anything like that."
Right.
"So, uh, but I, I feel that, uh, a lot of people have gotten lazy about voting."
"Yeah,"
I think you're right.
"And, it's, it's, they're,"
"and also they're fed up with the system,"
"and they say, well, why should I even vote."
"Yeah,"
"or sometimes they don't like either of the choices for the candidates,"
Right.
"so they think, well, you know, why vote."
Right.
The lesser of the two evils is how we usually look at it.
"Yeah,"
"and if, they should pay for it with their life."
Right.
"When you're saying as far as the appeal, uh, procedure was concerned."
Yeah.
"We just have the case,"
"I'm, I'm sure you've probably heard of Marion Berry."
Uh-huh.
"Uh, his last appeal was, was denied two days before his sentence was up"
"Oh, really."
"So, I mean, his appeal was denied"
and two days later he got out of jail For cocaine possession.
"It, uh,"
Yeah.
"But, uh, that was absurd"
"There is never, there was no reason  the appeal process should have dragged on that long for a six month sentence."
"I know that, that"
Uh-huh.
"And, I don't know."
"Uh, what would you do to change it? To make it better?"
"Well, uh, the, the only I can, I you know,"
"the, appeal procedure is the only thing I can possibly think of."
"Uh, like I said, as far as removing of the jury and having the judge sentence, that's absurd."
There's no way that could work.
"Oh, yeah."
"I, I, I don't agree with that at all."
"Uh, but,"
Imagine the guilt that person would have.
I mean  burned out.
"Oh, exactly."
"There's  there's no possible way that you could, uh, you know, feel good about yourself."
Exactly.
Right.
"It really does, except when you have to fill them up"
and then you get those Visa bills in.
And
Yeah.
"So anyway, um, anything else about the area, about, um,"
"you know, can you compare yourself to any thing around there."
Most of the neighborhood I'm in is pretty typical.
This whole neighborhood was built between sixty and sixty-five.
Yeah.
"So it's, it's,"
"Everybody has got a pretty good size yard,"
Yeah.
"I mean, I got probably the biggest,"
"if not the biggest yard, I've got pretty close to it,  in the entire neighborhood."
Yeah.
That's nice.
That is nice.
"But, you know, too, the only bad thing, too, is that then you have to keep up, you know,"
"you have to,  the yard to deal with"
"Well, I,  I enjoy that though."
"and,"
Do you.
"You must have more time than, than I have."
I'm sitting out here right now.
We had this terrible rain
and I'm looking at the yard and seeing how tall the grass has gotten
and it seems like
"now that's, that's,"
"I almost wish I was in an apartment or something. You know,"
It's rained
Yeah.
"Well, um, I don't know, do we just terminate this or do you have to talk for a certain amount of time?"
"But, um, what I do do, and I've always done it is,"
"at my father's house, we have, my sister and I have a couple of gardens."
"I think we figured out total, this is for vegetables about two thirds of an acre."
Uh-huh.
So we each have a third of an acre we do.
"Jeez,"
"that's more than, that's more than the property I have right here, that you've got as a, uh, garden,"
That's a lot
that's amazing.
"Yeah,"
"well, it's my dad's,"
and we've had it for he's been there for a long time
Right.
"so, um, it just happens they built a shopping center next to it"
"Oh, jeez."
"but, um, they put up a nice fence,"
"so we still have a lot of privacy,"
and we grow a lot of food.
Uh-huh.
"Uh, I enjoy it,"
"um, the gardens are kind of old,"
"you have to step down in them now because we've tilled them so much,"
Uh-huh.
"but there's still,"
"we, we, my sister uses probably a fertilizer."
I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing.
"But I wish this phone would stop screeching,"
Are you getting a lot of static on your end of the line?
Yes.
"I'm trying,"
I don't know if it's my phone.
This is bad.
"I might start using the answering machine more, because it's so hard to not pick up that phone when it rings."
"Oh, it's great,"
I mean.
"Well, you know, in fact, I've been missing calls from the T I switchboard,"
"because I, I always have it on you know,"
Right.
"and I'll get that, that message that says, uh, to, uh, um, you know, uh, end this call, press three"
Sure.
"and I assumed I, you know, it was from the switchboard."
You know
"Yeah,"
you're probably right.
Yeah
"it is, because one day I listened, you know, and it was you know,"
"but, um, I, I just got totally disgusted,"
"and then, you know, people asking for, for money for everything, you know,"
"I mean.  Exactly,"
I understand.
"I mean, I,"
it's hard to believe there's that many deputy sheriffs associations
"and,"
"and, you know, the policeman's associations."
"I know,"
they call you one time to send three kids to the carnival or circus
"Oh, I used to do that."
"and,"
"Yeah,"
"I used to do that,"
"I'd send, or three kids to the movies or something"
Right.
There's always a
"and I, my, my pat answer now is, well, you just called me the other night,"
"Uh, they, they don't get repealed as easily as they do."
"Like the guy in California got you know, twice before he went to the gas chamber"
"and then they said okay, no,"
you don't have to go.
And then they took him back.
"I mean, it just seems,  Yeah, it just seemed a little inconsistent."
"Jeez,"
that's a lot of repeals.
"And then you have like two,"
you have these people who are serial killers that didn't even get the death sentence back when ever you know.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
I don't know.
"I, I'm trying to think about other crimes that would warrant it."
"Uh, I guess,"
"what is it, what's the policy now with treason?"
"Do they, uh, do they axe you for treason or is it a life sentence?"
"No,"
"I don't, I don't think, uh, the military doesn't execute anymore"
so.
Yeah.
Or death before the firing squad or whatever.
Yeah.
"So, I think about the only one is, uh, rape,"
"Okay,"
I'm here.
How do you feel about public schools?
"Well, our public schools are, are really poor, I feel."
Uh-huh.
"Uh, I'm not sure where Georgia ranks in the nation"
"but, uh, we're toward the bottom."
Yeah.
"we've got one that gives you like a penny a can,"
"so if you,"
Really?
Yeah
For smashed cans?
"Well, actually, you have to give, put them in there unsmashed."
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, when you do that it, it basically crushes them and then drops a penny down a little shoot."
"Oh, can you, can you hold on for just a minute?"
Sure.
"I'm going to try pressing one again to make sure that I pressed it hard enough because, okay, just succeed"
Okay.
Okay?
"Oh, okay,"
"well, I guess, I guess,"
"Well, I heard it that, I heard it that time"
Yeah
"Okay,"
"well, anyways, you guys only get a penny a can."
"Well, when you buy like, uh, canned drinks and stuff like that, do they charge you for the deposit?"
"Uh, no,"
you probably get charged like a nickel or something like that.
Yeah.
Exactly
"and so it's like they charge you for the deposit,"
"so when you turn in the cans unsmashed, you're just, like, reimbursed."
"Oh, okay."
Type of thing.
"Okay,"
"no,"
they don't charge us that extra nickel.
"That's sort of nice, though"
"Oh, that's fantastic."
"Yeah,"
"I used to, uh, kind of be that way myself when I lived in, uh, north western Florida in the panhandle,"
I used to sail about every day.
"I'd work, go to work,"
I'd like to do some sailing.
"Yeah,"
it's a lot of fun.
"It's, uh,"
"especially if you get a, a pretty fast boat"
like those catamarans are pretty fast.
"Yeah,"
"what,"
"You can actually,"
"Do, if you get one like that do have somebody teach you that"
"or they just,"
"Well, actually, I, I've known how to sail pretty much my whole life."
"Uh, my family's pretty into it"
Yeah.
"and, uh, I took sailing lessons when I was about six"
"and then, uh"
Is it pretty easy?
"Yeah,"
"it, it's kind of a thing where you get the hang of it after a while, you know, uh, just kind of get a feel for the wind and how it works and, and the physics behind it."
Yeah.
"So it's, it's not too bad,"
"it's pretty easy to get the hang of, I think"
"and, uh, generally, everybody I've, I've known has kind of gotten into it,"
"but some people are more motorboaters, you know which is fine."
Yeah.
"Well, that's about all we have"
"Yeah,"
Yeah.
"I, uh, spent this past summer up in Canada."
"Uh, well part of it, touring."
"And, uh, you know, I was amazed cause I'd pick up a local paper and I'd read about all of these, you know, really interesting things going on."
"There's some serious talk about whether there's actually going to be a, a Canada, you know, in the next five years. You know, because of the problems with Quebec"
Yeah.
and I had never heard any of that before.
"Yeah,"
"you know, there was, a, a,"
"what is it called,"
is it Meech Lake Accord?
Uh-huh.
"Or, or, that's just something, uh, I'd say ninety percent of the people here would never have heard of"
"and I think that I heard of it about the first time when I was up in Calgary a couple of years ago and, you know, picked up a, a paper and started reading a little bit more detail about it."
"And, and came"
it was a big thing going on there
and I came back here
and nothing in the papers.
"Right,"
right.
I didn't see a thing about it.
"So it's, uh, we've got a long ways to go, I guess."
It's improved.
"And like I say, with C N N and, and, uh, the cable news."
"Even, even there's, uh, uh,"
it's it's semireligious in some respects.
But what is it?
"It's, uh, I mean it's news is not, not that way,"
"uh, oh, I'm trying to think of the channel."
"The, the CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR."
"Oh, yeah."
"Uh, I, it surprised me."
you could probably do that.
"Or is it,"
I've talked about adding at least one more room and definitely adding another bath on.
Yeah
"I would think so if you only have one bathroom for three bedrooms,"
that's tough.
"Do you not, like, have a half bath."
Not even a half bath.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's rough.
The house that I used to live in had one bath and a half.
And that was even just with two people.
That was a pain.
"The only thing that saves it, with the schedule I work and the schedule my wife works, we're getting ready to go to work at totally different times. So that. It's not like we're tripping over each other in the morning."
That's good.
Really.
That could account for a lot of marital problems I think
You get to know each other very well if you have to share a bathroom
It doesn't work if you're trying to shave and she's trying to put her eyeliner on
"and,  you're both fighting over the mirror."
No.
That's right.
It does not make for a happy situation.
That's true.
"Well, do you have any children?"
I've got one.
One child.
And they enjoy where they're living?
"We'll,"
he's nine months old.
"Oh, so he doesn't know, right."
"I do okay, because the kids are all in bed,"
"but before that, I really, there's not much time."
Right.
Or like at six thirty I'll watch WHEEL OF FORTUNE or something like that.
"Right,"
"well, our,"
"yeah,"
"if our if our grandchildren are with us, that's, they have to watch that."
We don't watch it unless they're here
Uh-huh.
"No,"
I like that.
"No,"
"I'll watch, game show kind of stuff"
"But they, uh,"
"but, Yeah."
"It's, it's, um, oh,"
"and, you know, the, the kids will get you started on stuff like AMERICA'S FUNNIEST HOME VIDEOS."
We've wound up sending in one.
That's something I didn't think that we'd ever do
Did you send one?
Yeah.
My oldest grandson pulling his tooth.
"He's, he's, he wouldn't let us pull it,"
How funny.
"and I mean, it, it got to the point he was eating a pear here,"
"and he bit into it,"
and it was just hanging by a thread.
"And I, and I'd tell him, you know, it's getting ready to fall out,"
"and he walked around the house with his face down toward the floor and his mouth open, hoping it would because he wouldn't let anybody pull it."
"And he he wound up pull,"
So do you have P C
"It's almost, you know, identical kind of country."
Uh-huh.
Beautiful.
Been that this year for the trees for the leaves.
Yeah.
Oh.
"Yeah,"
"I was up, I was up there cutting some firewood this weekend,"
so.
Um.
"Little, little oak tree that was dead, and cut it up and split it ."
"Yeah,"
"that's because it, it can't tolerate a freeze this early."
Is that right?
Well.
If it would came later it would be all right?
"Uh, it, there's some trees"
"like the oaks, like the white oaks seem to be pretty hardy."
"There's,"
nothing bothers them.
"Their leaves are still green,"
and some of the other oaks. There are a few oaks that have lost their leaves.
"Um, what I notice mostly is the red maples, that the leaves are just dead, the dogwoods still look, still look, you know, they got, uh, bit on the ends of the leaves a little bit,"
but they still look pretty good.
Um.
"It just depends on the, on the, uh, on the tree."
Okay.
"Well, it's not often you get, uh, many women interested in football"
Oh well
Do you follow football very much?
"I'm sorry, what?"
Do you follow football very much?
"Well, no fault's rather funny in Colorado, because it seems that everyone pays all the time instead of just the guilty party pays."
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"It's kind of, it's kind of strange here the way things go. Uh,"
"here if you have an accident and no one's injured, the police won't even show up."
You're kidding.
Nope.
"They say if nobody's injured, you all exchange names and take it up with your insurance company."
God.
"Well, if you,"
"I don't know how familiar you are with Maryland,"
"but, uh,"
Not at all.
"especially, the center part of Maryland where I Ninety-Five runs through it is really heavily populated."
There's just so many people and so many accidents every single day that it'd take a whole another police force just to answer the traffic.
They don't even try to keep up with it.
No.
God.
Not a bit.
So you lived in Texas for a while.
Yes
sir.
Huh.
"I spent, uh, couple of years down there."
Moved down there in eighty-seven
and moved out in eighty-nine.
"Are, where you from originally."
"Uh, right here in Maryland."
"Huh,"
so you just basically went home when you had a chance.
"Yeah,"
"And, uh, then she could be at home"
and then I'd bring her to my house for a couple of hours if I wanted too or whatever.
"But, uh, she paid, I think it was two or, I think it was about two fifty, three dollars a hour"
"and by the time I paid taxes on it, it, I was getting like eighty cents"
and that wasn't counting food or gas or anything.
"Oh, no."
Yeah.
It's hardly worth your time.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's pretty bad.
The only time I baby-sat was in high school
"and it, you know,"
of course you don't
"I didn't pay taxes on that,"
so.
Right.
"It was easy, you know, go over to some, uh,"
it was these people that lived in our neighborhood
and I'd just go over there.
"Every Thursday night, they went to the theater."
They had permanent tickets
"and they'd give me,"
"it was supposed to be two dollars an hour for two kids,"
but they would usually give me like five dollars more at the end of the night.
"Oh, wow."
"And, I mean, they'd, you know,"
it was great.
I'd go over there
"and there would be like, uh, you know, there's, we have these videos over here."
"Watch, whatever you want."
"And there's some Oreos in the, in the cupboard."
"I would, that's ideally the where, where I would like to be."
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
"and like I said, once, once it, it happened I couldn't because my son's tuition came due,"
"and I guess I had, you know, not really counted on it quite at that point"
Uh-huh.
"but, um, yeah,"
I didn't like it at all.
I was very uncomfortable.
"So,"
I can imagine.
"You know, and, and I mean, it was, I thought a lot,"
"sixty dollars interest or something for, for just a couple of months,"
"and I'm going jeez, that's outrageous,"
Yeah.
"but in, in, you know, retrospect it wasn't all that much,"
I mean a lot of people pay a lot more
"and and, you know, but still, I mean, I figured I didn't need those items if it cost me sixty dollars more to have them."
"Oh, yeah."
Uh-huh.
Think about what you can buy for sixty dollars.
Exactly
Groceries for a week.
"Yeah,"
yeah.
Yeah.
"I, I think about all, all the money that, that we've spent on interest on all of our credit cards,"
Uh-huh.
and it's just incredible.
But now did you use to not feel so badly because you could take it off your income tax?
We've never been able to take it off our income tax.
"Oh,"
Do you all just start planning real far ahead of time?
Pardon.
"Uh, do you all start planning real far ahead of time?"
"Well, no."
There is kind of a set pattern to it.
"There is, uh,"
"so, uh, the day it happens is ninety-eight percent of the planning usually."
"Oh, really"
Yeah.
"Uh, we, uh, get together, at the, uh, the park, uh, the, uh, the park, and playground area of the Church I was raised in"
Yeah.
"and, uh, everybody brings lots of food"
and some put up the volleyball net and sit around and tell stories and catch up and play volleyball all day and get really fat
Eat a lot.
"Oh, gosh."
It is a lot harder for us because we are like I said we are spread out
Yeah.
"and so we have to plan anywhere from six, well really probably a year ahead of time so that everyone, can uh, start their, uh, vacation time."
Schedule vacation time
and yeah.
We
"uh, Sat, uh, Sunday afternoon or, uh, sometimes it has been like on a Saturday afternoon."
Uh-huh.
"Usually, it is like Sunday afternoon"
and most people do not have more than you know a couple of hours drive at tops to get there and back.
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
"is that one of your, uh,"
"I mean, uh,"
"Well, where I am calling from is southern Mississippi."
"So, we have got, uh, uh, my wife and I have, uh, a bit longer ways to go than most."
Uh-huh.
"He, he'd, we'd gotten a couple of books"
and then he just started doing it.
I don't know.
"He, well he did all the flooring himself."
"He put the whole, the whole floor in"
and then I just started with the walls and the roof and started there.
"And then we were, put a, like a, not, not necessarily a garage, but just like a, off the side of that"
"after we had the house part made, we just decided we'd carry the roof out a little bit farther and put a carport more or less."
"It's not, you know, it's not enclosed."
"It's just somewhere to drive another car to, to park"
"and it's,"
"Do, do you build on slabs down there or did you build it up off the ground?"
"Uh, it's off the ground."
On the piers?
Uh-huh.
"It's on about uh, twenty-two inch piers, something like that."
"Did,"
You had those poured
So.
or you did them yourself?
"Uh, no,"
"those, those are,"
we did those ourselves
so.
You just put forms in the ground and fill them with concrete?
Yeah.
Huh.
"Exactly,"
"so. It's,"
"Well, the last thing I did completely myself was an outside deck which I was pretty proud of"
"Yeah,"
I mean they were so rude about it.
Right.
And so we wanted a different kind of catch
and she said well it's not guaranteed.
"And I said, well put it on because apparently nothing's guaranteed"
so do it anyway.
Uh-huh.
So we got the kind we wanted
and I was really disappointed with that.
I felt that this was a company that should have been more reliable
Uh-huh.
and I happened to need a birthday present for one of her friends
and I called there to see if they had it
and the lady was very nice.
"And I said my goodness,"
"I said you've been very nice, what's your name."
And she told me
and I said well I really appreciate it.
"I said there seems to be a big attitude problem in that, store"
and it turned out she was the assistant manager
"so,"
Right.
"So I felt kind of good about that, you know."
I didn't  even know the person's name that had given me the hard time or anything
Uh-huh.
Right.
"but I just felt like, well at least I did something."
Maybe they'll fix it.
"They might work on that, you know."
"Right,"
right.
But I find attitudes are more of a problem.
"In addition to the desecration of the courthouse's loose paper records, either a Union Army officer or an Indiana unit confiscated an old Scots language Bible belonging to White, which had been passed down to him from his grandfather, John White. The ""old Scots Bible"" was purportedly taken as punishment against White for his support of the Confederacy."
"White left Romney with his wife and youngest children and traveled to Richmond where he was offered a position in the Confederate States Department of the Treasury within the government of the President of the Confederate States of America, Jefferson Davis."
"White died soon after his arrival in Richmond on October 9, 1862. He was interred by Scottish Rite Masons at Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond. Distant relative Reverend Moses D. Hoge of the Southern Presbyterian Church, Bishop Duncan of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, and Bishop Minegerode of the Southern Protestant Episcopal Church participated in White's funeral services."
"White's friends and family believed that he ""died of grief"" caused by the loss of his property in Romney and his concern for the safety of the records in the Hampshire County Courthouse during the conflict. In their ""History of Hampshire County, West Virginia: From Its Earliest Settlement to the Present"" (1897), West Virginia historians Hu Maxwell and Howard Llewellyn Swisher said of White:"
"White was married first to Alcinda Louisa Tapscott of Jefferson County, Virginia (now West Virginia), on December 15, 1815. Tapscott was White's cousin through his mother, Arabella Baker White. White and his first wife Alcinda had three children together:"
"White was married for the second time to Frances Ann Streit (March 19, 1811 – November 12, 1866), a daughter of Lutheran Reverend Christian Streit of Winchester, Virginia. Streit and her family were of Swiss descent. White and his second wife, Frances, had ten children (one of which died in infancy):"
"White and his family resided in a large brick mansion located along East Main Street (Northwestern Turnpike) which was later known as ""Liberty Hall"". Due to his upbringing in an affluent family, White was a person of means from a young age, and in his early adulthood he was able to construct a ""large brick mansion"" at this location. His original residence was destroyed by fire in 1857, and White replaced it with a more modest brick edifice where he resided until his departure from Romney in 1861 during the American Civil War. White's home was a ""seat of true old Virginia hospitality"" and it was frequented by all socio-cultural strata of Hampshire County and the greater Valley of Virginia region."
"During the construction of the Northwestern Turnpike through Romney, the state superintendent for the project, Angus William McDonald, proposed building the thoroughfare through White's garden in front of his residence. White won an appeal in court which caused the turnpike to be rerouted, thus creating the present curve on East Main Street in front of White's former residence."

"The Best of Jean Shepard is a compilation album by the American country artist of the same name. The album was released in September 1963 on Capitol Records. Due to the death of Shepard's husband, Hawkshaw Hawkins, in a plane crash earlier that year, an official studio album was never issued. Instead, Shepard's record label decided to compile her significant hits into one album of material."
"""The Best of Jean Shepard"" contained all of Shepard's major hits and significant songs of her career up to that point. It included songs ranging from sessions dating to May 19, 1953 through May 9, 1961. Shepard's early sessions were recorded at the Capitol Recording Studio in Hollywood, California. Her remaining recording sessions took place at the Bradley Film and Recording Studio, located in Nashville, Tennessee. The album consisted of most of Shepard's major hits up until 1963, beginning with her first major hit, ""A Dear John Letter"" (1953). It also includes her 1955 solo hits, ""A Satisfied Mind"" and ""Beautiful Lies"". The album also includes some lesser-known songs such as ""I Learned It All from You"", ""The Other Woman"", and ""I've Got to Talk to Mary""."
"""The Best of Jean Shepard"" was officially released in September 1963 on Capitol Records. Upon its release, the album did not spawn any singles. However, songs that were previously released as singles the following year appear on the album. This includes, ""The Root of All Evil (Is a Man)"" and ""How Long Does It Hurt (When a Heart Breaks)"". ""Allmusic"" reviewed the record, giving four out of five stars. Music critic Dan Cooper called ""The Best of Jean Shepard"" a, ""A good compilation of her first wave of hits (""A Dear John Letter,"" ""A Satisfied Mind""), this is also the LP that shows up most often in used record bins."""

"The ""Syöksy""-class motor torpedo boats () was a series of four British Thornycroft type motor torpedo boats of the Finnish Navy. The vessels were constructed in 1928 by the John Thornycroft & Co. shipyard in Woolton, UK. The vessels saw service in World War II. The Thornycroft type released its torpedoes by dropping them from rails in the aft. The ship then had to steer away from the torpedoes path, a manoeuvre that could be quite tricky in the close waters of the Gulf of Finland."
"In 1942, the vessels received individual identification symbols on their superstructures. ""Nuoli"" had the ace of hearts, ""Vinha"" the ace of clubs, ""Syöksy"" the ace of diamonds, and ""Raju"" the ace of spades."
"On 6 July 1941 ""Syöksy"" and ""Vinha"" sortied to intercept a convoy of three sailing ships headed for Hanko. In heavy seas the torpedoes did not function reliably and the boats could not hit their targets. Instead ""Syöksy"" dashed past the lead ship and dropped its depth charges in front of it which exploded and sank the sailing ship. Both Finnish motor torpedo boats escaped unharmed before escorting Soviet ships could respond."
"On the night of 19 and 20 July 1941 Finnish motor torpedo boats were patrolling of the coast of Estonia when a Soviet destroyer opened fire on them. ""Vinha"" was damaged and unable to move but Finns were able to tow it to safety while ""Syöksy"" made repeated torpedo runs towards the destroyer drawing its fire and distracting it."
"On 1 September 1941 ""Syöksy"" and ""Vinha"" were patrolling south of the Beryozovye Islands when they came across a pair of Soviet freighters. ""Syöksy"" torpedoed and sank the lead merchant (SS ""Meero"", 1,866 tons)."
"On 22 September 1941 ""Syöksy"" sank the Soviet minehunter ""T-41"" (""Kirov"") east of Gogland while it was patrolling near the island with ""Vinha""."
"On 1 October 1941 ""Nuoli"" participated in the sinking of a Soviet minehunter, though it was a torpedo from ""Sisu"" that sank the target."
"""Syöksy"", ""Vinha"" and , as well as a minelaying KM boat participated in the attack on the harbour of Lavansaari on 18 November 1942. ""Syöksy"" managed to torpedo the (1,760 tons), which sank."

"Microsoft Network Monitor is a deprecated packet analyzer. It enables capturing, viewing, and analyzing network data and deciphering network protocols. It can be used to troubleshoot network problems and applications on the network. Microsoft Network Monitor 1.0 (codenamed ""Bloodhound"") was originally designed and developed by Raymond Patch, a transport protocol and network adapter device driver engineer on the Microsoft LAN Manager development team."
Network Monitor was replaced by Microsoft Message Analyzer (MMA was discontinued in 2019).
"The LAN Manager development team had one shared hardware-based analyzer at the time. Netmon was conceived when the hardware analyzer was taken during a test to reproduce a networking bug, and the first Windows prototype was coded over the Christmas holiday. The first 4 bytes of the Netmon capture file format were used to validate the file. The values were 'RTSS' for Ray, Tom, Steve, and Steve - the first four members of the team. The code was originally written for OS/2 and had no user interface; a symbol was placed in the device driver where the packet buffers were kept so received data could be dumped in hex from within the kernel debugger."
"Netmon caused a bit of a stir for Microsoft IT since networks and e-mail were not encrypted at the time. Only a few software engineers had access to hardware analyzers due to their cost, but with Netmon many engineers around the company had access to network traffic for free. At the request of Microsoft IT, two simple identification features were added - a non-cryptographic password and an identification protocol named the Bloodhound-Oriented Network Entity (BONE) (created and named by Raymond Patch as a play on the codename ""Bloodhound"")."

"Blas Ruiz de Hernán González or Blas Ruiz de Fernán González was an explorer from Ciudad Real, Spain."
"In the last decade of the 16th century, along with the Portuguese adventurer Diogo Veloso from Amarante, Blas Ruiz was the first European to ever set foot in Laos."
"Ruiz's journey to Laos started in Cambodia. In Cambodia, Ruiz met and befriended King Satha of Lovek and Veloso of Portugal. When Lovek was invaded by Ayautthaya, Satha was overthrown by his son and other nobles who allowed Ayutthaya to take control, forcing Ruiz to flee to the Spanish colony of the Philippines, the place where he began his adventure in Southeast Asia. Eventually Ruiz returned with Veloso, who had fled to the Portuguese colony of Melaka, to Lovek. When they arrived they learned Satha had fled to Lan Xang, an empire centered in modern-day Laos and consisting of Isan, Stung Treng, and small areas of Southern China and Vietnam. Ruiz and Veloso decided to journey to Laos and bring back Satha to restore his reign over Lovek."
"Ruiz and Veloso arrived in Vientiane, Lan Xang's administrative capital, in the summer of 1596. They were met with a procession showing off the city's immense wealth consisting of Asian Elephants, gold, jewels, silk, exotic snakes, bouquets of tropical flowers, chanting monks, Buddhist treasures and relics, music, and beautiful women. Ruiz and Veloso were also received with a great feast. But while they were in Vientiane they learned Satha had died from an illness he caught on his way from Cambodia to Laos. Saddened and angered by the news, Ruiz and Veloso returned to Lovek and started a rebellion to put one of Satha's political allies on the throne and free Cambodia from Ayatthaya. They managed to drive out Ayutthaya forces from parts of Cambodia and create a new state but led the new Cambodian state into a brief period of chaos. Eventually Ruiz returned to the Philippines. It is not known whether he died there, Spain, or somewhere else."
"In July 1593 king Satha I sent an embassy to Manila asking for Spanish military help to defend Cambodia. The embassy consisted of Portuguese Diogo Veloso, who had been living in his court since 1583, and Spanish Gregorio de Vargas Machuca. Satha I kept Spanish Bias Ruiz de Hernan Gonzalez as captain of his bodyguard. Veloso came back in February 1594, alone and without help. After Ayutthaya's attack on Cambodia, Veloso, Bias Ruiz and de Vargas Machuca found themselves in Manila. They continued to ask for help, and at last, Spanish Manila agreed to send 3 ships with 120 Spanish and Mexican soldiers, some Japanese and Philippino auxiliaries and some friars, under the commander Suarez Gallinato. The ship with Bias Ruiz was the only one that reached Cambodia. The one with Veloso was wrecked off the Mekong delta and Gallinato's ship was forced to go to Malacca due to the weather. Veloso rejoined Bias Ruiz at Phnom Penh in March 1596. They were both killed at Phnom Penh in July 1599 during a fight between Christians (Spanish and Philippinos) and Muslim Malay mercenaries of Barom Reacha II, who was Satha's son. Satha had died in October 1597 after contracting disease after he fled to Lan Xang."
"From independence to the time of his death he was associated with cricket in Pakistan and dedicated all his life and abilities for the promotion of Pakistan cricket. In recognition of his service one of the gates of the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium carries his name, ""Maqsood Ahmed Enclosure"" and so does one of the benches at the Bagh-e-Jinnah Cricket Ground located inside the historic Lahore Gymkhana."

"In October 1952, in Pakistan's second Test match and first Test victory, he became the first player to score a Test century for Pakistan, and the first player to remain on the ground for an entire Test match. An opening batsman, he carried his bat for his score of '124 not out' in Pakistan's total of 331 in an innings victory over India, batting for 8 hours 35 minutes."
"Shortly after the series, he injured his arm, ending his career.

"= = = An Englishman, an Irishman and a Scotsman = = ="
"""An Englishman, an Irishman and a Scotsman"" is the opening line of a category of joke popular in Ireland and the United Kingdom. The nationalities involved may vary, though they are usually restricted to those within Ireland and the UK, and the number of people involved is usually three or sometimes four. In Ireland, the characters are sometimes called ""Paddy Irishman, Paddy Englishman, and Paddy Scotsman"". Depending on who is telling the joke, one nationality fares well and the other nationalities fare poorly according to national stereotypes. For example, in England the punchline is usually based around the Irishman being stupid, the Scotsman being mean or miserly, and the Englishman being posh (or a snob but ultimately not the butt of the joke), whereas in Scotland and Ireland, the Englishman will typically be the butt of the joke. Sometimes, when the joke requires four people, a Welshman is brought in."
"The joke typically starts with the home or favoured nationality and ends with the nationality and associated stereotype against which the joke is made. For example, in England, the joke begins ""An Englishman, an Irishman and a Scotsman..."" whereas in Ireland it begins ""Paddy Irishman, Paddy Englishman, and Paddy Scotsman""."
"The joke typically places the three characters in a scenario. How each person in the joke reacts to the scenario is then explained in order by person, the final reaction being the punch line, playing up to the stereotype of that nationality.

"An ""attractive stroke-making right-handed batsman, who was ideal in a crisis"", he played in Pakistan's first 18 Tests, including its first five victories. In Pakistan's first Test series, against India in 1952–53, he was the highest scorer on either side, with 357 runs at an average of 44.62, playing several defiant innings when Pakistan were in trouble. He was less successful on the 1954 tour of England, with 103 runs at 14.71, but impressed with his fielding in the covers."
"He scored his only Test century against New Zealand in 1955–56 at Lahore, when he made 189 in 430 minutes, adding 309 for the seventh wicket with Imtiaz Ahmed after the score had been 111 for 6.

It stands in of parkland which includes one of the two privately owned deer parks to remain in Shropshire and is notable for its population of red kites.
"The estate is mentioned in the Domesday Book. The core of the present house dates from the 17th century, though significant remodelling was carried out throughout the 19th century. The ruins of an earlier castle, built in 1340, survive in the grounds."
"The north front was built in 1712 by Sir Edward Leighton, 2nd Baronet, who moved his family seat here from Wattlesborough Castle, and was High Sheriff of Shropshire for 1727. In 1805, the 5th Baronet entertained the Prince Regent and the Duke of Clarence at Loton. Sir Baldwin Leighton, 6th Baronet was wounded in the American War of Independence, was a Brigadier in Portugal and Governor of Carrickfergus Castle."
"The house is currently the home of Sir Michael Leighton, 11th Baronet."
The estate is also prominent in motorsport as the location of the Loton Park Hill Climb.
"Loton Hall is a Grade II*-listed building, dated c.1670. A country house, originally with a U-shaped plan, a large wing was added to the southeast in 1872–73. The house is built in red brick with dressings in red and grey sandstone and a tile roof. The earlier part has a plinth, quoins, chamfered, coped and parapeted gables with finials. There are two storeys, a basement and attics, and a front of five bays, the outer bays projecting and gabled. In the centre is a three-bay loggia-porch that has arches with imposts, Tuscan columns, an entablature, and a balustrade.

"WLMG (101.9 MHz, ""Magic 101.9 FM"") is a commercial FM radio station licensed to New Orleans, Louisiana. Owned by Entercom, it broadcasts an adult contemporary radio format. From mid-November to December 25th each year, it switches to all-Christmas music. The station's studios and offices are located at the 400 Poydras Tower in New Orleans' downtown district."
"WLMG has an effective radiated power (ERP) of 100,000 watts, the maximum for non-grandfathered FM stations. The transmitter site is off Bahrman Highway in the Algiers neighborhood of New Orleans. WLMG broadcasts in the HD Radio hybrid format."
"On March 15, 1970, the station first signed on the air as WWL-FM. It was owned by Loyola University of the South, now known as Loyola University New Orleans. Loyola also owned Channel 4 WWL-TV and AM powerhouse 870 WWL."
WWL and WWL-FM had the same call sign but separate formats. The AM was a full service middle of the road station while WWL-FM played beautiful music. It featured quarter hour sweeps of instrumental cover versions of popular songs with Hollywood and Broadway show tunes.
"In the mid-1970s, station management decided to go in a radically different direction, seeking a younger demographic for WWL-FM. Out went the soft instrumental musicians such as Henry Mancini and Percy Faith, trading them in for Michael Jackson and Paul McCartney. WWL-FM flipped to a Top 40 sound. But this was an era where most young people still were listening to inexpensive AM radios for their favorite hits. The station failed to make much headway against AM Top 40 leader 690 WTIX (now WQNO)."
"By May 1976, WWL-FM returned to easy listening music. The format featured mostly instrumental songs with several soft vocals each hour. On December 26, 1980, to separate the FM station's image from its AM and TV counterparts, the call letters were changed to WAJY. The station, calling itself ""Joy 102,"" moved closer to a 50/50 mix of instrumentals and vocals, some from soft rock artists such as Elton John, Olivia Newton-John, Stevie Wonder and Chicago."
"Through the 1980s, the easy format saw its audience continuing to age, while most advertisers seek young and middle-aged listeners. In 1987, the station completed its transition to a soft adult contemporary sound, eliminating the instrumental songs. The call sign was changed to WLMG using the moniker ""Magic 102."" With most radios in the 1990s going from analog dials to digital, the station began calling itself ""Magic 101.9"" in 1995."
"Over the next decade, WWL and WLMG switched hands several times. In 1989, Loyola University sold the stations to Keymarket Communications. The TV station was sold to a group of its employees, using the name Rampart Broadcasting. In July 1995, the radio stations were acquired by River City Communications. Later ownership switched to Sinclair Broadcasting. And in December 1999, WWL and WLMG were acquired by Entercom."
"In the early 2000s, WLMG moved to a mainstream adult contemporary sound. The tempo of the songs was picked up and the disc jockeys added more personality. The playlist extends from the 1980s to current day AC hits. In 2006, the WWL-FM call sign returned to New Orleans, on another station. Entercom decided to give AM 870 WWL an FM simulcast on 105.3 MHz, allowing WWL listeners the choice to hear the station on FM or AM."

"Louis Armstrong Stadium was a tennis stadium of the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center and one of the venues of the U.S. Open. Armstrong was the main stadium before Arthur Ashe Stadium opened in 1997, after which it served as the No. 2 stadium. It is named after the noted jazz musician Louis Armstrong, who lived nearby until his death in 1971 and was a significant figure in the Civil Rights Movement."
"The stadium was originally built as the Singer Bowl for the 1964 New York World's Fair, and hosted special events and concerts afterwards. It was renamed the Louis Armstrong Stadium in 1973 but closed the following year."
"In the early 1970s, the United States Tennis Association was looking for a new place to host the US Open as relations with the West Side Tennis Club in Forest Hills, which had hosted the tournament, were breaking down. The USTA was initially unable to find a sufficient site, but the association's incoming president, W.E. Hester saw the old Singer Bowl from the window of an airplane flying into LaGuardia Airport. The old, long rectangular stadium was heavily renovated and divided into two venues, becoming the square Louis Armstrong Stadium, with the remaining third becoming the attached Grandstand, with a seating capacity of about 6,000."
"In 1997, the stadium was replaced as the US Open's primary venue by the new Arthur Ashe Stadium. Armstrong Stadium was renovated again, with the top tiers of seating being removed. The stadium held close to 18,000 at its peak, but this was reduced to around 10,200 with the renovation, which also added a brick facade to match that of Ashe Stadium."
The stadium was demolished in October 2016.
"A new 14,000-seat Louis Armstrong Stadium opened for the 2018 US Open. This new stadium features a retractable roof and is the largest of No. 2 stadium at a Grand Slam site. For the 2017 tournament, while construction was still ongoing on the new stadium, a temporary 8,800-seat stadium was built on the site of the demolished ticket office and East Gate entrance, on Parking Lot B, close to the boardwalk ramp to the subway and LIRR trains."

"Ion I. Moța [or Motza] (5 July 1902, Orăștie, Austria-Hungary—13 January 1937, Majadahonda, Spain) was the Romanian nationalist deputy leader of the Iron Guard killed in battle during the Spanish Civil War."
"Son of the nationalist Orthodox priest Ioan Moța, who edited a journal called ""Liberty"", Ion I. Moța studied law at University of Paris (1920-1921), the University of Cluj, University of Iași and University of Grenoble. His thesis, finished in 1932 at the University of Grenoble, was entitled ""Juridical Security in the Community of Nations."""
"At Cluj, he founded Acțiunea Românească (""Romanian Action""), a nationalist group inspired by Charles Maurras' Action Française. This organization fused with A. C. Cuza's National-Christian Defense League in 1925. Moța met Corneliu Zelea Codreanu at a meeting of antisemitic students in August 1923. The two formed a plan to assassinate Romanian politicians and leaders of Romanian Jewry seen as traitors and corruptors of Romanian national life. They were arrested in Bucharest on 8 October 1923 and sent to Văcărești prison. Acquitted in March 1924, Moța shot Vernichescu, the member of their conspiracy who betrayed it to the authorities, seven times (but not fatally). He spent two months in Galata prison before being acquitted and released on 29 September 1924."
"Codreanu made Moța leader of ""Frăția de Cruce"", a group of peasants and students who would fight for nationalistic renewal (founded on 6 May 1924). Moța attended the World Anti-Semitic Congress in September 1925; upon the founding of the Iron Guard (the ""Legion of the Archangel Michael""), on 24 June 1927, he became deputy Captain to Codreanu."
"Ion Moța represented the Legion at the 1934 Fascist International meeting in Montreux. He was vice-president of the Iron Guard political creation, the ""Everything for the Country Party"". From 1934 through 1936, he served as a correspondent for ""Welt-Dienst"" / ""World-Service"", an anti-Jewish publication founded by Ulrich Fleischhauer in Erfurt, Germany. Fleischhauer was a staunch believer in the veracity of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion and appeared as an ""expert witness"" for the pro-Nazis at the famous Berne Trial."
"In late 1936, Moța formed a Legionary unit to fight against the Republican forces in the Spanish Civil War. He and Vasile Marin (another prominent Legionary) were killed on the Madrid Front on the same day of fighting (13 January 1937). Their funerals in Bucharest (13 February 1937) were an immense and orderly procession (""see Funerals of Ion Moța and Vasile Marin""), attended by the Ministers of Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and Francisco Franco's Spain, representatives of Portugal, the Japan of the early Shōwa period, and delegates of the Polish Patriotic Youth."
"In the 13th century, (this conflict formed the backdrop for some of Dante Alighieri's ""Divine Comedy"", completed in 1320)."
"A crossroads near the rue Camollia. On the outskirts of Sienna, the banned Guelphs and the reigning Ghibellines fight. The Guelphs are led by Orso who had been banished for having dared to throw a garland to the Ghibelline Cordelia Saracini. From the battle the guelfes emerge victorious at the portcullis of the Saracini palace. Orso demands that Cordelia appear at the balcony and open the gates to the town. Cordelia replies to him: « … now is not the time to open the gates, when thieves are in the town! » Orso give orders for an assault, the gate rises and he enters the Saracini palace bent on vengeance. Rather than throw Cordelia from the window as the screaming crowd demands, he drags her half-strangled back into the palace."
"Premier tableau – a great hall in the Seigniory palace. Despite their apparent victory, the Guelphs only control but half of the city. Among the dead on the Ghibelline side is Andreino, the fifteen-year-old son of Uberta, Cordelia's old nurse. The Guelphs request a truce in order to tend to the injured and bury the dead : plague is feared. The Saracini palace is on fire. Cordelia comes back, alive, but tells her brothers Ercole and Giugurta, as well as her nurse, that she has been raped by a man of whom all she can remember is the voice."
"Deuxième tableau – the cathedral square. Guelphs and Ghibellines attend the solemn mass for the Virgin in the cathedral. At the point of coming to blows, the Bishop Azzolino steps forward and upbraids them : « Siennois, is this what you call a truce for the Virgin ? Church is God's house alone ! – Faithless and unworthy Christians put your weapons down or I will close these doors and will open them only to admit your coffins! » They defer in the face of the threat; Orso only speaking a word but it is enough for Cordelia to recognize as she follows the men into the church."
"Premier tableau – a cloister. While Cordelia recognizes Orso as her torturer, Uberta learns by chance that the killer of her son is also Orso ! The two women argue over which should kill him. Cordelia decides with her plea : « You only mourn a death; I, I mourn myself, alive! ». Cordelia strikes Orso, and he falls to the ground, his throat cut with a dagger thrust. As a fight ensues, his men carry him, still breathing, to the shade of a church porch. When Cordelia and Uberta retrace steps to finish their vengeance, they cannot find the body and wonder if he was only injured. Cordelia cries out : « God of vengeance ! let him be dead ! I will not finish the task ! »."
"Deuxième tableau – the square. Cordelia discovers Orso in agony and pleading for a drink. Faced with this suffering, she pities him and pours fresh water on his lips."
"Premier tableau – a room in the Saracini palace. Cordelia has concealed Orso in the burnt palace. Giugurta, beaten, must flee the town. He wants to leave the palace by the gardens but to do that must pass through the room where Orso is hiding, convalescent. Cordelia puts him off with such insistence that Uberta becomes suspicious. A horrific explanation finally reveals the truth to Uberta, but Cordelia asks for mercy in the name of Andreino who would have condemned this bloody sacrifice. Cordelia and Orso find themselves alone. Two images alternate in the mind of Orso : the woman who stabbed him and the woman who saved him. The two make one victim of him; his repentance bursts forth and to restore her honour he asks to marry her. Cordelia replies that he is also guilty to his country riven by war. Orso promises her : « You will see me again when I have triumphed over discord and vanquished hatred! » He leaves the palace and it is announced that Giugurta has been arrested by the Guelphs, masters of the city."
"Deuxième tableau – ruins of the old Seigniory palace. The captured Ghibelline prisoners including Giurgurta are about to be executed. Orso enters and proposes to the people that the prisoners be freed, in order to march against the Emperor laying siege to the city and demanding 50,000 florins to lift the siege. The people accept. As they set off for battle Giugurta catches a glance and words from Cordelia to Orso, and says that he will return and question her after the battle."
"Sienna cathedral. The Siennese return victorious. Cordelia, frightened by her brother's threats has taken refuge in the cathedral. Giugurta find her there having extracted the information before killing Uberta. After proud protests, Cordelia faints on the altar steps, and he takes advantage to make her swallow poison. The victors come in with Orso at their head. Cordelia has convulsions which are mistaken for the plague. The crowd disperses in horror, and Orso takes Cordelia in his arms. So doing, he condemns himself to be trapped with her in the place tainted by the plague. At their pleas, Azollino joins them in marriage. Alone, they exchange parting words : Orso's wound has re-opened, and the two lovers die side by side."

= = = Dhamaal = = =
"Dhamaal (; English translation: ""Fun"") is a 2007 Indian comedy film directed by Indra Kumar and produced by Ashok Thakeria. The film stars Sanjay Dutt, Ritesh Deshmukh, Arshad Warsi, Aashish Chaudhary and Javed Jaffrey in the lead roles while Asrani, Sanjay Mishra, Vijay Raaz, Manoj Pahwa and Tiku Talsania are featured in supporting roles. It is heavily inspired from Rat Race which is a 2001 American comedy film directed by Jerry Zucker, and some scenes are shot-for-shot copies from other Mr. Bean Movies. It is the first installment of ""Dhamaal film series"". The film was remade on 2008 Kannada movie ""Mast Maja Maadi""."
"In 2011, the film spawned a sequel, under the title of ""Double Dhamaal"", with the lead cast reprising their roles."
"A third sequel, under the name ""Total Dhamaal"" was released in February 2019, with only Deshmukh, Warsi and Jaffrey returning with an entirely new cast and a fresh story, having no connections to ""Dhamaal"" and ""Double Dhamaal."""
"Four good-for-nothing friends - Roy (Ritesh Deshmukh), Adi (Arshad Warsi), Boman (Aashish Chaudhary), and Manav(Javed Jaffrey) - are kicked out of their house by their landlady (Suhasini Mulay) for not paying their rents. Desperate to earn money, they devise up a plan. Adi tells Manav to steal a painting from the house. They decide to sell it to the son of the late Businessman Dwiwedi. However, Manav accidentally picks up a blank painting not knowing the reality. They humorously sell the painting for Rs.20,000 to Dwiwedi. They then pick up the original painting with the intention to sell it to Mr. Aggarwal, not knowing that he has been murdered. The case is handled by Inspector Kulkarni (Murli Sharma). He learns that before Mr. Aggrawal was murdered, he was speaking on the phone to somebody and he mentioned the words ""horse"" and ""grass."" He interprets these words to be some code language. The four arrive at Agrawal's residence. Kulkarni demands to see the painting. Seeing the horse and grass on the painting, he immediately arrests them."
"On the highway, Kulkarni drops the four on the road after realizing that they are innocent. The four are overjoyed until they suddenly witness a car accident of Don Bose (Prem Chopra). He tells them that he has hidden a treasure of 10 crore in the St. Sebastian garden in Goa under a big 'W'. He tells them to divide the money equally among themselves and then dies. They come across Inspector Kabir Nayak (Sanjay Dutt) who has been trying to arrest Bose for the past ten years. He tries to extract information from the four but in vain, they escape from there and decide to travel to Goa. Desperate for his promotion, Kabir is determined to capture the four. All four friends steal Boman's car which belongs to his father Nari (Asrani), who loves his car more than his son and threw his son out after he damaged his car. The friends manage to steal their car but not before hitting Nari on the head and making him unconscious. Roy loses control of the car in a forest and hits it against a tree, breaking both headlights. They decide to spend the night in the car. The next day Kabir is transferred to Yavatmal for failing to capture Bose. Furious he walks towards his table where Nari is waiting for him to file a complaint against his son for stealing his car. He gives Kabir the photos of Boman and his car. Meanwhile, all four come across a broken bridge which is the only way through the forest. They decide to jump the car but Boman is reluctant to do so. They manage to jump the car on the other side but it blasts off."
"Kabir tracks the four down after discovering the destroyed car. He is able to learn the location of the treasure due to Manav's dumbness. He ties all four of them to a tree and sets off. However they manage to escape and it is revealed that Roy had actually cut the engine wires of Kabir's car so he must have not gone too far. They reach a dhabha and pretend to be detectives. They make the villagers believe that Kabir is a member of the Pasha gang and lures them to capture him for the reward would be Rs. 15 lakhs. Kabir defeats the villagers and he and the four arrive at a settlement - 60% would belong to the four and 40% would belong to Kabir. But Boman insists on having his money separately for damaging his car from the rest of the three. Consequently, a fight ensues and is decided that whoever reaches the treasure first would take all the money."
"All four part ways and try to reach Goa as soon as possible. Roy encounters a dacoit Babubhai (Sanjay Mishra) and agree to divide the money among themselves provided they reach Goa as soon as possible. Boman also encounters his father. Though Nari initially wants to kill his son, changes his mind after he learns about the ten crores. Adi and Manav travel together. Kabir nearly escapes death as he hangs off a cliff and is rescued by some school children whose school bus he stole. All of them go through a series of humorous adventures before reaching Goa. All of them except Kabir reach the garden at the same time. Finally Roy explains that it is useless finding the treasure alone and all agree to find the money together. They all search for the big 'W'. Manav is able to locate the Palm trees which make the shape of a 'W' when a crow defecates on Adi. But Kabir arrives there and tells them to divide the money against them to which all agree. They dig there and are able to find the money. But again a fight ensues over the payment for the damage of the car. All are enraged when Adi and Manav decide to pay the money as one unit but are separate units while taking money. The fight goes on during which Kabir takes all the money and runs. He tries to escape in a hot air balloon on a beach but finds it tied to a pole. He dives in an effort to cut the rope but is beaten up by the rest who pursue him. The balloon blows off shore and all are disheartened. Conditions change when the wind changes direction and the balloon again blows onshore. They follow the balloon in a towing van. The balloon clashes against a pole and the bag falls down. All of them try to collect as much money as they can when suddenly some spot lights focus on them and a crowd cheers loudly behind them. They are actually standing in stage where a function is being held by an organisation named 'Help Orphans'. Seeing the money everybody thinks they have come here to donate money. All of them get emotional and all decide to donate the money for the orphans. The film ends on a happy note conveying that the fate of the money was already decided. It never belonged to the four friends. They were just a medium which helped the money reach its true destination."
"The film's soundtrack is composed by Adnan Sami with lyrics penned by Sameer. The songs, ""Dekho Dekho"" and ""Miss India Marthi Mujhpe"", were both known as the title song, since the main chorus of both the songs included the title ""Dhamaal""."
"A sequel named ""Double Dhamaal"" was released in 2011. Third film of the franchise was named Total Dhamaal and released in 2019. Both the movies became huge box office hits."

Srinkhal () is a collection of short stories in the Assamese language written by Bhabendra Nath Saikia. The author received the Sahitya Akademi award for the collection in 1976.
The book contains 14 stories:
"There is a wide variety of training media that can be used, ranging from traditional lecture-based teaching to sophisticated simulators. Different media will be more or less appropriate for different activities. It is necessary to determine the most suitable and cost-effective training media for the different areas."
"There have been many different approaches defined, however, the system approach to training has been the most successful."
Training Needs Analysis (TNA) is defined as the “Identification of training requirements and the most cost effective means of meeting those requirements”.
"A TNA should always be performed where a major new development in policy, equipment acquisition or procedures is deemed to have potential impact upon the current training regime."
"TST has considerable experience of successfully employing the accepted techniques applied to the development of training systems, including the Systems Approach to Training (SAT) in both the defence and civilian domains using customer specific standards such as JSP 822 where required."
Carrying out all TNA activates in accordance with SAT principles ensures rigorous visibility in each design stage with clear audit trails from the initial Scoping Study through to the recommended solution.

"A T visa is a type of visa allowing certain victims of human trafficking and immediate family members to remain and work temporarily in the United States, typically if they report the crime to law enforcement, and agree to help them in the investigation and/or prosecution of the crime (or crimes) committed against them. It also allows close family members of the victims to come to the United States legally."
"The United States government estimated in 2002 that each year up to 50,000 people are trafficked illegally into the United States, mostly women and children, and are trapped in slavery-like situations. As a response, it enacted the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 (VTVPA), which, among other things, allows such people to apply for 3-year temporary visas that lead to permanent resident status. In 2006, Congress modified 8 CFR 214.11(p) to now have the T-visa to be for 4 years. Although 5,000 are available per year, only 2,000 had been issued as of January, 2009. In 2017, there were 8524 cases of human trafficking being reported to National Human Trafficking Hotline. And up to 2018, allowed stay period for people who are granted with T- visa is still 4 years."
Related visas include:
"The first T visas were issued in Fiscal Year 2003. In the table below, the years are Fiscal Years, so for instance the year 2009 refers to the period from October 1, 2008 to September 30, 2009. Note that this only counts T visas issued at embassies and consulates outside the United States, and does not include people who changed nonimmigrant status to T status within the United States. The T-1 status is the one most likely to be achieved through change of status within the United States, and therefore T-1 visas are not usually issued."

"Morphisms in monoidal categories can also be drawn as string diagrams since a strict monoidal category can be seen as a 2-category with only one object (there will therefore be only one type of planar region) and Mac Lane's strictification theorem states that any monoidal category is monoidally equivalent to a strict one. The graphical language of string diagrams for monoidal categories may be extended to represent expressions in categories with other structure, such as braided monoidal categories, dagger categories, etc. and is related to geometric presentations for braided monoidal categories and ribbon categories.

"In 1868 Boswell began experimenting in aeronautics, but supposedly threw his small model into the Yazoo River that same year. It is unknown why he did this, although speculation points to the purpose of hiding his plans or ending local ridicule. He moved to Eastaboga, Alabama in 1869 with his new wife, where he was granted a patent for an in 1874."
"While he continued his study until his death on November 26, 1909, it is unknown if he ever built a full-scale model and attempted flight. In 1900, he wrote a letter to the Secretary of War, asking for funding and promising results, but it was rejected. Locals in his area have made claims that he actually did fly in November 1902, beating the Wright Brothers by a year. In fact, at the time of his death, Boswell was pursuing lawsuit against them, but this action was never carried through by his estate. Other stories tell that he made a short flight after being rolled off a barn roof back in the mid-1890s. However, no conclusive proof has surfaced to support these claims."

A second Shins song, ""Caring Is Creepy"", is also featured on the soundtrack. The presence of Simon & Garfunkel's ""The Only Living Boy in New York"" on the soundtrack has been cited by some as evidence of a connection to ""The Graduate""."
"The song ""Orange Sky"" by Alexi Murdoch was also featured in the movie, but did not appear on the soundtrack, as the rights to the song were owned by Fox's ""The O.C."" It was played between ""New Slang"" and ""I Just Don't Think I'll Ever Get Over You"" in the film.

"Bill grew up in Salt Lake City, Utah and as a child, his mother was a prostitute and drug addict who was often beaten in front of him. He had to steal, to eat from trash cans, and once was caught trying to break into a bicycle store to try to steal something to sell for food."
"The few friends he had were mostly in street gangs, and Bill drank and smoked cannabis often. His mother was often evicted, and he lived in foster homes. Schuffenhauer's maternal grandmother, Sadie Muniz, took him in as he was about to enter junior high in Roy, Utah. ""She reminded me to never give up and always push on,"" he said."
"Because of his grandmother's influence, he began going to school and started to participate in track and field at Roy High School, due to his great speed. He persevered to become an Olympian, and his coaches encouraged him greatly as well. He soon became a decathlete. He went to Weber State University and there he won the junior nationals in 1992. Additionally he played American football in high school."
"Schuffenhauer's Olympics dream as a track and field athlete came to an end in 2000. While training for Sydney, he suffered a bad ankle injury and he could barely walk. When his friend told him that the U.S. Olympic team was practicing bobsledding in Park City, he took the chance to go and observe. While there, the team members noticed his 6-foot, 200 pound frame and asked him he wanted to be a pusher. He accepted and trained with the team from then on."
"He was not originally slated to be a regular member, but was promoted when one of the U.S. four-man team members tested positive for steroids. That crew, piloted by Todd Hays, won a silver medal at the Salt Lake Games."
"At the 2006 Winter Olympics in Torino, Italy, Bill's two-man team placed 14th, after which he retired. He had two children and he felt responsible for them. Bobsledders earn only a meager amount, but Bill made the tough decision to continue to aspire for qualification for Vancouver. He fought through a neck injury (2 herniated disks) with the help of a chiropractor and a team physician."

= = = Trams in New Zealand = = =
"Trams in New Zealand were a major form of transport from the 19th century into the mid-20th century. New Zealand's first (horse) tramway was established in 1862 (Nelson), followed by a steam tramway in 1871 (Thames), and the first electric tramway in 1900 (Maori Hill, Dunedin). The tram systems in the main centres, and in some smaller towns, were soon electrified. By the 1950s, all systems were in the process of being replaced by trolley-buses or buses. The last tram service closed in 1964, in Wellington. A tram running parallel with a public road opened in Western Springs, Auckland, in 1980 and a central city loop line in Christchurch in 1995. Both are heritage lines."
"Some moves are proceeding to extend tram use in New Zealand again. In Auckland, the MOTAT line was extended in 2006–07 to reach a second site of the museum, and the former Auckland Regional Council promoted the creation of an Auckland waterfront tram line, originally with MOTAT vehicles, but will initially operate former Melbourne trams leased from Bendigo Tramways Company Limited. The Auckland Tramway Limited opened 6 August 2011 with the support of Waterfront Auckland (later merged into Panuku Development Auckland) and the new Auckland Council."
"In Christchurch, the city loop is currently operating on a limited circuit after being reopened 27 November 2013 following the Christchurch earthquake of 2011 which halted services while the CBD was closed off. The tramway was being extended in several small stages starting late 2000s and was nearly complete when the 2011 earthquake struck. While these proposals are all officially heritage / tourist lines, there is some investigation into later extension or conversion for normal transport use. This line was extended in 2014 with the reopening of the full pre-earthquake circuit and the opening of the nearly complete extension through the mall and High Street."
"In 1862 the first horse tramway in New Zealand, between Nelson and the port, opened as part of the Dun Mountain Railway, built to export ore from the mine in the hills above Nelson. Other horse-drawn tram systems were built on the West Coast of the South Island, where a gold rush started in 1864."
"Horse-drawn lines also opened in the main centres; Auckland and Devonport in 1886, Dunedin 1879, Christchurch 1880 and Dunedin 1879."
"At Grahamstown (now Thames) in the North Island where gold had also been found, a steam tramway to Tararu was opened on 2 December 1871, but closed on 11 November 1874, due to 'not sufficient traffic'. A steam locomotive for the tramway was built at Mechanics Bay in 1872 by Fraser and Tinne."
"The see became one of the dioceses approved by Cardinal Giovanni Paparoni at the synod of Kells in 1152, and has approximately the same boundaries as those of the ancient Kingdom of Breifne. In the Irish annals, the bishops were recorded of ""Breifne"", ""Breifni"", ""Breifny"", ""Tir-Briuin"", or ""Ui-Briuin-Breifne""."
"In the second half of the 12th century, it is likely the sees of Breifne and Kells were ruled together under one bishop. In 1172, Tuathal Ua Connachtaig took the oath of fealty to King Henry II of England as bishop of Kells. Soon after 1211 the see of Kells was incorporated into the diocese of Meath."
"In 1454, Pope Nicholas V gave permission for the then bishop, Aindrias Mac Brádaigh (Anglicised: Andrew McBrady), to have the ancient church at Kilmore, founded in the 6th century by Saint Felim (or Feithlimidh), to be the cathedral church of the diocese. This building passed into the hands of the Church of Ireland at the Reformation, and, following the construction of a new cathedral, is now used as a parochial hall."
"After the upheavals of the Reformation, there were parallel apostolic successions: one of the Church of Ireland and the other of the Roman Catholic Church."
"In the Church of Ireland, the title was intermittently held with Ardagh until they were finally united in 1839. In 1841, the sees of Kilmore and Ardagh were amalgamated with Elphin to form the united bishopric of Kilmore, Elphin and Ardagh. The current incumbent is The Right Reverend Samuel Ferran Glenfield M.A. M.Th. (Oxon.) M.Litt. He was elected, consecrated, and installed in 2013."

The 8-cubic honeycomb or octeractic honeycomb is the only regular space-filling tessellation (or honeycomb) in Euclidean 8-space.
"It is analogous to the square tiling of the plane and to the cubic honeycomb of 3-space, and the tesseractic honeycomb of 4-space."
"There are many different Wythoff constructions of this honeycomb. The most symmetric form is regular, with Schläfli symbol {4,3,4}. Another form has two alternating hypercube facets (like a checkerboard) with Schläfli symbol {4,3,3}. The lowest symmetry Wythoff construction has 256 types of facets around each vertex and a prismatic product Schläfli symbol {∞}."

"This church also operated a parish elementary school until June 2005 when that school was closed due to its low enrollment of 130 students. The Reverend Monsignor John Wendrychowicz, the pastor of Saint Josaphat Parish at the time, informed parishioners of the decision in Masses held during the weekend of April 25, 2005, noting that he had also informed teachers and families of the children attending the school he had secured support from the Parish Pastoral and Finance Councils to request permission from Cardinal Justin Rigali, Archbishop of Philadelphia, to close the facility. Students enrolled in Saint Josaphat School at the time were given the option to attend any other parish elementary school for the 2005-2006 school year. A new regional Catholic school, the Holy Child Catholic School, also opened in September 2005. Cardinal Rigali, who granted permission for the closure, said of his decision:"

The Hamnigan Buryats or Khamnigan are Mongolized Evenks of Tungusic origin.
"Khamnigan is the Buriat-Mongolian term for all Ewenkis. In the early 16th century, the Evenks of Transbaikalia or Khamnigans were tributary to the Khalkha. The Khamnigan are only ethnic group of Tungus origin in Mongolia. They who lived around Nerchinsk and the Aga steppe faced both Cossack demands for tribute and Khori-Buriats trying to occupy their pastures. Most of them came under the Cossack rule and enrolled the Cossack regiments in the Selenge valley. The Khori Buriats occupied most of the Aga steppe and forced the Ewenkis to flee to the Qing Dynasty."
"After 1880 Russia's Khamnigan Evenks moved to semi nomadic herding of cattle, sheep, camels and horses. Some time after 1918 the Evenks, along with their Buriat neighbors, fled over the border into Mongolia and Hulun Buir, establishing the current Khamnigan communities there. The Khamnigan of Mongolia, numbering 300 households, are scattered among the Buriats and speak only the Khamnigan dialect of Buriat language. They live around the Yeruu Lake, Dornod and Khentii provinces as well as Möngönmorit of Töv Province."

He played college football for the University of Texas, and earned All-American honors. A second-round pick in the 1996 NFL Draft, he played for the Jacksonville Jaguars for his entire pro football career."
"Brackens was born and raised in Fairfield, Texas. He attended Fairfield High School, and played for the Fairfield Eagles high school football team."
"Brackens attended the University of Texas at Austin, where he played for the Texas Longhorns football team from 1992 to 1995. He developed a reputation as a ferocious hitter as a defensive end. As senior in 1995, he was recognized as a consensus first-team All-American and was also a first-team All-Southwest Conference selection. He finished his career ranked eighth on the Longhorns' all-time list with 24 sacks. He was also a key contributor to the 1995 Longhorns team that went 10-1 and won the Southwest Conference and gained a berth in the 1996 Sugar Bowl against the Virginia Tech Hokies."
"He was taken in the second round of the 1996 NFL draft by the Jacksonville Jaguars, for whom he played his entire professional career. His lone Pro Bowl appearance came in 2000, after the 1999 season in which he had 12 sacks and 8 forced fumbles. As of 2011, he held the all-time Jacksonville Jaguars records for several categories: sacks (55), fumble recoveries (13) and forced fumbles (28). He is also the leading tackler (all-time) among Jaguars defensive ends."

The group reformed in 2008 to record a new album, ""Unfamiliar Places"", released in May 2011."
"The Bhagavad Guitars were formed in 1985 as Inner Circle in Canberra by Jeremy Butterworth on guitar, vocals and flute, John Underwood (a.k.a. John Kilbey) on guitar and vocals, Kynan Hughes on bass guitar and Matt Kerr on drums. As teenagers they had played together in a band while students at Dickson College. In 1987 they relocated to Sydney and renamed themselves, the new name, ""was derived from a pun on the title of the Hindu book ""Bhagavad Gita""."" Butterworth later reflected, ""We started off seriously interested in Eastern thinking, different philosophies, meditation... etc but now we're more cynical."""
"In July 1988 they released their debut five-track extended play, ""Foreverglades"", which was produced by the Church's Steve Kilbey (Underwood's older brother) for Red Eye Records. Its ""featured track, 'Just to Be Sure' became a radio hit in Sydney."" They followed in October with a six-track EP, ""Headland"", where Hughes had been replaced on bass guitar by Adrian Workman."
"Red Eye compiled the two EPs, leaving off ""Shrine"" from ""Headland"", into a full-length album, also titled, ""Foreverglades"", in July 1990. They followed with a third EP, ""Party"", with six tracks, in October of that year. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, observed, ""The band's brand of spacious, chiming guitar-based pop called to mind the likes of The Crystal Set, The Church and UK band Simple Minds."""
"The group's album, ""Introversion"", was recorded in 1991 but did not appear until July 1996 on Karmic Hit/Shock Records. It included, ""a bonus 14-minute CD EP ""Extraversion""."" In 1992 Kilbey formed a record label, Karmic Hit, which issued the group's single, ""Hypnotise Me"" in February. They followed with their first studio album, ""Hypnotised"", in May 1992 with Tony Locke on bass guitar and lead vocals for two tracks, ""Romeo Error"" and ""Accident""."

The film is based on the 1993 young adult novel of the same name by Lois Lowry."
"""The Giver"" premiered on August 11, 2014, and was released theatrically in the United States on August 15, 2014, grossing $67 million on a $25 million budget. It received a People's Choice Award nomination for ""Favorite Dramatic Movie"". However, it received generally mixed reviews from critics."
"Following a calamity referred to as The Ruin, society has been reorganized. Conflict, pain, and suffering have been mostly removed from human experience, but emotion, love, freedom, individuality, and joy have also been removed. Babies are brought into being through genetic engineering, and sexual desire is chemically suppressed. All memories of the past are held by one person, the Receiver of Memory, for the purpose of shielding the rest of the community from pain. The Receiver of Memory and his/her protégé are the only persons able to see in color, an ability otherwise eliminated from the community to prevent envy. The community is ruled by elders, including a Chief Elder."
"Jonas is a 16-year-old boy whose best friends are Asher and Fiona. On graduation day, Jonas is told that he will become the next Receiver of Memory and will progressively receive memories from his predecessor, the Giver. During his training with the Giver, Jonas gradually learns about the past and about joy, pain, death, and love. Jonas stops taking his daily injections and begins to experience emotion. Those who leave the community are said to have been ""released to Elsewhere"", but Jonas learns that this is really a euphemism for death by lethal injection. Jonas also learns that the Giver's daughter, Rosemary, had preceded Jonas as Receiver of Memory. When she began her training, however, Rosemary became so distraught from the memories she received that she asked to be euthanized."
"Jonas begins to teach his findings to Fiona and shares the concept of emotion with her. Jonas then tells her to stop taking her daily injection. The next day, he kisses her; kissing is an antiquated action that is unknown to the community and which Jonas learned about through memories received from the Giver, and touching a non-family member is against the rules. Jonas also shares his memories with a baby, Gabriel, who was brought home by his father. He develops a close relationship with Gabriel after discovering that he shared the birthmark Jonas has—the mark of a potential Receiver of Memory."
"Appalled by the deception of his community and by the Elders' disregard for human life, Jonas comes to believe that everyone should have memories of the past. Eventually, the Giver and Jonas decide that the only way to help the community is for Jonas to travel past the border of their land into the area called ""Elsewhere"". Doing this would release memories and color back into the community. When Jonas tries to leave his neighborhood, he encounters Asher. Asher tries to stop Jonas, but Jonas punches him. Jonas retrieves Gabriel—who is to be ""released"" for having failed to meet developmental markers—at the Nurturing Center; Fiona kisses Jonas and helps him escape with Gabriel."
"Meanwhile, Jonas' mother and Asher go to the Chief Elder to tell them Jonas is missing. Jonas steals a motorcycle and drives away with Gabriel. Asher is assigned by the Chief Elder to use a drone to find Jonas and ""lose"" him. When Asher finds Jonas and Gabriel in the desert, Jonas implores Asher to trust him and let them go. Instead, Asher captures them with the drone, but then sets them free by dropping them into a river; when questioned by the Chief Elder, Asher lies and says that he has followed her orders."
"Fiona is condemned to be ""released"" for helping Jonas. Just as she is about to be ""released"" by Jonas's father, the Giver tries to persuade the Chief Elder that the Elders should free the community. Unmoved by the Giver's arguments, the Chief Elder asserts that freedom is a bad idea because left to their own devices, people make bad choices."
"Jonas and Gabriel enter a snowy area. Jonas falls to the ground, overcome by the cold weather. However, he sees a sled like the one that he rode in a memory he received from the Giver. Jonas and Gabriel ride the sled downhill and cross the border into Elsewhere, freeing their community. This action saves Fiona's life, as Jonas's father realizes what he is doing and stops short of ""releasing"" her. Jonas realizes that he has succeeded in his quest."
"Jeff Bridges initially wanted to film the movie in the mid-1990s, and a script was written by 1998. Various barriers marred the production of the film, including when Warner Bros. bought the rights in 2007. The rights then ended up at The Weinstein Company and Walden Media."
"Bridges originally intended that his own father, Lloyd Bridges, would play the title character, The Giver, but he died in 1998."
"Principal photography began on October 7, 2013 in Cape Town and Johannesburg. Meryl Streep had some of her scenes shot in England, where she also filmed Rob Marshall's ""Into the Woods"", before doing additional filming two months later in Paarl, a town near Cape Town. The filming was completed on February 13, 2014 in Utah."
"The score for ""The Giver"" was composed by Marco Beltrami. The song ""Ordinary Human"" by OneRepublic was featured in the movie. The film also features Tori Kelly's ""Silent"". The soundtrack was released on August 5, 2014 by Interscope Records."

"Bianchi then proceeded to work on over a hundred new projects both solo or in collaboration with other Italian and international artists including Atrax Morgue, Aube, Francisco López, Mauthausen Orchestra, Merzbow, Ryan Martin and Philip Julian/Cheapmachines."
"Bianchi has worked with record labels including Dais Records, the Carrboro, North Carolina based Hot Releases and the Italian Menstrual Recordings to re-release some of his out-of-print material."
"On August 19, 2009, for unspecified personal reasons, Maurizio Bianchi decided again to completely stop making music. This decision was soon after reversed; Maurizio Bianchi continued to release new music."
"In 2005, a 2-CD-Set named ""Blut und Nebel"" was released, consisting of a remix of his first ten LPs. Bianchi submitted the set's first CD, remixing the first 5 LPs from 1981 and 1982, to Wikipedia. The track, over 45 minutes long, is split into three .ogg files:"

The FIFA Order of Merit is the highest honour awarded by FIFA. The award is presented at the annual FIFA congress. It is normally awarded to people who are considered to have made a significant contribution to :association football.
"At FIFA's centennial congress they made one award for every decade of their existence. These awards were also handed out to fans, organisations, clubs, and one to African Football. These were referred to as the FIFA Centennial Order of Merit."
The winner doesn't have to be directly involved with football to receive it. One such notable non-footballing personality was Nelson Mandela who won it for bringing South Africa back to international football.
= = = Fadeaway = = =
"A fadeaway or fall-away in basketball is a jump shot taken while jumping backwards, away from the basket. The goal is to create space between the shooter and the defender, making the shot much harder to block."
"The shooter must have very good accuracy (much higher than when releasing a regular jump shot) and must use more strength (to counteract the backwards momentum) in a relatively short amount of time. Also, because the movement is away from the basket, the shooter has less chance to grab his own rebound."
"The shooting percentage is lower in fadeaway (because of the difficulty of the shot) and the shooter cannot get his own rebound. This leads many coaches and players to believe it is one of the worst shots in the game to take. However, once mastered, it is one of the hardest methods of shooting for defenders to block. The threat of a fadeaway forces a defender to jump into the shooter, and with a pump fake, the shooter can easily get a foul on the defender."
"Only a handful of great NBA players have been successful shooting fadeaways. Michael Jordan was one of the most popular shooters of the fadeaway. Wilt Chamberlain, Patrick Ewing, LeBron James, Kobe Bryant, Hakeem Olajuwon, Dwyane Wade, Karl Malone, Larry Bird, Carmelo Anthony, DeMar DeRozan, and LaMarcus Aldridge are also well known for using this move. The even more difficult one-legged fadeaway has become Dirk Nowitzki's signature move and has been called by LeBron James the second most unstoppable move ever, only behind Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's skyhook."

"Cotton Factory is an historic industrial complex formerly known as The Imperial Cotton Company Limited in the industrial north end of Hamilton, Canada. The complex has been renamed the Cotton Factory and is repurposed for small manufacturing and office space for creative professionals."
"The five buildings on the site were built in 1900 and stand today in their original structures. It is one of the few historic complexes built in the late 19th to early 20th century that remain today in Hamilton, Ontario."
"The growth of Hamilton's economic landscape during the late 19th and early 20th century is accredited to textile production, the city's second largest industry, second only to the steel mills. The men responsible for this city's economic expansion are the ""5 Johns"" of Hamilton (John Morison Gibson, John Moodie, John Sutherland, John Dickenson and John Patterson). The men opened the ""Catract Power Company"" in 1896 which brought cheap electricity to the city. They were Hamilton's major landowners in the region, both of which brought manufactures and entrepreneurs from all over North America."
"The general manager of the company was Charles T. Crantham, pioneer of the cotton duck industry in Canada and responsible for the creation of the Imperial Cotton Company Ltd. From Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, Grantham was the bookkeeper for a cotton duck mill in 1883 to fix the company's books. Four years after his employment, he resigned to open a rival company in Hamilton, Ontario; bringing with him many workers and experts. Grantham had the help of John Patterson of the ""5 Johns"" to fund his cotton mill venture and build the cotton mill on the land that he owned. It was also decided that his brother Edmond Patterson would be the architect. By, 1900, the Imperial Cotton Company"" ""was born and looked after by James M. Young, the first President, who was the son of John Young, an original investor with the Dundas Cotton Company (1860–1891) and a now distant relative of Bob Young, the current owner of the Hamilton Tiger-Cats."
"The Imperial Cotton Company at 270 Sherman was the second largest cotton mill in the city and attracted customers from the around the world. Orders were taken from using the telegraphic system and codebook that can be found in Hamilton's Public Library to date. The Imperial Cotton codebook helped workers simplify orders and organize classes of cotton. The company manufactures heavy grades of cotton duck, used for making vessel sails, mechanical belting and hose, railway car roofing, binder canvasses, tarpaulins, tents, awnings, filters and cotton paper dryers. The products of the company are sold mainly to manufacturers, cutters-up, railways, implement and paper makers."
"The Cotton Factory has always been a ""people first"" kind of place. The Imperial Cotton Company produced a quarterly newsletter called, ""The Fabricator"", to bring news to the staff about group insurance plans, a cafeteria unit that seated 165 people, upgrades of new technology such as electric refrigerators and a newly purchased lunchroom piano by the Entertainment Committee. News among the staff members are also featured in the Fabricator, highlighting marriages, births, and deaths and recounted vacation stories by the mill employees."

"Gil Gutiérrez (born May 1, 1962 in Oaxaca, Mexico) is a virtuoso Mexican guitarist"
"His mother sent him to study sculpture, painting and ceramics at the art academy in Oaxaca. It was there that he heard the sounds of classical music and learned to play cello on a borrowed instrument. He then switched to a guitar which was a gift from his brother, because his family could not afford a cello. At the Benito Juarez Autonomous University in Oaxaca, Gutiérrez studied classical guitar and his musical interests spread to diverse genres including classical, flamenco, son cubano and jazz."
"At age fourteen he began playing classical guitar in restaurants in Oaxaca and caught the attention of German born guitarist Wolfgang “Lobo” Fink of Willie & Lobo. At 17, he teamed up with Fink to play venues in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico. When Fink returned to Germany, Gutiérrez went to Mexico City to study jazz earning money by playing his guitar on city buses. The guitarist has played in South America and Spain with Ana Gabriel, Ricardo Arjona, Francisco Cespedes, and Pedro Guerra. A virtuoso with the nylon string guitar and tres, Gutiérrez has performed at the Kennedy Center, the Mexican Cultural Institute of the Mexican Embassy in Washington D.C. and to a crowd of 10,000 people at Millennium Park, Chicago.Gutierrez is recognized for his unique ability to connect with the audience and channeling a bit of the local energy into each performance."

They recorded their first album together in 2007 called En Mi Corazon. Gutierrez is the band leader, founder and musical director of the group the San Miguel 5 and they have performed with symphony orchestras across the United States. Other musicians of the San Miguel 5 include Grammy award winning violinist Charlie Bisharat, Cuban percussionist Jimmy Branly and bass player Kevin Thomas. In 2011 Gil Gutiérrez and Doc Severinsen played at New York City’s Carnegie Hall accompanied by the New York Pops under the direction of conductor Steven Reineke. Gutiérrez has performed as a soloist with the Minnesota Symphony, Florida Symphony and with the Doc Severinsen Big Band Tour in Dallas, Texas.

The introduction of and improvements in anti-reflective coatings vastly reduced flare; some many-element lens designs which had been abandoned due to low contrast in spite of otherwise excellent performance became practical."
"Lenses designed for use with monochromatic film, first orthochromatic, then panchromatic, had less exacting requirements regarding chromatic aberrations than when colour film is used.

"Bryan Keith Cox (born February 17, 1968) is an American football coach and former player. His most recent position was as the defensive line coach for the Atlanta Falcons of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for Western Illinois University, a small college football program, but received attention for his aggressive style of play. Although Cox was a relatively late fifth-round pick by the Miami Dolphins in the 1991 NFL Draft, he rose to prominence as a standout linebacker during his twelve NFL seasons from 1991 through 2002. He was a three-time pro bowler with the Miami Dolphins, and was also a member of the New England Patriots club that won Super Bowl XXXVI."
"Cox was a member of the East St. Louis High School Flyers high school football team, where he was coached by Bob Shannon."
"Cox attended Western Illinois University and was a mass communications major and a letterman in football. In football, he was a four-year letterman and a two-year starter. As a senior, he was named as a first-team All-America selection by the ""Football Gazette"" and was a first-team all-conference selection. As a junior, he was named the Western Illinois Most Valuable Player. As a sophomore, Cox played in every game, and finished his sophomore season with 54 tackles, four forced fumbles, three fumble recoveries, two interceptions and three blocked kicks. As a freshman, Cox was a reserve nickel-back and finished the season with 30 tackles."
"Cox was drafted by the Dolphins in the fifth round of the 1991 NFL Draft, chosen 113th overall. As a rookie, Cox started 13 games as the Dolphins right outside linebacker, racking up a total of 61 tackles along with two sacks. Miami finished out the season 8-8. In his sophomore campaign, Cox blossomed and helped lead the Dolphins to an 11-5 record and the AFC Championship Game. He made his first Pro Bowl and was named to the All Pro team after recording 127 tackles, 14 sacks and five forced fumbles. Miami switched to a 4-3 defense in 1993 and Cox was moved to right linebacker. The team started out 9-2, but lost their last five to miss the playoffs. Cox again led the team with 122 tackles, four forced fumbles and four fumble recoveries. He also collected five sacks and an interception."
"Cox earned his second Pro Bowl selection in 1994, starting 16 games at middle linebacker, leading the team with 100 tackles. Miami finished the season 10-6, winning the Wild Card Game against the Kansas City Chiefs, 27-17 before losing the Divisional Playoff to the San Diego Chargers, 22-21. In 1995, Cox was selected to his second consecutive Pro Bowl, and third overall. He again started every game at middle linebacker, finishing the year with a team high 119 tackles, 7.5 sacks and three forced fumbles. The Dolphins went 9-7 before bowing out in the Wild Card Game to the Buffalo Bills, 37-22. The defense tied for the AFC lead by allowing only seven rushing touchdowns. Overall, Cox spent five years with the Dolphins playing both outside and middle linebacker, starting 75 out of a possible 78 games."
"Cox would go on to play seven more seasons in the NFL for the Chicago Bears, New York Jets, New England Patriots, and New Orleans Saints. In a career encompassing 165 games, Cox recorded 764 tackles, tallied 51.5 quarterback sacks, caught four interceptions and forced 22 fumbles. Among his most famous plays was a 27-yard interception-return touchdown against the Patriots in September 1999 while playing with the Jets; another famous play came with the Patriots in September 2001 in a game against the Indianapolis Colts; Cox hit receiver Jerome Pathon in the first quarter, a hit that briefly knocked Pathon out."
"Throughout his NFL career, Cox was easily recognizable on the field due to the unusual headrest- or ""surfboard""-style neck roll he wore and colored to match his uniform jersey."

= = = Pentagrammic crossed-antiprism = = =
"In geometry, the pentagrammic crossed-antiprism is one in an infinite set of nonconvex antiprisms formed by triangle sides and two regular star polygon caps, in this case two pentagrams."
It differs from the pentagrammic antiprism by having opposite orientations on the two pentagrams.
This polyhedron is identified with the indexed name U as a uniform polyhedron.
"The pentagrammic crossed-antiprism may be inscribed within an icosahedron, and has ten triangular faces in common with the great icosahedron. It has the same vertex arrangement as the pentagonal antiprism. In fact, it may be considered as a parabidiminished great icosahedron."
"= = = Short, sharp shock = = ="
"The phrase ""short, sharp shock"" means ""a quick, severe punishment."" It is an example of alliteration. Although the phrase originated earlier, it was popularised in Gilbert and Sullivan's 1885 comic opera ""The Mikado"", where it appears in the song near the end of Act I, ""I Am So Proud"". It has since been used in popular songs, song titles, literature, as well as in general speech."
"John Conington's 1870 translation of the ""First Satire of Horace"" includes the following lines:"
"In Act I of the 1885 Gilbert and Sullivan opera ""The Mikado"", the Emperor of Japan, having learned that the town of Titipu is behind on its quota of executions, has decreed that at least one beheading must occur immediately. In the dialogue preceding the song, three government officials, Pooh-Bah, Ko-Ko and Pish-Tush, discuss which of them should be beheaded in order to save the town from ""irretrievable ruin"". Pooh-Bah says that although his enormous ""family pride"" would normally prompt him to volunteer for such an important civic duty, he has decided to ""mortify"" his pride, and so he declines this heroic undertaking. He points out that since Ko-Ko is already under sentence of death for the capital crime of flirting, Ko-Ko is the obvious choice to be beheaded."
"The three characters then sing the song ""I Am So Proud"". In the last lines of the song, Pooh-Bah, Ko-Ko and Pish-Tush contemplate ""the sensation"" of the ""short, sharp shock"" caused by being beheaded:"
"The phrase is particularly popular in music. For example, the phrase is used in the song ""Us and Them"" (from Pink Floyd's 1973 album, ""The Dark Side of the Moon"")."
"""Short Sharp Shock"" is also the name of a 1984 album by Chaos UK. It also appears in the title of an album, ""Short Sharp Shocked"", by Michelle Shocked and the EP ""Shortsharpshock"" by Therapy?. Short Sharp Shock is the name of a crossover thrash band from Liverpool, England. The phrase is used in the song ""East Side Beat"" by The Toasters, and in the 1980 song ""Stand Down Margaret"" by The Beat. It can also be found in the lyrics of a Billy Bragg song entitled ""It Says Here"" found on his 1984 album ""Brewing Up with Billy Bragg"" and of a They Might Be Giants song entitled ""Circular Karate Chop"" on their 2013 album ""Nanobots""."
"In literature, the phrase is used in the title of a 1990 fantasy novel, ""A Short, Sharp Shock"" by Kim Stanley Robinson. In the 1996 fantasy novel by Terry Pratchett, ""Feet of Clay"", police commander Sam Vimes is ""all for giving criminals a short, sharp shock"", meaning electrocution."
"Jude Maverick has grown up in an isolated town called Ciel, which is completely enclosed in a large sphere floating thousands of feet above the surface of Filgaia. His sheltered world changes forever when he sees the sky ""tear"" and ships enter his homeland. Upon inspecting the campsite set up by the intruders, he sees something else that he has never seen before: a girl."
"The girl's name is Yulie Ahtreide and she is being held captive by the intruders after being captured by a ""Drifter"" for hire, Arnaud G. Vasquez. After the invading army attacks Ciel and brings the sphere crashing down, Jude, Yulie and Arnaud join forces to find the army's true intention behind Yulie's abduction. With the help of another Drifter, Raquel Appelgate, these four idealistic teens travel the war-torn land of Filgaia in search of truth, their own identities, and their separate paths to adulthood."
"Action elements on the field map such as double-jumps, using the new ""Accelerator"" ability to manipulate time, and equipping items to solve puzzles maintains the excitement between battles. Movie events are presented in a distinctive use of polygons and shading with voice-actors. Dialog takes place using various character illustrations that change and reposition frequently."
"Dialog takes place using various character illustrations that change and reposition frequently like a digital comic book, making it easier to deeply understand the emotions of each character."
"The HEX battle system is composed of seven hexagons on the battle field, with random beginning placement for all characters and enemies. What makes the HEX battle system so unique is that it is area based instead of character based. This means that any attacks or spells given to certain hexagon, or HEX, will affect all characters on that HEX. Multiple allies or enemies can occupy a single HEX, but enemies and allies can't occupy the same HEX."

"In the North American version, two monsters (Dalawa Bunny and Accident Rabbit) were taken out of the game, but not out of the monsters list, making it impossible to finish the game with 100% completion. The PAL version still contains this error, and is also known to crash in certain places when played in 50 Hz mode, leaving those areas potentially impassable to players whose television does not support 60 Hz PAL signals."
Some PAL copies also have another issue where triggering specific Material summons would freeze the game. A workaround is to disable the battle movies in the game's options. This bug affects both PAL and NTSC modes.
"The English localization copy is known to freeze when loading the area at the top of a ladder at ""The Great Wall"" roughly 5 hours into the game when played in PAL mode. A workaround can be achieved by saving the game in the area prior and loading the game in NTSC mode, going past and saving on the world map. No other areas are known to have this problem."

"The Kichai tribe (also Keechi or Kitsai) was a Native American Southern Plains tribe that lived in Texas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma. Their name for themselves was K'itaish."
"The Kichai were most closely related to the Pawnee. French explorers encountered them on the Red River in Louisiana in 1701. By 1772, they were primarily settled around the east of the Trinity River, near present-day Palestine, Texas. After forced relocation, they came to share portions of southern and southwestern Oklahoma with the Wichita and in the Muscogee Creek Nation."
"The Kichai were part of the complex, shifting political alliances of the South Plains. Early Europeans identified them as enemies of the Caddo. In 1712, they fought the Hainai along the Trinity River; however, they were allied with other member tribes of the Caddoan Confederacy and intermarried with the Kadohadacho during this time."
"On November 10, 1837, the Texas Rangers fought the Kichai in the Battle of Stone Houses. The Kichai were victorious, despite losing their leader in the first attack."
"Caddo-Wichita-Delaware lands were broken up to individual allotments in the beginning of the 20th century. Kichai people's allotted lands were mainly in Caddo County, Oklahoma. Forty-seven full-blood Kichai lived in Oklahoma in 1950. There were only four at the end of the 20th century."
"The Kichai are not a distinct federally recognized tribe, but they are instead enrolled in the Wichita and Affiliated Tribes. These tribes live mostly in Southwestern Oklahoma, particularly in Caddo County, to which they were forcibly relocated by the United States Government in the 19th century."
"The Kichai language is a member of the Caddoan language family, along with Arikara, Pawnee, and Wichita."
"Kai Kai, a Kichai woman from Anadarko, Oklahoma, was the last known fluent speaker of the Kichai language. She collaborated with Dr. Alexander Lesser to record and document the language."

All gasoline sold in the country must contain at least 5 percent ethanol by February 2009, and by 2011, the mandated blend can go up to 10 percent. The new law is expected to bring a number of benefits to the country:"
"""Commercial production of ethanol from sugarcane, cassava or sorghum will help the island nation diversify its fuel portfolio and help to ensure its energy security. It could also generate employment, particularly in rural regions, as investors put up biofuel crop plantations and processing plants. Also, the shift to these plant-based fuels for transportation will help reduce pollution."""
"Four feedstocks—sugarcane, corn, cassava and sweet sorghum—were initially identified for ethanol production, but sugarcane is expected to be the predominant source of ethanol. The Philippines is a sugar-producing country, and sugarcane is grown mainly in the islands of Negros, Luzon, Panay and Mindanao. Despite growing demand for sugar, there are still an estimated 90,750 hectares (224,000 acres) of sugarcane available that can be used for ethanol production, and high-yielding varieties of sugarcane are available."
"In 2005, SEAOIL Philippines Inc. pioneered the use of ethanol as gasoline blend in the country, and the first to offer E10 Fuel in the market in their gasoline products. This was done even before the enactment of the Biofuels Act of 2006."

This telenovela was filmed in the Dominican Republic.
"Ana Paula Treviño dreams of falling in love with Aníbal Paz-Soldán, one of the richest millionaires in the country. One day while walking in the streets, Ana Paula's purse is snatched, and she unfortunately mistakes a witness by-stander, Fernando, to be the thief. Fernando is captivated by Ana Paula's beauty and charm, and he is instantly attracted to her. Fernando later discovers that Ana Paula is poor and must work hard in her father's boarding house in order to try to pay their debts. So, he decides to conquer Ana Paula's heart by omitting that he is a Paz-Soldán, and lying that he is merely an employee at the Paz-Soldán company."
"Although Ana Paula and Fernando develop a close friendship, she cannot stop thinking about Aníbal, the man of her dreams. Aníbal is the opposite of Fernando: he is proud and arrogant, looks down upon people below his class, and would not even bother to look at a girl like Ana Paula twice. However, a misunderstanding brings Aníbal and Ana Paula together when he mistakes her for Catalina Lampedusa, an Italian aristocrat known as the Countess of Cogorno."
"So, Ana Paula continues to pretend to be a rich countess in order to win Aníbal's heart. However, this is not easy for her, as she has to face Adriana, Aníbal's lover, who will go to any lengths to expose her, and her feelings for her true prince charming, Fernando."

= = = Nanto-Bordelaise Company = = =
"The Nanto-Bordelaise Company — formally ""La Compagnie de Bordeaux et de Nantes pour la Colonisation de l’Île du Sud de la Nouvelle Zélande et ses Dépendances"" — was a French company inaugurated in 1839 by a group of merchants from the cities of Nantes and Bordeaux, with the purpose of founding a French colony in the South Island of New Zealand."
"The company was formed after negotiations in August 1838 between whaling boat captain Jean-François Langlois and several Ngai Tahu Māori chiefs for the purchase of several thousand acres of land on Banks Peninsula, for which Langlois promised to pay a total of 1,000 francs. Upon returning to France in 1839, Langlois set about founding a company with the help of several financial backers, the eventual aim of which was to claim the entirety of the South Island for France. Government support was obtained in December of the same year via King Louis-Philippe to transport 80 settlers to Port Louis-Philippe (now Akaroa). A warship, the corvette ""Aube"", would travel to New Zealand, followed a month later by the colonists aboard . ""Aube"" left for the Pacific in February 1840, captained by Charles François Lavaud, who had been appointed as Commissaire du Roi."
"Aware of the potential threat of losing sovereignty of parts of the New Zealand island chain to the French, during early 1840, Lieutenant-Governor William Hobson was tasked with securing the whole of the country for the British Government. To this end, the Treaty of Waitangi was signed as an agreement between the British Crown and the indigenous Māori population. By the time ""Aube"" arrived at the Bay of Islands in June 1840, the acquisition of the country by Britain was effectively complete. Faced with no prospect of anything more than a small colonial settlement, Lavaud left for Banks Peninsula to oversee the arrival of ""Comte de Paris"". Hobson also sent a ship, HMS ""Britomart"", on board which were colonial magistrates."
"On arriving at Akaroa, Lavaud discovered that the agreement between Langlois and the local Māori was not as clear-cut as had been promised. Despite this, the founding of the colony went ahead, under an amalgam of French and British jurisdiction. C.B. Robinson, one of the magistrates sent on ""Britomart"", worked alongside Lavaud in the organisation of the settlement. Lavaud retired in 1843, and was succeeded as Commissaire du Roi by Post-Captain A. Bérard, who remained in this position until 1846, when formal agreements between the French government and the Nanto-Bordelaise Company settlement ended."
"The question of sovereignty remained a complex one, which the local colonial authorities were unable to solve. Eventually, the British Government resolved that the company would be awarded four acres of land for every £1 they could prove to have spent on the settlement. On 30 June 1849, the company's remaining New Zealand properties were bought by the New Zealand Company for the sum of £4,500. A second ship carrying more French settlers, ""Monarch"", arrived at Akaroa in 1850."
"Fateh became a casualty of Bangladesh's complex and shifting political landscape towards the end of his career. As he was closely identified with Bangladesh's initial, Liberation War era administration Fateh was not favoured by the military-backed regimes which followed it. Contemporary historians have characterised his Ambassadorial assignment to Algeria as a premature transfer and a virtual exile in a diplomatic post which was a relative back-water. One commentator voicing the widely held belief that Fateh was ""a victim of conspiracy hatched against him by anti-liberation forces."

Fateh died in London of natural causes at 0745 on 4 December 2010.
"A Sufi, he once cited a few of the axioms according to which he led his life: ""Do not speak anything that you do not yourself know to be true."" ""Speak in the spirit of offering, without the need to draw attention to yourself."" ""You should stand up when it matters."""
"Fateh was buried with Bangladesh State Honours at Hendon Cemetery, London on 7 December 2010"
"The Bangladesh Government was represented by His Excellency the Bangladesh High Commissioner Professor Mohammad Sayeedur Rahman Khan Khan who delivered a homily which spoke of the Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's devastation at the news of Ambassador Fateh's death, conveyed the condolences of Foreign Minister Dipu Moni and spoke of the highest standard of public service that Mr. Fateh's conduct and career represented. In consideration of the esteem of the Bangladesh government and its people for Ambassador Fateh, the High Commissioner had personally brought the flag of Bangladesh to be draped over the coffin so that Mr. Fateh could briefly lie in state before his interring. Justice of the Supreme Court the Right Honorable Syed Refaat Ahmed also spoke at the event about Fateh's humility and self-effacement in all contexts, against the backdrop of an enormous contribution to the public and civic life of the country.

Kenton Road is a main road in the London Borough of Harrow and the London Borough of Brent. It lies in the areas of Harrow and Kenton.
"Its eastern end is the border of Kenton in Middlesex and Kingsbury (in NW9) in London. Kenton Road is the A4006, apart from a short stretch west of Northwick Park roundabout, which is a small part of the A404. The road east of the Kenton Methodist Church originally followed the route of what is now Woodgrange Avenue and was a continuation of Kenton Lane before being upgraded, re-positioned and renamed in the early 20th century as an eastward extension of the original Kenton Road."
"On the north side of the road, almost opposite Kenton station is the Traveller's Rest pub. Approximately further along the A4006, also on the north side of the road, at the junction with St Leonard's Avenue, is the parish church of St Mary-the-Virgin, Kenton, built in 1935-1936 by the architect Harold Gibbons and a local firm of builders, Melsom & Rosier. Approximately further on, on the south side of the Kenton Road is All Saints Catholic Church, built in 1963. About another further on is the Greek Orthodox Church of St Panteleimon. Originally a mission church of the Church of England parish, it was acquired in recent years by the Greek community, which has replaced it with a traditional Greek Basilica complete with bronze dome (2011)."
"As late as 1935 there was a busy blacksmith's forge in Kenton Lane, from the junction with Kenton Road (the junction at that time called 'Brockhurst Corner').

"Raeburn Van Buren (January 12, 1891 – December 29, 1987) was an American magazine and comic strip illustrator best known for his work on the syndicated ""Abbie an' Slats"". He was familiarly known in the professional comics community as Ray Van Buren."
"Born in Pueblo, Colorado, Van Buren, a distant relative of US President Martin Van Buren, grew up in Kansas City, Missouri. At the ""Kansas City Star"", he learned cartooning from comic strip artist Harry Wood. In 1913, Van Buren moved to New York, where he illustrated for ""Puck"", ""Life"" and ""The Saturday Evening Post""."
"Van Buren served in the old Seventh Regiment (107th Infantry) of the 27th New York Empire Division in World War I. He was art editor of the division's magazine, ""Gas Attack"". An artistry and illustrative flair were evident in his cartoons, and ""The New York Times"" compared his artwork in the magazine with that of the famous British illustrator Bruce Bairnsfather."
"After military service, he drew cartoons for ""The Saturday Evening Post"", ""The New Yorker"" and ""Esquire"". As a freelance illustrator, he contributed to numerous magazines, including ""Collier's"", ""Redbook"" and ""McCall's"". He was a founder of the National Society of Magazine Illustrators."
"He began drawing ""Abbie an' Slats"" in 1937. The strip followed the experiences of a rural spinster raising her young cousin, a streetwise urban child. It was the idea of Al Capp, who intended to start a second strip to build upon the success of his popular ""Li'l Abner"". Instead of drawing it himself, Capp recruited Van Buren. Initially, Van Buren turned him down, but he was soon lured by the prospect of steady work, as he had just had his first and only child with his wife, Fern. The strip was carried in 400 newspapers but did not equal the popularity of ""Li'l Abner"". Capp abandoned the strip in 1945, turning the writing chores over to his brother, Elliot Caplin. Van Buren stayed on the strip, and it ended with his retirement in 1971."
"Van Buren lived in Great Neck, Long Island. When he died in 1987 at North Shore Community Hospital in Manhasset, Long Island, after suffering an injury in a fall, he was 96 years old."
"In 1984, When Van Buren sent a gift to ""Dear Abby"" columnist Abigail Van Buren (Pauline Phillips), she wrote back on November 30, 1984, thanking him and commenting on the name similarity:"
"With the Gold Key Award, he was honored in 1979 as a member of the National Cartoonists Society Hall of Fame. In 1958, he was named ""Cartoonist of the Year"" by the Quaker City Lodge of the B'nai B'rith in ceremonies at Philadelphia Pa. Previous winners were Al Capp, Milton Caniff, and George Wunder."
"Van Buren's wartime experiences are chronicled in the book ""Duty, Honor, Privilege: New York's Silk Stocking Regiment the Breaking of the Hindenburg Line"" by his grandnephew Stephen L. Harris. Beginning with ""Abbie an' Slats and Becky"" (Saalfield, 1940), his comic strip was collected in several books."

"Diogo Veloso, or Diego Belloso in the Spanish historical accounts, (Amarante 1558 - Cambodja 1599) was a Portuguese adventurer active in Southeast Asia in the last quarter of 16th century, acting sometimes in the service of the Spanish Governor of the Spanish East Indies (within the Cambodian–Spanish War) and sometimes as a free-lancer. He and Spanish Blas Ruiz were the first Europeans to ever set foot in Laos."
"Veloso's journey to Laos started in Cambodia. In Cambodia, Veloso met and befriended King Satha of Lovek and Ruiz of Spain. When Lovek was invaded by Ayutthaya, Satha was overthrown by his son and other nobles who allowed Ayutthaya to take control, forcing Veloso to flee to Portuguese Malacca, the place where he began his adventure in Southeast Asia. Eventually Veloso returned with Ruiz, who had fled to Spanish Philippines, to Lovek. When they arrived they learned Satha had fled to Lan Xang, an empire centered in modern-day Laos and consisting of Isan, Stung Treng, and small areas of Southern China and Vietnam."
"Veloso and Ruiz decided to journey to Laos and bring back Satha to restore his reign over Lovek. They arrived in Vientiane, Lan Xang's administrative capital, in the summer of 1596. They were met with a procession showing off the city's immense wealth consisting of Asian elephants, gold, jewels, silk, exotic snakes, bouquets of tropical flowers, chanting monks, Buddhist treasures and relics, music, and beautiful women. Veloso and Ruiz were also received with a great feast. But while they were in Vientiane they learned Satha had died from an illness he caught on his way from Cambodia to Laos. Saddened and angered by the news, Veloso and Ruiz returned to Lovek and started a rebellion to put one of Satha's political allies on the throne and free Cambodia from Ayutthaya. They managed to drive out Ayutthaya forces from parts of Cambodia and create a new state but led the new Cambodian state into a brief period of chaos."
Eventually Veloso returned to Malacca.

"Between 1842 and 1849, 234 juvenile offenders were transported to Western Australia on seven convict ships. From 1850 to 1868, over 9,000 convicts were transported to the colony on 43 convict ship voyages. Western Australia was classed as a full-fledged penal colony in 1850."
"Parkhurst apprentices were juvenile prisoners from Parkhurst Prison, sentenced to ""transportation beyond the seas"", but pardoned on arrival at their destination on the conditions that they be ""apprenticed"" to local employers, and that they not return to England during the original term of their sentence. Between 1842 and 1849, Western Australia accepted 234 Parkhurst apprentices, all males aged between 10 and 21. As Western Australia was not then a penal colony, contemporary documents studiously avoided referring to the prisoners as ""convicts"", and the ships that brought them were not officially recognised as convict ships there. English records were not so reticent, classing as convict ships the seven ships that transported Parkhurst apprentices to Western Australia."
This is a list of convict ship voyages that transported Parkhurst apprentices to Western Australia.

"Walsh University is a private Roman Catholic university in North Canton, Ohio. It enrolls approximately 2,700 students and was founded in 1960 by the Brothers of Christian Instruction as a liberal arts college. Walsh College became Walsh University in 1993. The university offers more than 70 undergraduate majors and seven graduate programs. Walsh has a satellite campus in Castel Gandolfo, Italy."
The school's namesake is Bishop Emmett Michael Walsh of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Youngstown.
"Walsh University was first founded as LaMennais College in Alfred, Maine in 1951 by the Brothers of Christian Instruction on an idea by Ferdinand Waldo Demara, who was then posing as a monk, to educate young men as brothers and teachers. LaMennais College continued in Alfred, Maine from 1951 until 1959. Because of a chance 1957 conversation between Brother Francoeur of La Mennais College and Monsignor William Hughes of Youngstown, Ohio about the Brothers' wish to move LaMennais College from Alfred, Maine, Bishop Walsh invited the Brothers to choose Canton, Ohio as the new location. Bishop Walsh donated $304,000 to the Walsh College project. In 1959 the present location of Walsh University began as of farm land on which two buildings were constructed, College Hall (Farrell Hall) and LaMennais Hall which continues to house the Brothers and international priest-students. The Founding Brothers include: Dacian J. Barrette, Thomas S. Farrell, Henry J. Vannasse, Edmond Drouin, Paul E. Masse, Robert A. Francoeur, and Alexis Guilbeault."
"Throughout the school's history, the Brothers have played an active role, serving as faculty during the original years and playing a part in the growth and development of facilities and programs. Several have served as President."
"In 2013, Walsh University joined Division II of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). Walsh previously competed in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) as a member of the American Mideast Conference, while its football team competed in the Mid-States Football Association."
"As a divisional point, Biscotasing did not last much beyond the era of construction, as Chapleau, about midway between Sudbury and Lake Superior, was selected to replace it. Soon after, the town lost its importance as a railroad town but still existed as a quiet fur trading town. The railway provided an inland access point to waterways flowing south to Lake Huron and north to James Bay, and the town subsequently developed as a centre for Indian trade in the region."
"The local water routes also helped to develop Biscotasing as a major centre for lumbering. In 1884, Public Lands Surveyor James Allan noted that timber in the area had been overrun by fires and was of very little value, consisting mostly of scrubby spruce and small pitch pine. The same year a sawmill was in operation at Biscotasing, mostly to serve the requirements of CPR construction."
"The first permanent sawmill was established by Sadler and O'Neil in the early 1890s. Robert Booth and Patrick Shannon, were also actively logging this region from 1895. Booth and Shannon produced square timber, which was taken by CPR to Papineauville for export to Britain, from the Port of Quebec in Quebec. By 1903 Booth and Shannon were the only lumber producers in Biscotasing, possibly having taken over and expanding the O'Neil mill which closed in 1898."
"The original Booth and Shannon mill was destroyed by fire 1913-06-13. It was subsequently rebuilt, at which time Robert Booth left the partnership, with Patrick's son, the firm was reorganized as P. & G. Shannon. In 1923 the mill was sold to Midland lumbermen Pratt and Shanacy. The mill closed in 1927 for lack of timber. The mill was dismantled and removed by 1938."
"Many of the old buildings in Biscotasing that survive today are from the sawmill era. A small steam locomotive, once used to switch cars of lumber from the mill to the lumber piling grounds, sat for many years, derelict on the mill property, across the tracks, opposite the Pratt and Shanacy company store. In 1958, David L. Pratt, of Toronto donated his father's steam engine for display at the Algonquin Provincial Park Logging Museum."
"From railway construction camp, to fur trade depot and lumbering centre, in 1922 Biscotasing became the first place in Northern Ontario to use aircraft (Curtiss NC) for forest fire surveillance."
= = = Provable prime = = =
"In number theory, a provable prime is an integer that has been calculated to be prime using a primality-proving algorithm. Contrast with probable prime, which is likely (but not certain) to be prime, based on the output of a probabilistic primality test. In principle, every prime number can be proved to be prime in polynomial time by using the AKS primality test. In practice, other methods which guarantee that their result is prime, but which do not work for all primes, are useful for the random generation of provable primes."

"Frio and Kyaro, two teenagers, love the Tales legends and read about them every day before they go to sleep. After an earthquake, Dr. Brown finds an ancient time traveling machine in the ruins. Using this, they can go see the Tales legends. They go to sleep and prepare for tomorrow."
"Before Frio went to sleep, he read a Tales legend again. But this one ended strangely: the hero arrives too late and the world is destroyed."
"When Frio and Kyaro wake up, they find out the machine has been stolen. Not long after they find out, a re-color of the machine appears. The one boarding it was Dr. White, Dr. Brown from 100 days into the future whose hair had turned white from extreme stress."
"There are thieves who are ruining the timeline of the Tales legends, and they have to be stopped. Dr. White now needs Frio and Kyaro to help stop the thieves and brings with him the aid of the heroes from Tales of Symphonia, Destiny, and Eternia."
"Tales of the World: Narikiri Dungeon 3 is a turn-based tactical RPG as well as a real-time RPG. Battles take place in enclosed areas that include ally parties and enemy units. Players move parties (consisting of three characters each) by selecting the sprite of the party's player-controlled character, and selecting the target location on the map. The limit of where the party can travel is indicated by dots between the target destination and the starting point of the party. When the dots are gray, the party can move to that location, as long as an obstacle does not block him/her. If it is red, then the target is out of range. The player can alter the destination of the party at any time during the player's turn. When the player ends the turn, all ally parties will move simultaneously. When one of the players' parties comes in contact with an enemy party, the player engages in a LMBS-style battle. In a typical RPG fashion, players level up their party members to gain stat increases. Like many Tales games, Narikiri Dungeon 3 includes the aspect of cooking: players can use acquired ingredients to prepare meals that affect party members, like replenishing HP, or temporarily gaining a certain stat in battle."

"""Long Cool Woman in a Black Dress"" (also titled ""Long Cool Woman"" or ""Long Cool Woman (in a Black Dress)"") is a song written by Allan Clarke, Roger Cook, and Roger Greenaway and performed by the British rock group The Hollies. Originally appearing on the album ""Distant Light"", it was released as a single on 17 April 1972 (on Parlophone in the United Kingdom), selling 1.5 million copies in the United States and two million worldwide. It reached No. 2 on the ""Billboard"" Hot 100 in September 1972. ""Billboard"" ranked it as the No. 24 song for 1972."
"On the day ""Long Cool Woman"" was recorded at AIR Studios, the group's producer, Ron Richards, was ill and, as a result, the song was produced by the group. The song is different from most other Hollies songs in that there are no three-part vocal harmonies, and the song features lead guitar and lead vocal work by Allan Clarke. Upon his return, Ron Richards mixed the recording."
"The song was written in the swamp rock style of Creedence Clearwater Revival, in terms of the vocal, rhythm, and melodic style. It came out in the spring of 1972 (the same year Creedence split up). Clarke imitated John Fogerty's vocal style, which was based on the Creedence song ""Green River"". According to Clarke, the song was written ""in about five minutes""."
"In the Hollies' native United Kingdom, the song was only a modest success for the band, peaking at number 32 on the charts. However, it was a smash hit in the United States, peaking at number 2 for two weeks behind Gilbert O'Sullivan’s ""Alone Again (Naturally)"". It was their highest charting single in that country. It also topped the charts in South Africa and peaked at number 2 in New Zealand and Australia. By this time, Clarke had already left the band, but he feels that ""it wasn't unfortunate"", since he had co-written the song. Clarke rejoined the Hollies in the summer of 1973, partly due to the success of this song."
"Kirby was born in Ottawa. A Canadian newspaperman and former editor of ""Yacht Racing"" (predecessor to ""Sailing World""), he designed the Laser in 1969. Kirby started as a reporter in Montreal before editing ""Yacht Racing"" and, in his spare time, taking up yacht design and drawing the Laser.In 1970 Kirby became editor of ""Yacht Racing"", where he stayed until 1975."
"Kirby's career began with the International 14 class, a developmental skiff with relatively few rules. Kirby designed several International 14s, winning the world championships in 1958 and 1961. Kirby also represented Canada at the Olympic regattas in 1956 and 1964, sailing Finns, and in a Star in 1968."
"Since the 1970s Kirby has designed two America's Cup 12-Meters, ""Canada One"" and ""Canada II"", the Apollo, Sonar, San Juan 24, Kirby 23, Kirby 25, and Kirby 30, Ideal 18, and the Pixel, a doublehanded trainer that has replaced the Blue Jay on Long Island Sound. Designed to the IOR rating, it was the basis for many of Kirby's later offshore designs. Kirby also served as both designer and skipper on ""Runaway"", one of three yachts in Canada's 1981 Admiral's Cup campaign."
"Kirby also designed Norwalk Islands Sharpies, a line of high powered, shallow draft sailboats from 18 ft. to 41 ft. The designs use modern plywood, fiberglass and epoxy construction. The Sonar is the largest of three classes used in Paralympic sailing. Kirby was also part of the international committee elected to create the IACC boats (International America's Cup Class) used in the America's Cup between 1992 in San Diego and 2007 in Valencia, Spain."
"On December 6, 2017 Kirby was invested into the Order of Canada for his contributions to the sport of sailing. In addition to representing Canada three times at the Olympics, Kirby's biggest contribution to the sport of sailing is the design of the popular Laser dinghy. The award was presented personally to Kirby by Julie Payette, Governor General of Canada, in September 2018 at a ceremony at Rideau Hall. He was in the first induction of the Lisgar Collegiate Institute Athletic Wall of Fame, as part of the 160th Anniversary celebrations. He is a member of the Noroton Yacht Club. Kirby was inducted into the National Sailing Hall of Fame in 2012."

"Dalecarlia Reservoir is the primary storage basin for drinking water in Washington, D.C., fed by an underground aqueduct in turn fed by low dams which divert portions of the Potomac River near Great Falls and Little Falls."
"The reservoir is located between Spring Valley and the Palisades, two neighborhoods in Northwest Washington, and Brookmont, a neighborhood in Montgomery County, Maryland."
"The reservoir was completed in 1858 by the United States Army Corps of Engineers as part of the Washington Aqueduct project. It began providing water on January 3, 1859. Initially the reservoir provided water to the city from the adjacent Little Falls Branch until the aqueduct construction was completed. Regular water service from the Potomac River source through the aqueduct commenced in 1864. The reservoir was modified in 1895 and 1935 to improve water quality and increase water supply."
"In 1942, the headquarters of the Army Map Service was established on the grounds adjacent to the reservoir; several buildings constructed in the 1940s still exist. In 1946, its headquarters moved to the nearby Sumner Site, which is today the Intelligence Community Campus-Bethesda."
"The Capital Crescent Trail runs adjacent to the reservoir and through the center of the pumping campus. The boundary between Maryland and the District of Columbia passes through the reservoir. A historic D.C. boundary marker (Northwest No. 5) is located in a woodland east of the reservoir. Another (Northwest No. 4) is located a short distance east of the Capital Crescent Trail, near the Dalecarlia water purification facility."

"Placed in Navy service on 11 December 1933, she was renamed USS ""Skaneateles"" on 1 June 1934 before being renamed USS ""Milan"" on 20 October 1937. The ""Milan"" was rechristened by Mrs. Charles Edison, wife of the Assistant Secretary of the Navy and daughter-in-law of Thomas Edison. The name is in reference the village in Ohio, Edison's birthplace."
"After her rechristening as USS ""Milan"", (YP‑6), a former district patrol vessel, was tied up at the Washington Navy Yard for the use of the Assistant Secretary of the Navy. With the outbreak of World War II, she was returned to patrol duties. In the middle of the war she was loaned, for a brief period, to the dock department, City of New York, after which she returned to the Washington, D.C., area, stationed at Dahlgren, Virginia. Declared to be excess to the needs of the Navy on 5 April 1946, ""Milan"" was turned over to War Shipping Administration for disposal on 7 July 1946 and sold on 27 July 1946."

"Kraków-Rakowice-Czyżyny Airport is a disused airport in Kraków, Poland, one of the oldest permanent airfields in Europe, open for occasional traffic by certain types of aircraft. A portion of it is now the site of the Polish Aviation Museum with a 720-metre long and 60-metre wide segment of the original concrete runway restored for use by the museum for light planes (to 7,500 kg) and helicopters."
"The airfield has its beginnings as a military airport established in the borough of Rakowice in 1912, one of the most modern and largest in Poland at the time. It was built for the needs of the Austro-Hungarian Empire along with an army garrison. In 1917 the airfield became one of the stopovers in the first European air mail service linking Vienna with Kiev and Odessa. The airport was in continuous use to 1963, until the relocation of the Kraków passenger airport 16 km westwards, to the village of Balice. The expansion of nearby Nowa Huta district of Kraków forced its closure."
"In June 2004, a portion of the airport contiguous with the Polish Aviation Museum was reopened as a police helicopter base and for an occasional fixed-wing aircraft traffic on runway 26 for an annual two-day air show held on the last weekend of June. The museum is also likely to use this airfield for flying some of its collection or acquiring new exhibits."

Kallark like all Strontians, has the capacity for great strength and various superpowers, but can only use them when they are completely devoted to a purpose and his abilities increase and decrease in accordance with his level of confidence. He was born on Strontia, which is part of the Shi'ar Empire and he is the leader of their Imperial Guard. He was also a member of the Annihilators, Dark Guardians and Guardians of the Galaxy."
"Gladiator and the Imperial Guard were created by writer Chris Claremont and artist Dave Cockrum as an homage to DC Comics' Legion of Super-Heroes, with all the Imperial Guard's original members created as analogs of Legionnaires. Gladiator was the analog to Superboy; the name ""Gladiator"" was a conscious homage to the Philip Wylie novel ""Gladiator"" (1930) on which Superman was partially based. Gladiator's name, Kallark, is a combination of Superman's Kryptonian and human names: Kal-El and Clark Kent."
"The character first appeared in ""Uncanny X-Men"" #107 (Oct. 1977). Since then, he has been periodically featured in X-titles, ""Fantastic Four"", ""Rom the Spaceknight"", ""Silver Surfer"", ""Nova"", and ""New Warriors"". His origin was revealed in ""War of Kings: Warriors"" #1 (2009)."
"Soyarabai was a saint from the Mahar caste in 14th century Maharashtra, India. She was a disciple of her husband, Chokhamela."
"Soyarabai framed large literature using blank verse of her own devising. She wrote much but only about 62 works are known. In her Abhang she refers to herself as Chokhamela's Mahari, accuses god for forgetting Dalits and of making life bad. Her most basic verses concern the simple food she gives the god. Her poems describe her devotion towards god and voice her objections to untouchability."
"Soyarabai believed that ""The body only can be impure or polluted, but the soul is ever clean, pure knowledge. The body is born unclean and so how can anybody claim to be pure in body? The body has much pollution. But the pollution of the body remains in the body. The soul is untouched by it."""
Soyarabai undertook an annual pilgrimage to Pandharpur with her husband. They were harassed by orthodox Brahmins but never lost their faith and peace of mind.
= = = Atmospheric optics ray-tracing codes = = =
Atmospheric optics ray tracing codes - this article list codes for light scattering using ray-tracing technique to study atmospheric optics phenomena such as rainbows and halos. Such particles can be large raindrops or hexagonal ice crystals. Such codes are one of many approaches to calculations of light scattering by particles.
"Ray tracing techniques can be applied to study light scattering by spherical and non-spherical particles under the condition that the size of a particle is much larger than the wavelength of light. The light can be considered as collection of separate rays with width of rays much larger than the wavelength but smaller than a particle. Rays hitting the particle undergoes reflection, refraction and diffraction. These rays exit in various directions with different amplitudes and phases. Such ray tracing techniques are used to describe optical phenomena such as rainbow of halo on hexagonal ice crystals for large particles."
Review of several mathematical techniques is provided in series of publications.
The 46° halo was first explained as being caused by refractions through ice crystals in 1679 by the French physicist Edmé Mariotte (1620–1684) in terms of light refraction
Jacobowitz in 1971 was the first to apply the ray-tracing technique to hexagonal ice crystal. Wendling et al. (1979) extended Jacobowitz's work from hexagonal ice particle with infinite length to finite length and combined Monte Carlo technique to the ray-tracing simulations.
"The compilation contains information about the electromagnetic scattering by hexagonal ice crystals, large raindrops, and relevant links and applications."

"In June 2013, during an interview with ""XXL"", Freddie Gibbs previewed the album. He spoke about “Eastside Moonwalker”, saying: ""That’s one of the dopest tracks. Shout out to GMF. He produced that. It’s showing people that I’m the staple of the game when it comes to Gary [Indiana]. Michael Jackson is dead, so I gotta pick up the torch and run with it for my city. Actually, I am the only person grabbing it. I am just doing what I got to do. I’m the eastside moonwalker. I stay high, baby.” He also spoke about “Freddie Soprano”, saying: ""That’s the definitive verse from the album. Basically, telling y’all what it is. How I feel about what’s what."" He spoke about “F.A.M.E.” which features Daz Dillinger and Spice 1, saying: ""[The acronym stands for] ‘Fuck All My Enemies.’ You know who I am talking about. If you an enemy—fuck you. I grew up listening to Daz and Spice-1. If it wasn’t for guys like that, I wouldn’t be rapping. Any project I do, I try to pay homage to guys that I respect. Last project I fucked with Jadakiss. He's one of the guys that when I came up, I came up listening to. He's still an athlete in this game. He's still one of the best in it. He don’t get his credit. I always try to pay homage to the guys that were instrumental in my career with me coming up. That's why I linked up with Daz and Spice-1. [This is a diss] track to anybody who want it. If the shoe fits, wear it. I’m talking shit about all of you niggas. If the shoe fits, wear it. If you pick up the shoe and you put it on. You want to take to Twitter and you want to get on your track and say something about Freddie Gibbs, make sure you got your hardhat on."" He spoke about “Lay It Down” which is produced by Willie B, saying: ""Shout out to Willie B. He fuck with Jay Rock and them. He produced that shit. That’s one of them hard-hitting joints. It’s going straight to the point. Lay it down. That’s a robbing song."" He also spoke about “Have U Seen Her” which features Hit Skrewface, saying: ""This is featuring my boy Screwface. SMKA, they produced that. That’s one of them bangers. It’s hard.”"
"""ESGN"" received generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 73, which indicates ""generally favorable reviews"", based on 5 reviews. Anthony Asencio of HipHopDX gave the album three and a half stars out of five, saying ""Ultimately, ""ESGN"" may not be a cultural event. It doesn’t introduce a new sound, nor does it feature many moments we haven’t heard before. Yet what makes this album important are all the reasons Hip Hop needs Freddie Gibbs. On any one album, he can give you pieces of Tupac, UGK, Three 6 Mafia, and blend them into a harmony that would make Bone Thugs-n-Harmony proud. And on that point, ESGN is a massive success."" Chris Mench of ""XXL"" gave the album an L, saying ""None of this criticism is to say that ""ESGN"" is a bad album. Freddie is a talented rapper with great flow and a wise selection of collaborators, and many songs are individually effective. Rather, it is simply an album that lacks a clear perspective on the many heavy topics it tackles. A first time listener may walk away feeling very familiar with Freddie Gibbs’ sound, but still unsure of who exactly he is."" David Amidon of PopMatters gave the album a seven out of ten, saying ""For those hip-hop fans forever in pursuit of the latest glass-shattering bass and semi-auto mob rules, ""ESGN"" is likely 2013’s flagship release. This is Gibbs’ deep breath; let's see what direction he takes off running in next."""
"Chris Bosman of Consequence of Sound gave the album four out of five stars, saying ""Gibbs’ EPs and mixtapes tend to run long, and ""ESGN"" – at 19 tracks — is no exception. The length is a weakness. The bleakness of Gibbs’ world, even when it's going well, can leave you gasping. The shock is somewhat lost in the number of tracks. In the scheme of the album, it's a minor quibble. ""ESGN"" digs new paths through rap's hallowed grounds. It may not be the crossover success that those who ride for Gibbs would love to see, but it doesn’t diminish this excellent record."" Jonah Bromwich of Pitchfork Media gave the album a 6.9 out of 10, saying ""On “Hundred Thousand"", Gibbs supplies a perfect—and, true to form, concise—review of ""ESGN"" himself. “Ain’t trying to be the man, just trying to maintain.” Callin an album ""more of the same"" sounds dismissive but its something that fans are often happy to receive and there are those for whom 20 tracks of Gibbs rapping nearly perfectly will be enough. But for everyone else, ""ESGN"" comes as an unwelcome reversion to the mean. It's the sound of a rapper more than happy to maintain his narrow lane after being burned by the industry, one who's lost the ambition to leave his comfort zone, at least for the time being."""

= = = Vicia villosa = = =
"Vicia villosa, known as the hairy vetch, fodder vetch or winter vetch, is a plant native to some of Europe and western Asia. It is a legume, grown as a forage crop, fodder crop, cover crop, and green manure. Although non-native, it occurs in all US states and is considered invasive by some states, such as Alaska, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, Minnesota, Oregon, and Washington state — as well as in Japan and some parts of Europe where it is not native. It is also found in most Canadian provinces."
"Hairy vetch is very similar to tufted vetch (""Vicia cracca""), the most noticeable difference being that tufted vetch has a smooth stem."
Several subspecies are recognized:
"The species ""Vicia hirsuta"" is also called hairy vetch."
"Hairy vetch is widely used by organic growers in the United States as a winter cover crop and in no-till farming, as it is both winter hardy and can fix as much as 200 lb/acre of atmospheric nitrogen. Disadvantages of hairy vetch in production agriculture are related to the crop having a portion of hard seed and its tendency to shatter seed early in the season, leading to it remaining in the field as a weed later in the season. This can be a particular problem in wheat production."
"Organic gardeners often plant hairy vetch (a nitrogen-fixing legume) as a companion plant to tomatoes, as an alternative to rotating crops in small growing areas. When it is time to plant tomatoes in the spring, the hairy vetch is cut to the ground and the tomato seedlings are planted in holes dug through the matted residue and stubble. The vetch vegetation provides both nitrogen and an instant mulch that preserves moisture and keeps weeds from sprouting."
"It is regulated in the state of Florida. Some sources consider it generally invasive in areas with suitable climate for it to out-compete native species, in a manner similar to how cow vetch, ""Vicia cracca"", is regarded. With both vetches, their agricultural usefulness is typically given precedence over concerns regarding potential ecological degradation. Despite being native to part of Europe it is considered an alien or invasive species in some European countries, such as Belgium, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, and Spain."

Donahue was born in Springfield, Ohio. He batted and threw left-handed."
"Donahue had his greatest success from 1904 to 1908, after switching to first base for the Chicago White Sox. Donahue's defensive skills were a key to the White Sox' 1906 World Series championship team, and he led American League first basemen in fielding percentage, assists, and putouts for 3 consecutive seasons, from 1905 to 1907. In 1907, Donahue had 1,846 putouts, which is still the major league record for putouts by a first baseman. He also holds the major league single season record for most chances accepted per game with 12.65 in 1907."
"Though known mostly for his fielding, Donahue was also a decent hitter from 1905 to 1907. In 1905, he was among the American League leaders in batting average (.287), on-base percentage (.346), RBIs (76), and stolen bases (32). In 1906, Donahue was among the league leaders in stolen bases (36) and sacrifice hits (36) and was one of only three White Sox starters to bat over .250 for the 1906 World Champion ""Hitless Wonders."" Donahue hit for a .278 average (5-for-18) with 2 doubles, 1 triple and 4 RBI."
"On October 10, 1906, Donahue broke up a World Series no-hit bid by Cubs' pitcher Ed Reulbach with a single in the 7th inning."
"In 1907, Donahue led the league in games played (157) and at bats (609) and was among the leaders in hits (158) and RBIs (68)."
"In Detroit on May 31, 1908, Donahue recorded 21 putouts in a nine-inning game."
"In 9 seasons, Donahue played in 813 games with 731 hits, 319 runs scored, 327 RBIs, 143 stolen bases, 90 doubles, 31 triples, and a .255 batting average."
"Donahue contracted syphilis and died in 1913 at age 34. He was survived by a brother, Pat Donahue, a major league catcher in the years 1908-10."
= = = Hanstead House = = =
"Hanstead House or Hanstead Park is a country house estate in Hertfordshire, England. Hanstead is near Bricket Wood, about three miles from Radlett and five miles from St Albans, within the green belt around London. It forms part of the civil parish of St Stephen, Hertfordshire within St Albans District Council. The park has been a stud, a college, and a corporate training centre, and is now owned by a property development firm. The current building, though in the Georgian style, dates from 1925. The property was mentioned in the Domesday Book."
"The house was built for the Yule family. Sir David Yule (1858–1928) was a Scottish entrepreneur who went into the family business, which was trade with India, then the ""jewel in the crown"" of the British Empire. He was involved with many additional businesses. The ""Oxford Dictionary of National Biography"" judged him ""arguably the most important businessman in India"" and quoted his obituary in ""The Times"" as ""one of the wealthiest men, if not the wealthiest man, in the country""."
"A later owner of the property wrote: ""In 1925 Sir David decided to build for himself a mansion on this 1200 acre [4.9 km²] estate, located only five miles [8 km] from the northwest edge of London. Prior to this he had built a 'modest' two-story house of some 14 rooms to live in during construction of the mansion. It was later to become the guest house."""
"Yule had married his cousin Annie Henrietta, oldest daughter of his uncle Andrew Yule of Calcutta. They had one child, Gladys. He died only three years after the construction of the house, and ""lies buried in an admirably designed carved stone tomb, covered overhead by a stone and wood canopy, enclosed by an ornate iron fence inside a small wooded park, the whole being encircled by another iron fence."" The Mausolea and Monuments Trust says that the sculpture itself is a draped chair with inscription from Kipling's ""Jungle Book"" and a box tomb showing his Indian jute mills and plantations."
"The two women lived the rest of their lives at Hanstead. The new main house became the home of the daughter, while her mother lived in the guest house (see dower house). They were world travellers who reportedly shared an interest in big game hunting and a love of animals. Hanstead House was said to have been adorned by a large stuffed bear which they had killed in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado. On the grounds they kept a seal, penguins, and wallabies."
"In 1925 they expanded their interests to the breeding of Arabian horses. The two women used their considerable fortune to build stables, purchase breeding stock, and establish a stud. Despite its relatively late start, Hanstead was soon considered ""second only in importance to"" Crabbet Arabian Stud, whose founders, husband and wife team Wilfrid Scawen Blunt and Lady Anne Blunt, had introduced the breed to England in 1878, and from whom the Yules bought and leased horses. A third stud, Courthouse, was also held up to be of the same level, and the three competed against each other at the annual show at the Roehampton Club"
"Gladys Yule died within a year of Judith Blunt-Lytton (Lady Wentworth), who had inherited Crabbet from her parents and run it for 40 years. The deaths of these two only children, at a time of high inheritance tax, meant that in 1957 a substantial number of British-bred Arabian horses left the country, improving the breed's bloodlines elsewhere. The Hanstead horses were appreciated in the United States and in South Africa."
"Following the death of Gladys Yule in 1957, Hanstead Park was put on the market, where it remained uncared for over a considerable period of time. Many country houses were being demolished at this time."
"In 1959 it was brought to the attention of the American evangelist Herbert W. Armstrong, who had arrived in England looking for a larger office for the British branch of his Radio Church of God. He bought the house and land as the site for his second Ambassador College campus. By the time of the purchase the guest house had already been sold separately to another buyer, who used the property as a private home like an island within the campus. Armstrong wrote in Chapter 72 of his autobiography that Trans World Airlines (TWA) had been considering Hanstead House as a school for stewardesses. ""Yet this mansion, with these outstanding gardens, the aviary, greenhouses, cedars of Lebanon, all finally came to us for £8,000 ($22,800) - the not uncommon price of a five- or six-room cottage on a forty- or fifty-foot lot in America, - and that on terms that gave us several years to pay."""
"In 1959 Hanstead House was renamed Memorial Hall in memory of Richard David Armstrong, Herbert's deceased son. The college at Bricket Wood began its first freshman year in 1960. (The first Ambassador College opened in 1947 at Pasadena, California; in 1964 a third college opened in Big Sandy, Texas which for a brief time became Ambassador University. All three colleges have since closed down.) From the radio studio of Ambassador College, daily broadcasts of ""The World Tomorrow"" were heard around the world on hundreds of stations. There was also a sizeable printing establishment on the site. Improvements were made to the grounds: tennis courts, track, gymnasium, and an Olympic standard (imperial measurements) indoor swimming pool."
"When Ambassador College closed its doors in 1974, the sports facilities were sold separately from the main buildings and eventually became part of a sports centre. The pool, one of the most modern in the area, became home to Verulam amateur swimming club in 1979."
"The college became a corporate training centre, first for the Central Electricity Generating Board and then, from 1993, to the banking group HSBC. In 2004 a volunteer-led community woodland was established on land given by the bank; Hanstead Wood has won a Green Flag Award."

He is also the Chairman of Perennial Real Estate Holdings Ltd. He has an estimated net worth of $2.4 billion as of March 2019."
"Kuok earned a Bachelor of Business Administration degree from the National University of Singapore, and began his career in 1973 trading soft commodities at Kuok Oils and Grains. He eventually became Managing Director of the business, and developed the Pasir Gudang Edible Oils refining complex in Johor, followed by China's first edible oil refinery, South Seas Oils and Fats."
"In 1991, he left the Kuok Group to start Wilmar, with Martua Sitorus soon after coming on board as a co-founder. Starting as a small commodities trading company with S$2m in seed capital from the mortgage of his family home, and further seed funding obtained from Kuok Hock Swee and Sons, his father's investment company. Wilmar grew rapidly from the outset, with initial growth in the Indonesian edible oil market, followed up with development of Sumatran oil palm plantations and Indonesian edible oil refineries. A large expansion into edible oil refining in mainland China, and a joint venture with the Adani Group in India subsequently placed it in leading positions within Asia's largest consumer edible oil markets. In 1994, a meeting with the legendary then-chairman of ADM, Dwayne Andreas, resulted in a US$30m investment into the company after the first meeting, and ADM coming on board as a long term strategic partner."
"In 2006, Wilmar International launched an Initial Public Offering on the Singapore Stock Exchange with a capitalisation of S$2.38Bn. In 2007, after a 16-year estrangement, he agreed with his uncle Robert Kuok to merge the Kuok Group's edible oil, trading and oil palm plantation assets into Wilmar in return for a 31% stake in the company. The merger resulted in the unification of Kuok's previous early career contributions to the Kuok Group with the rapidly growth of Wilmar International led by him and Martua Sitorus since 1991."
"Kuok's family investment vehicle HPRY Holdings acquired the Aviva Tower in the City of London in 2011 in a joint purchase with Martua Sitorus valued at £290m. The property subsequently received planning approval by the City of London for redevelopment into the Eric Parry designed 'Trellis', slated to be at 1000 ft the tallest building in the City and the second tallest building in Western Europe."
"Besides holding stakes in music, media and biotechnology businesses, HPRY is a substantial shareholder in Perennial Real Estate Holdings, which is a developer of commercial mixed use integrated developments and healthcare projects in China. It owns several iconic properties in Singapore including CHIJMES, the Capitol and AXA Tower. HPRY was a seed/angel round investor in SEA Ltd, a SouthEast Asian gaming and internet unicorn listed on the NYSE, whose co-founder Ye Gang was a Wilmar employee at the time the business was created."
"Kuok was born in the seaside village of Mersing in Johor, Malaysia, the second of four children of Kuok Hock Swee and Tan Sek Meng. His father was a cousin of Malaysian billionaire Robert Kuok. He was educated at Sri Mersing Primary, St Joseph's School and the English College, Johor Bahru."
"His father, Kuok Hock Swee, had arrived in then British Malaya from Foochow in Southern China at the age of 18, eventually setting up a provision store in Mersing that he expanded into a thriving business distributing foodstuffs along the east coast of Peninsula Malaysia. This was subsequently merged with the Kuok Group in exchange for an equity stake in Robert Kuok's rapidly expanding business which by then included the first ShangriLa Hotel in Singapore."
"The Kuok family traces its ancestry to the 8th century Tang Dynasty general Guo Ziyi, whose descendants included several famous generals under Genghis Khan and the Mongol Empire. Guo Ziyi was notably mentioned by the Nestorian Christians (known as the Church of the East) as perhaps the earliest high ranking patron of the Christian Church in Tang Dynasty China."

"At the time the song was written, Robert Smith was very interested in the work of Australian author Patrick White. According to a number of his fans, Smith was inspired to write ""The Love Cats"" after reading White's novel ""The Vivisector"" (1970), although this claim is difficult to verify. In the novel, the protagonist, Hurtle, is appalled when his lover's husband drowns a sack of stray cats. White draws a parallel between the way in which the cats are discarded, and the treatment of certain characters in the book; by extension, the cats symbolize the most innocent and vulnerable members of society, and the casual cruelty with which they sometimes meet their fate."

There are many shots of a mansion which the band told a buyer they were interested in buying it. They returned the keys in the morning.

"Israel Bush Richardson (December 26, 1815 – November 3, 1862) was a United States Army officer during the Mexican–American War and American Civil War, where he was a major general in the Union Army. Nicknamed ""Fighting Dick"" for his prowess on the battlefield, he was mortally wounded at the Battle of Antietam near Sharpsburg, Maryland."
"Richardson was born in Fairfax, Vermont. He was reportedly a descendant of famed American Revolutionary War general Israel Putnam. He was appointed from Vermont to the United States Military Academy in West Point, New York. He graduated 38th out of 52 cadets in the Class of 1841. He was one of 23 classmates who would become generals during the Civil War. After some routine assignments, Richardson served as a second lieutenant in the Second Seminole War in Florida. He was promoted to first lieutenant on Sep 21, 1846."
"He received two brevets for meritorious service during the Mexican–American War, to captain and major for the actions at Contreras, Churubusco, and Chapultepec. In Mexico while serving under General Winfield Scott in the Army of Occupation, he received his nickname, ""Fighting Dick"", which would carry over to the Civil War."
"He later served as a captain in the 3rd U.S. Infantry (a rank he achieved in 1851) at various frontier outposts in Texas and New Mexico Territory, San Antonio, Texas 1848–49, Post Opposite El Paso del Norte, 1849–1850; Fort Fillmore 1851–52, 1852–53; Fort Webster, 1852, 1853–54; and Fort Thorn, 1854–55. He then resigned his commission in 1855 and began farming near Pontiac, Michigan."
"When the Civil War broke out, Richardson was still farming in Michigan. He enlisted in the Union Army and recruited and organized the 2nd Michigan Infantry. He married Fannie Travor on May 18, 1861, in Wayne County, Michigan. When he reported with his regiment in Washington, DC, General Winfield Scott greeted him with ""I'm glad to have my 'Fighting Dick' with me again"". Richardson, promoted to colonel on May 25, 1861, was assigned command of the 4th Brigade, 1st Division, in the newly organized army of Brigadier General Irvin McDowell. His brigade saw limited action at the First Battle of Bull Run near Blackburn's Ford, and in covering the subsequent federal withdrawal to Washington. He was promoted to brigadier general, ranking from May 17, 1861."
"He commanded several brigades in the Army of the Potomac and then the 1st Division of the II Corps during the Peninsula Campaign in mid-1862. He was involved in the fighting at the battles of Yorktown, Seven Pines, and the Seven Days. He was particularly distinguished in sharp fighting near the Chickahominy River. Richardson was promoted to major general after the Seven Days Battles. His division was stationed in Washington, DC, during the Second Battle of Bull Run and did not participate in that engagement."
"Richardson's 1st Division played a key role during the Battle of Antietam on September 17, 1862, attacking Confederate positions in the center of the Sunken Road in support of the 3rd Division of Maj. Gen. William H. French. After stubborn fighting, by 1:00 pm, Richardson had gained control of the high ground in front of the apex of the defensive line, and his men enfiladed the remaining defenders in the road, which would gain the nickname ""Bloody Lane"" for the carnage. Richardson pushed forward beyond the road and was directing the fire of his artillery and organizing another attack when he was struck by a shell fragment."
"Carried to the rear, Richardson was treated at a field hospital. His wound was not considered life-threatening, and he was given a room in Major General George B. McClellan's headquarters, the Pry House. President Abraham Lincoln paid his respects to the wounded Richardson during a visit to the battlefield in October. However, infection set in, and then pneumonia, which claimed the life of the popular general in early November. He was among six generals to be killed or mortally wounded at Antietam."
"His body was escorted to Detroit. Large crowds lined the streets during his funeral procession to nearby Pontiac, where he was buried in Oak Hill Cemetery."
"Fort Richardson, a Texas frontier fort active from 1867 to 1878, was named for him."
"The Israel B. Richardson Camp #2 of the Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War in Oakland, Michigan, was also named for the fallen general."
"Battery Richardson, a 12-inch coast artillery gun battery at Fort Hancock, New Jersey, was named for him."
= = = Jere Wood = = =
"Jere Wood (born c. 1949) is the former mayor of Roswell, Georgia, serving five consecutive terms. Mayor Wood defeated Democrat ""Pug"" Mabry, who served as mayor for over thirty years, in the election of 1997. During his election he ran on the platform of slow-growth, fighting urban sprawl and what he viewed as its negative side effects. At the time, he promised to only be a two-term mayor. He ran unchallenged and secured re-election in 2001. Wood is the son of Roy ""Splinter"" Wood, a Democrat, who was Undersecretary of the United States Department of the Interior (DOI) during the Carter Administration in the 1970s. Wood won the mayor's race again in the election held in November 2005."
"Mayor Wood is a member of the Mayors Against Illegal Guns Coalition, an organization formed in 2006 and co-chaired by New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg and Boston mayor Thomas Menino."
"During the attempted merger of Comcast and Time Warner Cable, a number of politicians sent letters to the FCC expressing their support. Wood was one of these, stating the merger would help spur business growth. It was later discovered that Wood had actually submitted a letter that had been ghostwritten by Comcast. Wood was just one of a number of politicians exposed by ""The Verge"" to have participated in such a practice."
"In 2016, Roswell resident Michael Litton filed a lawsuit accusing Wood of violating the city of Roswell's charter by seeking a third term as mayor. Wood, who was first elected in 1997, advocated in 2010 for the Roswell mayor to have a term limit of three four-year terms. He has said the intent was that the clock would start for him when the law was passed, and not when he was first elected."
"Although Wood had enjoyed the support of State Representative Betty Price, she has since stated that she does not intend to amend the charter to allow Wood to run for a subsequent term. She had been willing to support a charter change that would allow the mayor to serve out his term, but no more. ""My goal has been to save the city the expense of a costly trial,"" Price said. Since the start of the controversy, the city of Roswell has spent $16,843 through city attorney fees on defending Wood, as of mid-2016. On August 3, 2017, Wood was removed from office after a judge finding he did violate city law."
"In October 2016, Wood filed suit in Fulton Superior Court against Roswell and the Roswell Council Members over whether he could renovate his home. Wood's home is located in the Roswell historic district, which requites prior approval when renovating. He was initially granted approval by the Roswell Historic Preservation Commission to build a 1.5 story, 3,000 square foot house on his property. However, the city council later overturned the decision in August 2016. Wood alleged in the lawsuit that council members acted improperly by deciding the council had the legal authority to reverse the commission's earlier decision. State historic preservation laws allow ""limited authority"" for the council members to ""approve, modify and approve, or reject"" the historic commission’s final decision, but only if it is found that the commission abused its discretion."
"Wood often mountain bikes, wind surfs or kayaks. He earned his Eagle Scout Award during his youth and has been active in the Boy Scout program in the North Fulton area."
